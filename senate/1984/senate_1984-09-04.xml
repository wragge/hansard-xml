<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I remind the Minister representing the Special Minister of State that on 23 August he gave the most generalised answer when asked by Senator Hamer whether Mr Justice Stewart, head of the National Crime Authority, had sought or been offered briefings by Commissioner Costigan or his staff as part of the handover process from the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union to the Authority. I ask again: Has Mr Justice Stewart had a briefing? If not, why not? Was it because of absence overseas on other duties or was there some other reason why the head of the Authority turned down the opportunity to become personally acquainted with the complex operations of the Commission, much of which will shortly be transferred to the new organisation?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Aviation. It concerns tenders which have been called for airport fire vehicles for Australian airports. Will the Minister advise whether tenders are still being considered or whether they have been cancelled? If they have been cancelled, will new tenders be called? Will the Minister give an assurance that the tenders will not be let outside Australia, as was the case with the Ford Transit vans for Australia Post? Will he outline the policy initiatives of the Australian industry participation program regarding the participation by Australian manufacturing industry in the supply of goods to the Commonwealth?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator GIETZELT</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government has on several occasions made pronouncements and statements, issued by both the Minister for Administrative Services and the Minister for Industry and Commerce, detailing Government policies in respect of the purchase of goods for the Australian Government. We are on the public record as saying that in the supply of goods to Government departments preference will be given to Australian goods. On the specific matter raised by Senator Foreman, tenders for the fire vehicles closed on 4 April 1984. Six tenders were received for the supply of a total of 12 vehicle types. Contrary to what has been expressed, the tenders have not been cancelled. The six tenders received were submitted by Australian firms, although all involved significant overseas content such as chassis, pumps, et cetera. One tender involved body building and assembly in New Zealand but under the closer economic relations agreement with that country it will be considered as Australian content. The remaining five tenders involved assembly in Australia, with the Australian content averaging between 40 and 70 per cent. In the Australian industry participation program which was announced by the Minister for Industry and Commerce we seek to increase the level of participation by Australian manufacturing industry in the supply of goods to Australian Government departments, including the departments of Aviation and Administrative Services. So I think I can assure Senator Foreman that the interests of Australian manufacturing are being well protected by the Government's policies.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My attention was drawn to the case of Mr and Mrs Clucas, who apparently withdrew $12,000 from the bank and kept it in their house because they feared that it would affect them under the assets test. I hope that those few members of the Press and some members of the Opposition who have been misrepresenting and exaggerating the effects of the assets test will be aware that this sort of thing can happen if such exaggerations and misrepresentations are known. The terrible irony of this case is, of course, that Mr and Mrs Clucas have assets far below the threshold at which their pension entitlement would be affected and they need not have had any anxiety. Their fears were completely groundless but they were fed by articles in one Melbourne newspaper in particular.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If Senator Missen has been enjoying himself misrepresenting the assets test in that way, he can also take some blame. The assets test thresholds have been widely publicised. A special information hot line service has been set up. A number of people, particularly vested interests and one organisation in Victoria, have made irresponsible claims. For instance, there have been claims that there would be armies of inspectors from the Department of Social Security and the Australian Taxation Office entering people's homes. That will not be so. Members of the Opposition, as well as those of the Government, know that that will not be so.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There was an outrageous claim by the honourable member for Denison, who is notorious for that sort of thing, that we would assess the gold in people's teeth. We have seen articles in the Press claiming that people will be forced off their land, that there will be SS squads, et cetera, trained ready for assets test raids. Such claims appeared day after day and week after week in the Melbourne Herald. I think one of the reasons the Melbourne Herald yesterday wrote a very responsible, sensible and clear article on this issue was to balance the previous articles which had been written in that newspaper.</PARA>
<PARA> As I have said before in this place, there will be no invasion of privacy and no inspectors going into people's homes to evaluate their personal effects. The test is based largely on self-assessment. Over 70 per cent of pensioners will not even have to fill out an assets test form. Only about 40,000-odd pensioners will be affected at all by the test. People need not be concerned by these highly emotional statements and articles. It is a tragedy that people put out misinformation to mislead people in this way.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I address my question to the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs. I refer to the submission of the Australian Teachers Federation to the Minister for Finance dated 31 August this year concerning allocations to non- government schools. First, were the per capita amounts and the total expenditure estimates for non-government schools for 1985-88 checked by the Department of Finance? Secondly, has the aggregate cost of Commonwealth recurrent grants for non-government schools for the next seven years been underestimated because the Government failed to take into account the cost of non-government school enrolments above the 1983 level of enrolments; so that, consequently, the expected increase in 1985 expenditure on non-government schools will be $51.2m rather than $10.6m as previously indicated by the Minister?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator RYAN</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have seen the submission sent to Mr Dawkins because a copy was sent to me. I am, therefore, in a position to answer Senator Macklin's question. I must lay to rest the idea that the cost estimates in the guidelines were not thoroughly checked by the Department of Finance. The fact is that, as with all Budget figures, the estimates for this program were fully checked by the Department of Finance in the normal way. The Government was aware, when making its decisions, of the cost implications if the projected growth in non- government enrolments were to eventuate. The Government decided to include in the 1984-85 Budget a provision for such an increase. For years beyond that, however, it is felt that the projections are too uncertain for cost estimates to be based on them, particularly in view of the advice of the Commonwealth Schools Commission that enrolment growth in non-government schools is slowing down.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The evidence is available from the Schools Commission, and I am happy to put it on the record. The enrolment growth in non-government schools is slowing down. I am pleased to say that, for the first time in many years, enrolments in government schools are increasing. Just as the figures set out in the guidelines underestimate the amount that will actually be expended in the government sector because of the enrolment growth, so too the figures on earlier projected enrolment growth have been revised and, judging by the 1983 data that is currently being analysed by the Schools Commission, will be lower.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In response to the grossly unwarranted reflection on the levels of assistance to government schools, I must say that the fact is that the per capita grants will increase during the next eight years by 37 per cent at the primary level and 100 per cent at the secondary level. Those increases will be made in real terms and will not be affected by any variation in the cost of grants for non- government schools. If government schools continue to increase their retention rates for students in upper levels of secondary schools their grants will rise accordingly.</PARA>
<PARA> I point out that early indications are that the Government's participation and equity program is having an effect. Senator Macklin previously expressed some scepticism about this. Enrolments in upper secondary levels in government schools are increasing, particularly in disadvantaged areas. Consequently, since government schools are now on a per capita basis of funding in terms of Commonwealth recurrent grants, increases in upper secondary, as is the case with increases in any level of government schooling, will involve higher grants and, of course, will be at those higher rates which I have just given.</PARA>

Has the Minister's attention been drawn to recent comments made by the Secretary to the Treasury criticising what Mr Stone called 'grasshoppers'; that is, public works for which the earning capacity does not cover the capital invested? Does the Minister share that particular concern of the Secretary to the Treasury? Can the Minister point to any particular projects that would fall into that category?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator WALSH</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Cook asked whether I can point to any particular projects that fall into the category of 'grasshoppers', which I believe was originally defined by Mr Shann; that is, public works the revenue from which is inadequate to service the cost of the capital invested in them. I was astounded to hear the present Leader of the Opposition uncritically endorse Mr Stone's speech when, in fact, the present Leader of the Opposition is busily promoting one of the most voracious grasshoppers ever suggested in Australia. I refer to the fact that the present Leader of the Opposition has committed a Liberal government, if there ever is another one, to building the Northern Territory railway. I cannot think of a better example of a grasshopper, as defined by Mr Shann and Mr Stone, than the proposed Alice Springs-Darwin railroad. That project entails an investment of $600m on present values, the revenue from which would not cover the operating costs and, of course, therefore would provide not only no return on the capital investment but a negative return on the capital investment. I would like Mr Peacock to explain that contradiction along with all the other contradictions he has been embracing recently. He is simultaneously embracing Mr Stone's views, derived ultimately from the views of Professor Shann, and advocating the construction of a voracious grasshopper of the magnitude of the proposed Alice Springs-Darwin railway.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> A couple of other examples of grasshoppers were mentioned specifically by Mr Stone. One was the Ord River irrigation scheme in Western Australia, in which in present value dollars some $150m of public capital has been sunk, and the other was the Dampier-Perth pipeline in which some $700m of public capital has been sunk. Ironically, both of those projects are attributable to the former Liberal Premier of Western Australia, Sir Charles Court, who, although not the Premier at the time, provided the political push to stampede an irresponsible Liberal- Country Party coalition Government in the late 1960s into providing Commonwealth funds for the Ord River Dam. Sir Charles Court was also responsible for the political push which ultimately resulted in the Western Australian Government signing the disastrous take or pay contract for the domestic phase of the North West Shelf gas and the associated Dampier to Wagerup pipeline. As a result of that decision by Sir Charles Court the Western Australian Government is faced with the prospect, unless it can introduce some way of mitigating the damage which it inherited, of deficits which will accumulate to the order of $700m or $ 1,000m by the early 1990s.</PARA>
<PARA> One might also add, although Mr Stone neglected to mention it, that Sir Charles Court was also directly responsible for the white elephant at Broome which is called a grain loading facility in which another $3m of public capital has been sunk not only for no return but also for absolutely no use. That facility was supposed to handle the sorghum which was to be grown on the Kamballan irrigation scheme which, of course, was going down the gurgler financially at the very time Sir Charles Court committed $3m of the State funds to it. Finally, I do share those concerns which Mr Stone expressed and I commend a careful and responsible study of those views and the implications of those views to all members of the Opposition.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I did read Mr Dolan's critical comments of what he believed to be frustration of Government policy by some departments and some senior bureaucrats, to use his terminology. I refer Senator Hearn to the previous statement that I made answering Senator Foreman: Government has made a pronouncement about the preference for Australian goods, through both the Minister for Administrative Services, Mr Brown, and Senator Button. It is designed to assist our manufacturing industry to negotiate successfully contracts and arrangements with the Australian Government for the purchase of Australian goods. That policy announcement was designed to ensure that Australian industry would be able to make more efficient use of long-standing Commonwealth purchasing preference for the provision of Australian-made goods. I am further advised that the Government, in making that announcement, has adopted certain guidelines. There is a 20 per cent notional discount, for tender comparison purposes only, for Australian content of offers of over $10,000-worth of goods. Ministers have been given the right of review of purchases of any substantial value by their respective departments. In that respect, my attention has been drawn to a large international company that has a contract arrangement with the Department of Veterans' Affairs, which is contemplating going off-shore in respect of its manufacturing operations and closing down its Australian operation. If that is the case-I propose to have discussions with this company- and if it is within my power to review the contractual arrangements between that organisation and the Department, I shall certainly be acting in accordance with Government policy in insisting that the guidelines that the Government has laid down in respect of the provision of Australian-made goods by the Commonwealth are followed. Otherwise, that particular company will find a very unsympathetic Minister so far as its present contractual arrangements are concerned. I reiterate to Senator Hearn what I said to Senator Foreman: The Government's policy is firm, and we shall be insisting that every government department, in its purchasing arrangements, gives preference to Australian-made goods.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I am aware of some claims by Senator Messner along the lines mentioned by Senator Bolkus. Senator Messner seems to be determined to conduct a misinformation and disinformation campaign in South Australia about this question-of similar magnitude to the sustained disinformation and misinformation campaign which he has been conducting about social security matters for some time. Senator Messner claimed that the allocation for water programs in South Australia this financial year was $8m. In that he ignored, either deliberately or otherwise, the $7m which has been provided in the Budget outside the Federal water resources assistance program to the Adelaide and northern towns water treatment program. That is a particularly important program, a fact well- recognised by this Government in both the previous and present Budgets, a program that is essential to upgrade the low quality of water received by many places in South Australia for far too long. That $7m, incidentally, will not have to be matched by State funds as is required under most of the Federal water resources assistance programs.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might have excused Senator Messner's ignorance on this matter-I am giving him the benefit of the doubt, I suppose, in describing it as ignorance-if he had been required to consult the Budget Papers and read all through them to discover the $7m he overlooked, inadvertently or otherwise. However, I am particularly peeved, and I believe I am entitled to be so, as I personally went to the trouble of signing a letter to Senator Messner which pointed out this fact to him. I do not know whether he cannot read, whether he does not want to read, or whether he deliberately plays fast and loose with the truth. The fact is that there has been a very significant increase in this Budget in allocations to South Australia for water, for the reason I have already given, that is, that the Commonwealth Government is very conscious of the high priority that ought to be given to the Adelaide and northern towns water filtration program. That priority has been matched by the Commonwealth by an appropriate financial allocation.</PARA>

The Government takes the view that financial assistance towards legal costs of witnesses before parliamentary committees is normally a matter for the Parliament. However, in this case it recognised that the terms of reference of the Senate Committee raised the quite fundamental constitutional issue of the relationship between the Federal judiciary and the Parliament. Accordingly, it agreed to provide assistance up to the level that was provided to the main witnesses before the Hope Royal Commission on Australia 's Security and Intelligence Agencies.

Can the Minister clarify these issues for the Senate?</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that questions have been raised, particularly in Western Australia, about the treatment of wineries that make wholesale sales or conceivably do not make wholesale sales and sell the entire production over the cellar door. I can clarify that. There has been confusion about other matters concerning the 10 per cent sales tax on wine; in particular, the confusion within the Opposition and the confusion-indeed, outright contradiction and conflict-between the present Leader of the Opposition and Deputy Leader of the Opposition. Here in the Senate, I think it was two weeks ago or 13 days ago, members of the Opposition sanctimoniously raised a matter of public importance condemning the Government for imposing a sales tax on wine and I think they all voted for it, and then the next week at the National Press Club we had the discredited former Treasurer and present Deputy Leader of the Opposition standing up and saying that the wine tax was a good idea and Liberal government would retain it, after his leader had been running around for weeks saying that a Liberal government would repeal it immediately. That is a bit of confusion which, I am afraid, I cannot sort out, but I can sort out the confusion pertaining to the way in which the tax will be applied.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;No, it is not my job to sort it out. In fact, it is a job that I would not like, because I think it is well beyond my capacity. The sales tax on wine, as with sales tax in general, will be applied at the wholesale level. There are cases, such as the integrated wineries which Senator Sibraa has mentioned, where there is in fact no wholesale transaction or at least no arm's length wholesale transaction. I am advised that the present intention of the Commissioner of Taxation is to apply the Act in the way I shall outline. I interpolate that matters of administration such as this are matters for decision by the Commissioner of Taxation at his discretion rather than matters for the Government by direct political directive.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I understand that the present proposal is that where a winery sells a portion of its product at arm's length to a wholesaler, all that winery's sales will be valued, for sales tax purposes, at the same prices as the actual wholesale transaction. If a winery does not make any arm's length wholesale sales of that type, the actual retail price will be used as a base for striking the tax, but only 65 per cent of the actual retail price will have the 10 per cent tax applied to it. So the tax converted to a retail level tax will be, in fact, 6 1/ 2 per cent and not 10 per cent. In my view, that is a very generous allowance because implicit in that decision is that the normal wholesale to retail mark-up in the industry is in excess of 50 per cent. I would be surprised if it were in fact that high.</PARA>
<PARA> There are a couple of minor matters. The taxation Act provides-I think the phrase used in the Act is 'goods for own use'- that, where the producer of a good consumes that good himself or within his or her household-in the case of a wine maker, somebody who is drinking his or her own product-that product will be subject to sales tax at either the actual wholesale price or the deemed wholesale price. I am advised that that will apply to wine consumed on the premises of a wine maker, whether it be a free tasting or something like that. Sales tax at 6 1/2 per cent of the retail price level, or the actual wholesale price level of 10 per cent, will be applied. However, wine consumed off the premises, for example, where a wine maker submits samples to a wine show conducted in another town, another city or, even conceivably I suppose, another State, will not be deemed as goods for own use--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question, which is addressed to the Attorney-General, refers to his failure to answer questions put by Senator Durack and Senator Hill today which sought information on the transition from Royal Commissioner Costigan to the National Crime Authority, questions on matters which were raised in the Senate and questions to the Attorney-General on 23 and 24 August which he undertook to follow up and respond to and which obviously have not been followed up by him since that time. Does he accept that, as Attorney-General, he has the fundamental responsibility to see that allegations of organised crime are properly and fully investigated? Does not his obvious lack of action in following up these inquiries indicate that he is neither interested in nor responsible for the protection of the public interest in these matters? If he denies that that is the case, I ask him to tell the Senate what he has done to follow up the legitimate inquiries which have been raised in this place about a matter of considerable public interest, about whether matters which have been uncovered by Mr Costigan will be properly dealt with.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If this is meant to be the warm-up for today's main bout, the Opposition should really be trying to get some more proven performers into the ring. The reality of the matters is that the questions raised on 23 and 24 August were referred to the Special Minister of State in the normal course by my office. They were followed up by me personally yesterday. They were followed up by me during Question Time when some briefing that I had expected failed to materialise. That briefing has now materialised and I am in a position to give the honourable senator the following information. I believe that this information largely satisfies the questions that have been directed to me. If, on review, it appears that any aspect of the questions has not been addressed in this answer, I will be happy to follow it up and ensure that that is put on the record tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The situation is this: Following a meeting with Mr Costigan in March, the Special Minister of State announced that, on the establishment of the National Crime Authority, there would be a transition period of one month with the Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union then having a further two months to write its report. On the appointment of Messrs Bingham and Dwyer in July as members of the Crime Authority, Mr Costigan proposed to them, and they agreed, that they should be briefed first on the computer systems of the Royal Commission to be followed by briefings on the Royal Commission's outstanding investigations. Subsequently, Mr Costigan indicated that he and his senior counsel, Mr Meagher, QC, would be occupied full time as from 1 August on writing the report of the Royal Commission-that is to say, if Mr Meagher could take time out from his journalistic activities-and that they would not, therefore, be available for briefing on the outstanding investigations or on 'the higher levels of operational techniques'.</PARA>
<PARA> Mr Costigan's position now is that so far as these matters are concerned the transition from the Commission to the Authority will, in his terms, fail. The Authority does not accept that this accurately reflects the position. It notes that the order of the transitional briefing was Mr Costigan's choice and that in any event he had held out to it the prospect that he would have some time available after mid-September when his report had gone to the printers. The Authority notes that, among other things, it will have available to it the material contained in the Commission's computer system, the analyses prepared by Mr Costigan's staff, the material contained in his reports, counsel and a team of solicitors who have been engaged in conducting his operations-I am happy to find out the names of those persons and put them on the record because that was the subject, as I recall it, of a specific question-and accountants, analysts and other staff trained by him, all of whom will be available to the Authority.</PARA>
<PARA> It is worth repeating the point that the functions of the Authority and the Commission are different and that it is not simply a case of the Authority picking up from where the Commission left off. The Authority is presently concentrating on examining the Commission's outstanding investigations with a view to proposing to the Intergovernmental Committee matters which might be referred to the Authority for investigation. Because of the number of investigations and the complexity of the material, to which I have already adverted in reply to Senator Missen today, the Authority has indicated to the Special Minister of State that it will not be ready to approach the Committee before late September. Further, more precise, advice is expected from the Authority later this week on when it will be ready to approach the Committee.</PARA>
<PARA> I have also a note on Mr Justice Stewart's travel arrangements, since that has been the subject of some rather snide questioning in the course of Question Time today. Mr Justice Stewart has travelled overseas on only two previous occasions in his capacity as head of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and the Nugan Hand royal commission, the name having changed when the letters patent were amended in March 1983. The first such trip was from 26 November to 23 December 1981 when he visited a number of countries in Europe. From 11 September to 13 October 1982 he visited Hong Kong, Singapore and the United Kingdom. This year Mr Justice Stewart left on 17 August to go to Hong Kong, accompanied by the team working with him on the Nugan Hand royal commission. He went from there to the United States of America and I believe that he will be absent from Australia for just two more weeks in the balance of this year. I trust that that satisfies Senator Chaney and the other members of the Opposition who have asked questions. I will be only too happy on behalf of the Special Minister of State to give any further information that the Senate might reasonably require.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Giles said, the new supported accommodation assistance program was announced in the Budget. This arose from the report on the Commonwealth's Review of Crisis and Youth Accommodation, which was tabled in this Parliament. As a result of that report and its recommendations I have had negotiations with the various State Ministers for community welfare about the situation which exists in various crisis accommodation programs generally. That report, Senator Giles will remember, reported that there was no order, no chaos, no sense of direction and no apparent idea of just where we were going in this whole miscellany of crisis accommodation programs which have developed over the years. The purpose of the new program is to provide funds to the States and Territories to be used to assist non-government and local government bodies to provide a range of supported accommodation services-services both of the traditional type which have provided accommodation for those who are long term homeless, particularly aged men, and in the youth area and the women's area. It is hoped that these programs will be brought together so that we can replace the homeless persons assistance program, the women's emergency services program, the youth services scheme, and related elements of the children's services program with a supported accommodation assistance program which contains three elements- the youth supported accommodation program, the women's emergency services program and the general supported accommodation program.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a result of recent negotiations with the States, we have come to an agreement, with some minor details to be sorted out. By 1 January I believe these new programs will be in place. We will then have three quite separate programs. The women's program, which is the one particularly mentioned by Senator Giles, will be separate from the other two programs. Funding and administration will be considered separately. In fact, by bringing together the present State and Federal contributions to these programs, plus the additions in the Budget, more funds will be available than have been available in the past. Part of the idea in developing the program is to give women who run programs such as this, and also those people who run youth shelters, one government and one agency with which to deal, and also to give them a guarantee of funds in a way that they have not had in the past.</PARA>
<PARA> If negotiations with the States and the Territories can be completed as quickly as I think they will be, this program will be established on 1 January 1985. From 1 January 1985 to 1 July it will be a Commonwealth-funded program. After that almost all elements of the program, with the particular exception of the homeless persons assistance program, will be cost shared. The result will be a more coherent program and, in the long term, I believe, a better funded program in all these areas than has been the case in the past.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Some people are tigers for punishment. The inadequate and misleading figure that Senator Messner quoted may well be correct; I do not have with me the figure for the last Howard Budget. However, I do know that the last Howard Budget established the preconditions which, had they not been changed, would have left the country with a $10 billion deficit. Where Senator Messner is misleading or obtuse or whatever is that he has counted only part of the allocation to South Australia in this Budget for water assistance. If the figure in the last Howard Budget was $10m, as he said-I do not know whether that is correct; judging by his recent record it is unlikely, but it may be-the total figure this year for water assistance for South Australia is $15m. That is made up of $8m in the water resources assistance program, the requirement of which is that it be matched by State funds in some proportion, and $7m outside the normal water resources assistance program, which does not require a matching State contribution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I do not know whether Senator Messner is complaining about that, but I do not believe that the South Australian Government or even the South Australian Parliament, which I understand has in it some colleagues of his, would complain about that. If his figure of $10m is correct, then in real terms after adjustment for cost changes over those two years, the total payments from the Commonwealth for water assistance programs in South Australia this year will be 25 per cent higher than they were in the last Howard Budget.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I am aware that supporting parents in the community, particularly those with more than one child, are in a difficult position and always have been. I remind Senator Elstob that because of provisions in the last Budget a supporting parent with two children and in private rented accommodation , as such parents frequently are, can receive after November an increase in payments of between $13 and $15 a week. Since the Australian Labor Party has come to power such supporting parents have received considerably greater amounts of between $25 and $30 a week. Of course, in some cases supporting parents, particularly those with more than one child, always will be better off in monetary terms on the pension with fringe benefits they may receive than in some of the low paid jobs that are available to them. We are likely to have to face that situation for a long time, although I believe-I am sure that this is true- that most single parents prefer to work if they can. Because of the assistance given to them through the family income supplement and the other benefits that are available through State and Federal governments, those parents should look carefully at the position before deciding to go on the pension rather than work.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> There continue to be obstacles in our society for working single parents with children, the most obvious of which are the limited employment opportunities. Sole parenthood is often an added barrier to obtaining a job. The Government has been successful in increasing the number of jobs available and employment in the community. We shall continue along that path. We shall continue also to give single parents assistance in that regard.</PARA>
<PARA> The earnings of women-more than 90 per cent of single parents are women-tend to be low. Those women tend to have fewer skills and less experience than others in the community. The legislation on affirmative action introduced by my colleague Senator Ryan and her efforts with education and training will assist us in that regard in the future. Another barrier to obtaining a job is the absence of accessible and affordable child care. This year we increased the child care budget by $30m on top of the $20m-odd by which we increased it last year. That is a considerable increase in a program which accounted for less than $100m when the Labor Party came to power. The increased number of child care places throughout the country will gradually assist us in that regard. We intend to take that action despite the complaints of some people that expenditure on child care is somehow damaging the family in this country. We know that all these problems have to be faced. We believe that we have faced them in the first 18 months of government. We believe that in the future we will be able to reach the situation, through fuller employment and through better assistance to women, where single parents will not be in the position that Senator Elstob talked about.</PARA>

<PARA> We intend to amend the Trade Practices Act by repealing sections 45D and 45E and will be amending the Conciliation and Arbitration Act to provide a mechanism whereby secondary boycott disputes can be dealt with by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> We also intend to introduce a Bill to bring about a major consolidation of all existing veterans' entitlement legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government will be embarking on major industry restructuring and assistance measures all of which have already been announced and some extensively canvassed . Briefly these will include legislation to:</PARA>
<PARA> establish an automotive industry authority as part of the revised assistance to the industry. Associated with this initiative will be the introduction of measures to provide support for the design and development of motor vehicles;</PARA>
<PARA> revise industry arrangements for the retail marketing of petrol;</PARA>
<PARA> amend the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act to facilitate and encourage off-shore petroleum exploration and development activity, and to give effect to the area to be avoided by ships around the Bass Strait petroleum production facilities;</PARA>
<PARA> introduce a package of Bills to restructure the wheat marketing and pricing arrangements;</PARA>
<PARA> revise arrangements for the fishing industry to introduce a new management policy and further assistance measures;</PARA>
<PARA> amend the export inspection charge provisions for meat, dairy products and eggs following review of these procedures;</PARA>
<PARA> revise arrangements for the canned fruits marketing industry. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government also intends to introduce, if time permits, a package of Bills to reorganise the dairy marketing industry. These will not be passed during the Budget sittings but will provide the opportunity for detailed public debate to take place on a more informed basis. </PARA>
<PARA> As already announced by the Minister for Education and Youth Affairs the Government will introduce a major item of legislation to revise the system of grants to the States and the Northern Territory for schools assistance. This will be introduced together with States Grants Bills for tertiary education, as well as Bills to adjust grant levels in line with cost supplementation arrangements. </PARA>
<PARA> In line with an announcement made last April the Government intends introducing a Bill to amend various electoral, health, social security and education Acts to bring arrangements for Christmas Island broadly into line with the rest of Australia. </PARA>
<PARA> Bills will also be introduced to:</PARA>
<PARA> enhance the role, jurisdiction and enforcement powers of the Human Rights Commission;</PARA>
<PARA> introduce changes to the supplementary licence scheme for broadcasting and television in preparation for its early commencement;</PARA>
<PARA> guarantee borrowings raised by Qantas to purchase Boeing 767 aircraft;</PARA>
<PARA> enhance the Commonwealth's ability to collect air navigation charges and introduce separate airport charges;</PARA>
<PARA> enable the Empress of Australia to be replaced, thereby ensuring the survival of the Bass Strait sea passenger service;</PARA>
<PARA> replenish Australia's contribution to the International Development Fund;</PARA>
<PARA> restrict the use of Australian passports to Australian citizens and remove the distinction between immigrants who are British subjects and those who are not;</PARA>
<PARA> implement the report of the remuneration tribunal in respect of salaries and allowances following the 1984 general review. </PARA>
<PARA> In addition the usual Statute Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill will include a number of matters of minor significance. </PARA>
<PARA> We will of course be proceeding with Bills before the Parliament, including:</PARA>
<PARA> The Constitution Alteration Bills;</PARA>
<PARA> Defence and Repatriation Bills;</PARA>
<PARA> Conciliation and Arbitration; and</PARA>
<PARA> the six Export Inspection Charge Bills. </PARA>
<PARA> As always, unforeseen circumstances may give rise to additional legislation and pressure on parliamentary debating time as well as on the Parliamentary Counsel' s time and resources may not enable all of the legislation forecast to come forward as soon as we would like. In addition, the Government may still consider other measures which could result in legislation in the current sittings. However, the program I have outlined continues the direction of reform established by the Government thus far. </PARA>
<PARA> I commend the Government's program and look forward to the assistance of honourable senators in its implementation. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I wish to make a statement on the Government's response to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge. The issues confronting the Government and the Senate arising out of the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge are about as serious as could possibly be imagined. An allegation has been made against a very senior Federal judge that, if substantiated, would amount to the commission by that judge of the criminal offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice. The evidence in support of that allegation has failed to convince the Senate Committee as a whole that there is a prima facie case against the judge, but equally it has failed to convince all members of the Committee that there is not.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The decisions that are taken on this report will have major consequences for the independence and the integrity of the Federal judiciary and the whole balance of power between the courts, the Executive Government, and each House of Parliament. Also, they obviously will have the most important consequences for the Federal judge concerned, Mr Justice Lionel Murphy, who has served on the High Court since 1975. He is now the most senior judge on the High Court, after the Chief Justice and Sir Anthony Mason, and, as occasion requires, presides over that court. </PARA>
<PARA> The matters to be dealt with must therefore not be approached lightly or dismissively, or in any partisan spirit. It is particularly important that the decisions we make in this matter-either on the part of Government or on the part of the Senate-not be a hothouse reaction to passing pressures that ignore the deeper issues and values that are involved. What we do now transcends the particular case. It will set the pattern for how our institutions respond in future to grave allegations of judicial misconduct without jeopardising the independence and integrity of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA>Proper Approach to Section 72</PARA>
<PARA> The decisions we take need to be taken in the light of the proper procedure and criteria to be applied when a House of Parliament addresses a question of misbehaviour under section 72 of the Constitution. Section 72 provides that a Federal judge:</PARA>
<PARA> shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for the removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA>Address for removal is the only action that Parliament can take. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government's position on the criteria and procedures that are available under section 72 has been clear from the outset. On 28 February, I tabled the opinion of the Solicitor-General, which I believed-and still believe now-to be the sound and the correct interpretation on this matter. It pays due regard to the role of the Houses of Parliament, and at the same time addresses the basic issues of the independence of the judiciary and the separation of powers. The Government does not accept the view of section 72 contained in the opinion of counsel to the Senate Committee, Mr Pincus, QC, insofar as it supports giving each House of Parliament more or less unfettered freedom to say what private misconduct constitutes misbehaviour. In this connection, Mr President, I now table a supplementary opinion by the Solicitor-General, which confirms his earlier opinion and explains in full the reasons why he, as does the Government, rejects Mr Pincus's approach. The Government's view, based on the authorities fully cited by the Solicitor- General--</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator GARETH EVANS</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will, Mr President. The Government's view, based on the authorities fully cited by the Solicitor-General, is that the concept of 'proved misbehaviour' in section 72 has only two possible areas of application. The first area is misbehaviour in the exercise of judicial functions, including neglect or non-attendance. In the absence of any question of criminal or civil liability of a kind appropriately proved in the courts, 'proof' here would have to be to the satisfaction of each House of the Parliament, following procedures established by Parliament.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second area is misbehaviour involving a breach of the general law of such a quality as to indicate unfitness for office. Parliament would normally rely for 'proof' here on the outcome of ordinary court proceedings, but Parliament could also, should it choose to do so, prove the matter to its own satisfaction by properly established parliamentary procedures. </PARA>
<PARA> Counsel for the judge, Mr David Bennett, QC, has expressed the view that a conviction in court is necessary to establish 'proved misbehaviour', at least in relation to conduct not immediately pertaining to the duties of judicial office. The Government's view, as I have previously indicated to the Parliament, is not so limited. The traditional authorities, in particular Quick and Garran, in their Annotated Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia, acknowledge a proper determining role for Parliament itself, although emphasising the very judicial way in which Parliament would need to act in such matters. Thus Quick and Garran say:</PARA>
<PARA> No mode is prescribed for the proof of misbehaviour or incapacity, and the Parliament is therefore free to prescribe its own procedure. Seeing, however, that proof of definite legal breaches of the conditions of tenure is required, and that the enquiry is therefore in its nature more strictly judicial than in England, it is conceived that the procedure ought to partake as far as possible of the formal nature of a criminal trial; that the charges should be definitely formulated, the accused allowed full opportunities of defence, and the proof established by evidence taken at the Bar of each House. </PARA>
<PARA>The reference is to the 1901 edition, at page 732. While acknowledging a proper role for Parliament itself, as well as the courts, in establishing 'proved misbehaviour' for the purposes of section 72, the Government does not, however, accept that it would be constitutionally capable for the actual proof of misbehaviour to be vested in any other kind of body-for example, a royal commission, or a parliamentary commissioner or parliamentary commission purporting to exercise power delegated by one or both Houses. This follows, in our view, from the necessarily judicial character of the 'proving' process; it is a very long established principle in Australian constitutional law that Federal judicial power can be exercised only by courts either created or vested with jurisdiction under chapter III of the Constitution, and there could be few more sensitive tasks of a judicial character than determining proof of misbehaviour against a High Court judge. The only exception, as we see it, to the rule requiring judicial proof or court proof is that which enables proof to the satisfaction of Parliament itself, and that power is in turn vested in the Parliament by virtue of section 72 (ii)-itself part of chapter III of the Constitution which gives the legislature a central role in the removal process. </PARA>
<PARA> The most fundamental difficulty with Mr Pincus's interpretation of section 72- insofar as it would allow Parliament to range more or less at will in determining what constitutes 'proved misbehaviour' rather than being confined to the two categories I have identified above-is that it takes no account of the object or purpose of security of tenure given to judges by section 72. The Solicitor-General's original opinion points out that section 72 was intended to give 'conscious effect to the principle that the judiciary in our Federal system should be secure in their independence from the legislature and the executive'. The Pincus opinion just does not address the issues of judicial independence and separation of powers, and the consequences-for removal procedures under the Constitution-that flow from the emphasis given in the Constitution to those principles. Quick and Garran put the point very well at page 733 of their book quoting the relevant part of Todd's Parliamentary Government in England:</PARA>
<PARA> The peculiar stringency of the provisions for safeguarding the independence of the Federal Justices is a consequence of the federal nature of the Constitution, and the necessity for protecting those who interpret it from the danger of political interference. The Federal Executive has a certain amount of control over the Federal Courts by its power of appointing Justices; the Federal Executive and Parliament jointly have a further amount of control by their power of removing such Justices for specified causes; but otherwise the independence of the Judiciary from interference by the other departments of the Government is complete. And both the Executive and the Parliament, in the exercise of their constitutional powers, are bound to respect the spirit of the Constitution, and to avoid any wanton interference with the independence of the Judiciary. Complaints to Parliament in respect to the conduct of the judiciary, or the decisions of courts of justice, should not be lightly entertained . . . Parliament should abstain from all interference with the judiciary, except in cases of such gross perversion of the law, either by intention, corruption, or incapacity, as make it necessary for the House to exercise the power vested in it of advising the Crown for the removal of the Judge. </PARA>
<PARA>Some classes of 'misbehaviour' may not be subsumed by the approach of Quick and Garran-for example, partisan political activity or notorious private behaviour not directly related to, or affecting, the conduct of judicial office. So be it. What may be a cause for admonition by the Chief Justice of the court in question , peer group pressure and like forces, should not necessarily be regarded as grounds for dismissal. The separation of powers principle demands that the power of Parliament to remove a judge not extend to undefined residual areas of behaviour which are neither clearly illegal nor clearly related to the performance of judicial duties. </PARA>
<PARA>The 'Age' Tapes and the Briese Allegation</PARA>
<PARA> It is well to recall that the Senate Committee was established to inquire into and report upon the conduct of the judge as revealed by the Age tapes and transcripts. The Committee's findings on this question could not be more clear- cut. They were, first, that it was unable to conclude that these materials relating to the conduct of a judge were authentic or genuine except to the limited extent that limited acknowledgements had been made. Secondly, as to the tape recordings, there is nothing contained therein which could amount to or provide evidence of misbehaviour of the judge, whatever interpretation of section 72 of the Constitution is accepted. As to the transcripts, the Committee reported that no facts had been established in respect of conduct revealed by them which constituted misbehaviour under section 72, whatever interpretation of misbehaviour is accepted. Well may David Solomon say in the Australian Financial Review of 28 August that the Age 'did not come out covered in glory from the Senate investigation' and that:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is quite extraordinary that a paper which is generally concerned about proprieties should have carried such a thin report of the Committee's conclusions about material which the Age itself had published so prominently. </PARA>
<PARA>I say no more on that aspect. </PARA>
<PARA> The nub of the Committee's report clearly concerns the allegation made to it in the course of its inquiry by Mr Clarrie Briese, Chief Stipendiary Magistrate of New South Wales. The criminal nature of the allegation appears to have been downgraded by some commentators, but I point out that the Committee agreed, in paragraph 79 of its report, that the allegation of Mr Briese, if sustained by the evidence, was that Mr Justice Murphy had engaged in conduct which constituted the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice. The Committee specifically referred to the offence to that effect created by section 43 of the Commonwealth Crimes Act. That is a very grave charge. The Committee did not seek to rule as a court on this charge but specifically limited itself to considering whether the evidence by Mr Briese could constitute the offence of attempting to pervert the course of justice. There was a difference of views on the Committee, as we all know. Senators Tate, Crowley and Bolkus did not believe that the evidence of Mr Briese was of sufficient strength to establish a prima facie case of misbehaviour by the judge. Senator Durack and Senator Lewis, without finding that the judge had been guilty of misbehaviour, concluded that there was a prima facie case against the judge. Senator Chipp, for reasons he carefully explained in his dissenting report and in his statement to the Senate on 24 August, felt unable to express a conclusion on this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> The seriousness of this offence and the clear division of opinion in the Committee have led the Government to conclude that further action of some kind needs to be taken to clear the air, and to remove the cloud hanging over the judge and the High Court. The question is what. So far as misbehaviour occurring otherwise than in the exercise of judicial functions is concerned, there are simply no precedents to bind or guide us, except that during the term of my immediate predecessor, Senator Durack, a serious criminal charge involving conduct not pertaining to judicial office was brought against a member of the Family Court of Australia and the judge was acquitted. Apparently that was regarded as the end of the matter. On that occasion, certainly, the matter was not raised in the Senate by Senator Durack or, so far as I am aware, by any other senator. Certainly, the situation in relation to investigations by Senate committees on matters of routine legislative inquiry provides no precedent as to the course that the present Committee should have followed, or that we in the Senate should now follow or authorise, in relation to the interrogation of the judge in the context of the possible application of section 72 of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>Possible Approaches for Resolution of the Matter</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has therefore given most serious consideration as to how this situation should be dealt with. One approach would be to consider the institution of criminal proceedings, having regard to the essentially criminal nature of the allegation that has been made. A second approach would be to confine further consideration of the matter to the Parliament, in particular by reconstituting the Senate Committee and directing it to conduct on this occasion a judicial examination of the issues relating to Mr Briese's allegation. A third general approach that has been carefully considered is whether the resolution of these matters might most appropriately be achieved by a person or body, other than a criminal court, outside the political and parliamentary arena. </PARA>
<PARA>Approach I-Criminal Proceedings</PARA>
<PARA> In the Government's view, the proper course to adopt at this stage is to exhaust the criminal prosecution option before considering any other approach. This is justified by:</PARA>
<PARA> the nature and seriousness of the allegation, which has been made on oath and tested by parliamentary committee examination;</PARA>
<PARA> the belief by two Committee members that a prima facie case has been made out, with a third member not persuaded to the contrary; and</PARA>
<PARA> the likely inability of non-court and non-parliamentary procedures, including a royal commission or parliamentary commissioner, so called, to satisfy the technical 'proved misbehaviour' requirement in section 72 of the Constitution.</PARA>
<PARA> If it can be established that Mr Justice Murphy used the words 'and what about my little mate?', and did so with the intention of influencing the course of the committal proceedings involving Morgan Ryan, then the character of this conduct is criminal. If he did not use those words, or used them without that intent, then the conduct is innocuous. There is no middle ground in relation to that conduct. At this stage there is no evidence at all available to the Government to enable it to form a view on this question. All the Government has is the Senate Select Committee's summary of what Mr Briese has said in sworn evidence to the Committee. That, of course, is classic hearsay. </PARA>
<PARA> Since the tabling of the report in Parliament on 24 August 1984 Mr Briese has indicated to the Australian Federal Police, on an approach initiated by me, that :</PARA>
<PARA> (a) he did not propose to be interviewed at this stage;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) he did not intend to make a formal complaint; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) he will decide his future conduct in the light of the decisions, if any, taken by the Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> According to the Committee summary, Mr Briese gave evidence of a conversation which occurred when the judge telephoned Mr Briese and said he had discussed the question of the independence of the magistracy in New South Wales with the New South Wales Attorney-General and the Government was going ahead with legislation to give effect to it. Mr Briese states that the judge then said to him: 'And now what about my little mate?'. The Senate Select Committee report then makes the following observations on this evidence:</PARA>
<PARA> In evidence Mr Briese was unsure of the exact opening words of the inquiry (' and' or 'now' or 'and now') but was adamant that the question was asked with such emphasis as to suggest a link between the inquiry and the preceeding conversation</PARA>
<PARA> The Judge's recollection is that he did not use the expression 'my little mate' . </PARA>
<PARA> The description I have just given of the relevant events is based upon Appendix 5 of the Committee's report. Essentially what emerges is two materially different versions of the events-Mr Briese's version and the judge's version. </PARA>
<PARA> Assuming the judge did make the statement 'and now what about my little mate?' with the intention of influencing the course of the Morgan Ryan committal proceedings, there are three provisions of Commonwealth criminal law which may be relevant:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) section 33 of the Crimes Act 1914, which deals with official corruption and provides for an indictable offence with a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) section 43 of the Crimes Act 1914, which deals with attempting to pervert justice with a maximum penalty of 2 years imprisonment; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) section 7A of the Crimes Act 1914, which deals with inciting to or urging the commission of offences with a penalty of $2,000 or imprisonment for 12 months. </PARA>
<PARA> The 'Prosecution Policy of the Commonwealth,' tabled in the Parliament on behalf of the then Attorney-General, Senator Durack, in December 1982, lays down three principles which must be satisfied before prosecutions should be brought-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) the evidence must establish a prima facie case against the defendant;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) a prosecution should not normally proceed unless there is a reasonable prospect of conviction. It should be rather more likely than not that the prosecution will result in conviction-the so-called 51 per cent rule;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) whether in the light of provable facts and the whole of the surrounding circumstances, the public interest requires the institution of the prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) Prima facie case. The purpose of this rule is to ensure that the evidence in support of the prosecution is sufficient to establish the commission of the offence on the criminal standard of beyond a reasonable doubt. This principle must be satisfied by the application of objective professional judgment. Failure to apply this standard would be contrary to processes of the law and may expose an initiator of the prosecution to action for malicious prosecution. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) The 51 per cent rule. There are precedents to support the proposition that in cases of this kind a prosecution should be brought to clear the air, notwithstanding that the available evidence may not satisfy the 51 per cent rule . Sir Thomas Hetherington, the English Director of Public Prosecutions, has recently said that the 51 per cent chance of conviction rule will not be applied in the case of allegations against police officers, whose public position requires the ventilation in court of allegations which amount to prima facie evidence of crimes. </PARA>
<PARA> (c) Public interest considerations. It is axiomatic that prosecutions should not be brought otherwise than in the public interest. The question which arises is whether, in the light of provable facts and the whole of the surrounding circumstances, the public interest requires that a prosecution be brought. Among the many considerations that may be relevant in this respect is the desirability , even in circumstances of a relatively weak prima facie case, of bringing a prosecution to clear the air. One New South Wales precedent comes to mind: In 1964 a member of the typing pool at Parliament House made allegations of criminal misconduct against the then Chief Secretary. The Solicitor-General, although unconvinced of the likelihood of a prosecution succeeding, deemed it in the public interest to lay charges, and to instruct the President of the New South Wales Bar Council, then John Kerr QC, to prosecute. After hearing evidence , the magistrate declined to commit. </PARA>
<PARA> There are three persons who could make a decision to prosecute: (a) Mr Briese- or for that matter any private persons; (b) the Attorney-General; or (c) the Director of Public Prosecutions. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Briese may be put aside at the outset. Although this course is open to him at law, he has made it clear that he does not intend either bringing proceedings , or making a complaint at this stage. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General could take the initiative in the matter. Notwithstanding the existence of the DPP it would be open to me to consider criminal proceedings , and institute them if I saw fit. I refer to section 10 of the Director of Public Prosecutions Act 1983. However, I have decided not to do so in this case. In reaching this decision I have had regard to the following matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Government has recently established the office of DPP to revitalise, and bring greater independence to, the prosecution of offences against the laws of the Commonwealth. I do not consider that I should bypass the proper function of the DPP in this matter. I envisage doing so only in the most exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> (b) Much of the debate in this matter has been in the political arena. Should I decide not to prosecute or should I decide to prosecute and the prosecution fails, the criticism may well be made that these processes lacked independence. The DPP has been established to provide the degree of independence which is required. </PARA>
<PARA> This leaves only the DPP, and the Government has decided that he is the appropriate person to make any decision whether or not to prosecute. I accordingly foreshadow that I shall be moving at the appropriate time in the following terms:</PARA>
<PARA> That the Senate-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) refer-</PARA>
<PARA> (a) all evidence given before the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) all documentary or other material furnished to the Committee,</PARA>
<PARA> relevant to the Briese allegation, to the Director of Public Prosecutions for consideration by him whether a prosecution should be brought against the judge, and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) request the Director of Public Prosecutions, should he conclude that a prosecution not be brought, to furnish a report to it on the reasons for reaching that conclusion. </PARA>
<PARA>If criminal proceedings are brought and determined only two consequences can follow: If the judge is convicted-presumably of attempt to pervert the course of justice under section 43 of the Crimes Act-the precondition of 'proved misbehaviour' under section 72 would appear to be clearly established, and an address could proceed without further Committee deliberation; if the judge is acquitted there would be no apparent remaining basis, so far as the particular Briese allegation was concerned, for any suggestion of some lesser form of section 72 misbehaviour. </PARA>
<PARA>Approach II-Further Parliamentary Procedures</PARA>
<PARA> Further consideration by the Parliament of the issues involved in an option which is certainly technically available on the views expressed on section 72 of the Constitution by the Solicitor-General and by me. However, the Government's view is that further consideration by Parliament should only proceed after exhaustion of the criminal prosecution option, as already outlined. There are a number of reasons why a further parliamentary procedure is not appropriate or desirable at this stage, but should only be a matter-if at all-of last resort. </PARA>
<PARA> First, given that the Committee was evenly divided on the question as to whether it should proceed from its initial investigative phase to a more formal 'judicial' phase, there would seem to be a strong case for an independent expert assessment of the question of whether there is a prima facie case, such as to justify a full scale 'judicial' proceeding, before that course is embarked upon. Secondly, while there may not always be any alternative procedure available for the resolution of particular kinds of section 72 misbehaviour questions that may arise, when as here the allegation is of criminal conduct, the Senate should be very slow to proceed to try the issue itself rather than resorting to the ordinary criminal processes. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, allegations of criminal conduct demand compliance with rigorous procedures, and the careful application of appropriate standards of proof, by persons who are both expert and detached. I imply no criticism of the Senate Committee or any of its members, but the fact remains-as they would readily concede-that its members are less well-equipped to resolve these questions than the established procedures and institutions of the criminal law. Fourthly, the fact that a High Court judge is involved here means, consistently with separation of powers principles, that Parliament should involve itself in the process when, and only when, it is necessary for it to do so. It is not necessary for it to do so now since 'proof' of misbehaviour may be sought by other means, namely the ordinary criminal processes, and that again would appear the proper avenue for resolving the matter in the first instance. </PARA>
<PARA> None of these considerations weigh conclusively against any further consideration of this matter by a properly constituted-or reconstituted- parliamentary committee. I simply emphasise the desirability of matters of this kind, and gravity, being dealt with by ordinary criminal processes so far as is possible. In the event, however, that the DPP should advise that on the material presently available there is no basis on which a prosecution could or should proceed, it may be that the Parliament-the Senate-would wish to reconsider the question of some further Committee proceeding. Certainly, for reasons I shall shortly set out, there would appear to be no other appropriate machinery on which Parliament could properly rely for such further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> If the Senate were to take the course of constituting or reconstituting a committee to conduct a further so-called 'judicial phase' inquiry, the appropriate course would appear to be to follow the general lines of the submission made by Mr Hughes, QC, on behalf of the judge-and endorsed in the report of Senators Durack and Lewis-by applying the principles of natural justice as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Taking any necessary evidence or further evidence in the presence of the judge and his counsel;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) permitting cross-examination of witnesses; and</PARA>
<PARA> (c) allowing the judge to then determine whether or not he would give sworn evidence and be subject to questioning by the Committee. </PARA>
<PARA>Approach III-Extra-parliamentary determination of issues (otherwise than through institution of criminal proceedings)</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has also considered other options for the determination of issues arising in this matter, in particular the following three possibilities which have each received a degree of public attention:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) An application by the Government, or possibly by the Senate through its President, to the High Court to resolve the questions both of law and fact that are raised by the Briese allegation;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) A royal commission specifically inquiring into the Briese evidence in relation to Mr Justice Murphy;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) A parliamentary commissioner or multi-member commission exercising delegated power from the Senate to determine the facts. </PARA>
<PARA>The Government has concluded, for reasons I shall now set out, that the problems with each of these courses are such as to warrant their exclusion from further consideration. </PARA>
<PARA> (a) APPLICATION BY GOVERNMENT OR THE SENATE TO THE HIGH COURT TO RESOLVE THE QUESTIONS OF BOTH FACT AND LAW</PARA>
<PARA> Although this approach would be a move to take the matter out of the political arena and to have all issues authoritatively decided, there is no obvious way of initiating proceedings in the High Court which the High Court would accept as both within its jurisdiction and within its duty to determine. I am not satisfied, in the absence of the kind of advisory opinions, jurisdiction that would have been available had a referendum proposal been put and passed on this occasion, that the High Court would have jurisdiction, and the Solicitor-General agrees. Moreover, it may be necessary for either the Senate or the Government to act as complainant and allege misbehaviour on the part of the judge in order to have standing to bring the matter before the Court. On the information available to it, the Government would not be prepared to take that course. </PARA>
<PARA>(b) ROYAL COMMISSION SPECIFICALLY INQUIRING INTO ALLEGATION OF MR BRIESE</PARA>
<PARA> The purpose of such a royal commission would be to establish a non-political impartial investigation by a body with coercive powers. However, there is an important question of principle whether that would be an appropriate step for the Executive Government to take, having regard to the independence of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> Also, there must be a real doubt whether the Executive Government can, through a royal commission appointed by it, compel a Justice of the High Court to attend and answer questions relating to his possible removal. Clearly, there would be the possibility of a constitutional challenge. </PARA>
<PARA> The royal commission's report would not legally conclude anything. Its findings could not bind the Senate. In the final result, if the commissioner reported that the judge was guilty of the conduct complained of, parliamentary or criminal proceedings would need to be taken and the whole matter reheard. It is also relevant to mention here that evidence given by the judge before the commission would not be admissible against him in legal proceedings. Similar considerations apply in relation to a possible reference of the matter not to a royal commission but to the National Crime Authority; the only significant procedural difference between the Authority and a royal commission for present purposes being that while the evidence of the judge would be usable in subsequent proceedings, the excuse of self-incrimination would be available. </PARA>
<PARA>(c) PARLIAMENTARY COMMISSIONER OR COMMISSIONER EXERCISING DELEGATED POWERS FROM SENATE</PARA>
<PARA> There is no clear precedent for what has been proposed in relation to the appointment of a parliamentary commissioner with compulsive powers to conduct a hearing to determine the facts. Such nineteenth century English precedents as have been referred to appear to fall short of what is involved in the present case. It is not clear to what extent power was claimed and exercised to compel witnesses to appear before the persons appointed in those cases to gather information or examine documents or accounts on behalf of the parliamentary committees in question. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate in 1982, on a motion by me, directed Senators Chaney and Guilfoyle to deliver to Sir John Minogue, QC, a retired judge, papers relating to tax avoidance and evasion. This was done so that Sir John Minogue could be given the function of editing 'bottom of the harbour' legal opinions held by the then Government with a view to the documents in their edited form being tabled in the Senate. This too falls far short of what would be involved in setting up a parliamentary commissioner with powers to conduct a hearing and to make findings of fact. </PARA>
<PARA> It follows that there must be a doubt about the power of the Senate to compel the attendance of witnesses before a parliamentary commissioner. Legislation could be considered to deal with this deficiency. However, the enactment of legislation purporting to delegate the 'misbehaviour-proving' function to a commissioner, while removing one possible area of legal uncertainty, would nonetheless still not put beyond doubt the possibility of a constitutional challenge arguing that such 'proving' had to be, if not by a court, then by Parliament itself, or at least by a parliamentary committee. </PARA>
<PARA> As well as the uncertainty in relation to the power to compel testimony before the parliamentary commissioner, there would also be uncertainty as to the protection available to the commissioner and witnesses in relation to things said in the course of the hearing. Obviously a question would arise whether the proceedings before the commissioner could be regarded as 'proceedings in Parliament' within the meaning of the protection afforded by the freedom of speech and debate clause contained in Article 9 of the Bill of Rights as applied to the Senate by section 49 of the Constitution. It would be important for those taking part in the proceedings before the commissioner, and for the commissioner himself, or the commission members themselves that the same privileges and immunities be available as if the proceedings were before a committee of the Senate, and firm assurances on this matter could not be given in the absence of express legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> This leads to a further problem with this course, and that is the question of whether it would be possible to find a suitable person or persons who would have the necessary qualities for the most serious and unprecedented role he, she or they would be asked to undertake, and who would be available and willing to undertake that role. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally I point out, in case there may be some misunderstanding on the point, that even if the Senate were to appoint a parliamentary commissioner he or she could not actually determine the question of misbehaviour. His or her findings could not constitutionally bind any member of the Senate. It would still be a matter for the Senate to decide whether the conduct amounted to 'misbehaviour' and a trial at the Bar of the Senate may, in the absence of a conviction by a court, be necessary for this purpose. </PARA>
<PARA>Conclusion</PARA>
<PARA> The course which the Government proposes is, in summary, that there be a reference of the matter in the first instance to the Director of Public Prosecutions in order that the criminal prosecution option may be fully considered, with any necessary further consideration-other than by the criminal courts-being by way of parliamentary rather than any extra-parliamentary process . The Government firmly believes that not only is this approach likely in the long run to prove the most expeditious, but that it is the only appropriate, responsible and constitutionally sound means of resolving such concerns as may continue to be felt following the tabling of the Senate Committee report. </PARA>
<PARA> What is abundantly clear is that the longer this matter lingers, the greater will be the damage caused to the reputation and prestige of the High Court and to the respect afforded to the institution of the judiciary generally. There is an enormous burden resting upon the Senate, and it is important that we discharge it quickly, conscientiously and honourably. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the text of the Solicitor-General's opinion. </PARA>

<PARA> Misbehaviour is limited in meaning in section 72 of the Constitution to matters pertaining to-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) judicial office, including non-attendance, neglect of or refusal to perform duties; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the commission of an offence against the general law of such a quality as to indicate that the incumbent is unfit to exercise the office. </PARA>
<PARA> Misbehaviour is defined as breach of condition to hold office during good behaviour. It is not limited to conviction in a court of law.

<PARA>The Pincus Opinion then states- Since, as will appear, I do not agree with the Solicitor General, it will be necessary to examine in detail the authorities on which he relies. </PARA>
<PARA>The conclusion of the Pincus Opinion [at 27], under the heading 'SUMMARY OF OPINION', is- As a matter of law, I differ from the view which has previously been expressed as to the meaning of s.72. I think it is for Parliament to decide whether any conduct alleged against a judge constitutes misbehaviour sufficient to justify removal from office. There is no ''Technical'' relevant meaning of misbehaviour and in particular it is not necessary, in order for the jurisdiction under s.72 to be enlivened, that an offence be proved. </PARA>
<PARA>I am asked to reconsider my opinion in the light of the Pincus Opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> 3. I find it difficult to respond to the Pincus Opinion in any structured way. The Opinion does not acknowledge the distinction, shortly stated by Quick and Garran at 731 (set out in paragraph 5 below), that the tenure of British judges is determinable upon two conditions, namely for misbehaviour or by address from both Houses. The essential matter is that, with the English position in mind, the draftsmen of section 72 consciously departed from it. The relevant exercise in determining the meaning of the section is to identify these points of departure and to establish the consequences. The Pincus Opinion omits squarely to address these issues of construction arising from the terms of the section itself. Although the Pincus Opinion engages that it will examine in detail the authorities upon which I relied in my opinion, the course of its discussion is fixed more by reference to its own English and colonial precedents. For that reason, it is necessary separately to consider the force and relevance of the authorities drawn upon by the Opinion, and the manner in which they are put as advancing contrary argument. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. It is necessary first to identify the matters of disagreement. The Pincus Opinion does not dissent from my conclusion that misbehaviour may be determined by Parliament. Unfortunately, it does not separately discuss the position in respect of misbehaviour pertaining to office. Misbehaviour of this sort, namely the improper exercise of judicial functions or wilful neglect of duty or non- attendance, was accepted by me as a matter to be found by proof in appropriate manner to Parliament. By inference, the Pincus Opinion does not demur from my conclusion that matters of these sorts are not predicated upon proof of any contravention of the law. Hence the difference between the opinions is limited to conduct not pertaining to office. My view is that a Parliamentary inquiry is limited to whether there is a contravention of law of the requisite seriousness. The conclusion of the Pincus Opinion [at 27] is that contravention of the law is not a relevant inquiry, it being for Parliament to decide whether 'any conduct alleged against a judge constitutes misbehaviour sufficient to justify removal from office'. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. In paragraph 15 of my opinion I accepted the analysis of Quick and Garran ( at 731)- The substantial distinction between the ordinary tenure of British Judges and the tenure established by this Constitution is that the ordinary tenure is determinable on two conditions; either (1) misbehaviour, or (2) an address from both Houses; whilst under this Constitution the tenure is only determinable on one condition-that of misbehaviour or incapacity-and the address from both Houses is prescribed as the only method by which forfeiture for breach of the condition may be ascertained. </PARA>
<PARA> Quick and Garran (at 733-4), explain the reason for this difference (set out in full in my paragraph 9), namely, that- The peculiar stringency of the provisions for safeguarding the independence of the Federal Justices is a consequence of the federal nature of the Constitution, and the necessity for protecting those who interpret it from the danger of political interference. </PARA>
<PARA> For the reasons stated, I found that it was only misbehaviour falling within the first condition referred to by Quick and Garran which was embraced within the meaning of 'misbehaviour' in section 72. I also accepted that misbehaviour in this sense meant misbehaviour as a breach of condition of office held during good behaviour. Further, as noted above, I expressed the view that the improper exercise of judicial functions, and wilful neglect of duty or non-attendance, were matters which, if established, would constitute misbehaviour, and that for the purposes of section 72 such misbehaviour was not predicated upon proof of any contravention of the law. It was, and remains, my opinion that in matters of misbehaviour not pertaining to office, it is necessary for there to be proved a contravention of the law of the requisite seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. As it does not address itself to the dichotomy between conduct pertaining to office and other conduct, much of the Pincus Opinion is directed to a false issue, namely, to establish that the word 'misbehaviour' in section 72 is not limited to 'proof of an offence'. The true differences seem to be first, that I regard 'misbehaviour' in section 72 as having a meaning limited to behaviour constituting a breach of condition of office held on good behaviour and, secondly, that in respect of misbehaviour not pertaining to office, my opinion is that such misbehaviour may be constituted only by a contravention of the law of the requisite seriousness. The relevant conclusion of the Pincus Opinion seems to be that for all categories of misbehaviour contravention of the law is not a relevant enquiry, and [at 27] that it is for Parliament to decide whether 'any conduct alleged against a judge constitutes misbehaviour sufficient to justify removal from office'. Apparently Parliament is to be guided in the task of enquiry as to whether 'proved misbehaviour' is established by reference to expressions of the sort to be garnered from the Opinion. Including references in authorities cited with approval in the Opinion, these expressions include formulations such as 'notoriously improper', 'misbehave . . . scandalously'), ' get into debt', 'any sort of misbehaviour', 'gross personal immorality or misconduct', 'corruption', 'irregularity in pecuniary transactions', 'moral misbehaviour', 'immorality', 'misconduct', or, as more widely expressed, 'a variety of reprehensible action or inaction, including mere immorality, or commercial misconduct not amounting to the commission of an offence at all' and 'outrageous public behaviour, outside the duties of their office'. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. I confirm in paragraph 5 above my acceptance of the analysis of Quick and Garran which identifies the differences, and the principal reason for the differences, between the tenure of British judges and of Federal judges under the Australian Constitution. My conclusion was that section 72 applies to exclude all modes of removal other than for misbehaviour as a breach of condition of office. Only Parliament may initiate removal by way of address upon the specified ground, namely 'proved misbehaviour'. My argument was not based upon the broad application of the English authorities, either ancient or contemporary. It was based upon the proper construction of the terms of the section itself, aided by what was put as permissible references to both legislative history and to the clear departure of its terms from the then recognised position in respect of the tenure of office of British judges. Hence in a very real sense the matters discussed in the Pincus Opinion under its various headings stand outside the course of the argument which they are intended to attack. In particular, the Opinion neither recognises nor discusses the distinction in British constitutional law between the power to remove for misbehaviour as a breach of condition of office held on good behaviour, and the open-textured ground for removal upon address of both Houses of Parliament. For this reason, it is bordering upon irrelevant to engage in a detailed rebuttal of many of the points sought to be made in the Opinion. However some criticisms and observations usefully may be made. I follow the order of the sub-headings of the Pincus Opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. UNITED STATES [13-16]. I do not read the Pincus Opinion as itself drawing strength from American law. As I neither referred to nor relied upon American doctrine, it is curious that the Opinion first discusses the United States Constitution, particularly as this leads to the conclusion [at 16] that 'it gives no support to the view expressed by the Solicitor General'. Neither does it support the Pincus Opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> 9. The Opinion contrasts the phrase 'Treason, Bribery and other High Crimes and Misdemeanours' in Article II, section 4 of the United States Constitution with the word 'misbehaviour' in section 72, to suggest that this 'simple word' was intended to be used without technical meaning. In its context, this comment is impermissable. It is clear that the word 'misbehaviour' as used in section 72 is derived from English constitutional law, and that it is not used in contrast with the terms of the American Constitution dealing with impeachment. Rather it is framed in conscious contrast with the law of judicial tenure in Britain. Secondly, and somewhat inconsistently with the first point, the Pincus Opinion also relies upon the alleged circumstance that the particular phrase in Article II has been read with a wider meaning than its terms suggest. If the Opinion here seeks to infer that if an equivalent to the American expression, such as ' treason, bribery, and other felonies and misdemeanours', appeared in section 72 it would be held to have a meaning wider than the commission of an offence, such a suggestion must be rejected out of hand. I comment also that the decision of Ritter v. U.S. referred to [at 15] has no relevance: the note at 300 U.S. 668 merely says that a petition for a writ of certiorari was denied, without reasons , and the report of the Court of Claims below, (1936) 84 Ct. Cls. 293, deals with the quite different point of whether proceedings in the Senate could be the subject of judicial review. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. We are concerned with the meaning of 'proved misbehaviour' in section 72 of our Constitution. American constitutional law furnishes no relevant learning. This is more obviously so in respect of the construction of section 72 than in respect of other parts of the Constitution where there is less divergence, both in word and context, between the two Constitutions: see generally Attorney- General (Cth); Ex rel. McKinlay v. Commonwealth (1975) 135 C.L.R. 1, 24, 47; Australian Conservation Foundation v. Commonwealth (1978-1980) 146 C.L.R. 493, 530 and Attorney-General (Vict.); Ex. rel. Black v. Commonwealth (1981) 146 C.L. R. 559, 578-9, 598-9, 603, 609 and 652. Hence I put the American authorities on one side. They are of no assistance. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. ENGLAND [16-19]. As has already been said, the failure of the Pincus Opinion to recognise the distinction between removal in cases of breach of condition of office held during good behaviour and the power of Parliament to address upon grounds not necessarily arising from a breach of such condition destroys the relevance of the discussion of English law which leads to the general conclusion that no offence need be proved to establish misbehaviour. The cases of Judge Kenrick, [discussed at 16], concerned a judge facing charges of misconduct in the House of Commons. The two cases are not reported in the Law Reports, but in (1825) 13 Parl. Deb., 2nd Ser. and (1826) 14 Parl. Deb., 2nd Ser . The allegations clearly involved criminal offences, but as the matter was before Parliament a breach of the law was not required to be established. For this reason, the quotation from Shetreet, Judges on Trial (1976), 143, [at 16], which deals with whether misconduct of a judge in his private life justified the address for removal, is unexceptionable. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. The Pincus Opinion [at 17] goes on to make one of its several references to the supposed intention of the founding fathers or the draftsmen of the section: 'If the draftsmen of our Constitution knew of the practice of the English Parliament with respect to removal of judges, and intended to depart from it so significantly, it is remarkable that they made that intention so unclear'. In other parts of his Opinion Pincus also seeks to draw strength from negative surmise of intention; for example, at 14, 18-19, 22, 25 and 26. With respect, it must be said that such references do not advance argument; they more stand in substitution for it. In this particular aspect, I comment that in drawing section 72 the draftsmen made intention abundantly clear. When the conditions for tenure in England, as they were understood by the founding fathers, are contrasted with the terms of section 72 the intention of the draftsmen is made quite clear by the specific departures from English law. First, the section excludes all modes of removal other than that for misbehaviour as a breach of condition of office and, secondly, it makes Parliament the sole repository of the power to address upon the ground of such misbehaviour. As a further limitation, the misbehaviour is required to be 'proved'. This is the distinction recognised and stated by Quick and Garran, (set out in paragraph 5 above). In this aspect, it is difficult to suggest that the terms of section 72 could be framed in a manner more directly to distance the Australian provision from the English position. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. As I merely made passing reference in paragraph 14 of my opinion to R. v. Richardson, when discussing the meaning of the expression 'infamous offence', the Pincus Opinion [at 17-18 and 21] also addresses a false issue by seeking to establish that this case does not bear upon the removal of English judges. (My discussion of what is 'infamous offence' is taken up in paragraphs 19 and 20 to lead to my conclusion that the relevant quality of contravention of the general law in respect of misbehaviour not pertaining to office is whether it is 'of such a nature as to warrant the conclusion that the incumbent is unfit to exercise the office'. Discussion of Richardson in the Pincus Opinion does not touch upon this conclusion). </PARA>
<PARA> 14. For the reason stated in paragraph 12 above, I agree with the Pincus Opinion [at 19] in its comment that when they framed section 72 what the founding fathers had in mind as to the law about the removal of judges was English practice in the 19th century. Where we differ is in our statement of the relevant law in respect of judicial tenure in England, and in our recognition of the effect of the clear departures from the English position which are embraced by the terms of the section. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. The Privy Council-Colonial Judges [19-22]. Although the issue of the Privy Council and colonial judges is separately discussed by Pincus, there is little reason to suppose that the draftsmen of our Constitution had any particular regard to the position of colonial judges up to the mid-nineteenth century. The tenure of colonial judges, including the judges of the Australian colonies before responsible Government, was much less secure than for English judges. For this reason I doubt very much the relevance of the Opinion's consideration of the peculiar position of colonial judges before the 1850's. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. Even if relevant, the discussion under this heading does not take the argument of the Pincus Opinion any distance; indeed to the contrary. The authorities referred to very much support the distinctions made in my opinion. Willis v. Gipps [at 19-20] is concerned with the requirement that a judge be given an opportunity to be heard before removal. Although the facts are not set out in Moore's Reports, the conduct of Willis as a judge in the District of Port Phillip are matters of common historical knowledge: see, for example, B. A. Keon -Cohen, John Walpole Willis: First Resident Judge in Victoria (1972) 8 M.U.L.R. 703 and A. C. Castles, An Australian Legal History (1982), 239-243. The allegations against Willis were very much in respect of conduct pertaining to office, and hence misbehaviour within the meaning of section 2 of Burke's Act. Upon this statutory ground, no contravention of the general law was required to be established. The interjection of Parke B. [referred to at 20] is not relevant to the issue of whether misbehaviour not pertaining to office is predicated upon breach of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. The 1849 case of Montagu [discussed at 20-21] does not take matters any further. There always are dangers in seeking to establish a decision's authority by reference to successful counsel's argument. I contrast the comment of Deane J . in Hammond v. Commonwealth (1982) 42 A.L.R. 327, 341. What next follows after the quotation from Thesiger Q.C. [referred to by Pincus at 20] is a submission which makes it clear that his submission was that the case was one of misbehaviour pertaining to office- The Appellant having first put his lawful creditor in a situation which compelled him to sue for his debt in a Court of Justice, avails himself of his judicial station in that Court, being the only Court in which the action could be brought, to prevent the recovery of the debt, which he admitted to be due; this is an act impeding the administration, and thereby defeating the ends of justice, and was such a gross act of misbehaviour in his office, as amply to justify his removal. Secondly, it appears, from the evidence, that the various pecuniary embarrassments of the Appellant, while sitting as a Judge, in a Court composed of only two Judges, and necessarily requiring the presence of both, for the determination of all cases brought before it, were such as to be wholly inconsistent with the due and unsuspected administration of justice in that Court, and tended to bring into distrust and disrepute the judicial office in the Colony. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence each of the two grounds embraced by the quotation set out in the Pincus Opinion fairly is characterised as misbehaviour pertaining to office. On the underlying issue of misbehaviour, the decision was, in the judgment of Lord Brougham (at 499), that on 'the facts appearing before the Governor and Executive Council, as established before their Lordships, in that case, there were sufficient grounds for the motion of Mr. Montagu'. These facts are not set out in length in the report, but, as has been said, the submissions of Thesiger make it clear that they went to establish misbehaviour pertaining to office. As such, it did not, of course, require contravention of the law to constitute misbehaviour within section 2 of the Act. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. The Memorandum of the Lords of the Council on the Removal of Colonial Judges, [constituting an appendix to 6 Moore N.S. and relied upon at 21-22] in no way supports the view that gross personal immorality is sufficient to justify removal as misbehaviour within the meaning of section 2 of the Act. What is clearly recognised in this Memorandum is the distinction between 'amotion' pursuant to the Act, upon which there was an appeal to the Queen in Council, and the separate and prerogative process whereby (whether with or without an order for suspension by the Colonial Governor), the issue of removal may be referred, upon Petition to the Queen, to the Privy Council for determination. This latter procedure was the colonial equivalent to the Parliamentary power to address for removal. In the Memorandum it is regarded as an exercise of a species of original jurisdiction, contrasted with the separate jurisdiction to hear appeals against actual removal pursuant to section 2 of Burke's Act. Of course the power of the Privy Council to act in its original jurisdiction was not limited to any narrow grounds of misbehaviour constituting breach of condition of good behaviour, and, for that reason, in cases not pertaining to office it was not tied to alleged contravention of the law. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. There is a similar mixture of discussion in Lord Chelmsford's observations [referred to at 21-22]. The short statement of Lord Chelmsford merely adds some general comments to the Memorandum. It deals with both the appellate jurisdiction of the Privy Council under the Act and the original jurisdiction outside it. Lord Chelmsford accepts that a judge may be suspended pending the exercise of the original jurisdiction. The sentence after next to that quoted [ at 22] is- Such serious cases ought to be brought before the Privy Council, either by appeal on the part of the removed or suspended Judge, or upon the recommendation of the Secretary of State. </PARA>
<PARA> Hence the remarks are apt to cover both conduct constituting a breach of condition of office and other conduct which may justify petition to the Privy Council (either with or without suspension), analogous to the English Parliamentary power to address. Moreover, Dr. Lushington, who gave an opinion immediately after Lord Chelmsford, stated that the procedure of suspension and reference to the Privy Council in its original jurisdiction is appropriate in cases of the sort discussed. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. In the result the Memorandum has little relevance to the proper construction of section 72. If it is an authority for anything, it supports the distinctions made in my opinion. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. Convention debates [22-24]. As has been said, the meaning of section 72 is to be derived from the construction of its terms, standing within Chapter III and the Constitution as a whole, and having regard to the extent to which it provides that judicial tenure under the Constitution differs from tenure of British judges under English constitutional law. As is picked up in paragraphs 10 and 11 of my opinion, legislative history casts permissible light upon meaning. This does not mean that too much is to be constructed from selective quotation of the Convention Debates. The references made in paragraphs 12 and 17 of my opinion were for the limited (and, as was suggested, also permissible) purpose of ascertaining the mischief to be remedied. The identified mischief was the perceived necessity adequately to safeguard the independence of the judiciary as an essential feature of the Federation established by the Constitution. It does not further the task of construction to speculate [as does the Pincus Opinion at 22] that there may have been a silent majority of delegates in disagreement with those who spoke. </PARA>
<PARA> 22. Clearly it was the primary concern of Mr Isaacs, both at the Adelaide Convention (20th April 1897) and at Melbourne (31st January 1898) to ensure that a decision of Parliament to address for removal should not be challengeable. It was at the Melbourne Convention that Isaacs accepted the amendment to add 'upon the ground of misbehaviour or incapacity'. Isaacs then accepted (Conv. Deb. at 313) that 'to remove any misconception, these words should be added, so that the Houses may show that they are not attempting to remove a Judge for anything but misbehaviour or incapacity'. His concern (also at 313) was to ensure that in the exercise of the power so limited, Parliament's decision should not be amenable to review- I want to lay it down distinctly that a Judge shall not be removed under any circumstances, except for misbehaviour or incapacity; but I want the verdict of Parliament-the verdict of the States House by itself, the verdict of the people's House by itself, the conjoint, independent and separate verdicts of these two Houses to be final and unchallengeable. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course the speeches and the opinions of Isaacs, and any other delegate, are not determinative of meaning. Reference to them merely is confirmatory of what is comprehended upon construction of the terms of section 72 itself, namely that it is for Parliament alone to address for removal, but upon the limited ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. The Pincus Opinion [at 23] asserts that what is referred to as a critical sentence of Todd (set out in my opinion, paragraph 5) commencing 'Misbehaviour includes . . .' is hardly suggestive of an exhaustive definition. In its context , I disagree. Todd was there seeking to define misbehaviour constituting breach of condition of office granted during good behaviour which would support the exercise of the power of removal without address of Parliament. In other words, he sought to define the content of the first condition of office referred to by Quick and Garran (set out in paragraph 5 above). As he was seeking to mark out the limits of the amenability of a judge to removal by the Crown without address from Parliament, there is no reason to suppose that his statement was intended to be anything else but exhaustive. This particularly must be so in the circumstance that conduct not constituting breach of condition of office was nonetheless subject to address by Parliament on grounds which were required neither to pertain to office nor to arise from any alleged contravention of the law. It was this power of Parliament which Todd [at 860, quoted in my paragraph 6 and by Pincus (quoting Isaacs) at 23] described as one which 'may be invoked upon occasions when the misbehaviour complained of would not constitute a legal breach of the conditions on which the office is held'. Having acknowledged that the power to address for removal was not dependent upon misbehaviour pertaining to office or contravention of the law, it cannot be supposed that in the context of discussion of the power to remove for breach of condition of office, Todd contemplated the existence of an unspecified fourth or wider category of misbehaviour in addition to the three categories stated in his definition. There simply is no basis for inference that Todd embraced the possibility of any wider meaning of misbehaviour as part of the Crown's power to remove for breach of condition. </PARA>
<PARA> 24. For the reasons stated, I also disagree with the comment in the Pincus Opinion [at 24] that it is a misapprehension to say that at the end of the 19th century the notion of judicial misbehaviour justifying removal from office had some received technical meaning. Misbehaviour, as a breach of what Quick and Garren refer to as the first condition of office, did have a technical meaning. In England, and in the Australian States, the Parliamentary discretion to address for removal remained at large. As has been seen, both British judges and colonial judges were amenable to removal for misbehaviour as a breach of condition of office; they were also liable to removal for some wider ground (not necessarily related to breach of the law) which would not constitute breach of the term for office held during good behaviour. The Pincus Opinion [at 24] does not take this matter any further by reference to what Mr. Wise said at the Adelaide debates. The comment in the Opinion is based upon a misconception. In any event, at 945, Mr. Wise makes it clear that here he was referring to the power of removing on address from both Houses, where, of course, to use the expression of the Pincus Opinion, 'no criminal conduct was necessary'. </PARA>
<PARA> 25. GENERAL [24-27]. Contrary to what the Pincus Opinion states [at 24], it is not the case that a conclusion has been drawn 'too readily' that the use of the word 'misbehaviour' was intended to incorporate the law as to the removal of judges in England prior to the Act of Settlement of 1700, whether by reference to Coke or otherwise. My opinion draws no such conclusion by reference to the law of removal prior to 1700. As has been seen, what is contrasted with the terms of section 72 is the law in respect of the tenure of British judges, as it was seen when section 72 was drafted, and the obvious points of departure of section 72 from this law. </PARA>
<PARA> 26. The Pincus Opinion [at 25] invites what is described as the 'safer course', namely, 'to come to the Constitution unaided by any authority, in the first place, and see if there is an ambiguity'. I readily accept that the words of section 72 should be construed within their context in Chapter III and the Constitution as a whole. The terms of section 72 do not stand alone. As the Pincus Opinion [at 25] points out for a contrary purpose, one is assisted in construing section 72 by the fact that it is the Justices of the High Court, and of other Federal Courts, who are being spoken of. To paraphrase the expression of the Opinion 'when one keeps the subject matter in mind' the limiting operation of section 72 becomes clear. Its interpretation is to be built upon the foundation of its context within the Constitution, as a whole, and recognition of the section's obvious and deliberate departure from the terms of judicial tenure under the British Constitution. Those differences are confirmed by the history of the section. As has been said, the reasons for section 72 being drawn to enhance the security of judicial tenure are sufficiently summarised by Quick and Garran, at 733-4 (referred to in paragraph 5 above). In essence, the Pincus Opinion concludes that Parliament may address for removal upon a ground defined upon its whim. The existence of such power would be destructive of the status and independence of the High Court as the independent interpreters of the Constitution and the Federation established by it. The example of the Pincus Opinion of a Judge becoming involved in political activities is inapposite. The relevant enquiry is whether the conduct complained of either constitutes misconduct pertaining to office or a contravention of the law of the requisite seriousness. </PARA>
<PARA> 27. On the only occasion [at 26] where it refers to the principle, the Pincus opinion seems to accept that for breach of condition of good behaviour conduct outside official duties requires proof of conviction. The Opinion gives three grounds to support the view that this doctrine does not govern the use of the word 'misbehaviour' in section 72. In my view, none of these reasons sustains the load which Pincus seeks it to bear. </PARA>
<PARA> (1) Pincus asserts that both in England and the colonies before 1900 it is clear that the power to remove for judicial misconduct was not so confined. The answer to this is that in England before 1900 breach of condition of good behaviour was so confined; the quite separate power of Parliament to address always was unrelated to the issue of breach of condition of good behaviour. The position of the colonies is not particularly relevant on this aspect; although, as has been seen, the application of Burke's Act leads to the same result. </PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Opinion asserts that the language of section 72 makes it clear that conviction is not necessary in respect of conduct outside office. This assertion highlights the fact that the Pincus Opinion nowhere acknowledges that the requirement of section 72 is for 'proved' misbehaviour. The Opinion does not concede that there is any work to be done by this word to enhance the operation of the section. It is section 72 itself which requires an address of Parliament upon the ground of 'proved' misbehaviour. It must be that what is to be proved is to have some content. My view is that this requires the finding of grounds which constitute misbehaviour as a breach of condition of office held during good behaviour. It is difficult to comprehend that the proper meaning of the requirement for 'proved misbehaviour' is to be fixed by reference to undefined conduct left subjectively at large. The requirement for 'proved misbehaviour' does not rest easily with assertions that matters such as 'immorality', 'moral misbehaviour', 'a variety of reprehensible action or inaction, including mere immorality, or commercial misconduct not a mounting to the commission of an offence at all', or 'outrageous public behaviour, outside the duties of their office' are amenable to proof as misbehaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Pincus Opinion suggests that it 'would have been foolish to leave Parliament powerless to remove a judge guilty of misbehaviour outside his duties , as long as an offence could not be proved'. (This is a variation of what is stated [at 25] with respect to 'outrageous public behaviour'). The Opinion asserts that this remark 'applies particularly to the High Court, which was to occupy a position at the pinnacle of the Australian Court system, and to exercise a delicate function in supervising compliance with the requirements of the Constitution on the part of the legislatures'. </PARA>
<PARA> Apart from begging the question as to what is misbehaviour, this comment ignores the obvious operation of section 72 to give direct effect to the principle that the judiciary should be secure in their independence from control by the legislature and the executive. Far from being a proper assumption that it was intended that a Justice of the High Court should be amenable to removal for undefined reasons relating to behaviour 'outside his duties', it is the position of the High Court in the Australian Constitutional structure which both explains and confirms the limitations which seem to be clearly enough embraced by the terms of section 72 itself. It is the antithesis of the recognition of the High Court as the arbiters of the Constitution to concede that there is a general power to control the composition of the Court by the application of an undefined power in Parliament to address for removal. </PARA>
<PARA> 28. As to this aspect of the argument, I do not understand the relevance of the dialogue between Messrs. Isaacs and Barton (with the delegates playing chorus) extracted [at 27] for the stated purpose of 'casting doubt on the theory that there was an intention to limit the plain words of s.72 by ancient technical rules'. Far from modifying the words of section 72 by reference to ancient technical rules, it is the plain words of section 72 which alter the terms of judicial tenure existing in English law. Be that as it may, the dialogue itself is relevant only to the result which (as is noted in paragraph 22 above) Isaacs was anxious to ensure, namely, that it was for Parliament alone to determine the issue of misbehaviour. The dialogue says nothing relevant to the proper meaning of 'proved misbehaviour'. </PARA>
<PARA> 29. Hence in as much as the argument of Pincus is intended there to be drawn together [at 26-27], it is suggested that the maters relied upon are destructive of the conclusion that the requirement for 'proved misbehaviour' in section 72 is not limited to that which would constitute breach of condition of office held during good behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> 30. The Pincus Opinion does not demonstrate error. This is not surprising for, as has been noted, it turns away from discussion of the mtters which I found determinative of the proper construction of section 72. My reconsideration of these matters goes to confirm my earlier opinion that, for proved misbehaviour in matters not pertaining to office, section 72 requires proof of contravention of the law of the requisite seriousness. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) has put down a most important, but I regret to say, disappointing statement in regard to the report of the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge which was tabled in this chamber a little over a week ago. The statement of the Attorney covers a lot of matters of serious legal and constitutional importance. I believe it is necessary to study them carefully. Certainly, in the time that has been available since notice was given of this statement, it has not been possible for me at least to study the supplemental opinion of the Solicitor-General which has just been incorporated. Of course, that opinion covers ground of which we are very familiar. I think the issues have now become fairly clear in relation to the question of what amounts to misbehaviour. I feel that the Attorney's response and proposals very much turn on the view of the Solicitor-General which the Attorney has adopted. He adopted the Solicitor-General's view in the first place in February and March this year, and he is adopting it again today. Of course, that is a very narrow view of misbehaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My view is very well known. It was expressed in this chamber in debates earlier this year and in an article which was published in a number of newspapers earlier this year. That view has been supported by the counsel who was retained by the Committee, Mr Pincus; namely, that the word 'misbehaviour'- the aspects and problems associated with it because of the word 'proved' are another matter-in the Constitution has a wider significance than it does in the view which has been adopted in this debate by the Attorney-General. As I said in the course of my remarks, I think it will become clear that the Attorney's response has been very much dictated by the continuing narrow view that he and, admittedly, the Solicitor-General adopt in this regard. I want to make it quite clear that the Opposition has never accepted that view. The view that the Opposition has put has now been supported by the opinion of Mr Pincus and numbers of other people who have commented on this whole problem. We will certainly maintain that wider view of misbehaviour.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In earlier debates in this chamber I referred to a view of judicial conduct by Sir Winston Churchill in 1954 and was rubbished by the Attorney-General for my pains in doing so. In fact, in this Senate on 29 April 1980 the Attorney-General , then shadow Attorney-General, in moving a motion for the establishment of a select committee to look into the alleged conduct of the then Chief Justice of the High Court, also quoted Sir Winston Churchill as to the standards of judicial behaviour that are required. I propose to quote Sir Winston Churchill again, with the authority of the Attorney-General himself, despite the comments that he made earlier this year, when he must have forgotten his quotation. On 29 April 1980 the Attorney-General said:</PARA>
<PARA> In that respect I rely on no less a presence than Sir Winston Churchill who, according to Shetreet-</PARA>
<PARA>another author he did not think much of earlier this year, honourable senators may remember-</PARA>
<PARA>said in the House of Commons in 1954-</PARA>
<PARA>about judicial life-</PARA>
<PARA> A form of life and conduct far more severe and restricted than that of ordinary people is required from judges and, though unwritten, has been most strictly observed. They are at once privileged and restricted. They have to present a continuous aspect of dignity and conduct. </PARA>
<PARA> Far more freedom is granted by the convention of our way of life to Members of Parliament, to Ministers or to Privy Councillors . . . The judges have to maintain, though free from criticisms [in parliament], a far more rigorous standard than is required from any other class that I know of in this Realm. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="8G4">Senator DURACK</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. That is a view of judicial standards and way of life which we on this side have adopted at all times in this debate, and we will continue to do so. I am very glad that since we last debated the subject the Attorney- General has adopted that same standard-at least he did in 1980. However, he now quite clearly adopts a very much more restricted standard. In this statement he makes a very surprising comment in relation to this standard. On page 5 of the statement, in dealing with the issue of what is meant by 'misbehaviour', under the sub-heading 'Proper Approach to Section 72', and having quoted Quick and Garran on the subject, he says:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Some classes of 'misbehaviour' may not be subsumed by the approach of Quick and Garran-for example, partisan political activity or notorious private behaviour not directly related to, or affecting, the conduct of judicial office. So be it.</PARA>
<PARA>'So be it', says the Attorney-General. He says that misbehaviour does not comprehend partisan political activity or notorious private behaviour not directly related to the office. How can anyone in this chamber or any thinking citizen in this country, adopt a standard of judicial behaviour which excludes the Parliament from considering partisan political activity in relation to the future of a judge? What chamber of Parliament in this country would ever tolerate judges engaging in partisan political activity? It is really an absurd notion. Certainly, the fathers and founders of our Constitution when they used the word 'misbehaviour' as they did in their convention debates on that subject, would not have tolerated for one minute this restricted attitude and understanding of judicial conduct and behaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> As I said, the approach of the Attorney-General at all times and again in this statement is entirely coloured-dictated, one might say, by that very narrow approach to this subject. The question that he addresses here is a problem which he has endeavoured to prevent this Parliament from considering. His whole approach from the first day that this Parliament sat in February this year, the day that he came into this Senate with his statement on the subject of the Age tapes, as it has been known, has been a very definite attempt to stifle any further consideration of the subject by this Parliament. He did his very best to heavy this chamber from the word go. His response today again is an attempt to divert the course of this chamber from its responsibilities and its duties in relation to this matter. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to quote another thing that the Attorney said earlier this year in debates and in response to questions in relation to this matter. On 2 March, only a couple of days after this debate commenced this year, in answer to a question from Senator Reid, the Attorney said:</PARA>
<PARA> I really believe that the Opposition has drained the last drop out of this matter concerning the judge. </PARA>
<PARA>On 2 March the Attorney was desperately trying to stop any further consideration of this whole subject. I ask the Senate: Where would we be today if we had adopted that attitude of the Attorney-General? We certainly would not have the problem, but we would not have these allegations which had been heavily resting in Mr Briese's mind for so long. The Senate Committee gave Mr Briese the opportunity to bring forward this very serious matter which the Committee has considered, and the appropriate approach which it is now the responsibility of this chamber to determine. There is no suggestion by the Attorney-General in this statement that no problem has to be faced. He recognises that the problem exists, yet the attitude that he took before would have prevented this information being brought forward. Page 7 of the Attorney-General's statement reads:</PARA>
<PARA> The seriousness of this offence and the clear division of opinion in the Committee have led the government to conclude that further action of some kind needs to be taken to clear the air, and to remove the cloud hanging over the Judge and the High Court. The question is what. </PARA>
<PARA>It is interesting to see the way the Attorney-General puts it-'to clear the air' . That does not necessarily mean to have a full investigation of the matter, but simply to clear the air. That is important, but it is also important that we use the right approach and have the truth fully determined. At least the attitude of the Attorney-General in September is some improvement on his attitude in March, when he did not want anything done by the Senate. At least he recognises now that something has to be pursued seriously and determined. So in six months there has been some advance in the attitude of the Attorney-General, disappointing though this statement is. </PARA>
<PARA> As the Attorney recognises in this statement, the responsibility for this issue rests with the Parliament. It does not rest with the courts. It certainly does not rest with the Executive. It rests with the Parliament. As I understood it, in debates earlier this year the Attorney-General did ultimately recognise that. He certainly recognises it in this statement, but he again takes a half-hearted approach in that his attitude is that as far as possible the Parliament, and the Senate in particular, should keep out of it. The proposal he is making is for reference to the Director of Public Prosecutions of the Senate Committee evidence and the allegations of Mr Briese. </PARA>
<PARA> The Senate will remember that the Attorney, when he came into this chamber in February to try to heavy us not to take any action in this matter, armed himself with two opinions, which he tabled. One was from the Solicitor-General and the other was from the Director of Public Prosecutions. The Director of Public Prosecutions, who admittedly at that stage did not have the Briese material, formed views about the meaning of misbehaviour. He formed views about the Age tapes and the alleged conduct they involved. So he has already been involved in this matter. The Director of Public Prosecutions, although an independent statutory officer, is subject to the directions of the Attorney-General under his statute. He is an officer of the executive side of government, as is the Solicitor-General. </PARA>
<PARA> What was the attitude of Senator Evans two years ago when he called for the tabling of documents related to the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union in the bottom of the harbour tax avoidance matter? He called for the opinion of Mr Brinsden and for a police report on a particular case. The Government of the day said that it would not table those documents because they might affect the course of possible criminal proceedings-a very clear ground for exemption under the Freedom of Information Act and under Executive privilege. The Government of the day produced an opinion of the then Solicitor-General, but Senator Evans and the then Opposition were not prepared to accept the opinion of an executive officer of the Government, namely the Solicitor-General. They proposed an independent person to handle that matter and to advise on whether those documents had that effect. Certainly, on that precedent, there is some reason why this chamber should be somewhat doubtful about the Attorney's suggestion, in effect, that it should be left to Mr Temby to decide whether there should be a prosecution. I do not believe that it is satisfactory for the Senate chamber, or for any parliamentary chamber, simply to put such a matter in the hands of an executive official. </PARA>
<PARA> Of course, there are many other reasons why that is not a satisfactory course. The question that Mr Temby will again be asked to determine is whether there should be a prosecution; that is, whether there has been, or may have been, on the evidence, a criminal offence which should be prosecuted. As I have said, that is not the real question before the Senate in this matter. The question is whether a judge has been guilty of misbehaviour. One will see from Mr Pincus's opinion that that is the way he addresses this question. A criminal offence may also be involved, but that is a separate question. Whether or not a person is to be prosecuted involves a number of considerations, which the Attorney-General sets out in this statement. A prosecutor has to take into account a number of considerations in deciding whether to prosecute. A decision not to prosecute may not resolve the issue, and the Attorney does concede that in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Temby is only a prosecutor. He does not have any investigative or coercive powers. He does not investigate; he simply looks at the material and makes a judgment about whether, on that material, it is appropriate to prosecute. He gives a purely legal opinion. We want resolved the question of judgment on who ought to be believed. </PARA>

What are the facts relevant to the question of misbehaviour, not to a breach of the Crimes Act? They are different questions. Different powers are required. Different questions have to be answered and, of course, it is very likely that different standards of proof will be involved.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Ultimately this question may well be decided on Mr Temby's attitude. I am pleased to note that Mr Temby has understood the problem in a way which the Attorney-General has not understood it. The other day, when the original suggestion was put to him by Senator Tate, Mr Temby is reported as saying very firmly:</PARA>
<PARA> It is not my function to help solve the problems of politicians, whatever their persuasion may be. </PARA>
<PARA>Obviously, Mr Temby clearly understands the problem he would face if the matter were referred to him. He clearly understands that it is not an appropriate function for him; that it is a function for the Parliament, or for the politicians, as he referred to them. </PARA>
<PARA> Those are the inadequacies of that proposal. The Government's response is most disappointing. The Government wants this matter resolved quickly but in fact suggests a process which may only prolong it. The Attorney concedes that ultimately there may well be a role for a Senate committee-either the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge or a reconstituted committee. It is well known that Senator Chipp and I have suggested that a most satisfactory way of handling this would be to have an independent parliamentary commissioner resolve it. I agree that that would be the most satisfactory way of resolving these disputed questions of fact, with the commissioner then making a recommendation to the Parliament as to what the facts are. </PARA>

The Government's co-operation would be required to resolve the questions of fact in that way. That action will certainly not resolve the whole question; the Senate must decide whether there was misbehaviour, on the facts, and whether any other action is justified. The disputed questions of fact must be determined by an independent person with-I agree with the Attorney-General-greater expertise than we as parliamentarians have.

In the absence of any sign of co-operation by the Government, on behalf of the Opposition I give notice that I shall move a motion calling for the constitution of a select committee to deal with Mr Briese's allegations and to make a finding of fact with respect to them. The select committee should consist of three honourable senators-one from the Government, one from the Opposition and one from the Australian Democrats. The real nub of the committee is that it will have the power to appoint a commissioner who will conduct the formal hearing for which Mr Hughes asked on behalf of his client.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As I said, it would be preferable if the Government co-operated. If the Government really were willing to resolve the substance of this matter and really believed, as we do, that a substantial matter must be resolved, it would co-operate in establishing a form of parliamentary commission. In the absence of that commission, the only way in which the matter can be resolved is by reconstituting a Senate committee. The Senate can give that committee the power to appoint a commissioner. Formally the powers would have to be exercised by a committee. We would obtain a man or woman of sufficient stature with the necessary expertise and time to devote to resolving the questions of fact and reporting the finding to this chamber. Our powers would in no way be taken away by that process. That would be the only way in which we could ensure that the disputed facts are resolved in accordance with the ordinary principles of natural justice. As I said, I agree entirely with the submissions made on behalf of the judge by his counsel. If those measures were undertaken we could satisfy all of those requirements and the matter could proceed in the right way. That is also the appropriate way in which to obtain the expedition that the Attorney- General says he desires. That process will certainly be a case of this chamber exercising its powers to resolve the very difficult problem that has arisen and has resulted in the division of opinion in the previous Committee. Those measures are entirely consistent with the proper resolution of the matter by the only body that can, as the law stands, resolve it in the end. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME><ELECTORATE>(South Australia)</ELECTORATE><TIME.STAMP>(4.16)</TIME.STAMP></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Democrats are, as I hope is every other honourable senator, acutely aware of the importance of not only today's debate but the issue with which the debate is concerned and the responsibility to resolve this matter that rests not just with the Australian Democrats-a group of five-or even with 64 honourable senators but with the Parliament as a whole. I do not intend to cover ground already covered by the reports of the Senate Select Committee on the Conduct of a Judge or to debate the various findings contained in them. Nor do I intend to canvass abstruse legal or constitutional issues. A plethora of conflicting opinions already exists about the way in which section 72 of the Australian Constitution should be interpreted, particularly the meaning of the words 'proved misbehaviour'. Yet another opinion is not necessary. Suffice it to say, I believe-I believe that my opinion is shared by many others-that the issue is not as black and white or, as Senator Durack said, as narrow as the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) seemed to indicate in his statement.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I and my Party are firmly convinced that this is not so much a question of whether the judge committed a criminal offence or even whether he is liable to be convicted of such an offence but rather a question of whether the behaviour shown in the allegations made by Mr Briese is such as to render questionable the judge's fitness to remain in a position in the highest court in this country. The issue is that the community must have and must be able to retain the fullest confidence in members of the judiciary at all levels. The Australian people are entitled to expect exemplary behaviour of the judiciary. I think that Senator Durack's point is one to which we should pay close attention. </PARA>
<PARA> Very grave allegations have been made against Mr Justice Murphy. They cannot be allowed to remain unanswered or publicly unresolved. That aspect is particularly important, given Mr Briese's status. As my colleague Senator Chipp said in the Senate on 24 August:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . a man of acknowledged substance in the community, the Chairman of the Bench of Stipendiary Magistrates of the largest State in the nation, had made allegations of the gravest and most serious nature on oath on two occasions . . . The overwhelming impression which was left with me was that he did not resile in any way from the grave and serious allegations that the judge had approached him with the intention to attempt to pervert the course of justice in one of the courts of New South Wales in a matter which involved a Federal criminal offence.</PARA>
<PARA>On the other hand, we all know that the judge, in his wisdom, has consistently declined to be cross-examined on the allegations or on his unsworn statement denying them. The Senate Committee, not surprisingly, was unable to reach a unanimous decision on the question of whether there had been 'proved misbehaviour' under section 72 of the Constitution or even whether a prima facie case could be made against the judge. Therefore I would have to agree with the Attorney-General that it is pointless to reconstitute a Senate committee of inquiry, given that three reports came from the original committee. </PARA>
<PARA> At the moment I do not want to discuss the contents of those reports-they are, after all, readily available and I think very well known-except to make the point that Senator Chipp's report argued strongly that insufficient evidence had been put before the Committee to enable any member of that Committee to come to a clear and definite conclusion. Indeed, the work of the Committee was, it has been suggested, significantly handicapped by the fact that Mr Justice Murphy consistently refused to appear before the Committee either to make a sworn statement or to be cross-examined on a written statement. Furthermore, Senator Chipp's attempt to use Senate procedures to summon the judge was not supported by a majority of the members of the Committee. The Committee was therefore in a position not unlike that of a jury faced with an unsworn statement by the accused in a trial. </PARA>
<PARA> All of this puts the Parliament in a particularly invidious position. To do nothing after the tabling of two dissenting reports is unthinkable. It is unfair to the judge and to the Australian public and an abrogation of the Parliament's responsibility to the people. Section 72 of the Constitution places the decision firmly with the Parliament. Whatever else can be argued, that fact is not open to debate. There is no question in my mind that there is a need for further action to be taken on this matter. The question, of course, as the Attorney- General has said, is what action. </PARA>
<PARA> It is vitally important that whatever moves are undertaken by the Senate today must lead to an inquiry which is beyond party politics. I cannot stress that point enough. It is essential that the inquiry be totally divorced from both the overt and covert political arenas. For that reason the Australian Democrats do not believe that the reconstitution of a Senate committee is appropriate, particularly in an election year. For a similar reason we do not believe that a reference of the matter to the Director of Public Prosecutions is acceptable. While I do not question in any way-I stress this-the integrity of Mr Ian Temby, QC, the fact remains that he is an appointee of the current Government and would be placed in an awkward position at best if asked to examine the evidence brought before the Committee and to come to a definitive conclusion about the culpability of the judge, given his limited investigative resources and lack of coercive powers. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That does not surprise me at all. After all he would be in a position similar to that of the Senate Committee in that he could only make a judgment on the balance of sworn evidence given by Mr Briese and the unsworn written statements from Mr Justice Murphy. Therefore it is my belief and that of my party that the only appropriate course of action is for the Senate to establish a three-member parliamentary commission. I do not subscribe to the Attorney-General's argument that this is out of the question because it has no precedent. There is, after all, a first time for everything or precedents would never be established. Neither do I believe, as the Attorney-General appears to believe, that it is too difficult to provide such a commission with the powers and protection for it to function effectively. For the first time set a precedent, Senator Gareth Evans. The provision of a commission with powers and protection can be achieved through legislation. Furthermore the Australian Democrats believe that the selection and appointment of the three commissioners referred to by me a moment ago should take place on the basis of consensus reached among the Government, the Opposition and the Australian Democrats. I would have thought, given consistent comments by the Prime Minister (Mr Hawke) over the last year and a half, that it would not be impossible for that sort of consensus to be reached on a matter as important as this.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Our proposal is based on the dissenting report by Senator Don Chipp, who insisted that the Senate Committee could not and should not make a finding without hearing the judge and without the opportunity of cross-examining him on his evidence. We believe there should be no constitutional or any other grounds preventing the judge from appearing before an impartial commission which would combine the authority of Parliament with the high judicial status and proven public record which will be the criteria for the selection of its members. However, if Mr Justice Murphy believes that it is beyond the jurisdiction of such a commission to investigate allegations against him or to determine what ' proved misbehaviour' is, he has the right to challenge these issues in the High Court of Australia. Indeed, because of the wide divergence of opinion already surrounding the exact meaning of the term as it is used in section 72 of the Constitution, a High Court interpretation of the words would of itself be of tremendous value. </PARA>
<PARA> Finally, I can do no more than echo the sentiments expressed in the last two paragraphs of the Attorney-General's statement. I believe that they sum up the belief not only of this chamber and honourable senators in it but also of the general public. He said:</PARA>
<PARA> What is abundantly clear is that the longer this matter lingers, the greater will be the damage caused to the reputation and prestige of the High Court and to the respect afforded to the institution of the judiciary generally. </PARA>
<PARA> There is an enormous burden resting upon the Senate, and it is important that we discharge it quickly, conscientiously and honourably. </PARA>
<PARA>We would not be doing that if we allowed ourselves to go no further than we already have or if we referred the matter to another source of inquiry which is questionable at best, which perhaps would not satisfy this chamber and would not satisfy the general public. On behalf of the Australian Democrats, I seek leave to give notice of a motion. </PARA>

<PARA> This is the second report presented by the Committee on the prescribed payments system of taxation. In October last year the Committee reported on the then new PPS regulations and since that time it has monitored the practical operation of the system. The Committee's report notes that many of the problems associated with the PPS have been overcome as the result of modifications made by the Government and as users have become much more familiar with the system. Recommendations have been made which, if implemented, should further reduce the volume of paperwork and simplify the operation of the system. Briefly, the Committee recommends:</PARA>
<PARA> 1. That the terms of the declaration by prescribed persons-usually accountants- be changed to match the wording of the ruling issued by the Commissioner of Taxation on this matter;</PARA>
<PARA> 2. That the use of obligation transfer forms be modified;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. That a system for the recovery of overpaid tax through the use of deduction forms be established; and</PARA>
<PARA> 4. That deduction exemption certificates be issued to taxpayers only on the ground of satisfactory taxation history. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Perhaps I may put something on the record, very briefly, for answer by the Minister for Resources and Energy (Senator Walsh). I have not given him notice of this and I do not seek a reply now. It is a matter that I raised with him informally in the Senate chamber some weeks ago, and he was good enough to give me some information which I should now like him to put on the public record. So, Mr President, simply to commence that process, I just wish to say that I think that it is time that the Government told us precisely what will happen about the next shipments of uranium which are due to be made in, I think, October. Those shipments may be barred by the Government in the light of the decision which was taken by the federal conference of the Australian Labor Party just a few weeks ago, but I have seen no official announcement as to what will happen with respect to those shipments, and an announcement is overdue.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second matter on which I seek information from the Government is the question of what is to happen with respect to losses which are incurred should shipments be disrupted. Queensland Mines Ltd may well suffer losses if the Government policy reflects the policy adopted by the ALP. That is a serious matter. It is a case of the deprivation of the proceeds of investment, which is most unfortunate; indeed, it is quite wrong. I believe that there is a case for compensation for that company or any other company which is similarly caught by government action. Therefore, I ask the Government to advise the Australian people, in the near future, of what it proposes in that area. I am sorry to raise that matter without giving notice to the Minister, but time is marching on , and I thought that if I put it on the record now he could respond later. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I must take up some of the time of the Senate this afternoon to raise the issue of the administration of the Commissioner for Housing loans scheme in the Australian Capital Territory, which has caused such incredible distress to so many people over the last couple of weeks. I had thought that I might get an opportunity to ask a question at Question Time today; I could not let the day pass without referring to this matter. However, I shall not do so in the detail that the matter warrants; I shall do that on another occasion. There are questions that need to be answered. I hope that the Minister will answer them quickly.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One might ask: 'What is happening to the Westminster system as far as this matter is concerned, and who bears the responsibility for the monumental muddle in the Commissioner for Housing loans scheme?' The muddley has existed since the time of the Budget. The muddle was alleviated to some small extent yesterday when the Cabinet, somewhat belatedly, band-aided the issue and gave a further $ 6m to cover loans which had been approved prior to 21 August but for which people could not get money. There were 355 people who had bought land or houses and who had been approved for the Commissioner for Housing loans scheme but who were not able to get the money to settle. Many of them ran the risk of losing their deposits. Many of them were involved in contracts which meant that they would be in serious difficulties if they did not meet them, and many other people were depending on those contracts for other transactions and were being inconvenienced as a result of cheques not being available from the Commissioner for Housing. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VI4">Senator REID</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. The fact is that the Minister for Territories and Local Government (Mr Uren) has for a long time been promoting low income people into houses. His rhetoric has been splendid. But it is clear that it was not matched by the money he had available for this scheme. It is clear that the guidelines for the administration of the scheme were not of the same order as the funds available. I want to know from the Minister how far the $6m will go towards redressing the plight of the people whom I have had in and out of my office over the last couple of weeks. Many of them have been very distressed. I also want to know how much money will be available in the Commissioner for Housing loans scheme for the balance of this financial year for people who have applied, who believe that they are entitled, and who believe that their situation is no different from others who are now getting money. What will the position be?</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I think that 1,100 blocks of land were sold during June of this year and 650 in July, and 130 blocks of land have been made available for over-the-counter sales at the reserve price to people who have qualified as low income earners. Many of these people believed that they would be able to get a Commissioner for Housing loan to proceed with the purchase. Perhaps some of the most distressing cases are those who have been affected by Family Court settlements and who had approval under their settlements to buy out the family home, to provide a home continuously for the children. These are people who had gone through divorce, obviously, and who, as a result of this, believed that they would at least be able to stay in the same house, but were told that they would not get the money.</PARA>
<PARA> It has been a fact for a long time that in many instances Commissioner for Housing loans have been used to save the family home. I think that is a proper use of the funds. The cost to government of throwing a woman out of her house, causing her to come back asking for emergency housing and probably then wanting a low rent house valued at about $60,000, is considerably more expensive than making available an average of $20,000 or $30,000 to save the family home. I could give many examples of that type. Some loans have been approved and applicants will now receive the money. Many are in the midst of settlements. They had expected the money to be available, but they now do not know what will happen or where to turn. There is a need for a close look at the guidelines. For some time the operation has been hit or miss. There have been no clear guidelines under which a person could go into the Department and pick up a piece of paper showing whether he or she was likely to qualify or whether the income was within the appropriate range. </PARA>
<PARA> I have raised this matter previously and the Minister for Social Security ( Senator Grimes) knows about it because he referred to it when I raised the subject earlier. He is aware of the fact that maintenance is not taken into account in assessing ability of a person to repay a Commissioner for Housing loan, yet the very pension received by that person is lower because of the receipt of that maintenance. If the person concerned were not receiving maintenance and were on full pension, he or she would qualify. The position is absurd and must be remedied. More land sales will take place within a few weeks and many people, especially first home owners, low income earners, will attend those auctions to buy land and will expect to feel confident that they will qualify for a Commissioner for Housing loan. The Minister has said that there is to be an inquiry and that he wants a report within a couple of months. However, he has not said what is to be inquired into or what he is looking for, he has not said what the guidelines for the future will be. There is a whole range of questions I hope he will answer before this week is out. As I have said, I could go on with examples of people who have been to my office and I could instance issues that arise. Even with the Estimates committee hearings pressing upon us this afternoon, I felt I could not allow this opportunity to pass without referring to this matter which has had such a devastating effect on the very people the Minister says he is hoping to help. They are the ones who have been harmed. </PARA>

<PARA> I provide the following additional information to the response I gave in the Senate and to Senator Sir John Carrick's supplementary question on the subject:</PARA>
<PARA> A Committee, then called the 'Maralinga Safety Committee' was set up in July 1955 with Professor Sir Leslie Martin as its first chairman. In 1956, the Committee was renamed the 'Atomic Weapons Tests Safety Committee' (AWTSC). There was no formal committee for the first two tests at Monte Bello and Emu. Professors Martin and Titterton were, however, both present at the Hurricane and the Totem nuclear tests. Members of the (AWTSC) included expert scientists and senior public servants. In January 1957 the Committee comprised:</PARA>
<PARA> Prof Sir Leslie Martin, (Chairman)</PARA>
<PARA> Prof E. W. Titterton, Member</PARA>
<PARA> Mr W. A. S. Butement, Member (Department of Supply)</PARA>
<PARA> Mr L. J. Dwyer, Member (Director of Meteorology)</PARA>

<PARA> Mr D. J. Stevens, Member (Commonwealth X-Ray Laboratory)</PARA>
<PARA> Dr J. H. Martin, Member (Cancer Institute Board)</PARA>
<PARA> Mr J. Moroney, Member (Secretary to Committee)</PARA>
<PARA> The responsibilities of the Committee, when founded, were:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) to examine information and other data supplied by the United Kingdom Government relating to atomic weapons tests from time to time proposed to be carried out in Australia for the purpose of determining whether the safety measures proposed to be taken in relation to such tests were adequate for the prevention of injury to persons or damage to livestock and other property as a result of such tests; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) to advise the Prime Minister, through the Minister for Supply, of the conclusions arrived at by the Committee as a result of each examination and in particular as to whether, and if so what additional, alternative or more extensive safety measures are considered necessary or desirable.</PARA>
<PARA> Reports of the activities of the Committee and other relevant documents are available and were reviewed by Australian Ionising Radiation Advisory Council in the preparation of its report 'British Nuclear Tests in Australia-a review of operational safety measures and of possible after-effects' and more recently by the Kerr Committee. Dr J Symonds who has prepared a Chronology of Events concerning the British atomic tests in Australia, which I tabled on 7 June, 1984 , has also examined relevant AWTSC documents.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has contacted available members of the AWTSC in relation to the question. Their recollections vary in detail but none can recall any evidence of harmful effects of the atomic tests in the areas for which the Committee had a responsibility.</PARA>
<PARA> My Department has sought from the relevant departments and agencies detailed documentation of all material held in the Australian Archives and elsewhere relating to the British atomic tests in Australia and the details of this material will be made available to the Royal Commission which has commenced its inquiry into the tests. More precise answers to questions raised in respect of the British atomic tests can be expected to result from the deliberations of the Commission.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 12 June 1984 (Hansard, page 2805) Senator Martin asked the Minister representing the Special Minister of State, without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> When Cabinet was considering changing Australia's national colours from the previous unofficial blue and gold to our sporting colours of green and gold:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) what information did it seek about the cost of such a change?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) will statutory authorities such as the Australian Bicentennial Authority and the Australian Tourist Commission, which adopted blue and gold logos because they were our national colours, be required to change to green and gold logos?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) what was the cost of designing and registering the present logos of the Australian Bicentennial Authority and the Australian Tourist Commission?</PARA>
<PARA> (4) What will be the cost of changing these logos?</PARA>
<PARA>The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> At the outset it should be noted that Australia had no formally approved national colours before the Governor-General's proclamation of green and gold on 19 April 1984. The adoption of green and gold as our formal colours was taken noting the community's general use and identification of these colours as a symbol of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the specific issues raised in the question:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) The use of any colours in the context of symbols, logos and other forms for identification purposes involves funding. This was appreciated when the adoption of official national colours was being considered.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Blue and gold were not Australia's official national colours. The Australian Bicentennial Authority sees advantages in changing its colours as a consequence of the Government's decision. The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment announced the change on 23 July 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Tourist Commission uses blue and gold as its primary colours. However, it should be noted that different colours are used in different markets , appropriately reflecting the colour perceptions in each market.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The cost of designing and registering the Australian Bicentennial Authority 's current logo, which includes both symbol and prescribed words, was approximately $100,000 to 30 June 1984. This amount includes the cost of a nation-wide competition to select a suitable symbol and registration costs both in Australia and overseas.</PARA>
<PARA> Costs incurred by the Australian Tourist Commission in relation to its logo totalled $57,250, which includes designer fees, material, tender, and trade mark registration charges.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) The logo of the Australian Bicentennial Authority will not be changed, though the colours will in time. The Authority will keep the costs involved to a minimum. No additional design or registration costs will be incurred and, as far as practicable, current stocks of stationery and brochures will be issued before new stocks with the national colours are obtained. Funds to cover the unavoidable costs involved in the changeover have been provided in the ABA's 1984/85 appropriation. The ABA estimates that the amount involved, excluding the cost of Bicentennial Roads Development Program signs, will not exceed $300,000. The money will be spent mainly on planning kits for the 839 Bicentennial Community Committees being formed throughout the nation.</PARA>
<PARA> Should the Australian Tourist Commission decide to change its colours, the use of new colours would be introduced progressively, avoiding wastage.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 13 June 1984 (Hansard, page 2915) Senator Crowley asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations whether he has seen an article in yesterday's Age headed: ' Tenosynovitis will cost millions in compo, says solicitor'. Is he aware of comments by the solicitor, Mr John MacMillan, that computer manufacturers claim that ergonomic features built into their products substantially lowered the incidence of tenosynovitis in key stroke operators? Is he further aware that Mr MacMillan claims that job design, with adequate rest periods, is far more important in preventing tenosynovitis than ergonomic components? Can the Minister say whether similar consideration is given to computer operators in Federal Government departments? Can he confirm the estimates of cost to industry of workers' compensation, as claimed in the article? Will he raise these issues with the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations for reference to the proposed national commission on occupational health and safety?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Yes, I have seen the article in the Age in which Mr MacMillan is quoted as saying that '. . . these measures [job design], coupled with the implementation of correct postural positioning plus seating and keyboard positioning, have resulted in a marked decrease in the number of injuries to keystroke workers'.</PARA>
<PARA> As I understand it, a number of factors, including job re-design or workplace design, will require attention to bring about an improvement. I doubt whether there is an exclusive solution for this serious occupational problem.</PARA>
<PARA> Many departments now have guidelines available which specify the need for rest breaks and well designed equipment. For example, the Office of the Public Service Board issued on 3 August 1984 a comprehensive circular (84/2970) dealing with the prevention of repetition strain injuries. It is expected that this circular will provide additional assistance to those departments which have still to introduce preventive strategies.</PARA>
<PARA> The Department of Employment and Industrial Relations' policy for its own employees states that 'a regular change in work or tasks such as a mix of duties or job rotation may provide breaks from continuous keyboard operation'.</PARA>
<PARA> The question of the frequency and duration of rest breaks is the subject of on- going negotiations between staff associations, departments and the Public Service Board. As a general guide where sustained keying is involved, and the opportunity to perform a mix of duties is not available, rest breaks of up to 10 minutes after 1 hour's work may be applicable.</PARA>
<PARA> I cannot confirm Mr MacMillan's estimate of the cost of tenosynovitis and related diseases to industry and government. With regard to the broad area of occupational health and safety, funds have been provided in the 1984-85 Budget for the establishment of a National Occupational Health and Safety Commission. I assure the honourable senator that the National Commission can be expected to devote urgent attention to tenosynovitis and related diseases with a view to their elimination.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) (a) and (b) The following are details of the two United States naval exercises mentioned. Neither would appear to have had any relevance to the shooting down of the Korean Airlines aircraft by the Soviet Union on 1 September 1983:</PARA>
<PARA> In late September 1982, two United States carrier battle groups (led by USS ENTERPRISE and USS MIDWAY) from the USN Seventh Fleet conducted carrier operations south of the western Aleutian Islands, which are US territory.</PARA>
<PARA> From 5 to 16 April 1983, the United States held a major fleet exercise in the north-western Pacific. The US naval force included three carrier battle groups ( USS Enterprise, USS Midway, and USS Coral Sea). The composition of the force involved was not consistent with an invasion related exercise objective. The exercise was carried out in waters south of the Aleutian Islands and along the coast of northern Japan.</PARA>
<PARA> (1) (c) The Pacific coast area contains a number of installations of considerable military/strategic significance for the USSR. It is doubtful, however, whether Soviet authorities regard it as more important than other areas of the USSR, particularly the European part of the country where the great bulk of Soviet human, economic and military resources are concentrated.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government has no further specific information on the above exercises. We place no credence on claims such as those in the article to which Senator Maguire refers that the Korean Airlines aircraft was engaged in espionage activities. The Government reacted with shock and grave concern to the shooting down of the aircraft and strongly expressed the view, both directly to the Soviet Union and in international forums, that there is no circumstance in which the shooting down of an unarmed civilian aircraft can be justified.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) The Hon. Mr Justice Woodward took evidence on the substitution of export meat with uninspected pet food, including kangaroo, during the Royal Commission into the Australian Meat Industry.</PARA>
<PARA> The Royal Commissioner, in his summary of major issues, said that he had not been asked to consider what effect the serious level of commercial malpractice may have had on the export meat industry itself or on Australia's reputation as a trading nation. He added, in any event, this would be difficult to judge in the absence of any knowledge of the meat industries of other countries.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No official statistics are published on the level of kangaroo meat production or consumption in Australia.

<PARA> In quantity terms there is no doubt that the Australian beef and sheepmeat industries could fill any gap in the market left by the withdrawal of kangaroo meat.

<PARA> (1) The Government is aware of the matter. It involves an isolated case and is not indicative of any serious weakness in the system by which organisations entitled to exemption from sales tax on goods for their use and not for sale obtain that exemption. In the case of motor vehicles, the Taxation Office has in place procedure to safeguard the revenue which, except for claims made by Government Departments and authorities, requires that claims for exemption be scrutinized by that office prior to the motor vehicle being sold free of tax.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for Public Service Matters has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> RAAF and Army training in the radio/ telecommunications field is recognised for three main employment levels in the Australian Pubic Service (APS)-professional (engineer), middle level (technical officer and draftsman) and trade. The general criteria applied for the recognition of RAAF training also apply for the recognition of Army training, the general criteria for each level being:</PARA>
<PARA> professional-a tertiary qualification recognised by the Institution of Engineers, Australia</PARA>
<PARA> middle-a Technical and Further Education (TAFE) middle-level certificate qualification, or other equivalent educational qualification</PARA>
<PARA> trade-a first-class tradesman's qualification, or tradesman's certificate issued under the Tradesmen's Rights Regulation Act.</PARA>
<PARA> In practice, the application of these general criteria means that RAAF and Army radio/telecommunications training receive equal recognition of professional and trade-level employment. However in the case of middle-level employment, there has been equal recognition only since 1980. From this time both RAAF and Army personnel in the radio/telecommunications field have received recognised technical and further education middle-level certificate qualifications as part of their basic military training. In the case of pre-1980 RAAF training, personnel whose training meets certain specified criteria are recognised as qualified for middle-level employment in the APS. However, no such provision exists for pre-1980 Army radio/telecommunications training because the Department of Defence, following investigations conducted in conjunction with TAFE authorities during the period 1973-1977, concluded that the RAAF training specified above was broadly equivalent in standard to a TAFE middle-level certificate but that the Army training (which is structured differently front the RAAF's) was below that standard.</PARA>
<PARA> It should be noted, however, that any person whose qualifications are not accepted for a technical officer or draftsman job in the APS can, under certain conditions, demonstrate that his/her technical knowledge and competence are at around TAFE middle-level certificate standard by sitting an eligibility test conducted by the relevant department on behalf of the PSB.</PARA>
<PARA> On the general question of recognition of Defence Forces qualifications, an interdepartmental working party is currently examining the nature and extent of problems being encountered by persons seeking to obtain formal recognition in civilian employment of training and education received in the Defence Forces; the working party is expected to report shortly:</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Why have representatives in the Department of Foreign Affairs expressed surprise at a retaliation by Indonesia in cancelling the planned visit to East Timor by the Australian Ambassador in Indonesia, Mr Dalrymple, when it must be received against a background of Australia giving offence to Indonesia in allowing East Timorese Guerilla Fretilin Leader Mr Jose Horta permission for a six week speaking tour of Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is this not yet another demonstration of Australian Government vanity in insulating and distancing itself on issues deemed important to our ASEAN neighbours and trading partners.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="435" SPEAKER="Evans Sen The Hon G.J." NAMEID="VD4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="TAS">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The visit to Australia of Mr Jose Ramos Horta, Fretilin's representative at the United Nations, reflects the Government's belief that as a matter of general principle, such persons should not be refused entry solely on the grounds that they are likely to express controversial views while they are here. In allowing Mr Morta to visit Australia, the Government made it clear, including to the Indonesian authorities, that the visit was in Mr Horta's personal capacity, that he would not receive any Government assistance and that the visit did not imply any change in the Government's attitude towards Fretilin.</PARA>
<PARA> The initial cancellation of Ambassador Dalrymple's visit to East Timor, for whatever reasons, caused some surprise. The foregoing circumstances surrounding Mr Horta's visit to Australia were clearly understood by Indonesian authorities and a similar visit had been made in June 1983 by two Fretilin Central Committee Members, Abilio Araujo and Roque Rodriquez.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government held the view that a visit to East Timor to examine developments in the province since the visit of the Australian Parliamentary Delegation in August 1983 was in both countries' interest. This point was accepted by the Indonesian Government and the visit took place from 4 to 7 July 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The Government has not in any way sought to distance itself from its ASEAN neighbours and trading partners on this or any other issue. Indeed the whole thrust of the Government's foreign policy is to involve Australia more directly and immediately in the issues facing our region. While, as a natural part of this process, there have been some differences of view with our asean colleagues on particular issues, Australia's role and interests in the region are accepted and our continuing consultations have proved productive for Australia and the region.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="435" SPEAKER="Button Sen The Hon J.N." NAMEID="4F4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="NSW">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="4F4">Senator Button</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Metal Trades Industry Association conducted a telephone survey of selected firms in the northern region of New South Wales on 31 May this year. Of the 20 firms surveyed, 18 were in the heavy engineering, foundry and metal fabrication industries. Respondents, who had a total employment of 2469 persons, estimated that between June and December 1984 they would reduce their workforce by 15.4 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> The estimate of a job loss of 3700, which was publicised in the local press, was obtained by applying this 15.4 per cent factor to all metals industries in the northern region of New South Wales, which employ about 24 000 persons. There is no indication to support the assumption, implicit in this estimate, that other metals industries are suffering the same difficulties as the heavy engineering industries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government is concerned about the situation in the heavy engineering industry. On 5 August this year, the industry was referred to the Industries Assistance Commission. The Commission is required to provide an interim report within three months on the appropriate short term response to existing industry problems, and a final report within 12 months on long term assistance arrangements.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) There has been some rise (+12 per cent) over the past nine months in the number of unemployed registered for full time employment with Commonwealth Employment Service offices in the region. Given the strong growth in the labour force over the past year, and the generally poorer performance of industrialised areas during the present recovery, the increase in registrations in the Hunter region is not unexpected. (CES unemployment figures between March 1981 and March 1983 are not available-due to the Review of Commonwealth Functions decision to discontinue their collection.)</PARA>
<PARA> Against this the number of unfilled vacancies available at CES offices in the Hunter region increased by over 60 per cent over the year to June 1984. In addition, over the year to the June quarter 1984, the number of vacancies notified to CES offices in the region increased by over one third.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Commonwealth is aware that Newcastle has a valuable and extensive infrastructure provided by both public and private investment over past years. So too do many other regions of Australia. The Government's economic policies, re-affirmed in our Budget of 21 August, are directed to make more efficient use of labour and capital resources throughout the nation, including the Hunter region.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) In 1984-85, expenditure on civil works funded directly from the Budget is estimated to rise by over 50 per cent. Grants of a capital nature to State, Northern Territory and local Governments are estimated to rise by 14 per cent.</PARA>
<PARA> Within the Hunter region, the Hunter Valley Research Foundation has identified between November 1983 and May 1984 a 4 per cent increase in the value of projects under construction, and a 91 per cent increase in the value of proposed projects.</PARA>
<PARA> At least $46 million of the proposed new investment in the region is due to capital expenditure by BHP in its Steel Division, undertaken as part of the Steel Industry Plan.</PARA>
<PARA> The Federal Government is also assisting the region through its package of employment generation and training initiatives for the steel regions. In 1983-84 some $3.3m was provided towards a range of TAFE, road, water treatment, tourism and Defence housing projects in the Hunter region. A further $13.5m is being provided for the region in 1984-85, of which the main payments will be for TAFE projects ($6.4m), Nelson Bay fishing port extension ($3m) and Chichester water treatment works ($2.6m). In addition, the Federal Government is continuing its considerable support for other projects in the region, including a $1m development of the Royal Australian Air Force base at Williamstown, construction of a new $9.45m office block in Newcastle, and provision of $1m towards the Chichester Dam under the national water resources program.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Federal Government's roads program, the Newcastle National Highway Strategy is being developed with a view to constructing a new route west of Lake Macquarie bypassing Newcastle and Maitland at a preliminary cost estimate of $ 180m. Upgrading of the New England highway section of the Sydney/Brisbane national highway is also continuing.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="VD4">Senator Gareth Evans</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The senator's question might more properly have been addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade as the activities of the Australian Trade Commissioner in the Philippines fall within his portfolio. It might be stated, however, that Australia's commitment to observance of internationally accepted standards of human rights is an important part of the Government's foreign policy. Through our membership in the International Labour Organisation, the Australian Government supports international efforts to improve labour conditions in all countries. We also maintain an interest in the activities of Australian companies in the Philippines. This does not normally extend to a close examination of local working conditions.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government has not established explicit human rights criteria for trade or overseas aid. The Government believes that Australia should not automatically withhold commercial and aid contacts from states with adverse human rights records. Nor do such contacts imply any endorsement on our part of the policies of these states.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government has considered suggestions that Australian aid to certain countries should be discontinued, but has firmly taken the view that such suggestions overlook the fact that the result of such action would be to punish the most needy people in a developing country without influencing those who direct affairs. At the same time, the Government believes that Australian aid in developing infrastructure and alleviating some of the social and economic problems of developing countries can play a positive role in promoting human rights in recipient countries.</PARA>
<PARA> The Government recognises, however, that Australia's commercial, aid and diplomatic relations with other states enable us to maintain a dialogue with them on human rights matters. It pursues such a dialogue with a view to promoting genuine, lasting improvements in human rights. Human rights issues, therefore, are clearly understood to be on the agenda of our bilateral relations with many countries including Asian countries. In seeking to pursue principles embodied in the United Nations Charter and the International Bill of Rights, the Government has a legitimate basis for taking issue with human rights violations in countries throughout the world. The Government's commitment to the promotion of human rights will continue to have an active influence on the conduct of Australia's international relations.</PARA>
