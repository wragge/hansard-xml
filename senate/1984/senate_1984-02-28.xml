<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;It is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death on 28 December 1983 of former Senator Francis Patrick McManus. I move:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death, on 28 December 1983, of Francis Patrick McManus, CMG, Senator for the State of Victoria from 1956 to 1962 and from 1965 to 1974 and former Leader and Deputy Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>
<PARA>Former Senator McManus died on 28 December 1983 when most honourable senators were on holiday or enjoying the break from this chamber. His death was perhaps less noticed than it might have been because it occurred on that date. He was a founding member of the Democratic Labor Party and he represented my State, Victoria, as a senator from 1956 to 1962 and from 1965 to 1974. I had personally a little to do with Senator McManus in 1955 before he became Democratic Labor Party senator for Victoria, but after that time I had no personal knowledge or experience of him except of his public record as a senator and as a person who was outspoken about the things in which he believed. He was, of course, a parliamentary leader in the Senate for a brief time between October 1973 and April 1974, and prior to that he was Deputy Leader of the Democratic Labor Party . </PARA>
<PARA> During his term of office in the Senate he served on a number of committees, I believe with distinction. As a result of that period of dedicated public service he was made a Companion of the Order of St Michael and St George in December 1979. I am sure that all honourable senators will join with the Government in expressing compassion and condolences to those members of his family who survive him after a prominent public career. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) in support of this motion of condolence on the death of Francis Patrick McManus. It says something for the rate of change in Australian politics that the great majority of honourable senators here today did not serve with former Senator McManus, who left here as recently as 1974. Those of us who did not serve with him and who therefore did not know him personally all know something of his role in Australian politics over the period from 1955 in particular through to 1974 when he left the Senate. He was involved in matters of great principle and of deep division within the Australian political system, but I have never heard it suggested that he was other than a man of very great principle or that the arguments in which he became so strongly engaged were not arguments, for him, of very deep principle. I understand that he was educated at his local Christian Brothers College and that he later won a scholarship to Newman College at Melbourne University. Whatever view one took about the particular issues in which he was engaged, I believe that the men who educated him at those institutions would have regarded him as having followed through the principles that they delivered to him during his education.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I, on behalf of the Opposition, join with the Leader of the Government in the Senate in expressing the sympathy of the Senate to his family, his associates and his friends. He was held in very great respect throughout the political spectrum. In a sense, I suppose that the more recent political events in Victoria are a reminder of some of the more permanent aspects of politics about which he was concerned. In any event, the Opposition joins very sincerely in this motion of condolence. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in this motion of condolence towards the memory of the late Frank McManus and send sympathy to his family, not just on my behalf but on behalf of my Party. I knew Frank McManus very well. I attended his funeral, where I was greeted by a great number of people who stated that they were surprised to see me there because my attitudes towards the philosophies of the Party which he led with distinction were well known. I should have thought that it would be very difficult to find a party with a political persuasion so different to that of mine as was that of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. Notwithstanding that, my respect and admiration for Frank McManus the man transcended my feelings about the philosophy to which he chose to belong. He was a man of extraordinarily high principle, of total integrity, and a man of great compassion.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I remember with some affection some of the long philosophical discussions that he and I used to have when I and a fellow called Billy Snedden, and others, were callow back benchers in the Liberal Party. We used to go to the Yass railway station on Thursday nights in the winter and catch the train from Yass to Melbourne to save any delay at a fog-bound Canberra airport on Friday mornings. Frank McManus always accompanied us. Quite often the train was late, and on those wintery mornings, well into one o'clock or two o'clock in the morning, we used to have lengthy philosophical discussions, and we used to play ricky-ticky, with pound notes, as I remember, and we had general conversations about various issues. </PARA>
<PARA> If honourable senators had been at the funeral service at St Patrick's Cathedral, they would have been as impressed as I was, and as everyone who attended it was, not only with the number of people present-the enormous cathedral was packed to overflowing-but also with the genuine beliefs and feelings of sympathy and admiration for the man on the part of those present. It was a living tribute to a person who had made his contribution and passed on. I take this opportunity of putting on record my personal tribute to a good man. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join in offering my personal sympathy and the sympathy of my Party, the National Party of Australia, to the family and friends of the late Senator McManus. I had the pleasant experience of serving in this chamber in the latter years of the late Senator McManus's period here, when he was Deputy Leader and then Leader of the Australian Democratic Labor Party. I remember him as a tall, distinguished and, above all things, scholarly member of this chamber. I suppose that if anything marked him more than any other single thing it was the measure of his dedication and sincerity. I am sure that wherever he moved he would have left that impression at least among those people with whom he spoke, both friends and foes. There was never any doubt that the late Senator McManus was sincere and dedicated in all of the things that he did. I again express my and my Party's sympathy to those he leaves behind.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I join with all other senators in paying tribute to the late Frank McManus and conveying to his widow, his two sons and his two daughters our warm sympathy. At the same time I record my own view-I am sure it is the view of many-that Frank McManus was a great Australian, a very distinguished person and a man of very singular qualities. I came to know him, as did Senator Chipp and others, in the time that I served here. I came to respect him as a man of high intellect, great integrity and massive courage.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Whatever were the rights and wrongs of the 1950s there is no doubt at all that Frank McManus believed that what he did was right. He did it with courage and at great sacrifice to himself and to his family. He carried those principles with great honesty and integrity wherever he went and in whatever he said. He was a man of great humanity and great affection for others. Indeed, I quite willingly say that I had not only an admiration but also an affection for the man quite beyond the ordinary politics of this chamber. Because he stood up for his principles and was willing to run up his flag for what he believed in against his own self interests, he paid the price. Although I was not able to go to his funeral-I would have liked to do so-I am delighted that there should have been such a wide Australian acknowledgment of the man at the point of his death. Therefore, I am very happy to place his qualities on record. I think we are all the better, whatever our political views may be, from having walked with him and shared the dialogue of life with him. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Frank McManus was born in North Melbourne in 1905. He was educated by the Christian Brothers and won a scholarship to Newman College at the University of Melbourne. He held an honours degree in English and Latin Literature and a Diploma of Education. He spent 19 years in high school teaching. He joined the Australian Labor Party in 1925 at the Flemington Branch. He was elected to the Victorian Executive of the Labor Party in 1947 and between 1949 and 1955 he was Assistant Secretary to the Victorian Branch of the ALP. In 1955 he was elected, with George Cole from Tasmania, to the Senate as ALP (Anti- Communist) Democratic Labor Party Senator. His term took effect from 1956. He was unsuccessful in the elections in 1961. From 1962 to 1964 he was Federal Organising Secretary to the DLP. In 1964 he was re-elected to the Senate. He was re-elected again in 1970 and in 1973 took over from Senator Gair as Federal Parliamentary Leader of the DLP. In 1974 he was defeated at the double dissolution.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In his retirement he wrote a book The Tumult and the Shouting. Frank McManus was married. He and his wife, Clare, had two sons and two daughters-Mary, Brendan, Paul and Noreen. One different feature of Frank was that he was No. 1 patron of the North Melbourne Football Club. He died on 28 December 1983 at the age of 78. His funeral was held on Tuesday, 3 January 1984. Unfortunately, I was not able to attend that funeral because at the same time the funeral of another great Australian citizen, John Traill, Q.C. who was a close friend of mine was being held in Sydney. Bishop Perkins was the principal concelebrant. There were four other bishops, 45 priests and over 1,000 people at St Patrick's Cathedral, Melbourne. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There were well over 1,000 people at that funeral. I did not know Frank McManus well. I got to know him in the 1950s. From memory I did not have the opportunity of renewing that acquaintance after the 1950s. As all honourable senators know, he stood a tall man and used to walk and speak with his hands behind his back, somewhat like a school teacher-reminiscent, of course , of the 19 years he spent as a high school teacher. He was an avid reader, mainly of history and biographies, and was a good customer to the Parliamentary Library. He had an aversion to travelling by plane and, as Senator Chipp has reminded us, he used to travel by car to Yass to meet the train going to Melbourne. He was a very strong family man and regretted the time that the Parliament kept him away from his family, particularly whilst his children were growing up. His wife Clare was very devoted.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Frank McManus had a great affection for Ireland. His father was born in County Roscommon. He was good friends with a number of journalists, including from the Press Gallery the late Kevin Power, Ian Fitchett, Alan Reid and the late Richard Hughes-the China watcher. He had some very close friends amongst the Chinese community in Melbourne. Perhaps his major interest during his parliamentary career was foreign affairs. He served on the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. </PARA>
<PARA> He had a dry sense of humour and a well-developed sense of the ridiculous. He often told jokes against himself. For example, in his book The Tumult and the Shouting he recalled his introduction to politics in the schoolyard in 1916 when the conscription debate was raging. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>I was accosted in the schoolyard at St Mary's by five or six boys and asked 'Are you for conscription?' I did not know what conscription was and said so. An answer was insisted on, so I guessed; I said 'Yes', and was promptly flattened. </PARA>
<PARA>Subsequently, largely because of the conscription debate, he joined the then Australian Labor Party. Senator McManus was always grateful for the assistance he received from the many thousands of ordinary men and women-support which enabled him to receive a very high 19.7 per cent of the vote in the 1970 Senate election. In the foreword to his book he paid tribute to those men and women who had fought over the years to save the Labor Party and the unions from communist domination. He said in that foreword:</PARA>
<PARA>They were branded as scabs and rats, as fascists and traitors; they were widely and ignorantly regarded as a Catholic mafia, seeking to take over Labor and the unions. They deserve no less than that the truth be told; therefore I have written this book. </PARA>
<PARA> As with many other books, The Tumult and the Shouting will probably be read and understood only now that the author has died. I take this opportunity of joining with other honourable senators in placing on record my support for the condolence motion and my sympathy for Senator McManus's family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Very briefly, on behalf of Government senators, I want to say a word about Laurie Wallis who died on 10 January 1984 aged 62 years. Mr Wallis was the honourable member for Grey in South Australia from 1969 to 1980. During his period of service in this Parliament he belonged to and served on many committees. All those things are a matter of record in the Parliamentary Handbook and I do not want to go into them .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> On my own behalf and, I believe, on behalf of my colleagues, I want to say that Laurie Wallis will be very well remembered by us all, firstly as a man of great integrity and a very honest man. Secondly, he was a man with a great deal of common sense. I think Laurie Wallis was one of the best barometers in this place if one wanted to find out what sensible people were thinking in the sometimes frenetic atmosphere which arises here. Thirdly, he was a very diligent and hard working member for his electorate. It was an enormous electorate and he knew it very well. He worked very hard for the people of Grey in the time he was in this Parliament and in difficult times. Because of that, he remained the honourable member for Grey. On behalf of the Government I place on record those things about Laurie Wallis and express our sympathy to his family in their bereavement. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On behalf of the Opposition I support the remarks which have been made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button). Mr Wallis was a member who was known to many of us-I suppose to all of us. I support the comments about him which were made by the Leader of the Government.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I served with him on one of the joint committees on which he served in the Parliament, namely, the Joint Select Committee on Aboriginal Land Rights in the Northern Territory. That exercise was one of many exercises in which one gets a great deal of non-partisan consideration of difficult and complex issues. It was the one opportunity I had to work with him directly. On that occasion he showed the sorts of qualities to which Senator Button has referred. I do not wish to say a great deal because I know that Senator Jessop has a wish to speak about this matter, but I extend the sympathy of the Opposition to Mr Wallis's family for the loss of a very fine man. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;As Senator Button has already pointed out, Laurie Wallis was the honourable member for Grey, which was indeed an enormous electorate covering more or less half of South Australia-the west coast and the upper northern regions of that area centred around what is known as the Iron Triangle, Whyalla, Port Pirie and Port Augusta.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is a matter of considerable regret to me that most honourable senators do not get the opportunity to know members of the House of Representatives very well. This is of course particularly true when they are not members of one's own political party. So my knowledge of Laurie Wallis is pretty much hearsay. Nevertheless, I think that no one will disagree with me when I say that he was well known and well liked in his electorate both as a man and as a member of parliament. He was widely respected as a person who cared for and worked hard for his electorate and for the people who lived in it. It was not an easy electorate to work for covering, as it did, such a large rural area plus a very large industrialised area, both of which suffered intensely from unemployment and the problems that go with it. I and my Party therefore join in the previous expressions of sympathy to his family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I also wish to join in the condolences for Mr Laurie Wallis. Mr Wallis worked very hard for the electorate of Grey. Laurie Wallis would meet with people of any political persuasion. He worked just as hard for members of the Country Party or the Liberal Party as he did for Aboriginals or members of the Australian Labor Party. It did not make any difference whether a person was wealthy or poor or what position he held, Laurie Wallis worked very hard. I believe he gained the respect of people in the electorate of Grey. It is a great loss because he worked so hard. I know that Laurie Wallis used to burn out a car every twelve months because of the distances that he had to travel in the huge electorate of Grey in South Australia.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Laurie Wallis retired only a couple of years before he died. Before he entered Parliament he was a boilermaker. I believe that, like so many boilermakers, he had to work with asbestos. I still believe that that was the cause of Laurie Wallis's early death. It is a great shame that Laurie Wallis could not have gained some enjoyment from his retirement. His family saw very little of him. Any member who works in a huge electorate such as Grey must sacrifice some pleasant things, such as family life. My sympathy goes to his family, because, for the ten years he was a member, they saw very little of him. It is a great loss. As I said, it is unfortunate that he could not have had more time to enjoy his retirement. On behalf of all South Australian senators, I extend condolences to his wife and family. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I associate myself with this motion of condolence. As honourable senators know, following the redistribution in 1969 after which, unhappily, I lost 7,000 or 8,000 rural votes, Laurie Wallis was successful in taking from me the seat of Grey. It was a large area which covered nearly 90 per cent of the area of South Australia. I knew Laurie before he went into Parliament. He was a patient of mine and I regarded him always as a friend. I did not always agree with his political views, but he was a quiet man who quietly went about the task of serving his large electorate. As Senator Elstob has said, irrespective of people's political views, he did his very best to serve them. I would like to pay that tribute to him. I was able to attend his funeral and paid my personal respects to his widow. I would like to place on record my feelings of a man whom I regarded as a friend and who served his people well. I pass on my condolences to his wife and family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I associate myself with this motion of condolence for two reasons. Firstly, Laurie Wallis was a good friend of anyone with whom he came into contact. He was a man of the people. Secondly, he represented the electorate of Grey which includes the town of Quorn where I was born and the area in which I worked for some time. I did not actually work in Quorn, but certainly in the northern area. It has always been recognised far and wide in Australia that the northern people are the salt of the earth. Laurie Wallis was a typical northerner. He dedicated himself to his job and I know from first hand knowledge from relations in the area that, as has been said by Senator Elstob, he did his job without fear or favour. I join with other senators in supporting this condolence motion and expressing sympathy to his family.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Mr President, I ask your indulgence and the indulgence of the Senate to raise a point of order concerning the condolence motions. In the white copy, the draft program, which was circulated in this place earlier this morning to party leaders there were to be condolence motions regarding the late Senator McManus, the late Mr Laurie Wallis and the late Mr Andropov. However, on the Notice Paper the last name does not appear. When inquiring into this omission I was told that certain people who prepare the Notice Paper considered that in view of the remarks that I made the last time a condolence motion was raised in regard to a Russian leader, Mr Brezhnev, it might be more desirable to leave Mr Andropov's name off and avoid that sort of situation. In the event, had a condolence motion to the late Soviet leader been on the Notice Paper, I would have used similar expressions of concern and put on the record some of the crimes against humanity for which he was responsible.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> That is not the point I am raising today. I am asking you, Mr President, the Leader of the Government in the Senate (Senator Button) or somebody else to refer this matter to the Senate Standing Orders Committee. The point I am making is that it is undesirable for a certain group in this place, whoever they might be-Whips, officials or party leaders-to say who shall or shall not be listed if they are a head of state who has died. Are we reaching a situation where a certain group here will determine that only 'the good guys' are listed for condolences? If so, who will determine the criteria? It is a matter of some concern. I have a personal view that it is time we stopped this nonsense of putting the names of any heads of state on the Notice Paper. I believe it is reaching a serious situation if we are going to discriminate between one head of state and another. </PARA>

<TITLE>Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act</TITLE>
<PARA>To the Honourable the President and members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</PARA>
<PARA> The petition of certain elected representatives and officers of Local Governments in Australia shows that General Revenue Grants to Local Government under Personal Income Tax Sharing entitlements have increased by 8.2 per cent in 1983-84 over 1982-83, the inflation rate over the same period was 11.2 per cent, the increase in grants to State Governments over the same period was 11.8 per cent, increased demands are being made on Local Government Authorities to participate in Federal Government programs e.g., Community Employment Program, the Labor Party made a pre-election commitment to allocate not less than the real value of the previous year's allocation in General Revenue Grants to Local Government.</PARA>
<PARA> Your petitioners therefore pray that the Government will amend the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Act of 1976, to provide a real term minimum guarantee to Local Government general revenue sharing arrangements in 1983-84, and in future years.</PARA>

<PARA> 1. Increase the financial hardship already being experienced by Australian students. The cut in subsidies to colleges will undoubtedly increase fees for that accommodation in 1984. Many students will be forced out of tertiary education as they will not be able to meet these increased costs particularly as the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme only gained a maximum increase of $2.80 per week in the Federal Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Decrease access to education for country students.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, like Senator Crowley, I did receive a letter from the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Peacock, asking me, amongst other things, whether I would donate at least $25 to assist the Liberal Party in its fight against the Labor Party, and assuring me that he would continue his fight against what he called the nationalisation of the health industry in this country. Incorporated in the letter, I think Senator Crowley will agree with me, are the most puerile yes/no questions I have ever seen in my life. I think the first question was, 'Are you opposed to Medicare? Yes/No'-one was to be crossed out. Others were 'Are you opposed to nationalised medicine? Yes/No', 'Do you like the Liberal Party? Yes/ No', et cetera. At the bottom of the letter were two lines. The first line read: 'Will you send a donation of $25 to the Liberal Party?' The second line read: ' Will you send a donation . . . to the Liberal Party to enable Andrew Peacock personally to lead the fight against' what he called, as Senator Crowley said, ' creeping socialism?'

In recent weeks, of course, Senator Messner , who I notice changes his appearance with his views, announced that the Liberal Party would again defer the legislation. Senator Chipp and the Democrats also decided that they would defer the legislation. So, of course, the Government had to make moves to take that situation into account.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I understand that the 1986 census forms, if printed in accordance with current recommendations, will include a question on income, as the previous census and, I think, at least one census previous to that did. The current recommendation does not include the asking of a question on wealth or total assets, nor does it re- commend that the sources of income be disclosed, other than payments from government. A question relating to the sources of income might give some indication of wealth holdings, but it would be an imperfect measure of wealth, a fact which I am sure Senator Maguire would appreciate. Nevertheless, if he wishes me to, I am quite willing to ask the Treasurer whether he will consider including in the question on income the various sources from which that income is derived.</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Well, not hundreds of millions, as Senator Chipp said. The matter of identity cards comes up quite frequently and creates much debate in this country. The first thing to point out is that to produce an identity card which is beyond falsification or corruption is not easy and is a considerable administrative problem. The fact that there is a name, a number and a signature on it does not mean that people cannot get round the system. For instance, in the United States of America, everyone from the President to the latest new-born babe has a social security number. However, at the same time, one of the big and continuing controversies in the United States is the amount of alleged fraud on the social security system.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> We also have a political problem, to which Senator Chipp referred. For instance , at various times Mr Anthony, the former Leader of the National Party, has said that everyone should have an identity card or social security card of that type before he or she receives benefits. Yet at the same time people such as Mr Fraser, the former Prime Minister and Leader of the Liberal Party, have said that the introduction of such a card, even just for the health insurance system, was akin to nazi Germany in 1939. I know that it depends a little on what stage of the political cycle people are talking about, but there is always the complaint that the introduction of such a card or such compulsory identification is an offence against civil liberties. I do not necessarily agree with that.</PARA>
<PARA> However, I point out that it is administratively very difficult and very costly to produce cards which cover the whole population and which would not be able to be subject to deception in the way that Senator Chipp is concerned about. The Department of Social Security and, I understand, other departments are continually looking at this matter, but until now we have no proposals to introduce such a system.</PARA>

<PARA> Under the Medicare system, as honourable senators will know, some people have managed, through various means, to get more than one card. This is a simplistic method which is attractive to many people but; when one comes to the nitty gritty of just how to go about it, one finds that it is a difficult administrative problem. In the United States of America and in such countries in which a similar system exists, it does not eliminate social security fraud in the way in which Senator Chipp would believe that it does.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If I can answer the question in my way, as Senator Chaney used to do in the same circumstances I will be grateful. The concern is, of course, justifiable in the light of what the Government did. I will go through it very carefully. We announced last August that we would introduce an assets test, giving a general outline. We said we would not introduce the legislation until November, to give people a chance to look at it and to allow me and others to have discussions with various organisations about the test. Come November, the Opposition announced that that was not enough and that it would defer the legislation. So we introduced the legislation into the House of Representatives and said we would reintroduce it at the start of this session after we had had further consultations, especially in the light of the fact that after the legislation was introduced and passed in February there would be another period of nine months or so until November in which people could further look at it and further talk about what they thought might be anomalies. The Opposition, of course, announced that that was not enough and that it would defer the legislation again. That became an intolerable situation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The problem was that although the assets test would affect only a small percentage of pensioners and although up to 85 per cent would not be affected at all we had the situation-it is an understandable situation in our political system-in which people, including members of the Opposition, were saying to pensioners that they would all be affected, their house would be affected, et cetera. What we did not have at any stage was a suggestion from the Opposition on just what it would do. We know that it was opposed to the lump sum taxation on superannuation. We know that it was opposed to the introduction of the attentuated means test for those over 70. We know that it was opposed to the assets test. But it has had no positive proposals. The only positive proposal was that of Senator Macklin. He wants a national superannuation scheme of the Hancock type which would involve a 5 per cent levy on people's taxable income. That would be an interesting debate in this country.</PARA>
<PARA> We were in a situation where there was uncertainty. That uncertainty was justified in view of the propaganda that had been put around. We thought that the best thing to do was to establish a panel of people. I believe that when that panel of people is announced even the Opposition will accept it as being expert, dispassionate, able to look at the situation and able to take evidence from all those in the community who have a view, including members of the Opposition such as Senator Messner, Mr Peacock and even Senator Walters, if she can get it down on paper. They can come along and say, as they have always said: 'We believe in a needs-based pension system and a needs-based social security system. This is how we would do it. We would not do it in the way in which the Government was going to do it with its assets test. We will do it this way'. It will be a very interesting day--</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I have seen the annual report of the Insurance Commissioner for 1982-83. Like other honourable senators, I would be concerned at a deterioration in the performance of the general insurance industry in this area. Private insurers have in fact accumulated nearly $1,100m in underwriting losses in the past three years and almost half of this loss occurred in 1982-83. Much of the loss has resulted from the compulsory compensation classes of business.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree that we can expect another round of workers compensation and, in fact, compulsory third party premium increases as a result. As Senator Cook says, we have all heard this before. This is the same tired story we have grown used to over the years. It is of great concern because the premium increases which will result-as they have resulted in the past-will be at the expense of a further tightening of the labour market because workers compensation costs are a major indirect cost of labour. In fact, after taxation they are the major cost of this type to various employers. This results in higher inflation because at least some part of workers compensation costs are passed on in higher prices and compulsory third party premiums are included in the consumer price index basket of goods which are calculated every three months. There is also obviously some loss of business profitability and competitiveness.</PARA>
<PARA> This situation is all the more lamentable when one recognises that, after excluding the State government insurance offices, about two-thirds of workers compensation and all compulsory third party business is now operated for the benefit of little more than a handful of insurance companies-of the order of 10 companies at the last count. The only solution to this would seem to be a co- operative effort from both the States and the Commonwealth Government to establish a more rational compensation system. The very serious alternative to this may in fact be a collapsing around our ears with an increasingly severe restraint on economic activity, which I do not think anyone wants.</PARA>
<PARA> I believe, as Senator Cook obviously believes, that we have to look forward to a rational, sensible, sure and economical system of compensation in this country through a national compensation scheme, whether it is done through the Federal Government or with the co-operative effort of the State and Federal governments. I hope that day will come but, like other honourable senators, I hoped that day would come back in 1974 when I was in this place and the idea was first introduced. It seems as though it is a long time coming.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Bolkus referred to the obvious controversy which exists as a result of the passage of the Medicare legislation by the House of Representatives and the Senate and the resultant exaggerated statements that have been made by some groups of specialists and some sections of the Australian Medical Association in respect of the expenditure containment proposals which the Government insists will be followed in the wake of the Medicare legislation. Naturally, of course, the Department of Health, which is the Department most affected by the proposals and my Department, in which there is about one-third or one-quarter of such expenditure in this area, have looked at the costs involved in specialist treatment. Expenditure by the Department of Veterans' Affairs on private specialists in 1982-83 was $32.2m.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> It is interesting to note that in the first seven months of this financial year expenditure has been $22.1m. If those figures are maintained they will result in an increase in expenditure of 18 per cent during a period in which everybody in Australia is being requested to exercise some measure of economic restraint. Of course, employees generally, in accordance with the prices and incomes accord, have followed that request fairly strictly. However, there are sections of the Australian community which are not prepared to put into effect the assurances that they gave at the National Economic Summit Conference in 1983. For example, in my Department in New South Wales expenditure for the first seven months of the financial year has been $11.4m, which represents a projected increase of 14 per cent over 1982-83.</PARA>
<PARA> Included in the list are eight or nine specialists' firms and individual doctors who have benefited annually by amounts in excess of $100,000. In particular, in the area of pathology, six centres in New South Wales have benefited to the tune of between $110,000 and $554,000. As regards the centre which has received payments from my Department of $554,000, this represents five or six times the salary of the Australian Prime Minister. When that figure is multiplied three or four times to take into account the amount which is paid by the Department of Health, one can estimate the desire of the Government to have some containment in the area of payments to specialists in Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Of course, I find it ironic that prominent amongst the list of specialists are several doctors who are leading scurrilous campaigns against Medicare which are not only based on deceit and misinformation but also creating a great deal of confusion in the Australian community. This Government is determined to ventilate publicly those doctors who are making considerable incomes out of specialist attention in our repatriation general hospitals.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Probably one of the areas that both my predecessor, Senator Messner, and I would accept as occasioning a great deal of complaint is that concerning the delays in the repatriation determining system. Clearly it is a very unsatisfactory state of affairs when people who served their country in time of war make application for a pension and have to go through the processes of the system that start at one tier and finish up four tiers later, with a lot of tears in between, by the way. That process takes from an average of 268 days to reach the Repatriation Board, to 784 days to reach the final Repatriation Review Tribunal. Of course, that is very unsatisfactory. At the end of January, for example, 17,000 entitlement claims were waiting to go before the repatriation boards. Another 8,800 pending claims were for an increase in the disability pension. Naturally, of course, those claims have been occasioned by the health of the applicants. Consequently any delay lessens their standard of living. Something like 3,700 entitlement claims were awaiting the Repatriation Commission; 4,500 were before the Repatriation Review Tribunal, as well as 2,700 assessment claims also before the Tribunal. The Government and I regard this backlog as completely unsatisfactory because it often denies benefits to people in their declining years.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, it is normal practice in the Public Service in this country- it has been for many years through all sorts of governments-to prepare for the introduction of legislation which it is announced will be introduced in the Budget in this way. The introduction of an assets test has a long lead time. We have always said that. From the sorts of comments which were made by the Opposition last year I think it was reasonably expected that the legislation would pass in February or March this year.

They have been employed training themselves or training others on the preparation for the introduction of the test which at the moment is deferred.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I am the first to admit that 1,400 people is a lot of people, but I think Senator Hill should remember that the normal turnover of staff in the Department of Social Security is some 300 a month; so it does not take long, if one stops recruitment, to run down that number of people. Also there are many other activities which can be performed in my Department from now on. In the past few years pension reviews, for instance, have been intermittent in some cases. There is a need for more extensive training. In the last five years training was cut down considerably in the Department and this has affected its efficiency.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. Is it a fact that almost all diagnostic specialists in Queensland public hospitals have been employed by the State Government for more than 20 years under contracts almost identical to those proposed for the public health hospitals in other States by the present Federal Minister for Health? Is it not also a fact that, because this system has been proven to work well in Queensland hospitals for more than two decades, it is unlikely that any active support will be forthcoming from doctors in that State for the inexcusable strike now being threatened for Thursday by the mercenary minority of doctors in New South Wales?</PARA></TALK.START>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes, I agree with the gist of Senator Jones's question, but I think it is worthwhile pointing out that he is not quite accurate. In fact the contracts under which the doctors he referred to in Queensland hospitals work are much harsher, and certainly much more restrictive, than the contracts proposed by the present Federal Minister for Health under section 17 of the Health Insurance Act. The Commonwealth Government's initial proposals were that salaried specialists would be able to earn an additional 25 per cent above a senior specialist's salary from private work in a public hospital. That is, they can earn another $12,500 a year on top of the $50,000 a year which is the average per annum salary of senior specialists in hospitals. Visiting specialists and radiologists in hospitals would have been able to earn $62,500 a year without any restrictions. They could then leave 25 per cent of their earnings-between $62,000 and $87,500-in a trust fund and 40 per cent of their earnings above $87,500 in a hospital fund.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Queensland salaried specialists have no private practice rights at all and have not had them for two decades. Queensland hospital specialists would be very attracted to the sorts of contracts that Dr Blewett and the Federal Government are offering under section 17 of the Health Insurance Act. In these circumstances Queensland private practitioners must be very different from their avaricious friends in New South Wales in particular who are indulging in the obscene activity of going on strike when they have an income of more than $90, 000 plus whatever they can earn from private practice. Senator MacGibbon, I notice, has not been going in to bat over the last 20 years for the apparently poverty stricken state of diagnostic specialists in Queensland hospitals.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator GRIMES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Queensland practice has been in place for 20 years. Queensland specialists have been getting less than specialists in other States for 20 years. They have been on much harsher contracts than the contracts suggested by Dr Blewett. Queensland specialists would love to be under the same contracts as those suggested by Dr Blewett. But the Government, and Dr Blewett in particular, has not demanded the imposition of conditions on those even higher earning diagnostic specialists. We have offered to defer the income restraints. Many people would not consider that they were much of a restraint. We have offered to defer these restraints until the whole issue has been examined-particularly the matter of private practice in public hospitals-by a joint Government and Australian Medical Association committee under Professor Pennington, who is the Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Melbourne.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Other more contentious issues, such as the matter of appeals, rights and the preparation of a national list of facility charges for the use of public hospital services and other equipment, have also been referred to the inquiry. This Government's only requirement for doctors who have been trained at public expense and who practise in public hospitals using facilities which are paid for by the taxpayer is that they stick to the schedule fee. That is the only restraint that is on them at the moment. These are the people who are, in fact, going on strike. The schedule fee is drawn up by a committee which is agreed to by the national body, the Australian Medical Association.</PARA>
<PARA> I repeat: It is an absolute obscenity that these medical practitioners should be going on strike in this way when they work in taxpayer-funded facilities and when they have been trained with the taxpayers' money. It is an absolute obscenity that they should go on strike because the Federal Government says: ' Charge what is a fair thing'. These same people-I am quick to point out that I believe that the majority of doctors in the community do not approve of these doctors going on strike-would be the first to complain about unionists in another area who earn much less going on strike.</PARA>
<PARA> In fact, as one of my colleagues has said, they make Norm Gallagher look socially responsible. I put it to honourable senators that what Dr Blewett and the Federal Government are doing is, in fact, being perfectly reasonable with these people. The fact that Mr Bjelke-Petersen and Mr Austin in the Queensland Government have come out in support of surgeons in New South Wales who are going to indulge in a strike of this type when, for the two decades that they have been in Government, Queensland's own doctors have been working under much harsher and stricter contracts which imposed much greater restraints on diagnostic specialists in Queensland hospitals is the absolute epitome of hypocrisy.</PARA>
<PARA> This Government will not back down under these circumstances. We will not back down under political or economic blackmail such as this. We believe that those who use publicly funded facilities and who are trained with taxpayers' money have some sort of social responsibility in this country. If they will not demonstrate that social responsibility, we will have to impose such a responsibility on them.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Obviously the Government and I are very concerned about reports appearing in newspapers daily and coming to us from vice-chancellors and other responsible bodies about the explosion of demand for higher education places. It is something that we anticipated and indeed took steps to cope with in our first Budget by making an extra $10m available for an extra 3,000 tertiary places. Those extra 3,000 tertiary places have been taken up according to our guidelines of providing increased possibilities for tertiary study in areas which had previously been disadvantaged. But quite clearly the legacy of the Fraser Government is still with us and is the main cause of this unhappy situation. During the seven years of the Fraser Administration recurrent and capital funding for the higher education sector was systematically cut back to a stage where there is virtually no infrastructure to deal with this excessive demand.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Let me say a couple of things about the increased demand for higher education places. The Government welcomes and I welcome the renewed confidence that young people are displaying in undertaking further education. It has been very much part of our Government's strategy to try to restore the confidence of young people in gaining further education and training, because we are very well aware that young people who leave secondary education without an adequate level of skills and training and who do not undertake some form of further education and training will simply not be able to compete in the improved economy which we are now seeing with the kinds of jobs that are becoming available. We also have a concern on equity grounds. It seems to us to be quite inequitable that some young people who may finish their education in a government school, or even a non-government school, at the age of 15 and 16 are getting a much smaller slice of the education cake than those who complete their secondary education and then undertake higher education. Indeed, as my colleague Senator Grimes pointed out earlier in Question Time today, the highest paid people in our community, namely doctors, have available to them a very expensive publicly-provided education at universities. So there is the question of equity in our wishing to encourage young people to pursue their education, as well as the obvious fact, very well established now, that more than four years of secondary education is necessary and desirable if young people are to pursue satisfactory post-school education and work.</PARA>
<PARA> We are very encouraged and heartened to see that young people are now seeking places in higher education. However, the fact is that young people are seeking many more places and are qualified by their tertiary entrance scores for many more places than are available. This is not a situation, given that it resulted from seven years of neglect by the previous Fraser Administration, that we have been able to reverse in one Budget. We took some steps. We increased recurrent and capital funding for technical and further education. As a result, many more places in TAFE are available, although again not enough to meet the demand. In higher education, as I said, we have created an extra 3,000 places, particularly in areas which have been disadvantaged, but clearly that is not enough to meet the demand.</PARA>
<PARA> However, as a result of the urgent situation that has been created by the increased demand for places, the Cabinet considered at its meeting yesterday what steps we can take in the short term. We wanted to take steps which would not interfere with the proper process of the report and advice from the Tertiary Education Commission which I expect at the end of next month. We have decided to accelerate the approval of the forward commitment of capital funds for those three projects to which the Tertiary Education Commission, in two published reports now, has given the highest priority. They are the Kingswood campus of the Nepean College of Advanced Education, which will have a total cost over 1985 -86 of $5.3m; the Latrobe University library project, which is a $6.3m project; and the Coburg campus of the Phillip Institute of Technology, which is a $25m project.

We acknowledge that. But by permitting the forward commitment of these three major projects, we will be putting those institutions at least on notice that they will have increased physical facilities for the 1986 year instead of the 1987 year. That means that their efforts to take in a higher number of students this year-each of those three institutions has increased its numbers this year-will be encouraged because they know that any interim arrangements they make by way of accommodation will be overcome one academic year earlier. Of course, we wish to do a great deal more in both capital and recurrent assistance to higher education, but further decisions will have to await my receiving advice from the Tertiary Education Commission and the issuing by me on behalf of the Government of the funding guidelines for the next triennium.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA>Receipt of Tapes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Early in the evening of 1 February-following an appointment arranged half an hour earlier-and then on 2 February 1984, representatives of the Age newspaper furnished to me the following material:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) four tapes containing what appeared to be 11 recorded telephone conversations between a Sydney solicitor and a number of other persons;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) 524 pages of documents, divided into six bundles, purporting to be the summaries and direct transcripts of approximately 3,000 telephone conversations between a large number of persons. </PARA>
<PARA>In providing the material the representatives of the Age stated to me that the material had been given to the Age by Mr Bob Bottom, who in turn was believed to have received it from some source within the New South Wales Police Force, although no detailed information or proof was offered as to the source. I drew it to the attention of the Age representatives, who appeared to be unaware of the point, that to the extent that the material was authentic and had been gathered otherwise than under Australian Federal Police warrant, it appeared that massive breaches of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, or its legislative predecessor, had been committed. </PARA>
<PARA>Action Taken</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> On 2 February 1984 I discussed the matter with the Special Minister of State, the Hon. M. J. Young, and set in train the arrangements carried into effect the following day, 3 February. On 3 February I wrote to the Special Minister of State, requesting him to arrange for a police investigation of the material, and on the same day I caused the material to be handed over to a senior officer of the Australian Federal Police. Later that day the Special Minister of State wrote to me confirming that he had asked the AFP to investigate the material with a view to determining whether federal offences had been committed. </PARA>
<PARA> There was never at any time any basis whatever for the reported suggestions by Senators Chipp and Durack that the Federal Police investigation of the Age tapes and transcripts given to me that week would be confined to the circumstances in which they were made, and not extend to their content. I made this clear in a statement issued on 4 February, when I said that the Australian Federal Police had been asked, through the Special Minister of State, to investigate fully and report upon all aspects of the matter, including the possible commission of any Federal offences revealed by the content of the tapes and transcripts. </PARA>
<PARA> A preliminary report from the Commissioner of Police was received by the Special Minister of State, and through him by me, on the morning of Monday 13 February, and was immediately considered. The report stated that the material disclosed the probability of an unauthorised, and accordingly illegal, interception of telephone calls in New South Wales. It also identified in general terms a number of matters requiring further examination and investigation; asked for assistance from the Attorney-General's Department in assessing the material; and identified a series of procedural options for carrying the investigation forward: The favoured one, so far as possible Federal offences were concerned, being investigation under a Commonwealth special prosecutor. </PARA>
<PARA> It was decided, as a possible prelude to the Special Prosecutor option being pursued, that the Director of Public Prosecutions-designate and current President of the Law Council of Australia, Mr Ian Temby, QC, should be briefed to advise on what offences against Federal law, if any, appeared to be disclosed or suggested by the material, and what further inquiries should be made. Mr Temby was to be asked to advise on as a matter of urgency, and to give priority attention to, the position of the judge allegedly involved in the taped conversations. The Acting Crown Solicitor flew to Perth that afternoon to brief Mr Temby, and Mr Temby prepared his opinion over the course of the next two days , assisted by consultations both with the Acting Crown Solicitor and the senior AFP officer who had been in charge of the initial police investigation. </PARA>
<PARA> Mr Temby's opinion became available to me in vocadex form in the afternoon of 15 February. It confirmed that breaches of the Commonwealth Telecommunications ( Interception) Act 1979 and its predecessor, the Telephonic Communications ( Interception) Act 1960, were likely to have occurred, and that there were other matters that might require further investigation. I table Mr Temby's opinion, complete except for the deletion of names, other identifying characteristics and certain information supplied to him in confidence by the AFP. </PARA>
<PARA> The substance of Mr Temby's opinion, and the preceding police report, was summarised in the joint statement issued by the Special Minister of State and me on 17 February. Following the receipt of Mr Temby's opinion, and consultations with the New South Wales Government and Police Force, the Government made a number of decisions about the proper further course of the inquiry, and these were also announced in the joint statement of 17 February:</PARA>
<PARA> a special prosecutor would be appointed to supervise further investigations in relation to the tapes and transcripts handed by the Age newspaper to me on 1 and 2 February 1984;</PARA>
<PARA> the role of the special prosecutor would be independent of the Government;</PARA>
<PARA> he would supervise a joint investigating team, consisting of selected police officers from the Australian Federal Police and the New South Wales Police Force , and would be charged with bringing prosecutions for any breaches of Federal law discovered as a result of investigations into, or in relation to, the contents of those materials;</PARA>
<PARA> questions concerning State law that may arise from the materials would be a matter for the law enforcement authorities of the State of New South Wales. </PARA>
<PARA>The statement of 17 February also announced that Mr Temby would be recommended for appointment as Special Prosecutor. The appointment was made by the Governor- General on 21 February. Mr Temby's terms of reference have been specified by me for the purposes of paragraph 6 (1) (a) of the Special Prosecutors Act 1982 as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) activities illegal under Commonwealth or Territory law in relation to the interception of alleged telephone communications which are referred to in the materials, including cassette tapes, delivered by representatives of the Age newspaper to the Attorney-General on 1 and 2 February 1984; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) any other activities illegal under Commonwealth or Territory law established as a result of investigations into, or in relation to, the contents of those materials. </PARA>
<PARA>Although the most obvious grounds for investigation by the Special Prosecutor clearly concern the circumstances of the interceptions, there are several other possible offences under Commonwealth law that may have been committed and which will require further investigation-although in some instances, as is made clear in Mr Temby's opinion, the raw material on which such investigations could proceed is extremely limited and tenuous. These matters are:</PARA>
<PARA> possible offences arising out of an immigration racket-which has already been the subject of investigation and successful prosecution-involving a former Commonwealth public servant and AFP officers;</PARA>
<PARA> possible improper release of information by AFP officers;</PARA>
<PARA> possible currency regulation charges in relation to a money courier;</PARA>
<PARA> possible tax evasion; and</PARA>
<PARA> possible fixing of a case in the Australian Capital Territory</PARA>
<PARA>I should make it clear that in addition to being examined by Special Prosecutor Temby's team, some of the material has also been forwarded to Special Prosecutor Redlich, and to Royal Commissioner Mr Justice Stewart, as it is possibly relevant to matters on which each are working or have worked. </PARA>
<PARA> It should perhaps be stated, because it has been questioned in some quarters, that the reason that Mr Temby was asked to accept the role of Special Prosecutor in this matter was simply that he was the Director of Public Prosecutions- designate, scheduled to take up that office on 5 March. When he formally becomes DPP, he will continue to act as a Special Prosecutor in this matter, but the two roles will for practical purposes become assimilated. This is consistent with the policy in this respect which underlay the creation of the office of DPP and which was explained to Parliament at the time of enactment of the enabling legislation: Namely, eventually to absorb the work of the existing Special Prosecutors-Messrs Redlich and Gyles, QC-under the DPP umbrella, and not to appoint any new Special Prosecutor other than in the most exceptional circumstances. </PARA>
<PARA> On Saturday 18 February I indicated orally to the Solicitor-General that I would be referring certain questions of law to him to ascertain whether his views confirmed the view of the law expressed by Mr Temby in relation to the meaning of 'misbehaviour' in section 72 of the Constitution. This was followed up by a written reference on Monday 20 February. I will refer to and table the Solicitor-General's opinion later in this statement. </PARA>
<PARA> A question has arisen as to the action taken by the Government in relation to the article 'Big Shots Bugged', published by the National Times in its issue of 25 November-1 December 1983, which was clearly based on similar, perhaps identical, material to that in the possession of the Age. This article was the subject of questions to me by Senator Archer on 30 November 1983 and 8 December 1983 and, of course, today. On 30 November he asked whether I would assure the Senate that the allegations contained in that article would be fully investigated to determine whether there had been any breaches of Commonwealth law, and that appropriate action would be taken. In my reply, I said that I had been advised by the Special Minister of State that the AFP were investigating to see whether the material in the National Times could possibly have come from information supplied by them and that I was awaiting further information. On 8 December Senator Archer asked a follow-up question, repeating his request for assurances, and I told the Senate that I had not received any further information to that point from the Special Minister of State. </PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the investigation by the AFP had not been completed before 3 February, and is now encompassed in the larger investigation arising out of the material given to me by the Age. One of the difficulties involved in this area is that the National Times, unlike the Age, is not prepared to reveal to the proper authorities the material which it has in its possession. It has been widely reported, not least in the National Times itself on 17 February, that the New South Wales Police Commissioner, Mr Abbott, requested the National Times to provide him with its material, only to be refused on the ground that, as the document purported to be a police document, it should already be in his possession. I requested the National Times on 21 February, to provide me with material in its possession relevant to the inquiry being conducted by the Special Prosecutor. To date, I have had no reply. </PARA>
<PARA> This description of the action taken since 1 February should demonstrate to any observer that the Government's actions since the receipt of the materials have been both prompt and proper in every respect. I have dealt so far with the particular procedural steps taken by the Government in this matter and the reasons for acting as we did when we did. It remains now to address a number of particular issues which arise from the publication of the Age articles, and I do so under the following headings: First, authenticity and evidentiary status of the material; secondly, references to a judge and the question of 'misbehaviour' ; and, thirdly, privacy, illegality and responsible journalism.</PARA>
<PARA>Authenticity and Evidentiary Status</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>I cannot emphasise too strongly the dubious status of the material in question. The tapes and transcripts given to me are clearly not originals. The locations of the original tapes and transcripts are not known to the Government. Who took the copies from which the Age copies were derived is unknown to us. The material is therefore completely anonymous and completely unauthen- ticated. </PARA>
<PARA> This is not some technical point designed to divert attention from issues of substance, as some media comments have perhaps suggested. We simply have no means, and are unlikely in the future to have any means, of being sure that we have a full, untampered with, reliable account of the conversations that appear to have been intercepted. It is not even a matter of being able to check the content of the Age-supplied transcripts against that of the Age-supplied tapes, since the two categories of material are mutually exclusive: None of the material on the tapes is in the transcripts, and none of the material in the transcripts can be checked against anything on the tapes. There is no basis at all for assuming the authenticity, in whole or part, of the purely written material and there are a number of problems confronting any acceptance of the tapes at their face value. </PARA>
<PARA>The Tapes</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA>As to the tapes, there is a very real question as to whether they have been tampered with. The New South Wales Solicitor-General's opinion confirms an impression to be gained by what I will call a layperson's hearing of the tapes. She said</PARA>
<PARA> In some conversations there are changes in speech patterns and/or speed which are to the untrained ear suggestive of 'editing'. </PARA>
<PARA>She went on:</PARA>
<PARA> Without full technical assessment it is not possible to exclude the possibility of 'editing' and/or 'patching' of conversations. I have requested the Commissioner of Police, who now has possession of the documents and tapes provided to the Attorney to undertake a full technical assessment of the tapes. This may be a lengthy process and, in any event, may not be reliable because the tapes are, as I have already stated, clearly not the original intercept recordings. </PARA>

<PARA>The Documents</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The so-called transcripts in most instances are not in fact transcripts in the sense of being verbatim reports of everything alleged to have been said. The documents made available to me consisted of 6 bundles:</PARA>
<PARA> The first bundle, of 64 pages, apparently corresponding with the bundle identified by New South Wales Solicitor-General, Ms Mary Gaudron, QC, as 'B-1', purports to contain summaries or records of conversations over a telephone in March 1976. The party whose telephone was apparently intercepted, was identified in the documents as 'Target' or 'T'. The subject matter of the conversations is very wide, but is substantially concerned with horse races and SP betting. </PARA>
<PARA> The second bundle, of 106 pages, apparently corresponding with Gaudron bundle ' A-4', purports to contain summaries or records of conversations over a telephone in March and April 1979. The telephone intercepted appears to be that of a Sydney solicitor. Included amongst these conversations are a number of conversations between the solicitor and a judge. </PARA>
<PARA> The third bundle, of 146 pages, apparently corresponding with Gaudron bundle 'B -2', purports to contain summaries or records of conversations over a telephone in the period June-July-August 1979. The summaries and extracts appear to relate to 35 tapes of conversations in that period. The telephone intercepted was substantially used by one 'D' although a number of other persons seem to have used the telephone in that period. Again the subject matter of the conversations is very wide. Apart from personal matters, horse racing and SP betting appear to be the major subjects of the conversations. </PARA>
<PARA> The fourth bundle, of 97 pages, apparently corresponding with Gaudron bundle 'A -3', purports to contain summaries or records of conversations over a telephone during February 1980. The telephone appears to be that of the same Sydney solicitor. Again the subject matter of the conversations is very wide. Again the material includes much of conversation between the solicitor and the judge. </PARA>
<PARA> The fifth bundle, of 67 pages, apparently corresponding to Gaudron bundle 'B-3' , labelled 'Trimbole Tapes', purports to contain summaries or records of conversations over a telephone over a period March-May 1981. The telephone appears to be that of a person described as 'Bob' although a number of other persons apparently used the telephone. Again the conversations cover a wide variety of subject matter but racing and SP betting figure prominently. </PARA>
<PARA> The sixth bundle, of 44 pages, apparently corresponding to Gaudron bundle 'A-2' , consists of two documents. The first document is a three-page report which is undated and contains no reference to an author. The document refers to a number of prominent persons and makes very serious allegations against those persons. The second document is described as a summary of information supplied by an informant in relation to the solicitor and is in the form of summaries of telephone conversations over the period February to May 1980. The two documents are related in that the allegations made in the first document appear to be based on the summaries in the second document. </PARA>
<PARA> Both Mr Temby, QC, and the Solicitor-General for New South Wales, who appears to have examined essentially the same material as Mr Temby, state that there is no authentication of either the tapes or the documentary material. In terms of the law of evidence this means that the material is worthless. Of course, even if it were to be established that the tapes and transcripts were authentic in every respect, that there had been no editing of or tampering with the tapes, and that the transcripts and summaries were exact and faithful reports of what was said, it does not follow for a moment that what was said by any individual in any particular conversation was true. Quite apart from the danger of ironic, joking or careless statements being taken at their literal face value, it is not at all uncommon for people, especially when they believe they are talking privately and not in any way for the record, to brag, exaggerate, fantasise or tell straight-out untruths. </PARA>
<PARA>References to a Judge and the Question of 'Misbehaviour'</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> Any allegations involving a member of the Federal judiciary are matters of serious concern. Any government must treat such allegations as very serious matters. The Fraser Government claimed to do so when I raised serious questions of bias in relation to the then Chief Justice of the High Court in 1980 not in any casual or partial way, as here, but in a fully documented speech in the Senate occupying some 28 pages of Hansard (Senate, Hansard, 29 April 1980, pp. 1897-1925). </PARA>
<PARA> In the 1980 case, the Prime Minister said that the serious matter raised-a conflict of interest arising out of family shareholding, and one which was squarely and directly related to the conduct of his judicial office-was a question which was wholly one for the individual judge to decide (House of Representatives, Hansard, 29 April 1980, p. 2348). In the present case, as I have indicated, the Government referred the relevant material for examination and report to the Federal Police and then to Mr Temby. The substance of both reports was summarised by the Special Minister of State and me in our joint statement of 17 February as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Both the report and opinion concluded . . . that in relation to the alleged involvement of a Judge in telephone conversations with a solicitor, the material -if authentic-could not support any conclusion that the Judge had been guilty of criminal misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA> Nor, in the opinion of Mr Temby, could the content of the material-if authentic -support in any way a conclusion that there had been 'misbehaviour' within the meaning of section 72 of the Australian Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> Both the police report and Mr Temby's opinion make it clear that there is no basis upon which any further police or Special Prosecutor investigation of the alleged behaviour of the Judge, as revealed by the tapes and transcripts, could be justified. </PARA>
<PARA>One might hope that that is where the matter will be allowed to rest-in the interests not only of the judge concerned, who has already had to endure a disgraceful campaign of gossip and innuendo, but also of the whole institution of the judiciary. In fairness to the judge concerned, however, I made arrangements to interview him on the afternoon of 15 February, in order to put the material in question to him and get, should he be minded to make it, some indication of his response. The fact that such an interview took place was mentioned by me in my Press conference on 17 February. Since the timing of that interview appears to have itself attracted some questioning, I should make it clear that it was governed by two considerations: First, the desire to give to the judge the earliest possible opportunity to make his own response to the allegations concerning him; but secondly, not to do so until I was satisfied- following the reports from the AFP and Mr Temby-that to put the relevant material to him would not in any way prejudice further police investigations. </PARA>
<PARA> Both at the interview on 15 February, and at a subsequent brief interview on 24 February, I was accompanied by the Permanent Head of my Department, Mr Pat Brazil. On both occasions His Honour strongly questioned the authenticity of the material and referred in terms of the strongest conviction to the outrage done to his and to his family's privacy, and to his objection to the principle of guilt by association being applied to him. In respect of specific matters raised by the published material, he either specifically denied the factual accuracy of the allegations concerning him, or gave explanations which put those allegations in a rather different context than that evident at first sight. </PARA>
<PARA> For present purposes it is unnecessary to give more detail than that, and I do not propose to do so. When material of contested authenticity is obtained in circumstances which, at the best, are manifestly illegal and gross invasions of privacy, the onus of explanation should not have to lie upon the target of the attack. To argue otherwise is to place all public figures who may be similarly attacked-and the institutions of which they may be part-in an invidious position . For obvious reasons, nowhere is this more clearly the case than in relation to members of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA>The Question of 'Misbehaviour'</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The Government has given careful consideration to whether there is anything in the Age material which-assuming for present purposes its authenticity-might properly be claimed to amount to or point to misbehaviour within the meaning of section 72 of the Constitution. That section provides that a Federal judge shall not be removed, except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity. I am satisfied, and the Government is satisfied, that there is no basis at all on which any substantive motion based on misbehaviour could or should be moved. </PARA>
<PARA> The Government initially referred for advice the question of misbehaviour to the Director of Public Prosecutions-designate, with the request that he consider this, as a possibly separate issue, at the same time as he was considering whether any criminal offences were involved. That part of Mr Temby's opinion which deal with the meaning of misbehaviour in section 72 of the Constitution and which sets forth the conclusion he reached states:</PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing in the material I have seen, assuming its authenticity, which would prove or in any way support the conclusion that [the Judge] has been guilty of misbehaviour within the meaning of section 72 (ii) of the Constitution . At least ordinarily such misbehaviour must be in a matter pertaining to the office held although conviction for an infamous offence which renders the person concerned unfit to exercise the office is apparently sufficient. Quick and Garran, 'The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth' p. 731; Halsbury 'The Laws of England', 4th ed., Vol. 8, 680; The Earl of Shrewsbury's case, 9 Co. Rep. 41''. </PARA>
<PARA>Quick and Garran, the most contemporaneous and authoritative commentary on the Constitution, quotes on the meaning of misbehaviour in section 72 the following passage in Todd, Parliamentary Government in England, second edition, page 857:</PARA>
<PARA> Misbehaviour includes, firstly, the improper exercise of judicial functions; secondly, wilful neglect of duty, or non-attendance; and thirdly, a conviction for any infamous offence, by which, although it be not connected with the duties of his office, the offender is rendered unfit to exercise any office or public franchise. </PARA>
<PARA>The opinion I have now received from the Solicitor-General, and which I now table, has substantially confirmed the test that Mr Temby applied. The Solicitor -General points out that the requirement under the Constitution is not conviction in a court of law but proof to the Parliament. It is important to note what he goes on to say:</PARA>
<PARA> Inasmuch as Parliament considers the matter, the question is whether there is proved offence against the general law 'of such a nature as to warrant the conclusion that the incumbent is unfit to exercise the office'. Parliament is not at large to define proved misbehaviour by reference to its own standards or views of suitability for office or moral or social character or conduct. The Parliamentary inquiry is whether commission of an offence of the requisite quality and seriousness is proved. Parliament would act beyond power if it sought to apply wider definition or criteria for misbehaviour than the recognised meaning of misbehaviour not pertaining to office. </PARA>
<PARA>The Solicitor-General goes on to answer the specific question of law I put to him as follows:</PARA>
<PARA> Misbehaviour is limited in meaning in section 72 of the Constitution to matters pertaining to-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) judicial office, including non-attendance, neglect of or refusal to perform duties; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the commission of an offence against the general law of such a quality as to indicate that the incumbent is unfit to exercise the office. </PARA>
<PARA>Misbehaviour is defined as breach of condition to hold office during good behaviour. It is not limited to conviction in a court of law. A matter pertaining to office or a breach of the general law of the requisite seriousness in a matter not pertaining to office may be found by proof, in appropriate manner, to the Parliament in proceedings where the offender has been given proper notice and opportunity to defend himself. </PARA>
<PARA>My understanding throughout of what Mr Temby considered to be the test was that it was substantially the same as that which has now been identified by the Solicitor-General. It is clear from the relevant paragraph that I quoted above from Mr Temby's opinion that he did consider whether the material, assuming its authenticity, in any way supported a conclusion that a serious criminal offence had been committed. His conclusion, to which I have just referred, was that there was no material that in any way supported that conclusion. Mr Temby, both by reason of his extensive criminal law experience and by virtue of his office of Director of Public Prosecutions-designate was clearly the most appropriate expert adviser on these criminal and evidentary matters. </PARA>
<PARA> I would only add that the issue of the meaning of misbehaviour within the terms of section 72 of the Constitution, and the question of the naming of the judge, raises in my view a quite fundamental constitutional issue relating to the separation of powers. This matter is referred to in the Solicitor-General's examination of the legislative history of section 72. Section 72 deals with the sensitive interface of the separation of powers between the legislature and the judiciary. In this regard, the Constitution was clearly established on the premise of separation of power between these two institutions. Because of the sensitivity of this separation-</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I have corrected the text. It should be 'judiciary'. I thought that the honourable senator would be acute enough to pick me up on that. I might also add that it involves the question of the relationship between the Executive and the judiciary as well which matter, no doubt, we may find ourselves debating. Because of the sensitivity of this separation, it is acutely important that all honourable senators and members be restrained in dealing with matters of alleged misbehaviour of judges.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Criticism of members of the judiciary by the legislature is a very sensitive matter, and certainly should not be based on the very unsatisfactory material which is available here. Any action asserting misbehaviour which were to be based merely on party political or other special interests would be quite indefensible in principle, and would degrade this Parliament and the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA>Privacy, Illegality and Responsible Journalism</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> The most worrying aspect of this whole matter is, I believe, the massive illegality and invasion of privacy which appears to have been involved; and, associated with that, the profound indifference, even cynicism, with which that illegality and privacy invasion has been greeted by some members of the media and Opposition spokesmen. </PARA>
<PARA> The Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979, by section 7, makes it an offence to intercept a communication passing over a telecommunications system unless authorised by Commonwealth laws. Before that Act came into operation on 1 June 1980, the only relevant legislation was the Telephonic Communications ( Interception) Act 1960, under which there was no legislative authority for any telephone interceptions by anyone-other than the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation on national security grounds. If the material is accurate and authentic-that of course very much remains to be established-then it is clear that very large scale unauthorised interception of private telephone calls has taken place, contrary either to that Act or the previous law. </PARA>
<PARA> Section 7 of the 1979 Act also makes it an offence to divulge or to communicate to another person, or make use of or record, any information obtained by intercepting a communication passing over a telecommunications system or obtained by virtue of a warrant. This offence is not confirmed to the divulging of information obtained pursuant to law, but applies to the divulging of all information obtained by intercepting a communication passing over a telecommunications system. Accordingly if the material is in fact information obtained by an intercept, then the divulging of that material by any person to another person would constitute an offence. As the Solicitor-General for New South Wales points out in her advice, the effect of this provision may be even to make it an offence for her to divulge information contained in the material to other people. </PARA>
<PARA> It is this Government's view that the investigation of the circumstances in which this material originated should be pursued with the greatest vigour. It is also the Government's view that if, in the course of those investigations, other illegalities are established the law will take its course in relation to those illegalities. I make it clear however that the first concern of the Government in this regard is to investigate what is, or what appears to be, a massive invasion of the privacy of the citizens of this country. </PARA>
<PARA> It is important to appreciate just what is involved in invasions of privacy of the kind that appear to have occurred in this case. Confidentiality of personal communications appears to have been breached on a massive scale. The tapes, transcripts and summaries given to me by the Age on their face record approximately 3,000 separate conversations, involving dozens of different people . </PARA>
<PARA> Unless the law comes down very hard on unauthorised eavesdropping-and also limits very dramatically, as the present law does, the circumstances in which authorised eavesdropping may take place-no one in this country, and certainly no one in any position of public responsibility, can ever feel safe again in having a private telephone conversation. No one will ever be able to blow off steam with loved ones or trusted intimates; no one will be able to gossip, or brag, or exaggerate, or fib in the way that every one of us has done from time to time in circumstances which we would be appalled to ever find made public. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Let anyone who is without sin cast the first stone. A great deal of reference has been made to organised crime in relation to the present tapes and transcripts. Many of the matters that might appear to lend themselves to this description have already been the subject of extensive police investigation and action; anything else that needs to be investigated will be investigated by either the Special Prosecutor's Joint Investigation Team or the New South Wales State authorities. What needs to be appreciated is that if there is any new kind of organised crime revealed by this material, and constituted by its proliferation, it is an organised crime against privacy.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Those that have orchestrated this proliferation of smear and innuendo bear a very heavy responsibility. A situation has been created in which any persons whose identity can be associated with a reference on these tapes or transcripts immediately will be assumed to be involved somehow in organised crime or official corruption. They will bear an impossible burden of proving their innocence. They will be convicted in the public arena by the unacceptable process of guilt by association. </PARA>
<PARA> It is to be hoped that those in this and other parliaments around the nation who might be minded to contribute further to the process of identification, sheltering as they can under the cover of absolute privilege, and knowing that they will never have to defend or establish their position in a court of law, will think long and hard before they do so. </PARA>
<PARA> The investigation of the matters that need to be investigated is proceeding competently, honestly and quickly, at the Commonwealth level under completely independent supervision. There is nothing to be gained, and a great deal to be lost, by further smearing individuals who have already suffered a good deal of humiliation and hurt in the way this affair has developed so far. </PARA>
<PARA>Responsible Journalism</PARA>
<PARA></PARA>
<PARA> I think it needs to be said, finally, that the role of the Age newspaper in this whole affair has not been a very proud one, particularly for a paper so prone to suggest its moral and intellectual leadership of the profession of journalism in this country, and which is certainly believed by many to occupy that role. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I appreciate that is the solution that springs readily to the lips of Senator Lajovic, but it is not one shared by honourable senators on this side of the chamber. About the only respect in which the paper has behaved completely commendably has been in giving the material in its possession to me so as to enable proper investigation to be carried out-more than can be said for the National Times, which still remains apparently quite unwilling to co-operate .</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> But this gesture was somewhat counter-balanced by the Age having its story already set up for front page treatment the following day at the very time the material was being handed over. Had the paper been genuinely more concerned to root out possible crime and corruption than to increase its circulation, it would have given the material to the Government well before it ever went to press-perhaps, if it felt that there was any danger the Government would be disposed to ignore it, also overtly making the material available to a responsible Opposition politician-if one can be found-at the same time. </PARA>
<PARA> It is acknowledged that this would hardly be a normal course for a newspaper to follow-papers are, after all, in the business of selling news, not crime fighting-but this was hardly a normal situation. The material was, if it was at all authentic, obtained in manifestly illegal circumstances; it manifestly involved outrageous invasions of privacy in so far as individuals were-or were ever likely to be-identified; and it involved putting at serious risk the credibility and status of, and public regard for, the whole institution of the judiciary. </PARA>
<PARA> These considerations should at least have led the paper to wrestle with its collective conscience before publishing, and to actively explore alternative courses of action. There is no evidence that it did so. The editorial columns show no particular signs of agonising over the principles involved-whether the end did indeed justify the means and indeed showed little sign of anything but cynical indifference to the values and principles I have just mentioned. </PARA>
<PARA> Worse even than that was the way the story was handled. The first article in the series, on 2 February, occupied most of the front page under the banner heading 'Secret Tapes of Judge'. Less than a third of the way into the story, very prominently located at the top of the second column, appeared a series of paragraphs relating to sexual matters, in particular the following:</PARA>
<PARA>'In other conversations the Judge talked of his drunkenness and sexual achievements. </PARA>
<PARA> 'A transcript reveals that the solicitor asked: 'Did you have a good time?'. The Judge replied, 'if you can call getting tired and drunk and f...... everything a good time, yeah . . .'. </PARA>
<PARA>We now know, of course, that the transcript revealed nothing of the kind. There are no conversations in which the judge talked of his drunkenness or sexual achievements. The quotation in question is clearly attributed in the transcript not to the judge but to the solicitor. The mistake was not a peripheral or minor one. It involved one of the central premises of the whole article-that the integrity and fitness for office of the judge was in question-and the potential damage done to the target and his family was incalculable. But the acknowledgement of error, when it was eventually forced out of the Age two weeks later, was less than handsome. It did not appear on page 1, and it certainly did not appear under that stark and familiar heading 'We Were Wrong'. It appeared right at the bottom of page 3, in a single column, under the somewhat less than self-lacerating heading 'Wran points out error in police tape article'. </PARA>
<PARA> The editor was concerned to insist at the time-as no doubt will others-that the sexual issue was in any event a marginal one. Objectively, he may well have been right. But if that were so, why give that part of the story so much initial prominence? Of course the answer is clear, and it does not-again-do the paper much credit. One does not have to know much about human nature-and newspapers that survive know a lot about human nature-to know that this was the aspect of the story that was likely to command the keenest and most fascinated attention. One did not have to have one's ear very closely to the ground to know that this was the aspect of the story that was attracting the most gossip and speculation in the bars, cars and living rooms of the nation. And one does not have to have much imagination to appreciate that this was the aspect of the story which was likely to cause the most embarrassment and humiliation to the man in question in his personal and family relationships. </PARA>
<PARA> The Age newspaper has now called for a Royal Commission, and no doubt others will be minded to do likewise. But there is simply no evident necessity for any step of this kind now to be taken. The Government has acted quickly, responsibly and responsively. It has put in train a full, independently supervised investigation of the circumstances in which this material was obtained and the Federal offences its contents might reveal. That investigation will be conducted competently and with vigour. As I said at the Australian National University conference last weekend:</PARA>
<PARA> 'It is not necessary, and indeed it is quite destructive of some of the very values it is sought to preserve-including in particular public confidence in the executive, legislative and judicial institutions of government-for every piece of scuttlebutt or tale of scandal to result in a full-scale, full-length Royal Commission. </PARA>
<PARA> 'The three most recent Commissions of Inquiry in New South Wales-the Street Royal Commission into the ABC allegations against Neville Wran, and the Cross Inquiries into the Sinclair and Bottom allegations-should have amply demonstrated by now that where there is smoke, there is not always fire. </PARA>
<PARA> 'They should also have graphically demonstrated the kind of damage, humiliation and hurt that even the most ill-justified muck-raking can cause its victims. </PARA>
<PARA> 'It is not good enough for a newspaper-whether its motives be high-minded, political, cynical, or just plain circulation-greedy-to publish salacious gossip about people in high places, to disregard the illegal or privacy-invading (or both) circumstances in which it was obtained, to deliberately generate an atmosphere of disquiet, and then to thunder about the necessity for a Royal Commission to allay the very fears which it alone has generated.'</PARA>
<PARA>The investigation of crime is not a matter for amateur sleuths operating in the public arena or public forums. The way in which this whole matter has been developed and manipulated has been against the public interest. It has outraged privacy and threatens basic human rights. If crime is to be detected, and offenders brought to justice, it will be done not by sensationalism of a salacious Press story or a muck-raking question, but by careful sifting and proper professional police investigation under independent supervision. That is the course which this Government has chosen to follow in this matter, and that is the course to which we intend to stay. I seek leave to incorporate the Temby opinion and the Solicitor-General's opinion in Hansard for convenient reference.</PARA>
<PARA> Leave granted. </PARA>

<PARA>Opinion of Mr Ian Temby Q.C., 15 February 1984</PARA>
<PARA>(Edited only by the exclusion of names, identifying characteristics, and certain information supplied by the AFP)</PARA>
<PARA>OPINION</PARA>
<PARA>I am instructed that ''The Age'' newspaper in Melbourne recently furnished to the Attorney-General 524 pages of documents, which are or purport to be comments on and transcripts of intercepted telephone conversations, and some tapes of intercepted telephone conversations. Copies of each have been made available to me. I have been instructed by the Acting Crown Solicitor to advise with respect to them as a matter of some urgency. I have not personally checked the transcripts of the tapes for accuracy. For the purposes of this opinion I assume that they are accurate. I have advised that this should be checked. It should be stressed that little is known as to the provenance of the material made available to me, and that it appears to have been abstracted selectively: the documents are not continuous or complete. </PARA>
<PARA> Whether the documents or the tapes, or both, are genuine, in whole or in part, is not known to me or to those who instruct me. </PARA>
<PARA> It appears from the material I have seen that on a number of occasions [the Judge . . .] had telephone discussions with [the Solicitor]. A matter of particular concern is whether [the Judge] has, or may have on the basis of the material, committed any criminal offence. I am also asked to give consideration to whether the material, assuming it to be genuine, could warrant the conclusion that ''the ground of proved misbehaviour'' could be made out or supported as against [the Judge] pursuant to section 72 (ii) of the Constitution: in that event he could be removed from office by the Governor-General on an address from both Houses of Parliament. That is of course a matter upon which only the Parliament could decide, if it chose to embark upon the exercise. It is thought appropriate that I should also comment as to whether, on the same assumption, the conduct of [the Judge] appears to have been injudicious. According to the Macquarie Dictionary, ''judicious'' means ''(1) using or showing judgment as to action or practical expediency; discreet, prudent, or politic (2) having, exercising or showing good judgment; wise, sensible, or well-advised; a judicious selection'', and to act injudiciously is to act in a manner which does not display these characteristics. </PARA>
<PARA> I have been instructed to peruse the documents with care and advise as to any offences against Federal law which they disclose, or any further enquiries which should be made on the basis of them. In that context I should say that it is police officers who have particular skills in relation to detection and investigation of alleged criminal behaviour. Lawyers do not have that expertise. I will do my best to make such suggestions as may be useful. </PARA>
<PARA> The first general point to be made is that the material I have seen could not of itself warrant the laying of charges against anybody. Neither the tapes nor the documents are original, and it may be that they have been fabricated. The first step, if any aspect of the matter is to be taken further, is to establish their authenticity. That might be difficult. It is not likely that those who prepared the tapes or documents will co-operate in disclosing the role they played. And if the tapes are genuine there will be great difficulty in proving the identity of any speaker to the high criminal standard of proof, at least in the absence of an admission. Speaking generally, no person is obliged to give information to investigating police officers, particularly information which may be of an incriminating nature. </PARA>
<PARA> The second general point I make is that even if the material is authentic, and the identity of the speakers can be established, it does not follow that what has been said by any individual is true. It is not unusual for men to brag, to claim greater power than they have, even to tell simple untruths. </PARA>
<PARA> The material I have seen covers an extraordinarily wide ground. In the circumstances those who instruct me have agreed that one broad aspect should be put on one side. It appears that there may have been one or more conspiracies to [. . .] using illegal means to do so. A man named [. . .], a former employee of the Department of [. . .] features largely in the material. It appears that at some stage he was the subject of a departmental investigation. A charge was brought against [the Solicitor] in relation to [. . .] matters. He was convicted , and has appealed. In the circumstances it is thought best not to deal in this opinion with any aspect of these matters, including [the Former Employee's] involvement. </PARA>
<PARA> There are various references in the material to [the Judge]. I deal with each of them which may be of any significance. </PARA>
<PARA> In a summary of a conversation between [the Solicitor] and a man named [. . .] it appears that one or other mentioned that 'a girl has to be arranged for [the Judge]'. Assuming that this was in fact said, it cannot be concluded that it was seriously meant: the comment could have been jocular. If it was seriously meant, it does not follow that anything of the sort was done on that or any other occasion. And if it was, it could not support a conclusion of criminal conduct on the part of any person. The matter does not warrant further investigation. Indeed how the matter could be further investigated I do not know: no details are available as to time or place. All of this can be said with equal force in relation to a statement in what appears to be a general commentary on the tapes, namely that [the Solicitor] organised girls for [the Judge] when time permits. </PARA>
<PARA> The transcript of one of the taped telephone conversations between [the Judge] and [the Solicitor] refers to [. . .] and [. . .]. Presumably those referred to were [. . .] and [. . .], who acted for [. . .], the complainant against [. . .] . Assuming the tape to be genuine, it contains nothing which is of a surprising nature. One cannot expect the defendant in criminal proceedings to be consistently charitable towards the complainant and those perceived to be associated with him. Some would think to be inappropriate certain of the language used by [the Judge] and the matters casually adverted to by him, given the high office that he holds. However, assuming the tape to be genuine, it is of a private telephone conversation which according to law should have remained private. </PARA>
<PARA> On a couple of occasions [the Judge] intimated to [the Solicitor] that he should, or perhaps they should, be careful as to what they said over the telephone. This is equivocal. It could not support the conclusion that [the Judge] had been guilty of criminal or other misconduct. </PARA>
<PARA> In March 1979 [the Judge] and [the Solicitor] had a conversation in which the former told the latter [. . .] is . . . appointing [a Public Servant] as Deputy Chairman of an unidentified body. The latter expressed himself to be pleased. There was talk about the tenure of the appointment. It appears that [the Judge] may have taken some steps to secure the appointment. That would be clear beyond argument if he is the unidentified male in another telephone conversation with [ the Solicitor] who was asked to ring [. . .] 'for that [Public Servant]', and agreed to do so. And in another telephone conversation between [the Solicitor] and an unidentified male person, the former said that when he barked the appointee as Deputy Chairman of the [. . .] would jump. In that telephone conversation [the Solicitor] was advising the person he called of the appointment of 'that big [Public Servant]' to the position in question. It seems unlikely that the other party to that conversation was [the Judge]. </PARA>
<PARA> I am instructed that a New South Wales Government Directory published in 1982 shows that a [the Publish Servant] was then Deputy Chairman of the [. . .] of that State. If it be the case that [the Judge] used influence or persuasion, direct or indirect, to have him appointed to that position, then that carries no consequence so far as criminal conduct is concerned. There is nothing unusual about people in high places suggesting or urging that given individuals should be appointed to particular Government positions. It would of course be a matter of great concern if that was done in order to secure some favour, or for any sort of consideration. One can imagine circumstances in which the taking of steps to secure such an appointment would be by reason of accompanying circumstances be criminal in nature. There is nothing in the material I have seen to suggest any such accompanying circumstances. I cannot think that any further investigation of the matter is likely to be at all fruitful. </PARA>
<PARA> In the transcript of one of the tapes of a conversation between [the Solicitor] and a man named [. . .] who I understand to be a lawyer, the former asked whether the latter was ''sweet with any of the Judges in Canberra'' to which he received a coy reply. [The Solicitor] said that a horse trainer friend of his had a son who had bashed some fellow and it was desired to save him from the can . He then suggested that money might be put forward to that end. The matter was not taken further. A credulous cynic might conclude from this that an attempt was to be made to bribe a Judge of the ACT Supreme Court. I do not think the matter can be taken further as against any party. If the tape is genuine it would not warrant the laying of any charge against either [the Solicitor] or [. . .]. And police officers can hardly be asked to go through the embarrassing ordeal of approaching all of the Judges who sit in the ACT Supreme Court and asking each if he has taken or been offered any bribes lately. As I have been dealing with [the Judge] it should be said that he of course sits on [. . .] which does not deal with cases of [. . .]. This conversation clearly has nothing to do with him. </PARA>
<PARA> There is nothing in the material I have seen, assuming its authenticity, which would prove or in any way support the conclusion that [the Judge] has been guilty of misbehaviour within the meaning of section 72 (ii) of the Constitution . At least ordinarily such misbehaviour must be in a matter pertaining to the office held although conviction for an infamous offence which renders the person concerned unfit to exercise the office is apparently sufficient. Quick &amp; Garran, ''The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth'', 731; Halsbury, '' The Laws of England'', 4th Ed., Vol. 8, 680; The Earl of Shrewbury's case, 9 Co. Rep. 42. </PARA>
<PARA> Has [the Judge] acted injudiciously? On the material I have seen his conduct cannot be so categorised, unless it be established that he well knew that a man with whom he was having frequent dealings was of poor reputation. [Judges] occupy lofty and rather isolated positions, and it may be that [the Judge] did not know in any detail what [the Solicitor's] reputation was. Even if he did, there is room for debate as between persons of good sense and goodwill as to whether any people, including those who hold high office, should be traduced by reason of the reputation of their friends and acquaintances, in the absence of actual and established improper conduct on their part. </PARA>
<PARA> It places a Judge in an invidious position if he has frequent dealings with any person of poor reputation. Presumably [the Judge] now realises this and will act more carefully in the future than he has done in the past. If there is doubt in this regard, it may be that he should be approached and advised as to the desirability of not further nurturing the relationship he has with [the Solicitor] if it presently remains on foot. </PARA>
<PARA> Except in relation to the aspect to be dealt with in conclusion, I can find nothing in the material which provides any strong indication that any breach of Federal law has been committed by any person. Nor do I think there are any obvious lines of enquiry open to police officers. It is hard to see what course could be usefully followed by an officer who was required to conduct a supplementary investigation in relation to Federal offences. </PARA>
<PARA> I should say that the material I have seen is not consistently salubrious. Several of those who have spoken, if they could be identified, would be hard put to deny general involvement in activities including illegal bookmaking, race- fixing, bribery, and prostitution. However these are matters for the State authorities to pursue. And charges of criminality cannot be preferred with any prospects of success unless particulars of the conduct involved, including time and place, can be provided and established. </PARA>
<PARA> As a general rule a person who intercepts a communication passing over a public telephone service commits an offence, and this has been so at all material times . See section 5 (1) of the Telephonic Communications (Interception) Act 1960 and section 7 (1) of the Telecommunications (Interception) Act 1979. It does not necessarily follow that evidence cannot be given of an unlawfully intercepted telephone conversation. See Bunning v. Cross (1978) 141 CLR 54, and R. v. Padman (1979) 25 ALR 36. </PARA>
<PARA> I am instructed that none of the permitted circumstances of interception occurred in relation to any of the material I have seen. It follows that unless the material is spurious, some people at present unknown have committed offences . The matter should be investigated in detail. I think this should be done by officers of the Australian Federal Police. It would be presumptuous of me to suggest how the investigation be conducted. I can say that I have discussed the matter with Superintendent Brown of the Australian Federal Police, and that which he has suggested seems entirely sensible. In the course of those investigations there should be, and I have no doubt there will be, interviews conducted with respect to one present and one former officer of the AFP, named [ . . .] and [. . .] respectively. The material does not establish that either has been guilty of any criminal misconduct, but suggests that each may have been used improperly by criminal elements. It may very well be the case that there is no substance in any of this, but it needs to be looked into. </PARA>
<PARA> If any aspect of the matter appears to have received insufficient attention, or if any questions arise, I will be pleased to address them. </PARA>

<PARA>Perth</PARA>
<PARA>15 February 1984</PARA>
<PARA>In the matter of section 72 of the Constitution</PARA>
<PARA>OPINION</PARA>
<PARA> 1. I am asked the meaning of ''misbehaviour'' in section 72 of the Constitution , and, in particular, whether misbehaviour for this purpose is limited to matters pertaining to the judicial office in question and conviction for a serious offence which renders the person concerned unfit to exercise the office.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. So far as relevant, section 72 provides-</PARA>
<PARA> 72. The Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament-</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Shall not be removed except by the Governor-General in Council, on an address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same session, praying for such removal on the ground of proved misbehaviour or incapacity;</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Clearly the ambit of the grounds for removal from office embraced by section 72 is limited by comparison with the position of judges under English law. Section 72 gives conscious effect to the principle that the judiciary in our Federal system should be secure in their independence from the legislature and the executive. This was a matter which considerably exercised attention in debates during the drafting processes leading to its final formulation. Quite deliberately, the conventional grounds for termination of judicial tenure were narrowed. </PARA>
<PARA> 4. The English position is that judges hold office during good behaviour or until removed upon address to the Crown by both Houses of Parliament. </PARA>
<PARA> 5. Coke described the grant as creating office for life determinable upon breach of condition: Co. Litt. 42a. Now tenure is until retiring age. A judge may be removed by the Crown for misbehaviour (or want of good behaviour) without any address from Parliament. The position as to such misbehaviour is conveniently summarised by Todd, Parliamentary Government in England, ii, at 857 -8-</PARA>
<PARA> 'The legal effect of the grant of an office during ''good behaviour'' is the creation of an estate for life in the office.' Such an estate is terminable only by the grantee's incapacity from mental or bodily infirmity, or by his breach of good behaviour. But ''like any other conditional estate, it may be forfeited by a breach of the condition annexed to it; that is to say, by misbehaviour. Behaviour means behaviour in the grantee's official capacity. Misbehaviour includes, firstly, the improper exercise of judicial functions; secondly, wilful neglect of duty, or non-attendance; and, thirdly, a conviction for any infamous offence, by which, although it be not connected with the duties of his office, the offender is rendered unfit to exercise any office or public franchise. In the case of official misconduct, the decision of the question whether there be misbehaviour rests with the grantor, subject, of course, to any proceedings on the part of the removed officer. In the case of misconduct outside the duties of his office, the misbehaviour must be established by a previous conviction by a jury. </PARA>
<PARA> 6. The contrasting Parliamentary jurisdiction to address for removal is described by Todd (at 860) as an additional power unrelated to breach of condition which-</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the constitution has appropriately conferred upon the two Houses of Parliament-in the exercise of that superintendence over the proceedings of the courts of justice which is one of their most important functions-a right to appeal to the crown for the removal of a judge who has, in their opinion, proved himself unfit for the proper exercise of his judicial office. This power is not, in a strict sense, judicial; it may be invoked upon occasions when the misbehaviour complained of would not constitute a legal breach of the conditions on which the office is held. The liability to this kind of removal is, in fact, a qualification of, or exception from, the words creating a tenure during good behaviour, and not an incidental or legal consequence thereof. </PARA>
<PARA> In entering upon an investigation of this kind, Parliament is limited by no restraints, except such as may be self-imposed. </PARA>
<PARA> 7. The position is much the same in Canada: section 99 of the British North America Act provides that judges ''shall hold office during good behaviour, but shall be removable by the Governor-General on Address of the Senate and House of Commons''. Likewise for the States of the Commonwealth. Indeed, many of the precedents cited by Todd as establishing Crown rights to remove for misbehaviour or upon address by Parliament concern judges with an Australian connection: Justice Willis was removed from the Bench in Upper Canada in 1829 and later from the Supreme Court of New South Wales in 1846; also debate concerning Justice Boothby of the Supreme Court of South Australia, 1861-1867; and Sir Redmond Barry (over the curious issue of taking vacation without leave) 1864-1865, discussed in some detail in Todd, Ch. VI. </PARA>
<PARA> 8. Todd (at 860-1) emphasises obvious inhibitions upon the exercise of the discretionary powers of Parliament-</PARA>
<PARA> Nevertheless, since statutory powers have been conferred upon Parliament which define and regulate the proceedings against offending judges, the importance to the interests of the Commonwealth, of preserving the independence of the judges, should forbid either House from entertaining an application against a judge unless such grave misconduct were imputed to him as would warrant, or rather compel, the concurrence of both Houses in an address to the crown for his removal from the bench. 'Anything short of this might properly be left to public opinion, which holds a salutary check over judicial conduct, and over the conduct of public functionaries of all kinds, which it might not be convenient to make the subject of parliamentary enquiry.'</PARA>
<PARA> 9. Under our Constitution Parliamentary address is the only method for judical removal. The reason sufficiently is summarised by Quick and Garran, The Annotated Constitution of the Australian Commonwealth, 733-4, under the heading ''Reasons for Security of Judicial Tenure'':</PARA>
<PARA> The peculiar stringency of the provisions for safeguarding the independence of the Federal Justices is a consequence of the federal nature of the Constitution, and the necessity for protecting those who interpret it from the danger of political interference. The Federal Executive has a certain amount of control over the Federal Courts by its power of appointing Justices; the Federal Executive and Parliament jointly have a further amount of control by their power of removing such Justices for specified causes; but otherwise the independence of the Judiciary from interference by the other departments of the Government is complete. And both the Executive and the Parliament, in the exercise of their constitutional powers, are bound to respect the spirit of the Constitution, and to avoid any wanton interference with the independence of the Judiciary. '' Complaints to Parliament in respect to the conduct of the Judiciary, or the decisions of courts of justice, should not be lightly entertained . . . Parliament should abstain from all interference with the judiciary, except in cases of such gross perversion of the law, either by intention, corruption, or incapacity, as make it necessary for the House to exercise the power vested in it of advising the Crown for the removal of the Judge''. (Todd, Parl. Gov. in Eng., i. 574.)</PARA>
<PARA>Hence the structure of the Constitution itself explains this direct limitation upon the power of judicial removal. The desire is to protect the judiciary as the interpreters of the Constitution. </PARA>
<PARA> 10. Clearly section 72 excludes all modes of removal other than the one mentioned. This deliberate limitation, apparent from the terms of the section, is emphasised by permissible consideration of legislative history. To paraphrase what Stephen J. said in Seamen's Union of Australia v. Utah Development Co., ( 1978) 144 C.L.R. 120, 142-4, it is from the successive drafts of the Bills which ultimately became our Constitution that the true role of section 72 emerges; its history and origins cast light upon meaning, the precise effect of which may otherwise be subject to some obscurity. </PARA>
<PARA> 11. The first draft of the Commonwealth Bill of 1891 departed from English and colonial precedent and tied revocation of office held during good behaviour to address from both houses. At Adelaide, in the 1897 Bill, this intention was made clear. In committee, tenure was further secured by resolution to limit parliamentary power of intervention to cases of misbehaviour or incapacity. The clause read:</PARA>
<PARA> 72. The Justices of the High Court and of the other courts created by the Parliament:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) Shall hold their offices during good behaviour;</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) Shall be appointed by the Governor-General in Council;</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Shall not be removed except for misbehaviour or incapacity, and then only by the Governor-General in Council, upon an Address from both Houses of the Parliament in the same Session praying for such removal. </PARA>
<PARA> In the Melbourne session on the 31st January 1898 Mr Barton successfully moved that tenure be further secured by providing that a parliamenary address must pray for removal ''upon the grounds of proved misbehaviour or incapacity''. </PARA>
<PARA> 12. Although their Honours regarded it as unnecessary then to consider the extent to which the Debates may be regarded in the construction of the Constitution, in Re Pearson; Ex Parte Sipka, (1983) 57 A.L.J.R. 225, 227, Gibbs C.J., Mason and Wilson JJ. accepted Griffith C.J.'s dictum in The Municipal Council of Sydney v. Commonwealth, (1904) 1 C.L.R. 208, 213-214, that it is permissible to have regard to Convention Debates, ''for the purpose of seeing . . . what was the evil to be remedied''. Perusal of the Adelaide and Melbourne Convention Debates confirms the extent to which the delegates desired to deal with the need adequately to safeguard the independence of the judiciary as an essential feature of the separation of powers in the Federal system. Todd's summary of the English position (set out in paragraph 5 above), which was read by Mr Isaacs at Adelaide on 20th April 1897 (Convention Debates 984-9), was the received meaning of misbehaviour. Each of the successive amendments to the draft clause was intended further to limit, for the purpose of the Constitution, the power of removal to a single specific and narrow basis related solely to the established ground of removal for breach of condition for good behaviour. The general discretionary power of Parliament to address for removal on grounds other than misbehaviour, in the technical sense understood by the delegates, was eliminated; with the function of finding such misbehaviour vested in the Parliament rather than in the Executive. </PARA>
<PARA> 13. What then is proved misbehaviour or incapacity? Incapacity is easily dealt with: it extends to incapacity for mental or physical infirmity, which always has been held to justify termination of office: see Todd, at 857. The addition of the word ''incapacity'' does not alter the nature of the tenure during good behaviour; it merely defines it more accurately: see Quick and Garran, at 732. </PARA>
<PARA> 14. As noted in paragraph 5 above, Todd, at 857-8, purported exhaustively to define misbehaviour as breach of the condition for judicial office held ''during good behaviour'' as including-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) the improper exercise of judicial functions;</PARA>
<PARA> (2) wilful neglect of duty or non-attendance; and</PARA>
<PARA> (3) the conviction for any infamous offence, by which, although it be not connected with the duties of his office, the offender is rendered unfit to exercise any office or public franchise. </PARA>
<PARA> Todd's commentary, at 858, was that the decision of whether the first category of misbehaviour is constituted rest with the Crown. However in the case of the third category misconduct outside the duties of office, he stipulated misbehaviour must be established by previous conviction by a jury. Similarly Halsbury's Laws of England, 4th ed, viii, para. 1107, which accepts Coke's statement that ''behaviour'' means behaviour in matters concerning the office and also the exceptional case of conviction upon indictment for any infamous offence of such a nature as to render the person unfit to exercise the office. Much might be said as to the received meaning of infamous offence. It is discussed in R. v. Richardson (1758) 1 Burr. 517, in the context of removal from office. Bacon's Abridgement, 7th ed., iii, 211 regarded such offences as embracing convictions for treason, felony, piracy, praemunire, perjury, forgery, and the like, together with crimes with penalty ''to stand in the pillory, or to be whipped or branded''. All this is somewhat archaic for contemporary definition. Maxwell J. in re Trautwein, (1940) 40 S.R. (N.S.W.) 371, warned against exhaustive definition, and adopted the sensible approach of having regard to the nature and essence of a proved offence without attempting a definition or enumeration of the crimes which fall within the expression. To his Honour (at 380) infamous crime was one properly described as ''contrary to the faith credit and trust of mankind''. Such ambulatory approach seems appropriate to give continuing content to any limitation expressed by reference to infamous offence, although it certainly does not close the otherwise open texture of meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> 15. However defined, Todd's third category of breach of condition for office held during good behaviour requires conviction for offence. Hence it is curious that, without comment, Quick and Garran (at 731) accept Todd's three categories as defining misbehaviour for the purposes of section 72. However a definition requiring conviction for offence in misbehaviour not pertaining to office does not rest easily with Quick and Garran's clear recognition of the essential limitation of section 72 requiring address of Parliament upon the proved ground of misbehaviour as the sole basis for removal (at 731)-</PARA>
<PARA> The substantial distinction between the ordinary tenure of British Judges and the tenure established by this Constitution is that the ordinary tenure is determinable on two conditions; either (1) misbehaviour, or (2) an address from both Houses; whilst under this Constitution the tenure is only determinable on one condition-that of misbehaviour or incapacity-and the address from both Houses is prescribed as the only method by which forfeiture for breach of the condition may be ascertained. </PARA>
<PARA> Obviously ''proved misbehaviour'' is to be established to the Parliament and, whatever the offence, such proof is not predicated upon anterior conviction in a court of law. </PARA>
<PARA> 16. The ultimate requirement of section 72 is for address upon ''proved misbehaviour''. Quick and Garran's views (at 732) are-</PARA>
<PARA> No mode is prescribed for the proof of misbehaviour or incapacity, and the Parliament is therefore free to prescribe its own procedure. Seeing, however, that proof of definite legal breaches of the conditions of tenure is required, and that the enquiry is therefore in its nature more strictly judicial than in England, it is conceived that the procedure ought to partake as far as possible of the formal nature of a criminal trial; that the charges should be definitely formulated, the accused allowed full opportunities of defence, and the proof established by evidence taken at the Bar of each House. </PARA>
<PARA> Odgers, Australian Senate Practice, 4th ed., 598, suggests, without discussion, that the probable procedure would be by way of joint select committee, with the accused being allowed full opportunities to defend himself. However it is difficult to see how Parliament adequately could discharge its obligation to address upon ''proved'' misbehaviour if the trial function were to be delegated (cf. FAI Insurances Ltd. v. Winneke (1982) 41 A.L.R. 1, 17 per Mason J., discussing delegation of enquiry by Governor-in-Council). Todd, ii, 860-875, requires ''the fullest and fairest enquiry into the matter of complaint, by the whole House, or a committee of the whole House, at the Bar; notwithstanding that the same may have already undergone a thorough investigation before other tribunals'' such as a select committee. </PARA>
<PARA> 17. Inasmuch as the Convention Debates reveal mischief intended to be dealt with, clearly it was contemplated that Parliament could fix its own procedures: see Convention Debates, 20th April 1897, 952, (Mr Isaacs and Mr Barton) and 959- 960 (Mr Kingston). At the Melbourne Convention it was made clear that the judge would be entitled to notice and to be heard: (see Convention Debates, 31st January 1898, 315, (Mr Barton)). Hence Parliamentary discretion as to mode in which power should be exercised is in the context of obligation that charges be formulated, and full opportunities for defence be furnished, before finding of proved misbehaviour. </PARA>
<PARA> 18. Quick and Garran reject any analogy between the Parliamentary discretion to address on grounds which do not constitute a legal breach of the condition on which office is held and the position which obtains under section 72. After reciting Todd's summary of the discretion in parliament and in particular his conclusion that parliament is 'limited by no restraints except suich as may be self imposed' (set out in paragraph 6 above), the authors note (at 731)-</PARA>
<PARA> These words are quite inapplicable to the provisions of this Constitution. Parliament is 'limited by restraints' which require the proof of definite charges; the liability to removal is not 'a qualification of, or exception from, the words creating a tenure,' but only arises when the conditions of the tenure are broken; and though the procedure and mode of proof are left entirely to the Parliament, it would seem that, inasmuch as proof is expressly required, the duty of Parliament is practically indistinguishable from a strictly judicial duty. </PARA>
<PARA> 19. The conferring of exceptional function to find proved misbehaviour is not equated to vesting discretion in Parliament to define misbehaviour constituting breach of condition of office. The general power of a Parliament to address for removal where there is not technical misbehaviour is negated by section 72. The power is limited to address only upon proof of misbehaviour, and neither House is at large to define and recognise misbehaviour as it pleases. Misbehaviour, as a breach of condition of office in matters not pertaining to the office, has a meaning related to offences against the general law of the requisite seriousness to be described as infamous. To this extent it has an ascertainable meaning, even if content varies in particular circumstances. In consideration of the issue of proved misbehaviour Parliament is obliged to apply this meaning. </PARA>
<PARA> 20. The inquiry is whether the offence is of such nature as to render the person unfit to exercise the office, although it is not committed in connection with the office. The notion that private behaviour may affect performance of official duty was expressed by Burbury C. J. in Henry v. Ryan, (1963) Tas. S.R. 90, 91:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . misconduct in his private life by a person discharging public or professional duties may be destructive of his authority and influence and thus unfit him to continue in his office or profession. </PARA>
<PARA> Sir Garfield Barwick, in opinion of 18th November 1957 on clauses of the Reserve Bank, Commonwealth Bank and Banking Bills of 1957, dealing with office held 'subject to good behaviour', wrote-</PARA>
<PARA> Good behaviour . . . refers to the conduct of the incumbent of the office in matters touching and concerning the office and its due execution, though the commission of an offence against the general law of such a nature as to warrant the conclusion that the incumbent is unfit to exercise the office would be a breach of the condition of good behaviour even though the offence itself was unrelated to the duties and functions of the office . . . </PARA>
<PARA> There is, in my opinion, no significant difference between a condition of good behaviour and a condition against misbehaviour. Indeed, in the older books the word 'misbehaviour' is often used as synonymous with a breach of good behaviour. Thus, the 'misbehaviour' in the Bill will be held to refer to conduct touching and concerning the duties of the member in relation to the office, but will also include acts in breach of the general law of such a quality as to indicate that the member is unfit for office. </PARA>
<PARA>I concur with this opinion. It represents a contemporary statement of the quality of offence not pertaining to office which may constitute misbehaviour. As discussed in paragraph 14 above, the content of offence so expressed is much the same as what may now be understood as embraced by infamous offence. </PARA>
<PARA> 21. It follows that the terms of section 72 dictate meaning for 'proved misbehaviour'. The fundamental principle of maintaining judicial independence is recognised by excluding all modes of removal other than for misbehaviour as a breach of condition of office. In matters not pertaining to office, the requirement is not conviction for offence in a court of law. Inasmuch as Parliament considers the matter, the question is whether there is proved offence against the general law 'of such a nature as to warrant the conclusion that the incumbent is unfit to exercise the office'. Parliament is not at large to define proved misbehaviour by reference to its own standards or views of suitability for office or moral or social character or conduct. The Parliamentary inquiry is whether commission of an offence of the requisite quality and seriousness is proved. Parliament would act beyond power if it sought to apply wider definition or criteria for misbehaviour than the recognised meaning of misbehaviour not pertaining to office. </PARA>
<PARA> 22. Parliament has, of course, a residual discretion not to address for removal , even if proved misbehaviour is found. </PARA>
<PARA> 23. Accordingly the question asked in paragraph 1 is answered-</PARA>
<PARA> Misbehaviour is limited in meaning in section 72 of the Constitution to matters pertaining to-</PARA>
<PARA> (1) judicial office, including non-attendance, neglect of or refusal to perform duties; and</PARA>
<PARA> (2) the commission of an offence against the general law of such a quality as to indicate that the incumbent is unfit to exercise the office. </PARA>
<PARA> Misbehaviour is defined as breach of condition to hold office during good behaviour. It is not limited to conviction in a court of law. A matter pertaining to office or a breach of the general law of the requisite seriousness in a matter not pertaining to office may be found by proof, in appropriate manner, to the Parliament in proceedings where the offender has been given proper notice and opportunity to defend himself. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Opposition is not satisfied with the statement which has just been presented to the Parliament by the Attorney- General (Senator Gareth Evans) in relation to the Age tapes. The Opposition believes that this matter, which the Government accepts is of great importance, should be the subject of full debate in this Parliament after there has been further and more adequate time to consider the statement and the opinions that are attached to it; although, of course, I acknowledge that we were given-and I thank the Attorney for having given-the usual notice in relation to them. However, it is a matter on which I propose at this stage simply to make a few general comments and seek leave to continue my remarks in an early debate, which I am hopeful can take place tomorrow.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In the statement that he has just read the Attorney has attempted to defend the Government's actions by seriously questioning the authenticity of the material, and the motives and ethics behind its publication. However, it seems that the Attorney is totally confused on the question of authenticity. Obviously the material was authentic enough for the Government to decide to appoint a special prosecutor and to set up a joint police task force. Clearly the New South Wales Government, after initially attempting to denigrate the material, also felt there was enough substance in it-or there was certainly enough pressure being brought on the Government-to ask for a proper inquiry into the whole matter. The Attorney himself emphasised that fact from the word go. He was concerned not simply with investigating the illegality of the circumstances by which the material was obtained but with investigating the contents of the material. Obviously it was authentic enough for the Attorney himself to speak to the judge . Also it appears from the opinion of the Solicitor-General of New South Wales, and indeed from Mr Temby's opinion, that they believed that there was sufficient substance in it for further investigation. Senator Evans, in his joint statement of 17 February with the Special Minister of State (Mr Young), appeared basically to accept the authenticity of the tapes. Indeed, he raised the question of authenticity only in relation to the conduct of the judge. </PARA>
<PARA> I must say that I was very surprised by the vehemence of the Attorney's attack on the Age newspaper. I do not believe that that attack is justified. The Attorney must be living in an unreal world if he believes that a newspaper which has a reputation for investigative journalism would be so trusting of the probity of government simply to hand over material to law enforcement authorities, some of whom were alleged to be involved in the matters raised, and trust in their determination to put things right. In the Opposition's view the Age handled this matter quite responsibly. It avoided publishing names of those involved and has passed the material only to the Federal Attorney-General. As the Age stated, after successive royal commission inquiries into matters involving the spread of organised crime in our community, it would have been acting against public interest if, after having satisfied itself as to authenticity, it had decided not to publish. That is a matter which it said it investigated. It obtained legal advice in relation to the matter before doing so . </PARA>
<PARA> We do not believe that it is possible-or that it would be responsible-for this Parliament simply to dismiss the question of the conduct of the judge. The Attorney's discussion on that matter needs much further consideration. All we are told is that the judge specifically denied some matters of fact or-I quote from the statement-'gave explanations which put those allegations in a rather different context than that evident at first sight'. Certainly the Opposition believes that the sort of behaviour alleged in the published material, as I said when the Age first published the material, would be viewed with great concern by the overwhelming majority of the community. </PARA>
<PARA> Although this perhaps needs further discussion and consideration, we do not accept at this stage the restricted view of misbehaviour as outlined in the opinion of the Solicitor-General. But certainly, if there is some constitutional problem about the meaning of misbehaviour or Parliament is restricted in what action it can take in that way, a responsible debate in the Parliament-I agree with the Attorney-General on this point-about the conduct of a judge is clearly within the responsibilities of this Parliament. To say, as the Attorney-General tried to say, that some great issues about separation of powers are involved is another attempt to divert this issue and to suppress proper public discussion of matters of such great importance. </PARA>
<PARA> I also believe that the Government's handling of this matter leaves a great deal to be desired. Much more needs to be said and questioned about that aspect. But I place on record the concern that I have expressed about the appointment of Mr Temby in the dual role of Special Prosecutor, heading a very special police task force, and his new and most important role as Director of Public Prosecutions. This is a new position which was recently created to strengthen the prosecuting arm of the Commonwealth. Mr Temby has been appointed to take up that position on, I think, 5 March. It will involve an enormous task and will be a challenge in itself. The problem that we are discussing today is a separate and challenging problem which certainly demands the response of at least a special prosecutor, if not a greater response in the form of a royal commission or judicial inquiry. But it certainly requires the attention of a special prosecutor who can give special and sole attention to the enormous problem that is presented by this material. Mr Deputy President, I seek leave to continue my remarks. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;by leave-I think it is important for me to make a brief statement. I will be very brief, but it is necessary to put before the Senate some further information which I believe will assist. What has occurred must be of considerable concern to honourable senators. We are now engaged in a debate based on certain information, received in a certain way, on which I think we have raised questions before in this place. Some accusations have been made concerning contact with a judge. I believe all those accusations have been refuted in the statement of the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans). However , one point remains-that the judge may have been in contact and communication with a person of doubtful repute. However, although it may be the case that that person is now of doubtful repute that person may not have been of doubtful repute in 1979-80 when the conversations were supposed to have taken place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I point out that in 1982 the person concerned was of sufficiently good reputation to have been the subject of a representation by Sir Ernest Keith White. I draw the attention of the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Durack) to the fact that Sir Ernest Keith White by letter dated 21 June 1982 requested the then Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, to have Federal charges against a certain solicitor dropped and that Mr Fraser passed on the request to Senator Durack, as Attorney-General. In this regard my purposes are not scurrilous. I merely indicate to the Opposition the trap in which we are all falling. On that particular date, in all earnestness, Sir Ernest Keith White wrote to the Prime Minister, Mr Fraser, and Mr Fraser then made a representation to the Attorney- General. Sir Ernest Keith White is a very important person in the Liberal Party and in the community. He has held high positions in the Liberal Party. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I will put the matter more clearly. I ask whether it is a fact that while Sir Ernest Keith White was a close friend of the solicitor concerned he was also a founder and leading figure of the Liberal Party? I am sorry, I may have said that he was a president of the Liberal Party which he was not, but he was a leading figure. I do not in any way denigrate Sir Ernest White. He was also President of the Australian-American Association. I do not denigrate him on that basis either. I am telling honourable senators the facts concerning the person who made a representation on behalf of the solicitor concerned. At that stage the solicitor was held in high repute. Is it also a fact that a similar request was made by the former Liberal member for Phillip, Mr Jack Birney, at about the same period? I say further that the request made of the former Attorney-General may have been a reasonable request on the basis of the information before the Prime Minister at the time. What followed then? Is it not a fact that after the intercession the major charge of forgery against the solicitor was dropped? We could start to stir that matter about. A major charge of forgery was dropped on the representation made by a person of considerable reputation in the community on behalf of another person whom he believed to be also of good reputation.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> What I am saying to honourable senators is that we have reached a stage now where the reputation of a judge has been impugned on the basis of a conversation with a solicitor in 1979 and that in 1982 members of the Liberal Party were making representations on his behalf to the Prime Minister who then made a representation to the Attorney-General and subsequently a major charge of forgery was dropped. That might have been the correct course of action to have taken. All I say is that the judge whose character has been impugned has been impugned mainly as a result of the conversations and the communications with this solicitor in 1979 who is now the subject of these great questions. Also we find that leading members of the Liberal Party were friendly with that person in 1982. </PARA>

For any person engaged in questionable activities in the community one method of insurance is to get close to leading politicians. It may be the turn of honourable senators opposite next. Some of their friends close to them may turn out to be quite different from what they first appeared. That is something Mr Dowd in New South Wales found to his cost and which other people have found to their cost. They have found suddenly that those friends whom they held in high repute were not what they appeared to be in the first place. That is exactly what has happened in this case. Before honourable senators go down the track making further charges and trying to establish guilt by association I ask them to be careful.</PARA></TALK.START>

I commend him for the clear and precise way in which in most of it he has established the situation as it is at the moment. I join with Senator Durack in saying that what I believe to be an otherwise sound statement was spoiled a little by the denigration of the Age newspaper over which the Attorney took so long and so many pages. I thought that the Age went to incredible trouble to keep anonymous the personalities allegedly involved. As I read the Age reports-I believe I read them as carefully as anyone-there was nothing to identify any of the people involved.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;If, as Senator Georges interjects, the names of the people allegedly involved were known around coffee shops that certainly cannot be attributed to the Age newspaper. I remind Senator Evans in passing-because his criticism of the Age newspaper, while serious, was not a major part of his statement-that identical criticisms were made of the Washington Post in the early stages of its expose of Watergate. Other than that, I welcome the Attorney -General's statement and look forward to studying it in greater detail with a view to responding tomorrow when the debate, as I understand, will resume. I also refer to one matter the Attorney did not cover in his statement. It is not, I suppose, a major matter but it is a significant matter. On page 6 of Mr Temby' s opinion he says, among other things:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Has [the Judge] acted injudiciously?</PARA>
<PARA>He continues:</PARA>
<PARA> On the material I have seen his conduct cannot be so categorised, unless it be established that he well knew that a man with whom he was having frequent dealings was of poor reputation. </PARA>
<INTERJECT CHAIR="0" SPEAKER="Senator Georges" NAMEID="7V4">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="7V4">Senator Georges</NAME></TALKER>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="3V4">Senator CHIPP</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is the question that Senator Georges quite properly raised. Mr Temby goes on:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> [Judges] occupy lofty . . . positions. </PARA>
<PARA>Quite often judges do not know the reputation of the people with whom they deal. On page 7 of the report Mr Temby states:</PARA>
<PARA> It places a Judge in an invidious position if he has frequent dealings with any person of poor reputation. Presumably [the Judge] now realises this and will act more carefully in the future than he has done in the past. </PARA>
<PARA>Mr Temby then made a rather novel suggestion, presumably to the Attorney:</PARA>
<PARA> If there is doubt in this regard, it may be that he should be approached-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, the judge should be approached-</PARA>
<PARA>and advised as to the desirability of not further nurturing the relationship he has with [the Solicitor] if it presently remains on foot. </PARA>
<PARA>The Attorney relies fairly heavily on Mr Temby. I think I am raising a fair point in asking why the Attorney did not follow that rather novel, quaint suggestion that Mr Temby put to him. Perhaps the Attorney will tell us that when he responds. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thank the Attorney for his interjection. In conclusion, the Australian Democrats accept the strictly legal interpretation offered by the two opinions that at this stage have been put down by the Attorney. We reserve final judgment until the report of the Australian Federal Police is available. We express the view that the investigations could be wider and could go beyond the narrow limits of the words on the tapes. I want to express very briefly some disquiet. I refer to the ambit of the investigation to be undertaken by Mr Temby 's supervision. To investigate with a view to a prosecution is a brief somewhat narrower, in fact a lot narrower, than I would have liked to have seen and may well constrain Mr Temby from following trails which may open up beyond the actual content of the tapes. The Attorney will agree in a flash that Mr Costigan was not bound by such constraints and that the investigations of the Costigan Royal Commission on the Activities of the Federated Ship Painters and Dockers Union, in particular, were made more fruitful by its ability to follow such trails that Mr Temby is precluded from following. That is an aspect that does give me some disquiet and at the moment I merely express it. Further I must foreshadow, as I think is reasonable, that the Australian Democrats would request a wider judicial inquiry only if the Australian Federal Police report turns out to be a whitewash which, of course, all of us hope it will not be.</PARA></TALK.START>

The reason for that is that we have had long discussions with the Government which is endeavouring to see if we can do in two sitting weeks what has in the past taken us three sitting weeks. This is an attempt to rationalise the hours. It is always possible to trim at both ends. I have just had it drawn to my attention that this proposal to simply carve a couple of hours off the end of the week would carve off in large part the General Business time of the Senate unless we further readjusted the program and reduced the time for Government Business. We do not think that we should do that at this stage but rather that we should see how these sitting hours work. There are plenty of sceptics in the place. I am one who hopes that the new sitting hours will work, perhaps because I am a Western Australian. The Opposition supports the Government in maintaining the sitting hours it has set out in part 1 of its motion until we have at least sucked it and seen.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;For exactly the same reasons as Senator Chaney has explained, the Australian Democrats cannot support Senator Harradine. It is unfortunate that through no fault of his we had no notice of this amendment. I received it literally a couple of minutes ago. One cannot take these sorts of changes on the run. I take this opportunity, however, of saying that as far as I am concerned and, I think as far as my Party is concerned, if two hours are to be lopped off each of the two-week program we would far prefer to sit one night only and not two. I agreed with the proposals of the Government, which have been agreed to by the Liberal Party with grave disquiet. What we are setting ourselves in this program is an extraordinarily heavy schedule of two-week sittings. We have had some warnings of certain senators and staff being affected by the strain of these kinds of sittings. I believe that late night sittings, which are followed by having to get up early the next morning to attend committee meetings well before 9 o'clock put an intolerable strain on people.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> I agree to the Government's proposals with grave disquiet. Therefore, I regret that I cannot agree with Senator Harradine's suggestions. If two hours were to be lopped off, I would rather see them lopped off on one of the late nights so that we would have only one late night a week. </PARA>

<PARA> At end of paragraph 1 of the proposed Sessional Order relating to the Days and Hours of Sitting, add:</PARA>
<PARA> ': Provided that this Sessional Order does not have effect for Monday, 5 March 1984 and Monday, 7 May 1984'. </PARA>
<PARA>I am sure that honourable senators will agree with this amendment. I am sure that being asked by the Government's proposal to sit on what is Labour Day in Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland must have been an oversight. I think that it is a disgraceful situation whereby the only public holiday that has been selected by the Government for us to sit on is the Labour Day holiday in Tasmania, Western Australia and Queensland. So far as I am concerned, I have not worked on Labour Day since I was a shift worker. I do not intend to start now. I ask the Government to take this proposal back and have another look at it. I have the list of public holidays with me. An examination of that list shows that for the sitting period between now and the end of May, which this motion is designed to cover, the only public holiday on which the Government asks us to sit is Labour Day. I am not going to cop that. If honourable senators want to sit next Monday they can go ahead and sit next Monday, but do not let them expect to see me here. I hope that the Government will take this matter back to its Caucus to ensure that proper consideration is given to it. </PARA>

<PARA> 1. Petitions</PARA>
<PARA> 2. Notices of Motion</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Formal Motions-Discovery of Formal Business</PARA>
<PARA> 4. Postponement and re-arrangement of Business</PARA>

<PARA> 9. General Business</PARA>
<PARA> 10. Further consideration of Government Business, Notices of Motion and Orders of the Day, or vice versa, as set down on the Notice Paper</PARA>
<PARA>The only change proposed is to bring forward in the order of business the time for dealing with proposals pursuant to standing order 64, that is, matters of public importance. The Opposition brings forward this amendment because it is opposed to changes in the sitting arrangements which reduce the opportunities which exist in this place for the Opposition to obtain a hearing. The Opposition has been consistent in taking this stance when the Government has raised questions about a possible reduction in the availability of Question Time, for example, and I acknowledge that the Government has agreed to the Opposition's point of view with respect to a number of these matters, on some of which we have also had the support of the Australian Democrats. </PARA>
<PARA> Our concern is that the routine of business as it has been laid down by the Government would not permit debate for a full two hours. Only about one and a quarter hours would be available on the Friday, and a two hour debate of a matter of public importance on a Thursday would cut into the time allowed for General Business. The amendment which I have moved and which has a consequential amendment in that we would be opposing proposed sessional order 4, which restricts discussion on those days to one hour, is simply to preserve the traditional two hours provided for in the Standing Orders for matters of public importance. </PARA>
<PARA> Any examination of the record of the sittings of the Senate since the Government assumed office would indicate that the Opposition has not sought to use the rights available to it for matters of public importance in any capricious way or in any way to use up the time available to it. I would not wish it to be thought by the Australian Democrats or by any other honourable senators that the Opposition, in moving this amendment, is taking the view that it would on each of those days of necessity want to debate a matter of public importance or debate it for a full two hours. Quite often the Opposition would not want to bring on a matter of public importance and on some occasions when it did it would be prepared to consider a debate for less than the full time. All we are saying is that in principle we do not believe that changes to the order of business should be made which reduce the opportunity for non-government senators to raise matters which they think are of significance. Of course, the use of those rights will vary according to the exigencies and issues of the day. I ask the Senate to support the amendment which has been circulated in my name. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Government is not prepared to accept the amendment moved by Senator Chaney. Under the Government's proposal on every day there will be on the Notice Paper an opportunity for any proposal pursuant to standing order 64. The Government is concerned to provide some consistency in the program for each of the weeks in relation to when particular events occur so that Question Time will be at 2 o' clock each day and a matter of public importance, if there is one, will follow Question Time each day. We have also indicated to the Opposition that the time in which notice of a matter of public importance must be given should be the same each day so that all honourable senators understand where they are in relation to those matters.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> One of the reasons we have agreed to the time each day in respect of which notice of a matter of public importance must be given is simply to ensure that honourable senators do not come here at 7 o'clock in the morning, as we did for the seven years we were in Opposition, to put in a matter of public importance. That seems silly. We think that the procedure outlined in the Government's motion unamended by Senator Chaney's proposition, provides that degree of consistency each day. I do not want to deal with the suggested time limitation on a matter of public importance on the last day of the cycle because I think that can be more appropriately dealt with in a later amendment. That is the reason the Government has embarked on this course. We think it desirable that there be consistency every week. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Foreign Proceedings (Excess of Jurisdiction) Bill is a further development of legislation which was designed to protect Australian trading interests from the extraterritorial application of foreign laws. In particular the problem has arisen from courts in the United States of America seeking in private lawsuits to apply US anti-trust laws to Australian corporations in relation to those companies' operations outside the United States. In 1982 an anti-trust co-operation agreement was signed between the Australian and the United States governments which provided for negotiations to take place at an intergovernmental level to solve conflicts arising from the extraterritorial application of United States laws. In general both parties have subsequently abided by the spirit and letter of the agreement and apparently the agreement is working quite well. However, it must be conceded, as I did when, as Attorney-General, I signed the agreement on behalf of the Australian Government, that it would not be fully effective as a shield against private anti-trust suits.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Bill consolidates and extends existing Australian legislation to provide a comprehensive range of defences to enable the Government to protect Australian interests against extraterritorial enforcement of foreign laws. I do not propose to deal in detail with the Bill; suffice to say that incorporated in it are refined provisions of the existing Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act which was passed by this Parliament in 1976 and which, an order of the Attorney-General, prohibits the production of documents located in Australia and the giving of evidence in foreign proceedings in circumstances covered by the order of the Attorney-General where it is thought to be in the national interest or the interest of international comity, or where it would be in breach of international law for the foreign court to exercise a jurisdiction of an extraterritorial kind. </PARA>
<PARA> The Foreign Antitrust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Act 1979 is also incorporated in the Bill. It provides for the blocking in Australia of foreign judgments which are also prohibited, on order by the Attorney-General, in the circumstances that I have already mentioned in relation to the giving of evidence. These two Acts passed by this Parliament in those years were fairly major developments in providing a shield for Australian companies which were likely to be affected by proceedings of this kind. The first Act was introduced with some haste. I think it is desirable that it be looked at again. The provisions which have been included in this legislation have been updated and refined in that way. I think they are useful additions. </PARA>
<PARA> As I have said, this Bill purports to be a code in relation to the subject. It incorporates the restriction enforcement of judgments legislation. I think it should be said that, as a general rule, judgments of foreign courts are and should be enforceable in Australia. It is important for a nation such as Australia, in respect of our trading interests, comity of our laws with other countries, and our commercial operations, that we should give effect to and expect other countries with similar interests to give effect to the judgments of our courts. This legislation certainly qualifies that rule in regard to foreign anti-trust proceedings. I believe that is justified only because of the exceptional threat of those proceedings to Australian interests. It is important to emphasise that, by and large, this is an exception and ought to be an exception to that rule of comity. </PARA>
<PARA> A development of existing law contained in this Bill relates to the recovery back of moneys paid under a judgment, or that portion of a foreign judgment, which has been declared to be unenforceable in Australia under the provisions to which I have just referred. This is a rather unique provision which has developed from English legislation known as the Protection of Trading Interests Act. The United Kingdom Parliament passed this legislation several years ago as part of its defence mechanism to cope with the same problem that we face in Australia. Of course the problem is not one which is experienced only by Australia; it is a problem which greatly and gravely affects a number of our trading partners, particularly the United Kingdon, Canada and countries in western Europe, because American laws apply extraterritorially in those countries. It affects the trading interests of those countries in the same way as it may affect Australian interests. The United Kingdom took the further step of providing not only for the blocking of a judgment, that is, declaring unenforceable a judgment of a foreign court-as I have said this concerned principally courts in the United States of America-but also it made provision for a United Kingdom citizen who had such a judgment enforced against him in the United States or in some other country to recover back, against assets situated in the United Kingdom, that portion of the judgment which was declared unenforceable. </PARA>
<PARA> This was a development of the shield against the problem of the extraterritorial enforcement of United States laws, a problem at which we looked very closely when we were in government. In fact in 1981 I introduced a Bill to achieve the same purpose as this Bill. However, we were also concerned in government to enter into an agreement with the United States to ameliorate the problem as far as we were concerned. Other countries have since followed suit in trying to achieve such agreement with the United States. As I have said, that agreement was entered into at the end of June 1982. Having entered into that agreement we decided not to proceed with that Bill. Although I told the United States Attorney-General who signed the agreement on behalf of the United States that we would not proceed with that Bill, I made it clear that we would still keep it in place in case the agreement proved-these are the general terms and honourable senators should not hold me to the exact words-to be less effective or successful than we had hoped. Certainly there was never any suggestion that we would withdraw our existing blocking legislation. It was made clear that it may well be necessary, if circumstances occurred, for us to proceed and put in place this further part of the armoury, so to speak. </PARA>
<PARA> This Bill goes two steps further than that. It adopts another provision of the United Kingdom legislation which will enable the Attorney-General to make an order prohibiting the performance of an obligation in Australia which has been imposed by a foreign government under a foreign law relating to trade or commerce where the Attorney-General has specified that it is necessary to do so to protect the Australian national interest. It is a very broad power indeed. It is one which I think is somewhat questionable. Certainly it is a rather questionable power to be exercised by the Attorney-General. I would have thought it would be very much more a matter for a Minister concerned with trade rather than a Minister concerned with the enforcement of judgments. In the United Kingdom all these powers are exercised by the Secretary of State for trade and not by the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> However, the mischief which this provision was designed to correct in the United Kingdom, which may certainly apply in Australia, is due to the fact that there are a number of other foreign laws. Again, unfortunately, the main example we refer to is the United States example where orders are made under Acts which prohibit extraterritorially another country from taking certain actions which are seen to be or are contrary to the interests of the country making the order. This is a very gross violation of international comity. It is a very gross example of extraterritorial law and it has given nations in Western Europe very great problems. A classic example is orders which were made under the United States export administration Act in regard to companies in Western Europe which were providing work, materials and capital equipment for the building of the Siberian pipeline. That is the sort of example where these laws apply. Although Australia has not been affected directly by orders of that kind-an Australian company was indirectly affected by those orders-I suppose one must always concede that that is a possible problem. </PARA>
<PARA> Another clause in the Bill allows the Attorney-General to make orders based on national interest grounds which prohibit the enforcement of court orders and judgments which are not for money amounts in Australia. I think that is designed to deal with a situation which was of some concern a few years ago to us in this country when proceedings were brought in a United States court. These proceedings were designed to prevent American companies from entering into resource development agreements in Western Australia in the exploitation of some forest areas. That certainly was a different example of the extraterritorial problem. This particular clause would meet a judgment. In that case the proceedings were dismissed in the United States and no problem arose, but it certainly is another possible problem. </PARA>
<PARA> From what I have said, it is clear that this Bill implements and carries forward policies that were developed when the Opposition was in government. The object was to protect Australian interests against the successive jurisdiction claimed primarily by United States courts and possibly United States government agencies. They arise particularly under anti-trust laws. The private suits that are commonly brought under these laws enable treble damages to be given and could be ruinous of even large Australian companies. This is a problem which is not, by any means, confined to Australia, but is of considerable concern to many of our trading partners and Western allies. </PARA>
<PARA> Over the years we have developed very good relationships with other countries which are affected in this way. Certainly when I was in government I had many discussions-I think Australian foreign Ministers and other Ministers concerned in the trading areas also had discussions- with our counterparts in these countries with the object of putting up a united front of resistance to the extraterritorial application of these laws. Our legislation and this proposed legislation would be part of a wide spread defence mechanism which was pursued in various degrees of strength by these countries. </PARA>
<PARA> It was our policy, and it is the present Government's policy in carrying forward that policy, to encourage this multilateral response to the problem. At the same time we endeavoured to develop modifications of the United States policy in relation to Australia. Our particular self-interest dictated that we should endeavour to reach agreement with the United States to modify, as far as possible on a government-to-government level, the application of its laws. The United States Government cannot dictate what private litigants do in courts, but the United States Government has a very big enforcement arm of anti-trust laws in the Department of Justice. In this agreement we were primarily concerned to reach a means of consultation and negotiation on a government-to-government level in relation to possible enforcement by the Department of Justice. </PARA>
<PARA> However, another important aspect of the agreement was the obligation the United States Government undertook. If we were to persuade the United States Government that its law should not be enforced against Australian interests it would intervene in a private suit and put the argument to the court that the enforcement of that law, even in a private suit, would be contrary to comity and good relations between the two countries in the hope that the court might be moved to dismiss the suit. That would be a very valuable addition but of course the United States Government's views will not be binding on the court. That is the one major deficiency in the existing agreement. </PARA>
<PARA> I believe that there is justification for these further steps being taken. I reiterate the view we took in government. Having entered into this agreement we felt, with our existing blocking legislation and with the agreement, that we had a number of valuable tools at our disposal to cope with this threat and that it was not justifiable to proceed with these further defence mechanisms which are provided in the legislation. However, the present Government has taken a different view. It says that the United States Government will understand the need for this legislation in the manner in which it is being taken. I hope the present Government is right in that assumption. I hope that adequate discussions and explanations have taken place with the United States and that it will understand the need for this legislation. I am sure it will not accept the legislation with equanimity because such blocking legislation is very serious. </PARA>
<PARA> However, it is also very important that the countries of the Western world which are so affected by these laws should make their concerns not only known but also should make them effective. Effective defences should be raised against these economic effects which apply in the extraterritorial application the laws will have. I think this is the only way, in the long term apart from constant protests and constant complaints about these matters when they do arise, and they are certainly made and orchestrated pretty strongly. Another part of the defence is legislation of this kind. Similar legislation has been passed in the United Kingdom and other aspects of this blocking legislation has been passed in other countries. In the long run we hope that in these ways the American legislators or courts will be persuaded that they should not keep on foot laws of these kinds. I think that will take a long process of persuasion. </PARA>
<PARA> Although there are some indications that expert opinion in the United States appreciates these matters, nevertheless there is a very strong commitment in the United States, reflected in Congress, towards their anti-trust laws, not only the domestic application but also the foreign application. I believe it will be a long process. I believe it is important that we maintain a bipartisan approach to the problem in this country. I believe it is important for us to maintain the strong mutual relationships and defences that have been built up with countries such as the United Kingdom, Canada and others over recent years. </PARA>
<PARA> I know that this legislation will be welcomed, particularly in the United Kingdom because of the reciprocity that is available there under its legislation and will be available under this legislation, if it is passed by this Parliament . I believe that this legislation goes further, particularly in relation to the general orders that can be made prohibiting the performance of obligations under executive orders made by foreign governments and to some extent it may be premature to proceed with the recovery back aspects of the legislation. Although I have those reservations, I think that the more important aspect of this matter is to maintain the common front, both domestically and internationally, in relation to this problem and to maintain the pressure against extraterritorial application, particularly of the American anti-trust laws. By a process of that kind and of complaint-and, dare I say, even education by taking opportunities of various forums that arise in the United States-we may be able to put our point of view and will, in the long run, obtain a modification of these offensive extraterritorial laws. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise in support of the Foreign Proceedings ( Excess of Jurisdiction) Bill 1983. I acknowledge the contribution by the shadow Attorney-General (Senator Durack) who indicated that the Opposition would, with some reluctance as to the timing of the legislation being introduced in this chamber, support it as part of the erection of a common front, the maintaining of the shield with various other trading partners of the United States, and also the maintaining of a common front domestically so that the United States Government may know that the Bill enjoys bipartisan support. Indeed, I think much of the rationale underlying the introduction of this legislation, which is reactive and which responds to a situation forced on us by the purported extraterritorial application of United States laws, is shared throughout this chamber and by the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which brought down a report on the extraterritorial application of United States laws late last year. There is a question as to its timing, and I am sure that this will be the subject of contributions by other speakers this evening.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Senate has been reminded by Senator Durack that the legislation tries comprehensively to deal with a couple of situations which have arisen in recent times. The first instance arises when the United States, through one of its agencies or a private citizen within the United States, applies anti-trust legislation to the activities of non-nationals, even when that activity occurs in foreign states-in other words, outside the territorial jurisdiction of the United States-so long as there is some substantial impact on the United States economy. The United States courts take the view that they can subject that non- national to their jurisdiction if they can physically find that non-national either within the United States or elsewhere. </PARA>
<PARA> The most notorious example of this procedure has been thrust upon our attention over the last several years in relation to the Westinghouse case when, of course , that procedure was attempted. In relation to the activities of several Australian corporations it was alleged a cartel had been entered into in order to maintain and set an artificially high price for uranium with direct effect outside the United States, but with a claimed effect within the United States. Westinghouse entered the United States courts with a view to getting treble damages suits enforced against those Australian companies. In the end the four Australian defendant companies had to settle out of court at a cost of $11m. Of course, one of the techniques employed by those who manipulate the anti-trust laws within the United States is that they bring forward actions for treble damages, which are clearly so potentially ruinous to the defendants that they settle out of court, whatever the merits of the case, because the fact is that costs cannot be recovered even in a case in which the plaintiff's suit falls to the ground. Rather than face hundreds of thousands, even millions, of dollars in court costs, defendants prefer to settle out of court at an early stage. That is a fairly notorious example of which everyone is aware. </PARA>
<PARA> A more recent example was the purported extraterritorial application of presidential orders issued under the Export Administration Act of 1979 and its regulations. It will be recalled that under this process the legislation asserted jurisdiction over any foreign subsidiary or affiliate of a United States company abroad which was controlled by a company within the United States . The controlling interest could be as little as 10 per cent or 15 per cent of the shares in that particular company. Of course, over the last couple of years an attempt was made by the United States to achieve a foreign policy objective in relation to the Siberian pipeline to try to prevent its early construction. In that instance, whilst imposing certain sanctions against the Soviet Union, those regulations were invoked and orders were made to embargo the export or re- export of equipment containing United States manufactured components for use in the Soviet-European gas pipelines. This embargo included the export of equipment made outside the United States under United States licences or by overseas subsidiaries of United States companies. This action had a quite unexpected effect in Australia when Santos Ltd, which had contracted with Dresser France to obtain certain gas compressors, found that as the United States presidential ban prohibited United States companies from providing energy-related technology, goods or information to European companies, Dresser France could not fulfil that contract to Santos and Santos had to go elsewhere for the particular equipment to get the compressors it needed. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Durack said, these matters have the potential for quite ruinous treble damages judgments to be entered against Australian companies by the extraterritorial impact of United States anti-trust legislation, most usually in suits brought by private litigants who cannot be controlled by the United States Government, or by the more direct use of the presidential orders under the Export Administration Act regulations which are designed quite clearly and openly to further foreign policy concerns of the United States Government. In both instances very serious questions arise as to the need to preserve Australian sovereignty in its international relations. That applies not only to the more blatant instances but also, of course, to the Australian Government's policy of having orderly marketing schemes, particularly for the sale of our primary products overseas. In relation to these matters Australia must be in a position to protect itself, its citizens, its corporations and their employees, and its general sovereign policy, from the jurisdiction of United States courts. This legislation has been brought forward because of those concerns. </PARA>
<PARA> I had intended to outline the more salient points of that legislation. But I noticed that Senator Durack felt that the second reading speech sufficiently outlined those matters. Perhaps I could rest on the same approach. I did note with interest his comment that the Minister involved in the making of orders and the exercising of discretions under the equivalent United Kingdom legislation is in fact the Minister of State for Trade. Whilst it is true that we have followed the pattern set by Senator Durack's earlier legislation where the Attorney- General was vested with this power, I think it might bear some examination for the future to see whether the powers to make these various orders are most properly or conveniently vested in the Attorney-General. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact is that we have here an underlying jurisdictional threat to Australian sovereignty and to our various export and trading policies. Certainly there has been no significant change in the United States anti-trust laws. I believe that we are right to bring such legislation forward. I use a fairly neutral phrase there-'bring such legislation forward'-because, like Senator Durack and some members of the Opposition, I had misgivings about translating this Bill into law . The reason I entertained those misgivings as to the timing was that there has been some evidence of a changing pattern of judicial pronouncements within the United States. In fact, the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence recognised this development of judicial doctrine within the U.S. It referred to a US Court of Appeals decision in the Timberlane Lumber Co. case and a US Court of Appeals decision for the Third Circuit in the Mannington Mills case-courts of some status in the hierarchy. In the Timberland case it was stated by the Court that it would take into account these matters:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Does the alleged restraint effect, or was it intended to effect, the foreign commerce of the United States?</PARA>
<PARA> (b) Is the alleged restraint of such a type of magnitude so as to be cognisable as a violation of United States anti-trust laws?</PARA>
<PARA>And, most importantly for our purposes:</PARA>
<PARA> (c) As a matter of international comity and fairness, should the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the United States be asserted to cover it?</PARA>
<PARA>Honourable senators may well argue that it is not really for a judge or a court to make that sort of decision as to the bounds of international comity and fairness and the extent to which the jurisdiction of the court ought to be pushed. </PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Yes. I take it that Senator Rae's intervening at this point to say that they are matters of such moment and such consequence that to vest decisions as to whether the matter should be pressed in a judge or a bench of non-elected judges has its dangers.</PARA></TALK.START>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="NJ4">Senator TATE</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;That is right. It will be difficult to put those matters before a court. Indeed, however fully they are put before a court, the objection will remain that it is a non-elected bench and it ought not be making decisions of that character. Nevertheless, I mention that particular case and the Mannington Mills case which followed, which laid down some 10 criteria for the US courts to consider when the question of extraterritorial enforcement of one of its judgments arises. The sixth point was the 'Possible effect upon foreign relations if the court exercises jurisdiction and grants relief'. Those criteria have not yet found universal acceptance within the United States judicial system . Nevertheless, there was a movement there which gave rise to some thought that perhaps we ought to stand back and watch that and encourage its development over the next several years rather than come in with legislation at this point.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The second cause for not being so sure of the timing was that an agreement of a very single, special and extraordinary kind has been entered into between the Australian Government and the United States Government. I believe it is the envy of the other trading partners of the United States. Honourable senators will recall that, in brief, the agreement contains: A provision requiring the United States to give Australia prompt and detailed notification of any United States Department of Justice or Federal Trade Commission anti-trust investigation that might have implications for Australia's national interest; a provision providing an option for Australia to notify the United States of any Australian policy which might have implications for United States anti-trust laws; and a provision that, after such notification either party may seek consultations and that conflicts are to be resolved with due regard to each other's sovereignty and to considerations of comity. </PARA>
<PARA> Very clearly, in relation to matters which are instigated or initiated by United States Government agencies, there is good provision for consultation and modification of a stance that may have been taken up in the United States courts . But in relation to private action there is still a great difficulty. It is recognised in the agreement that the United States Government would intervene in private anti-trust actions to inform the court of the substance and outcome of consultations where the matter before the court includes activity which has been the subject of notification and consultation under the agreement. That is a mere intervening obligation cast upon the United States Government to come into a court where private litigants have instigated anti-trust actions and the court may or may not take into account the criteria I have outlined from the Timberlane and Mannington Mills cases. In any case, the weight to be given by the court to the various considerations of international comity is something that is quite unpredictable and still therefore leaves Australian corporations in the jeopardy that they may face a treble damages decision. </PARA>
<PARA> The view of the Joint Committee was, as I recall, that that agreement was a very significant step towards resolving an issue which had been a major irritant in relations between the two countries over a number of years. Nevertheless, the Committee concluded that, whilst this provided a good framework and certainly a token of good faith on both sides, there needed to be this further element of legislation brought forward. I believe that we are right to do so. It ought to be noted for the record that during discussions at the time of drawing up the Joint Committee report, which were always aimed at getting a consensus report, as I recall it, was put forward that the significance of the agreement could be acknowledged and we should have some sort of phrase in the report to the effect that the legislation be introduced and allowed to lay on the table without actually being processed through the Parliament but that, nevertheless, it would bring the legislation up out of the dungeons or the bowels of the department and lay it for public exposure and comment-that every official within the relevant United States agencies and the lawyers in the major United States corporations would know or suspect that such legislation was in preparation and it was a question of laying it out for public view and then bringing it into play if it were required. That compromise formula, as I recall it, was not accepted on the Committee. Therefore, the conclusion reached by the Committee was in the terms that 'The Committee recommends that the Attorney-General introduce legislation into the Parliament' to carry out that which it does carry out. In relation to that I am sufficiently persuaded by the argument of the Attorney-General ( Senator Gareth Evans) in his second reading speech, where he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is better to introduce protective legislation now, during a period of improved relations, than to leave it until some crisis arrives, and so heighten what would be at that time a public perception of conflict between our two countries. </PARA>
<PARA>I think that argument has merit. I think the Senate is right to accede to it, as I believe the shadow Attorney-General has indicated will be done by the Opposition. The argument has sufficient force to persuade me to support the timing of the introduction and passage of this legislation. I support the Bill because of the need to overcome a potentially ruinous application of the United States courts' jurisdiction within Australia upon our corporations trading within Australia and overseas on the basis of policies which have been formulated by democratic processes under our government. As Senator Rae quite rightly pointed out, there are major foreign policy implications. I may have mentioned the Santos case before Senator Rae came into the chamber. The matter that the honourable senator alluded to had an unexpected impact in relation to gas pipelines in Australia. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Senate is debating the Foreign Proceedings (Excess of Jurisdiction) Bill 1983. I very much regret that this legislation is before the Senate at this time. I remind the Senate that the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans), in his second reading speech, stated:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA>It is the Government's firm belief that jurisdictional conflicts between the laws and policies of sovereign governments should be resolved if at all possible by consultation and not by unilateral legal or executive action. But here jurisdictional conflict is attempted to be resolved by unilateral legislative action. </PARA>
<PARA>He also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . the Government reaffirms Australia's commitment to the consultative approach of the Antitrust Co-operation Agreement between Australia and the United States. </PARA>
<PARA>This is not evidence of the consultative process in action. Rather this Bill is of a confrontationist nature. Furthermore, in current circumstances it is unnecessary confrontation. There is no evidence of current need and certainly no evidence has been given in the Minister's speech. To make matters worse, it is destructive of the consultative process. The consultative process, which went as far up as heads of state, was the path chosen by the previous Government to avoid the need for confrontationalist legislation such as this. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that former Prime Minister Fraser and President Reagan met to discuss an alternative course and through them, and in due course their Attorneys-General, an agreement was reached. The action of the previous Government led to what is accepted as a unique agreement between Australia and the United States. It is a bilateral agreement which goes beyond that which had been previously negotiated between the United States and such countries as Canada and West Germany. I referred to the unique nature of the agreement in a speech I gave on this subject in the Senate on 2 December last year. It is based on the understanding and belief that the consultative process was the better way of resolving these difficulties, a better way than legislation which would only further inflame what has been at times a difficult trading relationship. Both parties-Australia and the United States-saw that as the better way to go. Clawback legislation, recovery-back legislation or what ever one calls it, is not helpful in industrial relations. The United States experience with the United Kingdom did not enhance the type of relationship we should all be seeking between friends and allies. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate of the language that was used in the report from the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence on the extraterritorial application of United States laws. It adopted language that was put to it that there was lengthy and acrimonious confrontation between the United States and the United Kingdom following the implementation of the United Kingdom law. The previous government was of a view that that was not the way to go if there was a better alternative. The United States also had learnt by its experience and had negotiated with Australia with what I think can be fairly described as a new attitude. Australia on its part made it clear that if the consultative agreement could be made to work it was preferable to legislation. It is clear-I think this is the critical point in this debate-that an understanding was reached that we would go further and legislate on recovery-back only if the agreement failed. Tonight we heard the former Attorney-General remind the Senate that the recovery -back legislation was before the Senate for a long period but it was not enacted because of the understanding that had been reached with the United States that it would be enacted only if bilateral agreement failed. I remind the Senate of Senator Durack's Press release of 29 June 1983 in which he stated:</PARA>
<PARA> On behalf of the then Australian Government I assured the United States Government that we would not proceed with any further blocking legislation unless the Agreement proved less successful than we hoped. </PARA>
<PARA>As I have said, there is no evidence that the agreement has failed. There is no evidence in the Minister's second reading speech that the agreement has failed. The Attorney-General, in his second reading speech, also stated:</PARA>
<PARA> When the Labor Government came into office in March this year, the general climate between Australia and the United States in relation to the extraterritorial enforcement of U.S. antitrust laws had improved significantly in no small measure due to the fact that both countries were trying to abide by the spirit and the letter of the Agreement. </PARA>
<PARA>The Australian Government is reneging on the deal that was made. It is putting at risk the good faith that has developed. It is waving the legislative big stick at the United States in a provocative way when it acknowledges that both parties were, I repeat, trying to abide by the spirit and letter of the agreement. It is acknowledging that it does not have faith in the consultative solution. Its potential destruction of the good faith that has been built up through that agreement is something that I very much regret. I am not saying that the Westinghouse case was not an unsatisfactory affair and I am not condoning the international grasp of United States anti-trust law which I think is, on occasions, contrary to international law and international comity. I am not critical of the enactment of, first, the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Act 1976 or, secondly, the Foreign Antitrust Judgments ( Restriction of Enforcement) Act of 1979 which, in the heat of the Westinghouse case, were necessary. It was a time of bad experiences and the Government had a responsibility to protect Australian interests. But the question that we then had to face was where should the Government go along the road of resolving these international trading difficulties. Should the Government introduce further legislation-I acknowledge, and I am sure the Attorney-General would acknowledge, that no legislation in this field can be totally protective- or should it seek a better alternative to develop machinery whereby these difficulties might be overcome by a consulative process in good faith? To its credit, the previous Government chose the latter path. The agreement reached, as I indicated, goes further than any previous agreement and is, I believe, to the great credit and achievement of Senator Durack. The scope and functions of that agreement are well set out in the explanatory memorandum. I say in passing that the explanatory memorandum is comprehensive, helpful and to be commended. I remind the Senate of paragraph 42 of that memorandum which states:</PARA>
<PARA> The Agreement does not attempt to provide a comprehensive panacea to cure all problems which might arise from the extraterritorial enforcement of antitrust laws. Rather, it is a framework for conflict resolution, in which two nations, respecting and understanding each other's differing positions on important issues have committed themselves to consultations and related conduct that will enable potential conflicts to be faced squarely at the earliest possible time, and to be resolved in a spirit of accommodation and compromise, according to the principles of comity and equality of sovereignty. </PARA>
<PARA>If one goes to the terms of the agreement itself-I just briefly touch upon the premise to the agreement-the language is of the same style:</PARA>
<PARA> The Government of Australia and the Government of the United States of America;</PARA>
<PARA> Recognising that conflicts have arisen between the interests reflected in the United States anti-trust laws and policies and those reflected in Australian laws and policies, and that such conflicts may arise in the future;</PARA>
<PARA> Recognising the need for such conflicts to be resolved with mutual respect for each other's sovereignty and with due regard for considerations of comity;</PARA>
<PARA> Considering that intergovernmental consultations may facilitate the resolution of such conflicts;</PARA>
<PARA> Desiring to establish an appropriate bilateral framework for conducting consultations; and</PARA>
<PARA> Considering that in, the absence of conflicts, co-operation between the Governments of Australia and the United States is desirable in the enforcement of anti-trust laws,</PARA>
<PARA> Have agreed as follows--</PARA>
<PARA>So continues the agreement that was reached. I think that one has only to consider those words to realise the moment of the agreement that was, in fact, reached. Also, if one looks at the words of the then United States Attorney- General, one sees further evidence of that good faith and the early development of what I think can be described as a new and commendable United States attitude in this field. I remind the Senate of his words at the time, which appear in the report I mentioned. The Attorney said:</PARA>
<PARA> While neither of our countries has sacrificed any part of its sovereignty or rights under international law by this agreement, we have agreed upon an excellent mechanism for channelling and containing potential differences. The United States will work diligently to ensure the usefulness of that mechanism to both nations. </PARA>
<PARA>I repeat:</PARA>
<PARA> The United States will work diligently to ensure the usefulness of that mechanism to both nations. </PARA>
<PARA>The Labor Government is putting all of this at risk by this Bill. Why? One can surmise only that a new Attorney-General hungry for legislative achievement, a Prime Minister perhaps too busy at sporting contests, a Caucus always gleefully ready to embrace any attempt to kick the Americans, fail to appreciate the consequences of their actions. </PARA>
<PARA> The Attorney-General said that he went to the United States and satisfied himself that America would not be too concerned by such legislation. I invite him to produce one statement from an American official that expressed that view. It is illogical in view of the existence of the agreement to which I have referred and the statements made by the then American Attorney-General which I have quoted. We then get the argument that now is the right time. The Attorney- General said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . in the light of this much improved relationship between the two countries . </PARA>
<PARA>In other words, we can slap the American face now because we are getting on better. The Attorney-General in his second reading speech, said:</PARA>
<PARA> . . . it is better to introduce protective legislation now, during a period of improved relations, than to leave it until some crisis arrives--</PARA>
<PARA>What a disappointingly negative approach, an approach that dismisses the agreement and the good faith upon which it is based, that dismisses the consultative process. The Attorney-General, in his speech, places great emphasis on the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. Not surprisingly he fails to mention that a third of the members of that Committee, after taking into account those who were away, strongly dissented, believing that to legislate in these terms, whilst the agreement was being given an opportunity to work, was not in Australia's best interests. </PARA>
<PARA> I remind the Senate that apart from myself, members of the Committee included Mr Coleman who is, I think, highly regarded by all in the area of international affairs; Mr Shipton, the former Chairman of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of this Parliament; Mr Lusher, who was the Chairman of the Sub -Committee inquiring into the Pacific Basin which took upon itself this reference and who had to chair the first half of that Sub-Committee's reference before the last election; the Hon. Ray Groom, and you, Mr Acting Deputy President. These members were all of the view that to legislate at this time in these terms was unwise. I would have thought that to be fair, when the Attorney- General was laying great emphasis in his speech upon the decisions and recommendations of the Joint Committee, he would have made some reference to the fact that about a third of the members of that Committee held a totally different view. </PARA>
<PARA> I wish to look very briefly at the other of the Attorney-General's arguments. He says that one reason we should proceed in this way is that no significant change in United States domestic anti-trust laws is occurring; whereas I think anyone who has done work in this field would concede that Congress is particularly stubborn in this area and that his statement is technically correct . I draw the attention of those who are interested to chapter 6 of the report of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence which looks at all sorts of new pressures that are being brought to bear by the American Bar Association, by the Justice Department, by the State Department, by the American Chamber of Commerce in Australia and other American chambers of commerce throughout the region and to a number of supportive speeches that are starting to occur, in fact, within the Congress. There is evidence of a slowly changing-but changing- attitude. Whether that is to continue whilst governments such as ours unnecessarily decide to enact provocative legislation is questionable. </PARA>
<PARA> Secondly, the Attorney-General says that the agreement will not resolve problems of private treble damages. I say that whilst there is no absolute answer to that, article 6 of the agreement provides a process which allows the American Government to become involved and which requires consultation between governments and for the American Government to put the result of such consultations to the court. Under the Timberlane principle it is likely, I believe, to be taken into account. But the trouble is that we will never know whether the agreement would have satisfactorily worked because this Government has decided that there are better courses to take by provocative legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> Thirdly, the Attorney says that the agreement will not overcome trade problems that might arise incidentally after the use by the United States of its Export Administration Act to implement foreign policy decisions. That point has been mentioned by others tonight. Again, the way the Government proposes to act is not the way to resolve such difficulties. When one envisages particular examples it is difficult to see how it would work. I for one cannot see how it could have helped the Santos case, which I noticed was not mentioned by the Attorney- General in his speech. That is the case usually cited as the type of problem that could be overcome by such legislation. The fact is that we cannot effectively legislate out of these problems. Their solution depends upon good relations and good faith. It is a choice of the way in which to operate when in government-whether we are prepared to stand by foreign relations undertakings given by a previous government or whether we favour the consultative process over that of the implied threat. It is clear that the former Government preferred the consultative process and gave the opportunity for a new leadership between friends in what has been a difficult area. It is clear that this Government prefers the alternative of an implied threat. It talks about its comprehensive arsenal of defences, terms which might be used more appropriately in a policy on war or defence. </PARA>
<PARA> The present Opposition is still anxious to remain constructive and will not formally oppose the Bill. To divide would be to accentuate the differences, and that is still not seen by us as in Australia's best interest. This is not the way we would have gone had we remained in government. In summary, the decision the Government has made, I believe, reflects poorly upon Australia and its good foreign relations and has led to a situation which I regret. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Australian Financial Review reported on 15 September 1978 the comments of Mr A. H. Page, then, I understand, a senior officer with the Department of National Resources. Amongst the comments he made was this sentence:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The philosophy underlying US anti-trust law is not necessarily in Australia's national interest in regard to export of our natural resources. </PARA>
<PARA>Nor apparently was it considered to be in the interests of certain other countries, as the Australian Trade Practices Reporter mentioned several years later in an article under the heading 'Enforcement Jurisdiction', which made the following comment:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . the encroachment of foreign anti-trust investigation and litigation abroad has recently led to positive action by way of blocking legislation enacted, inter alia, by Australia, the United Kingdom, the Federal Republic of Germany, Canada and The Netherlands . . . Governments have felt it necessary to secure their own sovereignty by legislating to protect their own citizens against investigations and orders sought to be enforced domestically by the US authorities where doubt exists as to the likelihood that the courts will prevent such investigations on the ground of their repugnancy to international law. </PARA>
<PARA> The blocking legislation enacted in Australia relates both to the investigatory stage and the enforcement of orders in foreign proceedings. Although it is not strictly relevant to the extra territorial operation of the Australian Act, it is convenient that it be dealt with here-</PARA>
<PARA>that is, in this article-</PARA>
<PARA>and maybe instructive from the point of view of comparison. </PARA>
<PARA> The two pieces of legislation were a direct result of proceedings seeking treble damages commenced by Westinghouse Electric Corporation against 29 United States and foreign uranium producers. </PARA>
<PARA>The Westinghouse case in 1977-79, if it served to do nothing else, served to highlight the fact that as yet Australia and other trading nations do not live in a world economic community. Certainly no one would argue that the removal of artificial trade barriers within a nation state such as Australia is essential if we are to achieve the benefits flowing from competition, such benefits including lower cost to the consumer and the efficient allocation of resources within the economy. Notwithstanding that fact, even in that context we in this country justify a degree of intervention to protect the weak. It is interesting to note though that as yet we in Australia have no legislation akin to the anti- trust laws in the United States which are designed to ensure that the strong do not misuse their position to force up market prices. That may at the moment be no real problem in Australia and indeed there may be no internal need for such legislation. However, it is quite another matter if such internal provisions are to be used to disadvantage individual companies trading in the world economy. In that context it is essentially the individual nation states rather than the individual companies which are trading partners, with varying degrees of strength. Individual companies are part of their respective economic fabrics and I believe nations have the right and the duty to protect those companies against attacks on their economic viability which in turn could well affect the national economy. </PARA>
<PARA> In 1977-78 Australia's export income from minerals was $4.7 billion, which represented something like 39 per cent of the total national export income that financial year. This was of no small value to Australia and the Australian Government encouraged it, as indeed it should. In the context of what, in view of recent developments, we laughingly call resource diplomacy, Australian companies sued by the Westinghouse Corporation did what Australian Government officials had been recommending that they do to avoid being played off against each other by international buyers; that is, they made price agreements in a market which had been severely destabilised by the release of in the vicinity of 50,000 tonnes of U308 from the United States uranium stockpile. </PARA>
<PARA> At this point, in view of the resource which was involved, I ought to make the point that the Australian Democrats view that the Australian companies were entitled to government intervention to protect them and to protect Australia's economic interests is not to be taken as any sort of approval of or support for the products they were trading in. </PARA>

</INTERJECT>
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="1H4">Senator HAINES</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I thought that the honourable senator would be absolutely destroyed by that! I am totally and utterly surprised! However, I am sure the honourable senator will agree that we all share a belief in the principle of the matter; that is, that it was something of vital concern to Australia, the effect of which on the companies concerned and on the Australian economy could have been quite devastating. In the event, the punitive treble damages available under United States anti-trust legislation which I have already mentioned in the article from which I quoted at the beginning-I understand they were something like $7 billion-and which may well have been justified and justifiable in that context and in that country were sought against 29 uranium producers, including Conzinc Rio Tinto of Australia Ltd, Mary Kathleen Uranium Ltd, Pancontinental Mining Ltd and Queensland Mines Ltd. Ultimately, as I understand it, the judgment was entered after, and indeed despite, Australia's attempt to raise jurisdictional objections; and those objections, I also have been given to understand, were somewhat contemptuously dismissed.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> As a consequence, in March 1979 the Australian Parliament enacted the Foreign Anti-Trust Judgments (Restriction of Enforcement) Act enabling enforcement of the judgment in proceedings in Australia to be prohibited by order of the Attorney-General. Orders were in fact made by the Attorney-General prohibiting the enforcement or recognition in whole or in part in Australia of the judgment entered in these proceedings. However, that 1979 Bill was limited in its application merely to anti-trust judgments. The 1981 'recovery back' Bill introduced by the previous government was not passed, as I understand from some comments made by Senator Durack earlier this evening, apparently in an effort to avoid straining the somewhat fragile agreement on anti-trust co-operation concluded with the United States in 1982. I am somewhat at a loss to understand why it is always Australia that has to tread fairly warily whenever these sorts of agreements look like being broken or strained to the limit. Certainly the United States of America did not worry too much about what damage it was likely to have on its relations with Australia when the United States undertook the proceedings which produced this brouhaha. </PARA>
<PARA> As Senator Durack also pointed out, that agreement provides avenues for consultation and negotiation but acknowledges that ultimately 'both countries can protect their national interests as they see fit'. Indeed, I believe that the 1979 decision by the Australian Attorney-General was made for the purpose of protecting our national interest in relation to the trading operations of trading or financial corporations formed within the limits of the Commonwealth. The present Bill seeks to further this aim by extending protection against enforcement to other than anti-trust actions and to protect Australian citizens and companies from the extraterritorial enforcement of foreign laws. </PARA>
<PARA> I am not a lawyer. I cannot judge or enter into the fascinating arguments that have been thrown around the chamber tonight by the legal experts in this place. I can simply say that if in effect this Bill does do just that-as I have indicated it does, that is, if it offers protection to Australian citizens and companies from the extraterritorial enforcement of foreign laws, laws which may be well suited to the country in which they were formed but of no particular relevance to Australia, whose laws are established under totally different criteria-it will be supported by the Australian Democrats. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I very much appreciate, on behalf of the Government, the support for the Bill that has been expressed around the chamber, particularly by Senator Durack, leading for the Opposition, who had a particular personal interest in this whole policy area, and for whom the signing of the agreement with the United States of America represented a very significant personal achievement and, indeed, a significant achievement for the then Australian Government. I can understand the reservations that have been expressed in various parts of the chamber by Senator Durack himself and, more particularly, by Senator Hill, because this is a very sensitive and difficult area. But I also appreciate the way in which honourable senators appear to have overcome those reservations and have seen the necessity for there to be strong and uncompromising bipartisan support for a measure of this kind if it is to successfully serve the very purpose for which it is, after all, being introduced , namely, to remind the United States, in particular, but also any other country that might be minded to engage in extraterritorial activity of a legislative kind, that their trading partners and the rest of the world will not simply look idly by while their interest, our interests, are threatened or potentially threatened by such activity.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The objective of this legislative enterprise, the putting in place of some potential sticks to match the carrot that is already there, at least in the anti -trust context with the bilateral agreement, has, I think, been sufficiently explained in the second reading speech not to require repetition from me now. As Senator Durack pointed out, what we are about will be very well understood in the United Kingdom, and certainly also by Canada and a number of European countries, which are only too well aware of the need to shore up legislative and associated defences against the potential application of United States law in these areas. What we are about is equally very well understood by the business community, which, particularly through the Business Council of Australia, which has been apparently the major spokesman on this issue, has made no bones at all about its support for this legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> The reservations that have been expressed range over a number of different matters. I shall not endeavour to cover them all, but I should address at least a couple of points made by Senator Hill, in particular, in reliance upon and in repetition of the reservations of the minority members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee that considered this matter in its very constructive and useful report. The first matter to which I refer in this respect is the suggestion that the Australian Government may in some way be acting improperly in proceeding with this legislation in the light of the signing of the anti- trust co-operation agreement. But that sort of criticism fails, I think, significantly to acknowledge that, apart even from the continued concern with private triple damages actions, which concern was expressed by the then Attorney -General in an address on the signing of the agreement, the whole of the negotiations for that agreement took place against a background of the introduction and presence on the Notice Paper at the time of the recovery back legislation and of a series of public statements by the then Attorney-General that those provisions in the 1981 Bill were being further considered and refined and that there may well indeed be supplementary provisions to accompany them, and, indeed, against a background, further, of an understanding by the United States-the subject of oral discussions rather than anything that was particularly documented-that the conclusion of the Agreement did not necessarily preclude further Australian legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that one can go so far as to say, fairly robustly, that at all times, as I understand it, during the negotiation of the agreement it was comtemplated that at least recovery back legislation of the kind proposed in that June 1981 legislation would be introduced. Indeed, the final form of that legislation was settled after the bilateral agreement had been negotiated in the middle of June 1982. The giving away, as it were, of the legislation seems to have come about at the euphoria of the signing, and the dissentients, in their report, are really just in error in point of fact, as I am advised, in assuming, as they do at page 68 of the report, the contrary. </PARA>
<PARA> So much for the past. What of the present and the likely response of the United States Government to the passage by the Australian Parliament of this legislation? Are we really generating, as Senator Hill would almost have us believe in one particular flight of rhetorical fancy, a warlike response and provoking accordingly a likely warlike reaction on the part of our friends across the Pacific? To make any such claim is, I think, completely to fail to appreciate the tenor of the further discussions that have taken place with the United States in the context of the development of these legislative proposals. As I made clear in the second reading speech, I engaged in extensive discussions on this matter in the United States, in the course of a fairly eventful trip in the middle of last year, during which, among other things, my house burnt down. The United States Government understood, I believe, the need for Australia, from Australia's point of view, to have protective legislation. I shall not seek to saddle it with the second leg of the famous double and say that it not only understood but also accepted the need for Australia to have protective legislation of its own, but it did, nonetheless, appreciate that Australia saw its interests as demanding an additional legislative series of protections of the kind that had become quite familiar with the United States' other trading partners, not least, of course, the United Kingdom, with its protection of trading interests legislation. </PARA>
<PARA> United States officials were provided at an early date with copies of the Bill and other relevant documents and were invited to discuss the matter with Australian officials if they thought it necessary. I am able to report that, to date, apart from an informal inquiry on a technical aspect of the Bill and what I might describe as a couple of wry remarks to me from United States diplomats at odd times in the last six months on the Canberra cocktail circuit, there has simply been no official or unofficial reaction from the United States. One could hardly pretend that the United States would be ecstatic to see any country moving to join the list of those putting in place protective legislation of this kind; but nor does it, I assure the Parliament, regard the exercise as being a provocative one or one that is beyond the ken in terms of the continuing relations of otherwise friendly trading partners. </PARA>
<PARA> The final group of points that need quickly to be made relates to the terms of the 1982 agreement and to whether that is sufficient for us to roll along with in the foreseeable future without the necessity for legislation of this kind. This matter has been sufficiently addressed in the second reading speech, but I think it needs to be reiterated, first, that the 1982 agreement is not in any way an all-purpose one; after all, it deals only with the anti-trust area and certainly has nothing to say about the application in Australia of the Export Administration Act, about which Australian business is justifiably very concerned. Equally, the 1982 agreement certainly does not cover the field very effectively or completely so far as private suits are concerned. The consultative procedures are not very powerful weapons in this area and there is always the prospect of the rogue elephant, a treble damages private suit, appearing in the anti-trust area to really make a mess of rational trading relations. </PARA>
<PARA> The balance of the interests approach in the two court cases-Timberlane Lumber Co. and Mannington Mills-useful as that may be, has not been unequivocally adopted by Unites States courts and we simply cannot assume, in any event, that that will always produce the kind of result that is appropriate from the point of view of domestic Australian industry and national protection. Essentially, United States interests are not uniform. Certainly they are not identical to our interests and neither consultation nor the application of judicious judicial balance will necessarily produce acceptable results. The legislation is not in a form which involves a plunging into confrontation on the first occasion on which a potential conflict arises. It enables all sorts of discretions to be exercised by the Government, by the appropriate Minister, as situations develop. </PARA>
<PARA> The final point I make relates to who the appropriate Minister should be. This matter was raised by Senator Durack when he asked: 'Why does not the Minister for Trade administer this legislation as is the case in the United Kingdom?'. I simply say that the Minister for Trade and Industry in the United Kingdom has traditionally dealt not only with this area but, indeed, with the whole area of what in Australia might be regarded as the business law part of the Attorney- General's portfolio, including company law, such British-type restrictive practices legislation as there is, securities control and matters of that kind. </PARA>
<PARA> Traditionally in Australia the Attorney-General, when there has not been a Department of Business and Consumer Affairs, has had the ministerial responsibility for these matters. So far as the extraterritorial operation of anti-trust legislation is concerned, the Attorney-General has certainly had the carriage and co-ordination of matters in this area. I make no imperial bid for the retention of any jurisdiction in this respect, I have quite enough on my plate in this as, indeed, in a number of other areas. I simply make the point that it is as it is because that is the way it has been. That is not to say that it will not be that way in future. I make the point that the making of any order in this area will be a matter for the whole Government taking into account trade policy considerations as well as local or peculiarly technical legal ones. I will certainly have very close regard to the views of all relevant Ministers before making any order in this area. Once again, I thank all honourable senators, particularly Senator Durack who, I repeat, has played a major personal role in this area over the years. I wish the Bill a speedy passage. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I rise to answer allegations made against me in the New South Wales Parliament by the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, Mrs Rosemary Foot, on Thursday, 23 February. The substance of the allegations were that a man named Tom Domican had been employed by a property developer, Mr Warren Anderson, to work as an Australian Labor Party operative in the inner city and to do my bidding; further, that Mr Anderson had paid Domican $20,000 a year for two years to do so; and, further, that in return for these favours granted to me Mr Anderson was to receive preferential treatment from ALP-dominated councils in his development and rezoning applications. The councils mentioned specifically were Marrickville, Ashfield, Fairfield, Waverley, Liverpool and Campbelltown. A development at Woonoona in the Wollongong Council area was also referred to.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> To try to answer all of the allegations against me will take some time. Nevertheless, first and foremost, all of the allegations are based on the unsubstantiated work of Mr Domican. I wish to inform the Senate of some of the activities of Mr Domican, why he has pursued a vendetta against me for the past 18 months, why I believe that vendetta will continue and why I believe it will have no effect. If one looks at the activities of Domican over a long period in the Marrickville area in the inner city of Sydney one sees a pattern-a history of threats, intimidation and violence waged against many ordinary citizens of Marrickville but, most particularly, many Party members and aldermen. All of those involved had at times suffered the overwhelming sheer physical presence of Domican. Anyone who saw Nationwide last night knows he is no man to be trifled with when it comes to matters physical. He professes to be an expert in the martial arts. </PARA>
<PARA> We saw an unsavoury period in Marrickville, particularly in 1982. Finally in October of that year an assault on Alderman Ken Brennan took place after a council meeting. It was witnessed by Alderman Margaret Newman. That matter received wide publicity. Indeed, it received coverage in the newspapers and in the New South Wales Parliament. I spoke at the time to Alderman Brennan and to Alderman Newman. Alderman Brennan had been terrorised by Domican for some time. He did not wish to pursue the matter with the police because he feared reprisals . Accordingly, I spoke to Domican and asked him not to attend any future council meetings. He agreed to my request, while denying that the assault had taken place and stating that Mr Brennan had simply fallen down and put on an act. Alderman Margaret Newman told me the real facts of the matter. It did involve a serious and brutal assault by Domican. </PARA>
<PARA> After that incident no further violence was reported for some time, but in December 1982 Domican broke his undertaking to me and attended another council meeting. At that meeting a confrontation developed between Domican, the Mayor, Alderman Harrison, and Alderman Margaret Newman. The next morning, one could believe by divine intervention-I do not-a masked intruder entered Alderman Margaret Newman's home and bashed her. She received treatment in hospital from a doctor. Photographs of her bruised and bloodied face appeared in practically all the Sydney newspapers at the time. </PARA>

All of them complained of a pattern of threats, intimidation and violence which had increased in the previous six to 12 months. I suggested to them that, if I were an alderman on Marrickville Council, if I were suffering from these threats , this intimidation and actual physical violence, I would resign from the Council and I would ask the Government to sack the Council and appoint an administrator. </PARA>
<PARA> After discussing the matter with them for some hours the aldermen present at the meeting agreed to do so. Furthermore, they agreed to talk to other aldermen to see whether they could persuade any of them to go along with them. In the end seven aldermen resigned from the Marrickville Council because of the threats and the violence of Domican. These seven aldermen represented all shades of opinion within the Party. Not all of them were friends of mine. But they were all united on one point: They could not take any more. On that point we were all united. </PARA>
<PARA> Where were the investigative reporters of the Australian Broadcasting Corporation's Nationwide program during the last few days? They found time to make a folk hero of Domican. While listening to his plea that he had never threatened anyone where were they? Why were they not knocking on Margaret Newman 's door, Ken Brennan's door, Grahame Watson's door, or on the door of any other alderman who had been the subject of actual physical threats and violence by Domican in that period? Did they ask Lin Gordon, the Minister whom the aldermen went to see when they resigned, why he had taken the action to sack the Council? I suspect not unless that was edited out of the program. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to read just a few clippings from the Press at the time which I think show that the opinions I am expressing here tonight are not my own but were widely shared by everybody at the time, including the Fairfax media and, in particular, the Sydney Morning Herald. The first article from which I will quote is from the Sun-Herald of 19 December 1982. In an article that was headed 'The Bashing that brought down a council', Margaret Newman was quoted as saying to Joe Payne who wrote the article:</PARA>
<PARA> 'I was threatened before, but nothing ever happened . . . </PARA>
<PARA> Now I'm so scared I won't stay alone in the house-and the windows and doors stay locked. </PARA>
<PARA> I would like to think nothing more is going to happen, but I don't know.'</PARA>
<PARA>In the Sydney Morning Herald of 14 December 1982 Lin Gordon, to whom neither the Sydney Morning Herald nor the Nationwide reporters chose to talk, after having talked to all the aldermen involved said:</PARA>
<PARA> 'No one would give evidence. People were frightened. </PARA>
<PARA> 'There is obviously an explosive situation and I've got to defuse it. The situation is one of great concern.'</PARA>
<PARA> He said that the aldermen had shown great courage to resign and it was a credit to them. To quote Mike Stekettee who has been for some years now the number one political writer in the New South Wales Parliament for the Sydney Morning Herald :</PARA>
<PARA> . . . there are very clear links, acknowledged by the Right and the Left of the Labor Party, between the firebombing of Alderman Graham Watson's car, the bashing of Alderman Ken Brennan and Margaret Newman and of Peter Baldwin, MP, and each of these persons' activities, particularly in opposition to a small and notorious clique in Marrickville, to make it clear that the violence is motivated by politics and power in the Labor Party and the council. </PARA>
<PARA>The opinions that I am expressing are not simply mine. They were the opinions expressed by all and sundry at the time. What makes the argument so preposterous -that is, the argument that Domican was working for me-is the fact that most of these seven aldermen, those who were exposed to the threats, the violence and the intimidation, were my friends. Indeed, some of them were my close friends. I have known Alderman Margaret Newman's husband, Barry Jones, for some 15 years and I regard him as a close friend. These attacks against my friends went on and on. They also went on against my enemies. In fact if I could be criticised for anything that I have done in the Marrickville area at that time it would be for not having removed Domican and his element much earlier. </PARA>
<PARA> After the bashing of Margaret Newman, I decided, as the responsible officer of the Party, that we had to draw a line. The Labor Party could not handle those sorts of disputes. I could not find any reference in the Labor Party rule book as to how one handles someone who goes around bashing one's colleagues, especially when those bashings occur in one-off situations, when they are very difficult to prove and, more particularly, even where they are witnessed, when no one is prepared to give evidence because of the reprisals they fear will take place later. Ever since that time I have lived with all sorts of allegations emanating from Domican. However, I have to say that, if asked to do it all again , I would. The decision that was made at the time to talk to those aldermen and discuss with them the possibility of resigning, to see them resign and then to see the Council sacked was correct. At least it can be said that, in the 18 months that have ensued, there have been no further acts of violence perpetrated against those aldermen or against any member of the Party in the area at all. </PARA>
<PARA> Furthermore, it should be noted that before the last election Domican proclaimed loud and long in Marrickville that Leo McLeay, the Federal member for Grayndler, against whom he also has a fair sized vendetta, would not be allowed to take his place in Parliament as the honourable member for Grayndler and I would never be allowed to sit as a senator. He was wrong on both occasions. He will be wrong in anything else that he tries to talk Rosemary Foot into saying. Furthermore, what really annoys me about this matter is that this man, by his own actions, has shown that he has no credibility whatsoever. This aspect of the allegations that he was working for me in any capacity whatsoever is nothing more than a sick joke emanating from a very sick man. </PARA>
<PARA> After the attack on Ken Brennan, when Domican had given me an undertaking that he would no longer attend Marrickville Council meetings, he told me that he wished to stand for Labor pre-selection for Marrickville Council-something which he had tried to do before in 1980 when I and others had simply told him that he had to withdraw his nomination because we would not proceed with it. He told me he wished to nominate again for the 1983 election. I told him then, as my fellow officers at the time can bear out, that not only would he not be an alderman on Marrickville Council by winning a pre-selection from the Labor Party but also I would not support, on the administrative committee, his ever receiving endorsement to stand as a Labor alderman. It is natural in Labor Party circles to work at maximising one's support by encouraging people to join party branches . Domican was engaged in that activity. He was doing so of his own volition to support his own nomination and to support the nomination of the Mayor, his other friends and colleagues. </PARA>
<PARA> Let me turn now to the actual allegation about his employment with Mr Anderson. I say at the outset that it was well known in Marrickville at the time-it could hardly be denied by even Domican himself-that Domican was the close confidante, the shadow if one likes, the constant companion and many said the minder, of the Mayor, Alderman Harrison. I want to make it clear that I bear no malice towards Alderman Harrison. He has been a part of Domican's campaign from time to time-a campaign that has been to the Corporate Affairs Commission, the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking and to newspapers such as the National Times, although it would not print the allegations without them being substantiated by an independent representative or person. Naturally enough, no such person could be found. But I bear Harrison no malice. He has simply been dominated and used by Domican. </PARA>
<PARA> Back in 1981 Alderman Harrison had several discussions with Warren Anderson. As a result of those discussions Mr Anderson employed Mr Domican to act as a security guard for his properties in Marrickville. He was employed for one year and not for two years as was previously stated. Given that the value of Mr Anderson's properties in Marrickville at the time was some $16m the fact that he would employ someone to protect them from vandals and squatters-there was quite a deal of publicity about that at the time-should come as no surprise to anyone. Furthermore, the caretaker of the Alice Street, Newtown, site had been bashed over the head with a piece of 4 x 2 and seemed to have lost all of his enthusiasm for the job. I cannot state that I witnessed Domican during his employment over that time. All I can say is that Mr Anderson informs me that he had no further trouble with vandals or squatters. </PARA>
<PARA> To go further into these allegations that he was some kind of emissary for me and that he was working for me, it must be remembered that Domican was a hated man in Marrickville. Association with him rubbed off on all those who dared to be a part of it. What is more, when Alderman Harrison, the person to whom I have referred, nominated for pre-selection for the State seat of Marrickville in comparatively recent times he received fewer than 30 votes out of some 250 votes , which would suggest that any claim of support by Domican or any claim that he ensured that thousands of people joined the Party in the area are false and can pretty easily be seen to be so. </PARA>
<PARA> The fact that Rosemary Foot would use Domican as the sole source of her allegations fascinates me. From time to time I have remembered John Dowd. Honourable senators will remember that he is a former Leader of the Liberal Party of New South Wales. These people are hard to remember as they come and go like the seasons of the year. In the New South Wales Parliament on 14 October 1982 when referring to Domican, Mr Dowd said:</PARA>
<PARA> No inquiry has yet been established to look into the latest bashing episode involving Alderman Brennan, who was assaulted by Mr Tom Domican, a fine member of the Labor Party, in the presence of Alderman Newman. A complaint was made to the police, and Alderman Brennan was given time to think about it. Of course, when one has someone of the calibre of Tom Domican in a council, . . . one must be wary about the evidence one proposes to give. Obviously intimidation occurred and Alderman Brennan found that it was in his own interests to withdraw the complaint. </PARA>
<PARA>That Rosemary Foot could go on with Domican's allegations in the light of that is surprising and disappointing. More importantly, I think it shows just what has happened to the allegations business in the New South Wales Parliament where anything goes and any allegation is capable of getting a run, irrespective of how creditable it might be. </PARA>
<PARA> I anxiously await the publication of the report of the Stewart Royal Commission of Inquiry into Drug Trafficking. I will respond to no more of Domican's personal attacks on me at any time until that report has been released. I suggest that all members of parliament, indeed all honourable senators who sit opposite in this Parliament and members of the Opposition in the New South Wales Parliament, would do well to wait for the release of the report before they engage in giving Domican any more of the publicity that he so craves and loves or the credibility that he could never have. </PARA>
<PARA> On that score I quote from the Sydney Morning Herald. When one looks at the Herald's front page on Friday, 24 February, it would seem that Domican was being glorified. If honourable senators read this paragraph that I am now about to read in conjunction with what had been said in other Herald articles, which I read a little earlier, they will see that at least in 1982 the Sydney Morning Herald had no doubt whatsoever as to who were the villains in the Marrickville piece. They regarded Domican, and said so directly, as the cause of the problem. In an editorial on 13 December 1982, the Sydney Morning Herald stated:</PARA>
<PARA> Labor's problems at Marrickville will not be resolved simply by the dismissal of the council or a few aldermen. The Labor Party must take action to rid itself of elements that dominate the Labor machine in that area. </PARA>
<PARA>We took that action. We rid ourselves of the elements in the area. For our pains it would now seem that the victims are being made to look like the villians. Anyone who goes through the evidence of 1982 can come to only one conclusion; that is, while the decision to rid ourselves of thugs and hoodlums may have come too late, it did come. The two programs on Nationwide on the subject leave me almost speechless. I will read to honourable senators what Richard Carleton failed to read out on a program on the ABC last Friday night, 24 February. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at the further aspect of Rosemary Foot's allegations, that is, that Warren Anderson was promised favours by me and was to receive preferential treatment, with the exception of once making an appointment for him to see Alderman Harrison-I might say, in Mr Anderson's defence, that that is my recollection; he does not think that I did that, but at the back of my mind I recall that I did ring Harrison for him once to make an appointment-I have never spoken to an alderman, councillor, council or shire employee about any one of Warren Anderson's 23 developments that he has so far been involved with in New South Wales. I invite members of the Press and members of the Opposition to try to find somebody. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at Rosemary Foot's allegations about Labor dominated councils giving Warren Anderson preference. Let us go through the list of his developments in New South Wales, because it makes fascinating reading. First off , out of 23 developments he has undertaken only six involved rezonings. I will get to those rezonings in a moment. The other developments include: One at Campbelltown, a non-Labor council, where he bought land already zoned; at Forster, a non-Labor council, where he bought land already zoned; at Castlehill, a non-Labor council, where he bought land already zoned; at Armidale, a non- Labor council, where he bought land already zoned; at Hornsby, a non-Labor council, where he bought land already zoned; at Liverpool, a non-Labor council, where he bought land already zoned; at Katoomba, a non-Labor council, where he bought land already zoned; and at Wagga, a non-Labor council, where he bought land already zoned. The Labor council areas include: Randwick, where he bought land already zoned; two developments at Blacktown, at Kings Langley and Plumpton , where he bought land already zoned; at Fairfield where he bought land already zoned; and at Marrickville, where he bought land already zoned. In three other councils where Labor had 50 per cent of the aldermen but did have the Mayors, so presumably they had a casting vote, he had two developments in the Sutherland Shire, at Engadine and Sylvania, where he bought land already zoned; one at Bondi Junction in the Waverley Council area, where he bought land already zoned; and one at Ashfield, where he bought land already zoned. </PARA>
<PARA> Let us look at the rezonings, the ones that people look at to see what might happen which could be wrong. There were six rezonings in all, five in non-Labor council areas and one only in a Labor council area. That rezoning has cost him the most money and threatens to cost him very much more. Let us look at those zonings. Firstly, there is one at Bowral, where most of the site was already zoned as commercial, but a part of it had to be rezoned. That part was owned by that well-known troublesome body of never-do-wells, the Salvation Army. The same happened in Goulburn, where part of the development was owned by another group of people that one has to look at closely, that is, the Uniting Church in Australia. In Woy Woy and Erina, two developments in the Gosford Council area, a non-Labor controlled council, the land purchased was already mooted to be in an exhibited plan to be rezoned, and indeed that is what happened. In Tamworth, where he bought a convent school from the Catholic Church, part of that site had to be rezoned as well. That left Woonona in the Wollongong Council area. </PARA>
<PARA> I think that something should be said about Woonona, perhaps not all of which may have been said by Neville Wran today and which may really nail forever any thought that Warren Anderson was given preferential treatment. Warren Anderson owned a zoned site at Bulli. He was asked by the council not to build there because it would tend to drag people away from the Woonona shopping centre. Instead the council asked him to develop something inside the shopping centre. Anderson agreed. As part of that deal he paid the council $1m to develop a soccer oval, plus $400,000 to relocate a council depot and purchase part of the site from the council as well. He followed the Department of Environment and Planning directives and he followed the council's directives. But the Land and Environment Court invalidated the zoning. After two years and several court appearances, Warren Anderson has still been unable to develop the site at Woonona or Marrickville and has briefed Queen's Counsel to look at the prospect of suing the Government for its failure to act and its failure to prevent a situation where he loses money-it could be up to $13m-simply because he followed the directives of the Department of Environment and Planning and the directives of the Wollongong Council. </PARA>
<PARA> If one looks at Marrickville, one sees yet another situation when Warren Anderson, far from being advantaged, has been grieviously mishandled by the Department of Environment and Planning. He had a site at St Peters-the old brick pits site-which had been already zoned. The Department of Environment and Planning wanted it for a bicentennial park, so it asked him not to build there. It asked him to move further up into the main shopping area of Newtown. He said: 'That is fair enough. I will hand over my contracts to buy the site at St Peters . I will go to Newtown'. So he spent $9m to buy a property in Alice Street, Newtown. However, the Council refused to agree to a rezoning, even though the Department of Environment and Planning would agree, and the dispute between the Department and the Council went on for some time. </PARA>
<PARA> In the meantime, in this same Government, I noticed that Eric Bedford was supposed to have been involved in the network of influence. He was the Minister for Planning and Environment at the time. The Minister and the Department approved the zoning of another site only a mile or so away at Marrickville, while leaving Anderson's site unzoned. So he had the worst of all worlds. He had to buy the second site to enable him to still have a chance of building a shopping centre in the area. For that site he had to pay the previous owners $ 500,000 for his trouble, plus the $7m for the land. He then had to sell off the Alice Street properties because they were not rezoned. That took over a year and he suffered a loss of more than $3m. Such are the activities of a man allegedly advantaged and given preferential and special treatment by the New South Wales Government. This man, Warren Anderson, has so far spent $500m in developments in New South Wales and employed 12,000 people in the process. State Government actions have cost him a fortune and placed very much more of his money at risk. Yet we still hear an allegation of preferential treatment. </PARA>
<PARA> Where would the Hermitage land rate, therefore, in this man's priorities? Whether the price was $145,000 or $600,000, it would rate nowhere to a man who was standing to lose as much money as he does because of State Government actions. In regard to the Hermitage land, honourable senators should remember that it cannot be valued as if it were the average block in a subdivision. It has no opportunity value. There is no access, not even for a four-wheel drive vehicle, let alone a family sedan. It is 66 metres long, 6 metres wide at one end and 3 metres wide at the other. It is not what one would call an average building block. At its widest it is 13 metres. I wonder why some of these facts are not stated. </PARA>
<PARA> For all of the muck raking that has gone on, Warren Anderson is talking about pulling out of New South Wales. Already, he told me that he has cancelled participation in $200m worth of further projects. A few of the places mentioned were Maitland, Wallsend, Wangi, North Sydney and an office block at the corner of King and George Streets. He intends only to complete those projects which are well down the line towards completion. It is a great tragedy that this should occur. It has been brought about by Rosemary Foot, the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in New South Wales, being prepared to accept the totally unsubstantiated evidence of a man like Domican who has no credibility, and to slur Anderson, a man who has done so much good for New South Wales. He did not deserve to be repaid like that. He has been done a monstrous injustice. I hope, in light of all the evidence presented here tonight and in the New South Wales Parliament today, that Mrs Foot will show just one scintilla of decency and offer him the apology that he deserves. </PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;There was a very busy Question Time in the Senate today. I was one of the many honourable senators who was unable to ask questions. I take the opportunity now to read my question, which was to have been directed to the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Senator Gietzelt, representing the Minister for Aviation (Mr Beazley). My question would have referred the Minister to an article published in the Northern Territory News on 8 February 1984 which quoted a spokesperson for the Aviation Minister as saying that several hundred thousand dollars would be spent on the interim upgrading at Darwin Airport. I would have asked whether the report was correct and, if so, exactly how much would have been reallocated to the interim upgrading; what areas of the airport would be upgraded; what nature of work would be carried out; and finally, when would it be anticipated that the upgrading work would begin. I wish to ask that question because in an article in the Northern Territory News on 8 February 1984 Mr Beazley is reported to have said, in a statement in regard to the interim upgrading plan for Darwin Airport:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Several hundred thousand dollars interim upgrading will be undertaken at the Darwin Airport. </PARA>
<PARA> A spokesman for the Federal Aviation Minister, Mr Kim Beazley, said plans were under consideration but it was not yet known which areas would be worked on. </PARA>
<PARA>The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works has looked at the proposal for a new international terminal building at Darwin at a cost of some $98m. We now await the recommendations of that Committee in its report to Parliament. But a very serious problem exists in Darwin. The fact is that if the international airport is to be constructed, it will not be completed before about five years. At the moment the facilities for processing overseas visitors is, without exaggeration, so appalling that I would say they are inferior to most Third World countries. Overseas visitors are severely jeopardised in Darwin and will continue to be so until the terminal is completed. Despite the efforts of Customs on the ground at Darwin to humanise the processing of inbound travellers , they are still herded through health and Customs checks under most deplorable conditions. In fact, the Customs area in which these people are herded measures only 16 metres square. Yet up to 200 men, women and children are held in that area for anything up to 45 minutes. This occurs in the early hours of the morning, at 2 o'clock or 3 o'clock in the morning. The building is not airconditioned. It is an old war-time hangar which was damaged during the war. Money has been spent on it occasionally to upgrade it to a minimal airport facility. </PARA>
<PARA> The travellers are held in this area for up to 45 minutes while their luggage is being unloaded from the aircraft and brought to an area next to the travellers' holding room. The roller doors are then lifted and there is bedlam as people fight their way to their luggage. In some cases it can take up to two hours before the traveller has been through Customs, collected his luggage and fought his way out to the fresh air. It is a most deplorable situation. The purpose of the question which I wanted to ask today was to highlight the situation and endeavour to have the Minister for Aviation proceed with the upgrading plan so that a minimum amount of money could be spent at least to bring the facilities at Darwin Airport to such a condition that people could pass through and be serviced in some reasonable manner until the new airport is constructed. </PARA>
<PARA> I turn briefly to another matter. Today I was very concerned to hear a question and answer in the Senate. The question came from Senator Macklin, of the Australian Democrats, and was addressed to the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans), regarding the Northern Territory Criminal Code. I believe that the situation is getting out of hand. I think a confrontation is developing when there should be no confrontation. I refer briefly to the situation which occurred last December. In answer to a question Senator Gareth Evans read out a letter on 19 November addressed to the Honourable Paul Everingham. The letter was from the Prime Minister, Mr Bob Hawke, who outlined the problems that the Federal Government foresaw in the Criminal Code. This letter was incorporated in Hansard. </PARA>
<PARA> On 15 December Mr Paul Everingham was at Parliament House and delivered to the Prime Minister a letter in very moderate language answering the criticisms, as the Prime Minister saw them, regarding the Northern Territory Criminal Code. In that letter Mr Everingham clearly indicated that the matter was open for further discussion. When I incorporated that letter in the Senate Hansard of 15 December I read the part which stated:</PARA>
<PARA> At the outset let me say that I hope my letter will not be the end to discussions between our Governments if you consider there are areas of concern. </PARA>
<PARA>At the end of the letter Mr Everingham stated:</PARA>
<PARA> As stated at the outset, I would not like this to be an end to our discussions on this matter if your concerns remain . . . In the meantime, a very careful watch will be kept and if anomalies are discovered proper use will be made of the executive discretion to remove any possibility of injustice arising from them. </PARA>
<PARA>Also at this time the Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, indicated his disquiet regarding the matter. I asked questions of him in Question Time. I think it was just a little later at the end of Question Time that the Attorney- General said that he would make no more public comment on the matter as he would be receiving respresentations from a Mr Des Sturgess, a solicitor who was the architect of the Northern Territory Criminal Code. He had agreed that he would see Mr Sturgess to discuss overcoming the possible problems that Senator Gareth Evans saw. We have now reached a rather silly situation. Today in answer to a question Senator Evans said:</PARA>
<PARA> These matters have now been the subject of a further letter from the Prime Minister to the Northern Territory Chief Minister. I am not sure whether it is accurate to say the Prime Minister has been rebuffed once again because I think the letter has been sent only in the last 24 hours or so. </PARA>
<PARA>That is quite correct. The Chief Minister of the Northern Territory has waited more than 2 1/2 months now for some response from the Federal Government which has now been sent, probably today or yesterday, couched, I suggest, in terms, it would appear to bring about further confrontation. As I said before it is a most serious matter. Today I received a copy of a telex to the Prime Minister from the Chief Minister of the Northern Territory, Paul Everingham. He said:</PARA>
<PARA>. . . Despite the fact that the code has now been operational since January 1 this year, and despite the fact that I have had not further response to my letter to you of December last. </PARA>
<PARA>That was when he was seeking some response from the Federal Government in an endeavour to have an exchange of views and to overcome the problem. Mr Everingham continued:</PARA>
<PARA> I myself, my Attorney-General, our law officers and Mr Sturgess can make ourselves available to meet you and your Attorney-General at any time of your convenience. I am most anxious to head off any confrontation in this matter and I don't believe anything can be gained by your acting precipitately. The Criminal Code has been passed into law by a democratically elected government after an exhaustive process of consultation. It was raised as an issue in the recent Northern Territory election by yourself and the Territory Opposition. The results speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA>I hope that before the Federal Government takes any action in Parliament the matter will be discussed government to government. I think it would be most unfortunate if we saw intervention by the Federal Government in the affairs of the Northern Territory. The Northern Territory has now been granted responsible self-government by enactment of the Federal Government. I suggest that even though the Federal Government has the ability to intervene in the affairs of the Northern Territory in the present circumstances it would be most improper. Once again I ask the Attorney-General, Senator Gareth Evans, before he flies off on another tangent, whether he would please receive representations from the Northern Territory Government and Mr Des Sturgess, the architect of this Criminal Code, so he can understand what the situation is all about. I suggest that there is good reason for the code. I recall of course that the crime rate in the Northern Territory for serious crime, whether it be rape, murder, bashings and so on, is 400 to 500 per cent higher than the national average. It was implied in the question asked today by Senator Macklin that this was a disadvantage to the Aboriginal people. Does he not realise that it is mainly the Aboriginal people who are the victims? Therefore, how can they be disadvantaged? This code will protect the Aboriginal people. There is far too much violence in the Northern Territory. As I said before it is the Aboriginal people themselves who are the victims. Murder and rape are increasing. I would expect this code to alleviate the situation. I say no more for the moment except that I believe the situation is now quite serious. There are increasing reports in the media as to the proposed action of the Federal Government. It has been said that Cabinet will discuss the matter next week. I hope that if the report is accurate Cabinet will take a reasoned, sensible attitude to the whole situation and at least accept the request by the Chief Minister, Paul Everingham, that he with his officers of law be received here in Canberra so the matter can be thrashed out properly. I seek leave to incorporate in Hansard the telex I referred to earlier . </PARA>

<PARA> CC: Attorney-General Senator G. Evans</PARA>
<PARA>Dear Prime Minister,</PARA>
<PARA> I continue to hear media reports that your government in some way intends to interfere with the due administration of the Northern Territory Criminal Code. This is despite the fact that the code has now been operational since January 1 this year, and despite the fact that I have had no further response to my letter to you of December last. </PARA>
<PARA> It is difficult for me to conceive that you or your government would contemplate the grave breach of constitutional convention to which your interference with the Criminal Code would amount. </PARA>
<PARA> You of all people should be aware of the attitude of many Australians and of your Party to the last intervention by a Governor-General into matters politic and decreed by convention. </PARA>
<PARA> As I say the Criminal Code has now been in operation two months. This is far too soon to determine its effectiveness but obviously after twelve months or so of its operation the Northern Territory government is going to have to review whether it is operating fairly and effectively. This has always been our intention and has been stated in the past. </PARA>
<PARA> It is a matter of some regret to me that your Attorney-General, Senator Evans, did not himself take the opportunity of a briefing from Mr Des Sturgess, our principal adviser and draftsman of the code, but delegated one of his officers for this task. Even at this late stage I would still be happy to meet with Senator Evans and his officers to discuss any lingering concerns he may have. I do reiterate however the following points:</PARA>
<PARA> Unsworn statements by the accused from the dock have been abolished in Western Australia, and Queensland, New Zealand and many other British jurisdictions. </PARA>
<PARA> A sub committee of the Law Council of Australia has endorsed the terrorism provisions contained in the code. </PARA>
<PARA> Provisions relating to intoxication are designed to take account of the shortcomings in O'Connor's case, shortcomings foreseen by the High Court and for which the court suggested legislative amendment. Our law should be compared with that applicable in the code States of Queensland, Western Australia and Tasmania . </PARA>
<PARA> I myself, my Attorney-General, our law officers and Mr Sturgess can make ourselves available to meet you and your Attorney-General at any time of your convenience. </PARA>
<PARA> I am most anxious to head off any confrontation in this matter and I don't believe anything can be gained by your acting precipitately. The Criminal Code has been passed into law by a democratically elected government after an exhaustive process of consultation. It was raised as an issue in the recent Northern Territory election by yourself and the Territory Opposition. The results speak for themselves. </PARA>
<PARA> As I indicated earlier, the Northern Territory will be reviewing the operations of the code after twelve months or earlier if it should prove necessary. We have not rejected or refused consultation in this matter. Indeed I am seeking discussions. I await what I hope will be a constructive response from you. </PARA>
<PARA>Your Sincerely,</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;Senator Kilgariff raised on the adjournment tonight two matters of concern to him. The first matter relates to the proposed improvement to Darwin Airport. I will make sure my colleague the Minister for Aviation (Mr Beazley) responds to that. Senator Kilgariff's then expressed his concern about the Federal Government's response to the proposed Northern Territory Criminal Code. I will make sure the Attorney-General (Senator Gareth Evans) is made aware of those matters and responds to them.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;I heard Senator Kilgariff's remarks while I was sitting in my room. I am indebted to him for his contribution to the debate. I can assure him that the kinds of noises he is making have been present to my ears for the duration of this exercise. In particular, the propositions likely to be advanced by Mr Sturgess, as the primary architect of the legislation, have been the subject of very extensive discussions between Mr Sturgess and an officer of my Department who has made trips to the Northern Territory for the express purpose of satisfying himself and accordingly reporting to me that there is a real problem in this area. The Government believes there are real problems with this legislation, as I said at Question Time today. I regret that the initial response from Mr Everingham does not seem to be one that acknowledges their existence. Accordingly, it may be necessary for the Government now to consider moving to the next inevitable stage of this process. We will do so unhappily, but the attitude of the Northern Territory Government seems to leave us little choice.</PARA></TALK.START>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 21 September 1983:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) How much of the additional $21m allocated for children's services in the Budget will be expended on 'after school care centres'.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) What will be the extent of the Government's assistance in the provision of staff and equipment for these centres if funds are to be expended.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator Grimes</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No specific amount has been allocated to out of school hours care projects from the additional $21m allocated to the children's services program in the 1983-84 Budget.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The policy and funding arrangements relating to the provision of outside school hours care services are currently being reviewed in consultation with community groups and service operators. Under the present arrangements, new services are provided with an equipment grant and recurrent assistance for approved staff salaries and associated costs according to a formula which takes account of numbers of children, and hours of operation. Usually an equipment grant of $500 is provided to a service on establishment but this may vary dependent on the size of the service.</PARA>
<PARA> As an interim measure I have recently approved a 15 per cent increase to all out of school hours care services. In addition I have approved 39 new services at the increased level of funding. Included in the new services approved are the Ryde Primary School and the Eden Park Industrial Estate in Sydney which have been approved for equipment grants and recurrent funding from 1 July 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Yes. Applications are ranked according to the distribution of other services, priorities of need, the type and quality of the service to be provided and the relative cost of the service in terms of the number of children who would benefit.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. However, no decision has yet been taken as to where the office will be located.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The Government is aware of two proposals to set up similar offices.</PARA>
<PARA> The Premier of New South Wales advised the Prime Minister and myself on 23 September 1983 that his Government proposes to establish an office of aged services in New South Wales. The functions of this Office are listed as:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) To liaise with Government departments and authorities for the co-ordination of programmes affecting the ageing and to monitor the functioning of such programmes.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) To provide policy advice to the Government on matters affecting aged persons.</PARA>
<PARA> (c) To initiate or assist development of policy/programme to advance the quality of services provided for aged persons.</PARA>
<PARA> (d) To liaise with and provide support for community-based aged persons/service organisations.</PARA>
<PARA> (e) To provide a co-ordinated information service on aged related matters.</PARA>
<PARA> (f) To foster the appointment of aged persons to Government boards and commissions where their decisions affect aged persons.</PARA>
<PARA> (g) To co-operate with local government and Federal Government authorities on aged related issues.</PARA>
<PARA> (h) To co-ordinate government sponsored senior citizens' week and other programmes initiated by the Premier, for aged persons</PARA>
<PARA> There was no indication from the New South Wales Government when the office would be operational.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that the South Australian Government also proposes to establish a commission of aged care.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="PF4">Senator Colston</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Social Security, upon notice, on 7 October 1983:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) What is the reason for disregarding disability pensions for the purpose of the income test for unemployment sickness benefit (see answer to Question No. 81 , Hansard, page 1278).</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Why does a similar situation not prevail for other social security pensions and benefits.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="72" SPEAKER="Grimes Sen The Hon D.J." NAMEID="9V4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD" GOV="1">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="9V4">Senator Grimes</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's questions is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Disability (war) pensions have not been taken into account as income for unemployment and sickness benefit purposes, other than where paid for the same disability as sickness benefit, since 1950. The reason for disregarding such pensions at that time seems to have been the strict income test then applicable which reduced unemployment and sickness benefit by the full amount of any income over $2 per week and thus, in effect, significantly negated the payment of this form of compensation.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Disability pensions are not disregarded in the legislation for other social security pensions because of the more liberal income test applying. A married couple may have income of up to $50 per week before there is any reduction in pension. Moreover, there would be a very substantial additional cost if disability pensions were disregarded for all social security purposes and other areas of need are seen as having a higher welfare priority at present.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1"> asked the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, upon notice, on 1 November 1983:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Is the Minister for Veterans' Affairs aware of a study conducted by British doctors reported in the Lancet in April 1983 which concluded that a distance of 10,000 metres away from the hypocentre of an atomic explosion is not safe and that even minute doses of radiation can be harmful.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is the Minister also aware of determinations given by the Repatriation Board claiming that unless the applicant was within 0 to 10,000 metres from the hypocentre of an atomic explosion, then it would be difficult to relate such an incident to the applicant's present condition.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Is the Minister also aware that the United States has sent doctors to Japan to study the effects of radiation and the clinical records of those who suffered in the two atomic explosions.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Have Australian doctors been properly trained in the effects of radiation; if not, will the Government take similar action to that of the United States to ensure that the situation is rectified.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) When will the study into the present health of those ex-servicemen who were involved in the British nuclear tests conducted in Australia during the 1950's be completed and the results tabled.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Will the Minister take steps to defer further assessment of nuclear veterans who have applied for repatriation benefits until the results of these studies are known and will he ensure that those who may have been wrongly assessed in the past are reassessed in the light of these results and fairly dealt with.</PARA>
</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="73" SPEAKER="Gietzelt Sen The Hon A.T." NAMEID="RG4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="QLD">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="RG4">Senator Gietzelt</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. However, the Lancet article of 9 April 1983 did not refer to a distance of 10,000 metres away from the hypocentre. Nor did the article come to the conclusion canvassed.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The author presented five possible explanations for the observed increase in reticulo-endothelial system neoplasms, either:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) far more men at risk than the number considered in the study;</PARA>
<PARA> (b) much higher radiation doses than has hitherto been supposed;</PARA>
<PARA> (c) much higher cancer risks from smaller doses of radiation than has hitherto been supposed;</PARA>
<PARA> (d) exposure of the men to other causes of reticulo-endothelial system neoplasms; or</PARA>
<PARA> (e) a combination of some or all of these factors.</PARA>
<PARA> 2. I am not aware that repatriation boards determine claims on the basis of distance from the hypocentre of an atomic explosion. Distance is only one element among many which would delineate the radiation exposure and risk to a claimant.</PARA>
<PARA> 3. Yes.</PARA>
<PARA> 4. In undergraduate medical education all medical students receive some training in the use of radiation for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. Extended coverage of radiation is provided at postgraduate level for appropriate medical specialities. At both the undergraduate and postgraduate level the subject gives some coverage of the effect of ionising radiation on human beings; the Department of Health is not aware of the 'action . . . of the United States' referred to in the question.</PARA>
<PARA> 5. The report of the study on the health of those Australian ex-servicemen who were involved in the British nuclear tests has been printed and was tabled on 15 December 1983.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="GD5">Senator Ryan</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Home Affairs and Environment has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) No. The Australian Government made two major submissions to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service prior to the 6 June hearings. The first submission, dated 10 November 1982, stated that the Wildlife Protection ( Regulation of Exports and Imports) Bill 1982 was introduced into Federal Parliament on 6 May 1982. No date for passage of the Bill was suggested. This submission included, as an appendix, a copy of the national kangaroo management program. The status of this program is made clear in section 3 (Implementation) which lists issues which should be taken into account by Australian wildlife authorities in implementing agreed management objectives.</PARA>
<PARA> In a second submission dated 1 June 1983, the Government stated that the Wildlife Protection (Regulation of Exports and Imports) Act 1982 had been passed by the Parliament and was awaiting proclamation. At the hearing on 6 June 1983, the Australian Government representatives made it clear that this remained the position.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The United States did not express any views at the hearing regarding the importance of the legal enforceability of the Wildlife Protection Act or the national kangaroo management program to the delisting proposal.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Wildlife Protection Act, the Australian Government representative at the hearing indicated that as soon as minor adminstrative details and staffing concerns had been dealt with, including the finalization of the Regulations, the Act would be proclaimed.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The Governor-General's speech on 21 April 1983 gave a commitment to establish a national kangaroo monitoring unit.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Embassy in Washington wrote to the United States Fish and Wildlife Service on 4 October 1983 stating that no firm date could be given for the proclamation of the Act or for the monitoring unit; however, since that time , action has been taken to recruit staff for the establishment of the monitoring unit.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Government considers that sufficient information on kangaroo management has been provided to enable a decision to be made on the delisting proposal. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service, in the Federal Register of 8 April 1983, notified that it had received sufficient data to warrant removal of the Red, Eastern Grey and Western Grey from its classification as endangered and indicated its proposal to delist these kangaroos.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) I am unable to provide a date of proclamation for the Act as the drafting of regulations, including provisions relating to financial aspects, are yet to be finalised.</PARA>
<PARA> Discussions regarding enforcement and other adminstrative matters under the Act are continuing between the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Australian Customs Service. Necessary discussions are also being undertaken with the States.</PARA>

<PARA> (3) No. During its first years of operation from 1973-74 to 1974-75 the fund failed to attract the level of interest from Australian consultants that was expected. Initially the operational guidelines were very restrictive and it was the Department's responsibility to identify suitable CSFSF studies and to select suitable firms to undertake these studies. This proved to be unsatisfactory from the consultants' point of view.</PARA>
<PARA> Effective operation of the fund was suspended from 1976-77 and 1977-78 as a result of Government directives on limiting expenditures. No new projects were undertaken during this period. In 1978-79 the guidelines were revised and consultants were allowed to identify and introduce projects for funding in contrast to the earlier system of Government initiated studies.</PARA>
<PARA> When administering a scheme of this nature advance commitments can only be entered into to the extent of funds appropriated in the Budget. Consequently any cancellation or deferral by the recipient country, particularly if late in the financial year, can result in underexpenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> The operating guidelines are currently being reviewed in consultation with the Australian Professional Consultants Council to further improve the fund's effectiveness to assist Australian consultants obtaining overseas contracts. With projects presently under consideration the CSFSF is likely to be fully utilised this financial year.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) In paragraphs 195 and 196 of Volume 1 of the fourth report of the Royal Commission on Intelligence and Security, Mr Justice Hope said:</PARA>
<PARA>'195. Not a few members of the public are concerned that ASIO might have a 'file ' about them. Being on ASIO's records is not, and should not be seen as, akin to having a police or criminal record. A very large number of ASIO's files establish that persons are not security risks. (4-68: They include people in vetting categories-people in certain Commonwealth Government employment, and immigrants-of whom ASIO almost certainly have a record.) But apart from this at times important intelligence, ASIO needs a bank of information.'</PARA>
<PARA>'196. A requirement that ASIO destroy all records about people whom it has not established to be security risks is not justified. Such a requirement is based on a simplistic idea about the nature, and the difficulty, of ASIO's task. Information cannot be assessed until after it is collected. Apparently innocent information about people might, after the addition of other information, assume a different appearance. The reverse can also happen. However, ASIO does hold many records which are not, or are not now, of actual or potential security relevance. As resources allow, these records should be destroyed. I have been told by the Director-General that a start has already been made.'</PARA>
<PARA> I am informed that there are information management practices employed by ASIO whereby files are reviewed and, where appropriate, destroyed.</PARA>
<PARA> Information management within ASIO is a matter that I expect will be examined by the current Royal Commission on Australia's Security and Intelligence Agencies.</PARA>
<PARA> I do not think it is appropriate for statistics of ASIO file holdings to be made public.</PARA>

<PARA> Commonwealth general recurrent grants (in the case of the Australian Capital Territory, both grants from the Commonwealth Schools Commission and from the Department of Education and Youth Affairs) are paid on a per capita basis with different rates for primary and secondary students. The secondary rates for a particular school are the same for all students in years 7-12. The table below therefore applies to years 7-12 for each of the schools listed.</PARA>
<PARA> As far as the variations in Commonwealth Schools Commission grants for individual schools are concerned, grants are based on a 3-tier system of per capita payments according to the assessed needs of schools. The AME school and the two Canberra grammar schools are in Group 1 for grant purposes. Other schools are in Group 3. The variation in actual grants for Catholic systemic schools (Merici College, St Francis Xavier College, St Clare's College, Padua High) reflects the allocation of funds between individual schools by Catholic education authorities on the basis of need.</PARA>

<PARA> (2) The Government recognises the importance and seriousness of the asbestos problem.

<PARA> Pending the establishment of that Commission, the newly formed National Consultative Committee on Occupational Health and Safety has established a working party to consider the problem of non-occupational exposure to asbestos.

<PARA> As far as any further development in the Kakadu National Park area is concerned , I note that during the recent Northern Territory election campaign the Country Liberal Party distributed a leaflet, bearing the photograph and name of the Chief Minister, which criticised development proposals made by the Labor Party as follows: 'Big numbers of tourists the Labor Party is planning to put in big hotels in the park under Balanda control will destroy Aboriginal self- determination and take away their control of the land.' This statement indicates that the Northern Territory Government is opposed to the proposed Kakadu tourist developments.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) Proclamation 112A, gazetted in the Commonwealth of Australia Gazette No. S 282 of 14 November 1983, places controls upon the exporters of live fish and the conditions under which live fish are exported to Australia.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The works to accommodate domestic wide bodied aircraft at Adelaide Airport were sufficiently advanced to enable operations by these aircraft to commence on 26 November 1982; they have continued on an ad hoc basis since. All major works have now been completed; however, there are a number of minor items still outstanding. These are expected to be finalised this financial year.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The General Manager of Ansett Transport Industries (Operations) Pty Ltd has advised that, if there is a recovery in the domestic airline market, it is probable that scheduled Boeing 767 services to Adelaide would be commenced when the company's fifth Boeing 767 is delivered in September 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The General Manager has further advised that Ansett does not operate Boeing 767 aircraft to Adelaide on a regular basis because of the effect that its introduction would have on the frequency of services. There is currently an average of five services a day between Melbourne and Adelaide; if the Boeing 767 were introduced, the average would fall to three a day. It is the company's assessment of the market that frequency of service is preferred above any particular aircraft type. The Boeing 767 is operated to Brisbane because of the much higher traffic densities which support 51 services a week. Boeing 767 operations to Perth are scheduled to offer an increase in capacity when additional frequency of service is not warranted.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Special Minister of State has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I am advised that, on the night of 11 November 1983, a helicopter operated over the camp in the course of testing its equipment. This was an inadvertent operation of the aircraft and apologies were tendered to the Police Liaison Collective on the following morning by the Australian Federal Police-AFP-Officer in Charge of police arrangements. All subsequent helicopter operations were confined to the prohibited area or to hinterland patrols well away from the camp . The access road along which the majority of women were camped runs parallel to the perimeter of the prohibited area and at a distance of less than 200 yards. AFP helicopter operations would hence have come within 200 yards of the camp while engaged on protective security missions. The usual operating height at these times was between 400 and 500 feet above ground level.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) All operations by the Australian Federal Police helicopter during the period 11 to 23 November 1983 were directed by the AFP Commander, appointed to conduct the special police responses during the period of the Pine Gap demonstrations.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Yes-but with exceptions. As the aircraft may have been placed at risk from projectiles originating from the area of the main gate, the aircraft pilot elected to douse navigation lights where and at those times when he thought himself to be most vulnerable. Airspace in which this decision operated was promulgated as 'Restricted Airspace'. A projectile was in fact discharged from the vicinity of the main gate on the night of 22 November 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The following lights were used to assist the pilot in avoiding hazards:</PARA>
<PARA> (a) Hazard lights on artificial structures higher than 50 feet above ground level situated in his area of sortie; and</PARA>
<PARA> (b) floodlighting fitted to the aircraft.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The word 'Police' appeared on one of two helicopters used by police at Pine Gap. The one making the inadvertent flight did so at night when its markings would not have been visible to persons on the ground.</PARA>
<PARA> One light helicopter was deployed by Northern Territory Police. This had no police identification marking and had no function other than random surveillance within the prohibited area. It is assumed that the question alludes to the helicopter deployed by the AFP.</PARA>
<PARA> The word 'Police' appeared on the fuselage of the AFP helicopter in accordance with contemporary obligations for police to be identifiable particularly when requiring members of the public to comply with lawful directions. In this case, lawful directions could be given via the public address system with which the aircraft was fitted.</PARA>
<PARA> The aircraft itself was operated by the National Safety Council of Australia of which the AFP is a contributing member. The NSCA is the custodian of a number of important support skills and equipment, including aircraft, for application in emergencies and disasters; hence Australian Federal Police membership.</PARA>
<PARA> Authority over tasking of the aircraft was vested with the Australian Federal Police Commander at Pine Gap. The aircraft operation was additionally authenticated by the contractual arrangements made with the NSCA and a procedure which ensured that it was not tasked on operational business without at least one Australian Federal Police officer in the aircraft; more often two.</PARA>

</QUESTION><ANSWER PAGE="86" SPEAKER="Walsh Sen The Hon P.A." NAMEID="TJ4" PARTY="ALP" ELECTORATE="SA">
<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Primary Industry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) There has to date been no public disclosure of the cost-benefits associated with the commercial introduction of pre-sale dumping of wool in Brisbane in October 1983.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation has previously undertaken some desk studies which suggest there would be significant net benefits from this system, but these findings could only be substantiated through full-scale commercial trials.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Detailed comparison of post and pre-sale dumping are presently being undertaken by the Australian Wool Corporation, the results of which could determine future reserve price support for wool prepared in a dumped form prior to sale and continued support by Queensland woolgrowers.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Although discounts at auction of 10c to 13c per kilo on jumbo bales may apply on occasion, the Australian Wool Corporation has no evidence to support the view they are that high consistently, or on average. A detailed comparative study undertaken by the Corporation in 1980 disclosed average levels of discounts for jumbo bales at that time of 5c to 6c per kilo greasy and offsetting savings to growers of 3c per kilo.</PARA>
<PARA> The Australian Wool Corporation considers it is unlikely that the difference in costs between post and pre-sale high density dumping is more than the amounts by which jumbo bales have been discounted.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) As I indicated above, a study into the comparative effects of pre-sale dumping on the wool industry is being undertaken by the Australian Wool Corporation on behalf of woolgrowers. The Government believes that the Corporation is fully competent to undertake the study, the results of which will be available to all interested parties in the wool industry.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The pre-sale dumping of wool is essentially a commercial matter which should be resolved between the parties involved, principally woolgrowers, brokers and the buyers. I have, however, been advised that unless the introduction of pre-sale dumping can be justified on commercial grounds in each case it is not likely that the system will be supported by growers or the Australian Wool Corporation through the wool reserve price scheme.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) Yes. The Australian Wool Corporation has reported that it recognises that some overseas markets do not support tri-packed bales, while others require only part of their wool in this form. It recognises also that local processors oppose tri-pack wool, and other high density package forms. The Corporation is continuing to monitor the extent of discounting at Brisbane sales as part of its evaluation of the system.</PARA>
<PARA> (7) The Corporation has indicated it will not continue reserve price support indefinitely for pre-sale dumped wool unless the system proves its commercial viability and potential net benefit to the wool industry. If this is not achieved, the absence of reserve price support and consequent lack of grower support, could be sufficient to discourage a general movement towards pre-sale dumping without the need for Government intervention.</PARA>
<PARA> Further, following representations from the Australian Wool Processors Council, I did write on 12 September 1983 to the principal parties involved in the pre- sale dumping of wool stressing that there should be considerable consultations between appropriate groups in the industry on the effects of the development in Brisbane, and that I would be concerned if there was a move towards pre-sale dumping of wool in other wool selling centres before the evaluation of the development in Brisbane was completed.</PARA>

Nevertheless the time taken for review has continued to increase as the backlog has built up further.</PARA>
<PARA> Priority is given to those reviews in which a requirement for urgent treatment has been brought to notice. The average time from lodgement of review application to decision by the Minister is close to 5 months. This includes the time taken for any further correspondence with the applicant, inquiries into the case (often including inquiries overseas), preparation of all necessary papers for the panel and dispatch to panel members for pre-meeting reading, full examination by the panel including any further inquiries directed by the panel, the panel's report to the Minister and subsequent consideration by the Minister.</PARA>
<PARA> In a further attempt to reduce the backlog and the average processing time, the Department has recently drawn together a task force which will continue to operate for some months.</PARA>
<PARA> I am keeping the review system under observation and will await the report of the Administrative Review Council on the review of adverse decisions under the Migration Act before making decisions on any significant changes to the system.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Aviation has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) The Commonwealth Government currently provides subsidies for air services in three categories:</PARA>
<PARA> (i) The Remote Air Services Subsidy Scheme is designed to guarantee a minimum level of service throughout the year to ensure fresh food, other perishables and mail can be delivered to remote communities. The level of service normally considered to be a criterion for eligibility for this scheme is a once weekly service by a small single or twin engined aircraft. As the services currently assisted under the scheme are not commercially viable in their own right, they would not be provided without subsidy.</PARA>
<PARA> (ii) The 10 per cent subsidy for fares between Melbourne and Tasmania paid by the Commonwealth to Ansett, Trans-Australia Airlines and East-West Airlines. This subsidy was introduced by the previous Government in April 1981 following an air fare increase granted to Ansett and TAA. The fare increase was associated with revisions to the air fare formulae which resulted in fares on short haul routes such as those between Melbourne and Tasmania, increasing by more than those on the long haul routes. The subsidy was provided so that the increase in Melbourne-Tasmania airline fares paid by travellers would be contained to approximately the national average increase in fares.</PARA>
<PARA> (iii) Air travel on services to western Queensland ports is subsidised to enable continued operation of air services currently provided by TAA and Air Queensland, subject to matching subsidy from the Queensland Government.</PARA>

I am advised that Western delegations assessed that to have initiated at such a late stage in proceedings a debate on the human rights situation in Iran in response to the initiative of an Iranian opposition group would very likely have had a counter-productive result.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) As should be well known, the Australian Government has taken action on a number of occasions, on both a direct bilateral basis and through multilateral channels, to make known to the Government of Iran its concern about the human rights situation in that country. At UNGA 38, in a statement relating to human rights, the Australian representative in the Third Committee expressed Australia 's serious concern over the recurrent reports of violations of human rights in Iran. In addressing this issue the Government has been guided by the need to ensure that its efforts should be as productive as possible and, in particular, should not put at further risk those suffering or under threat of human rights violations. We shall continue to pursue the question of human rights in Iran as opportunities arise.</PARA>

<TALK.START><TALKER><NAME NAMEID="TJ4">Senator Walsh</NAME></TALKER>
<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The answer to the honourable senator's question is:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) Yes. On 13 October, 1983, the Spanish Government announced that, consistent with the projections of its economic plan, it had decided to 'slow down or paralyse temporarily' a part of the nuclear power program which had been planned under the direction of the previous Government. Nuclear capacity as at 1990 would now be limited to around 7500 MW rather than the 12,500 MW previously planned.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) The decision is in line with reduced growth in nuclear and other electricity capacity occurring in other countries. Implications for the Spanish economy include an adverse effect on the balance of payments, as reliance on oil and coal imports would not be reduced to the extent hitherto planned. The slow down in the nuclear power program would also result in a loss of employment opportunities in Spain.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) and (4) The slow down means that work will either stop or will not begin on 5 of the 12 nuclear plants already under construction or approved. Although the plants which would be affected have not been specified, the Government has indicated that the decision will represent a cost to investors of 300,000 million pesetas (A$2,100m) and result in a capital saving in the short term of 1 ,100,000 million pesetas (A$7700m).</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Minister for Science and Technology has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) I cannot confirm the authenticity of the photograph published in the Geographical Magazine. However, I am aware that shipment of radioactive material from McMurdo took place between the end of 1972 and some time in 1979, at which time what had previously been the reactor site at McMurdo was released for unrestricted use.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) A reactor was operational at McMurdo Station in the Ross Dependency between 1962 and 1972 for the purpose of generating electricity.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The reactor and contaminated material were shipped to the United States for disposal in South Carolina and California.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) No.</PARA>
<PARA> (5) The Antarctic Treaty is one of the most successful international agreements and certainly the most successful demilitarisation treaty. It stipulates that Antarctica should forever be used exclusively for peaceful purposes and not become the scene or object of international discord. The Treaty also prohibits nuclear explosions, the disposal of nuclear waste and measures of a military nature, and removes the potential for sovereignty disputes between Treaty Parties. While the Treaty is open to review after 1991 at the request of any consultative party, modification to the Treaty would require agreement by a majority of consultative parties. The Treaty itself has no finite lifetime.</PARA>
<PARA> (6) McMurdo is about 150 kilometres from the nearest point on the eastern boundary of the Australian Antarctic Territory. Australia has no intention to install nuclear reactors in the Antarctic, but provided that suitable safeguards prevent contamination of the environment, the Antarctic Treaty imposes no particular restrictions on the use of nuclear reactors in Antarctica. The Antarctic Treaty expressly prohibits nuclear explosions and the disposal of radioactive waste material on the continent. Recommendation VIII-12 of the eighth Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting restates the intention of the Treaty parties that there be no disposal of nuclear waste in the Antarctic Treaty Area. If it were proposed that a reactor be installed in the Australian Antarctic Territory, the Government would be concerned to ensure that adequate safeguards existed to ensure the protection of the Antarctic environment.</PARA>

<PARA> (1) When will Telecom Australia be in a position to provide a full videotex service?</PARA>
<PARA> (2) Is there any danger that the gateway facility will intrude into the security or privacy of third party data base owners?</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Will the Minister answer criticisms relating to Telecom's decision to use the British developed Prestel standard?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Communications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question, based on advice from the Australian Telecommunications Commission:</PARA>
<PARA> (1) Telecom has set a target of providing a full national videotex service by the end of 1984.</PARA>
<PARA> (2) No. The gateway facility simply enables third party data base operators to give wider public access to the information held. The operators would need to consider whether any security problems might arise from wider access to their systems and take any appropriate precautions before they are connected to the Telecom network.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) The British developed Prestel standard is the only standard established and currently in use commercially to any extent in Australia to this time. It is compatible with the teletext standard recommended by the Department of Communications and this means that the cost of television sets serving both videotex and teletext in Australia is minimised.</PARA>
<PARA> Prestel is also the most basic of the videotex displays and this is expected to facilitate access by terminals of other types to the Prestel compatible data bases.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is therefore currently supporting the Prestel standard in the interests of cost and the rapid expansion of videotex generally throughout Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom indicated, too, that the Australian videotex environment is similar to that in the United Kingdom. The knowledge available from the industry and working applications in that country will be of considerable assistance to Australian information providers and will assist the expansion of videotex.</PARA>
<PARA> Telecom is asking manufacturers here and abroad to indicate what immediate or firm developmental plans they have in regard to compatibility between standards. Telecom's aim is to eventually provide a national system with low cost accessibility from differing types of terminals to the various types of data bases which may be established but there is still much technical development needed before this can be achieved.</PARA>

I was also asked to outline the measures taken by the Australian Government to regulate the use of asbestos and the standards of safety that apply to exposure in the work place.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration issued an emergency temporary standard on 4 November 1983, covering permissible exposure levels to asbestos fibres for a wide range of Federal and State workers employed in the manufacturing, construction and maritime industries.</PARA>
<PARA> This emergency temporary standard reduced the permissible exposure levels from two fibres (longer than 5 micrometres) per cubic centimetre to 0.5 fibres per cubic centimetre, over an eight hour time weighted average period. This standard does not discriminate between asbestos fibre types.</PARA>
<PARA> The current Australian standard for occupational exposure to asbestos, as recommended by the National Health and Medical Research Council, is:</PARA>
<PARA> One fibre per millilitre of air for Chrysotile and Amosite asbestos and</PARA>
<PARA> 0.1 fibre per millilitre of air for Crocidolite, or blue asbestos.</PARA>
<PARA> The current Australian exposure standard differentiates between asbestos fibre types, and is more restrictive for Crocidolite than the emergency temporary standard issued by the United States Occupational Safety and Health Administration. In addition, the 96th Session of the National Health and Medical Research, Council held in October 1983, has agreed that from 1 July 1984, the threshold limit value for Amosite asbestos will be reduced to 0.1 fibre per millilitre, the same as for Crocidolite asbestos.</PARA>
<PARA> As regards the measures being taken by the Australian Government to regulate the use of asbestos, I announced on 14 October 1983, in conjunction with the Minister for Territories and Local Government, that the proposed National Occupational Health and Safety Commission will give priority to the development of guidelines for the safe treatment and handling of asbestos, and this will form the basis of dealing with the problem on a national level.</PARA>
<PARA> Pending the establishment of the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission the Government has announced the establishment of a National Consultative Committee on Occupational Health and Safety to ensure full consultation with the State and Territories, unions and employers, and relevant Government departments.

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 7 December 1983 (Hansard, page 3395) Senator Reynolds asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the following question without notice:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> Is the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations aware that in a paper entitled 'Estimates of Unemployment by Local Government Area', the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations lists 36 local government areas, of a total of 145, as having unemployment rates in excess of the Queensland average of 10 per cent? A study of community employment program announcements in Queensland made to date indicates that only a few of these high level unemployment areas are, in fact, represented, leaving up to 30 areas not as yet recognised by the allocation of funds for vital job creation projects. Given that many of these areas are in northern central and western Queensland, can the Minister assure Queenslanders that there will not be a capital city-south-east corner bias in the implementation of the Federal Government's important employment initiatives in that State?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Department's estimates identify 32 local government areas in Queensland with an unemployment rate in excess of 10 per cent at March 1983. The number of such areas shown in the paper 'Estimates of Unemployment by Local Government Area' is slightly higher at 36, due to the disaggregation of the Brisbane City Council area into Commonwealth Employment Service Office areas for analytical purposes. I stress that the Departmental estimates should be used cautiously as they may not fully reflect underlying unemployment levels due to the unavoidable need to make a number of assumptions in the estimation procedure. These assumptions relate in particular to population movements and changes in the composition of unemployment.</PARA>
<PARA> The estimates will play a role in the implementation of the Government's job creation initiatives in assisting consultative committees to direct funds to areas of greatest need. However, consultative committees are dependent on organisations and authorities from these areas submiting project proposals for assessment.</PARA>
<PARA> I understand that as of 15 December 1983 applications for community employment program funds had been received from all but two of the 32 areas of highest unemployment in Queensland.</PARA>
<PARA> Applications from 17 of these areas had been approved at that date for funding, with a total project value of $7.859m and program grants made to the value of $5 .599m.</PARA>
<PARA> Projects totalling over $15.95m in Commonwealth funds had been approved to 15 December 1983 throughout Queensland, representing 38.6 per cent of the State's total allocation in 1983-84. Applications from the remaining areas of high unemployment are currently under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> The program is still in its early stages. Many project proposals are still under consideration and further proposals are expected to be submitted. It is the Government's intention that priority will be given to areas of high unemployment in the implementation of the Federal Government's important employment creation initiative.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 9 December 1983 (Hansard, page 3600) Senator Hearn asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the following question without notice concerning precautionary measures for computer operators:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> In a recent speech the Minister said that estimates suggested that at least $6 billion a year was wasted through loss of production and other costs caused by injury and ill health stemming from occupational hazards. Occupational health and safety are matters of concern to workers using computers because of the many repetition injuries and eye problems which are occurring. Will the recently announced Interim National Occupational Health and Safety Commission be looking at the precautions needed for people working with computers?</PARA>
<PARA> The Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations has provided the following information in response to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> The Interim National Occupational Health and Safety Commission-INOHSC-has been established to advise the Government on the detailed functions, structure, membership, staffing levels and methods of operation of a permanent National Occupational Health and Safety Commission-NOHSC-and Office-NOHSO-and a National Institute of Environmental and Occupational Health-NIEOH. The establishment of the INOHSC reflects the high priority the Government accords the development of a national framework through which occupational health and safety problems may be resolved.</PARA>
<PARA> The terms of reference of the INOHSC do not allow it to examine specific occupational health and safety issues. However, the NOHSC when established will develop standards and guidelines for specific occupational health and safety issues, such as the precautions needed for people working with computers and the NIEOH will provide hazard information, commission research and will advise on training needs of health and safety professionals.</PARA>
<PARA> In the past, consideration of specific occupational health and safety issues has been undertaken by various bodies including the sub-committees on occupational health and safety established by the National Labour Consultative Council and the Departments of Labour Advisory Committee. A National Consultative Committee on Occupational Health and Safety-NCCOHS-which represents a merging of these two sub-committees, has now been established to provide a means by which the INOHSC can consult fully with the States, employers and unions. The terms of reference of the NCCOHS also provide for it to consider specific occupational health and safety issues which arise in the period prior to the establishment of the permanent NOHSC. This activity will complement the initiatives of other bodies active in the occupational health and safety field such as the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Department of Health and the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> (1) and (2) The Commissioner for Taxation has advised that since the enactment of the Taxation (Unpaid Company Tax) Assessment Act 14,000 company assessments, or copies thereof, in respect of some 5,000 companies have been served on vendor shareholders and other former owners as members of the representative class for each of those companies.</PARA>
<PARA> Precise statistics of assessments issued prior to the enactment of the recoupment tax legislation were not kept. However, on the basis of available information it is estimated that, of the companies identified as having been stripped of assets and rendered unable to pay their tax, assessments had been issued in respect of 60 per cent of those companies. Since the enactment of the legislation all company notices have been issued in accordance with the requirements of that legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (3) Recovery action against stripped companies would not be productive as, at the completion of the stripping operation, the companies have no assets with which they can meet their taxation liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> In these circumstances, if it were not for the recoupment tax legislation, proceedings would need to be instituted against persons associated with those companies, whether immediately before or after the sale of the shares, who may have breached the law. Those persons could, depending upon which laws might be found to have been breached, possibly be ordered to recompense the companies and thereby enable them to meet their liabilities.</PARA>
<PARA> However, because of the uncertainty of successfully recovering the unpaid company tax by this means, and in view of the fact that any tax that might ultimately be recovered would not be recovered in what could be regarded as a reasonable time, the recoupment tax was brought in to provide a clearer and more certain technique for collecting the unpaid tax.</PARA>
<PARA> Because of these considerations, the Commissioner's general policy has been to rely on the recoupment tax legislation to collect the company tax. In a limited number of cases representative of cases in which legal processes were already well advanced, liquidation proceedings have been continued but I have already mentioned the collection difficulties in relation to possible recovery of tax from the company or associated persons.</PARA>
<PARA> (4) Under the terms of the recoupment tax legislation, the service of a company notice of assessment on a member of the representative class constitutes service on the company. As I have already indicated, service of notices of assessment has been effected in respect of some 5,000 companies which represents approximately 85 per cent of the number of companies identified as having been stripped of pre-tax profits. I have been advised by the Commissioner that necessary action is now in course to enable the issue of notices of assessments in respect of the remaining companies. When this is done, action will be taken expeditiously to collect the tax under the recoupment tax legislation.</PARA>
<PARA> (a) The Commissioner informs the Special Prosecutor on a regular basis of the progress made in relation to the administration of the recoupment tax legislation. The Special Prosecutor is also aware of those cases in which liquidation proceedings have been continued.</PARA>
<PARA> (b) No such matter was taken into consideration in the re-appointment of the Commissioner and the appointment of his successor.</PARA>

At any particular time, the conditions and restrictions relevant for uranium exported under any contract are those specified in the relevant bilateral agreements in force at that time.</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's preparedness in the case of non-nuclear weapons states (NNWS) to conclude such agreements only with those adhering to the Treaty on the Non- Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT) functions as a significant minimum condition in its own right. There is the additional requirement for a bilateral agreement with Australia. These agreements specify that Australian-origin nuclear material (AONM) subject to any given agreement (whether with a nuclear weapon state, or with an NNWS) is covered by a stringent regime of international safeguards applied by the International Atomic Energy Agency to verify solely peaceful usage. Strict conditions for applying physical security provisions at agreed international levels to the AONM are also specified in the agreements.</PARA>
<PARA> Within this framework:</PARA>
<PARA> (A) Australian-origin uranium or derived material may be converted and/or low- enriched (up to 20 percent U 235) in those countries with which Australia has a nuclear cooperation or safeguards agreement in place and operative.</PARA>
<PARA> (B) Under a number of Australia's bilateral agreements, specific provisions have been included to allow our treaty partners to have conversion and/or low- enrichment of AONM carried out in a specified third country not party to a bilateral nuclear safeguards agreement with Australia, subject to certain additional requirements being met, including the granting of prior consent by Australia to any such proposal. The additional requirements specify amongst other things that the partner concerned make acceptable arrangements for the return to itself or to another country with which Australia has a nuclear safeguards agreement of a quantity of nuclear material equivalent to all AONM shipped into the specified third country. Finnish and Swedish utilities have made use of such provisions in Australia's agreements with Finland and Sweden to have Australia's uranium enriched in the USSR.</PARA>
<PARA> (C) Australian supplied uranium is not permitted to be enriched beyond 20 percent U 235 in any country without prior consent by Australia. To date no country has sought such consent.</PARA>
<PARA> (3), (4) and (5) No Australian uranium sales contracts provide for conversion and/or enrichment services. In all cases the contractual arrangements provide for delivery in the form of uranium concentrates. Subject to the conditions and requirements imposed by Australia's bilateral safeguards agreements, AONM may be processed at any of the approved facilities in bilateral partner countries providing conversion and/or enrichment services. Such services are provided on a commercial basis by, in the case of conversion, Allied Chemical Corp.

<PARA> The Minister for Defence has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Australia's relations with the ASEAN nations are sound and close. It is a primary aim of the Government that they should remain so.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to the future of the Australian Defence Force presence at Butterworth, decisions will be taken in consultation with the Governments of Malaysia and Singapore. Upon completion of the review of this matter by the Government, there will be early and comprehensive discussions with those countries.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the honourable senator's suggestion relating to Skyhawk aircraft, I confirm that the decision which I announced on 3 May, that naval fixed wing aircraft would be phased out, is final. Six Skyhawk aircraft have been withdrawn from service, and the remaining four are being used for target towing pending the development of an alternative system.</PARA>
<PARA> The announcement also mentioned arrangements for the future employment of Naval personnel affected and, largely because of these, the wastage of ex-Skyhawk pilots from the Australian Defence Force has been minimal to date. Of the 59 pilots, nine have elected to transfer and have been accepted by the Royal Naval and Royal Air Force, two have left to seek civilian employment in Australia, while 34 have elected to transfer to the Royal Australian Air Force and the remainder have decided to continue to serve in the Royal Australian Navy.</PARA>

<PARA IN-LINE="1">&mdash;On 8 December 1983 (Hansard, page 3505) Senator Coates asked me, as Minister representing the Minister for Finance, a question without notice concerning the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust.</PARA></TALK.START>
<PARA> The Minister for Finance has provided the following information in reply to the honourable senator's question:</PARA>
<PARA> Senator Coates will be aware that the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust was established under the Superannuation Act 1976 to invest and manage the Superannuation Fund. In fulfilling these responsibilities, the Trust has adopted investment policies directed towards achieving the highest possible return in the interests of all contributors, consistent with the level of security offered .</PARA>
<PARA> The Chairman of the Superannuation Fund Investment Trust, Mr Hammond, has advised me that in 1982-83 new investments made by the Trust (excluding short- term investments) totalled about $400m, turnover of short-term investments totalled about $1.7 billion, while the cost value of all investments held by the Trust exceeded $2 billion for the first time. All this investment activity was handled by a relatively small investment staff.</PARA>
<PARA> Given its limited staff resources the Trust has necessarily imposed a lower limit on the size of investments below which individual proposals cannot be considered. While the Trust recognises that many small investment proposals may otherwise be attractive, it must nevertheless manage its activities within the constraints imposed by the resources available to it.</PARA>
<PARA> In respect of the Trust's property investment in Tasmania, Mr Hammond has advised that very few proposals have been received from Tasmania since the Trust gained property investment powers in 1976, and that there have always been other property investment proposals available which have met the Trust's investment criteria to a greater extent, especially in relation to size. Nevertheless, Mr Hammond has assured me that, in pursuit of its policy to invest moneys of the Superannuation Fund to achieve the highest possible return in the interests of all contributors, investment proposals originating from Tasmania and which are of an appropriate size, will continue to receive careful consideration.</PARA>

<PARA> The Minister for Health has provided the following information:</PARA>
<PARA> I have read with interest the findings of the South Australian Public Accounts Committee with regard to the efficiency and effectiveness of the school dental service in South Australia.</PARA>
<PARA> Under the Australian school dental scheme which was initiated in 1973, school dental services in all States were rapidly developed. Together with various preventive programs such as the fluoridation of water, this development has led to a marked improvement in the dental health of children.</PARA>
<PARA> Specific purpose grants to States for school school dental services were discontinued by the previous Government on 1 July 1981 and were absorbed within general revenue payments. Under the revised arrangements the responsibility for school dental services rests with individual States which also determine the priority to be given to school dental services in the allocation of funds. Since July 1981 the Federal Government has had no direct responsibility for school dental services.</PARA>
<PARA> The initiation and financing of review and evaluation of school dental services are also matters for individual States. The Federal Government did not contribute funds for the review in South Australia to which the honourable senator has referred.</PARA>
<PARA> I am most sympathetic to the dental needs of children, and am hopeful that in the long-term school dental services will be further expanded to include secondary school children. However, such expansion must be viewed in the context of the available funds and competing priorities. There is a continuing need for restraint in expenditure.</PARA>
<PARA> In the present circumstances it would be inappropriate for the Federal Government to allocate funds for the dental care of secondary school children. However, the possibility of providing additional funds for the expansion of school dental services is being kept under consideration.</PARA>
<PARA> With regard to dental treatment of pensioners and other needy groups, I must emphasize that this is a responsibility of States though of course it is an area of concern to the Federal Government. While extension of Medicare cannot currently be contemplated, the possibility of including dental treatment in the Medicare arrangements at some future time cannot be ruled out. Clearly this would be of assistance to needy groups.</PARA>

In addition, committees and sub-committees of both the US House of Representatives and the US Senate conduct regular hearings on nuclear non-proliferation and safeguards issues which include in some cases examination of the operations of the IAEA.
