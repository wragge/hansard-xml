If so, were such machinery and equipment sold to the persons who submitted the highest tenders? To whom were the sales effected? Are the machinery and equipment, which are now at Brisbane, about to be sold by private negotiation, though tenders for their sale have been called?If so, with what companies is the Department of Shipping and Transport endeavouring to negotiate sales? </para>

                        <para>- As the honorable senator will probably remember, some time ago tenders were called for the purchase of this equipment in agency or State lots. The equipment at a number of ports as separate agency lots was disposed of to the highest bidders. In all cases the highest bidder was the harbour authority concerned. I speak from memory when I say that the agency equipment at neither Townsville nor Mackay was sold. At Mackay the harbour authority was not interested because new loading facilities had already been erected, and 1 do not think that the harbour authority at Townsville submitted a tender. I believe that the equipment from those two agencies has not yet been disposed of. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I shall now inform the honorable senator of the position regarding the equipment that remains, that is, the equipment at Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, and the bits and pieces - if I may so refer to them - that were not disposed of to the harbour authorities. I gave the Senate some information on this matter in reply to a question asked some time ago, and the position has not changed. Consideration of the tenders submitted is still proceeding, and negotiations are taking place with those people who tendered. It may be of particular interest to the honorable senator to know that one of the tenderers with which negotiation is taking place currently is the Commonwealth Handling Equipment Pool Co-operative. </para>

                        <para>- I think I had better ask the honorable senator to put the question on the notice-paper. It is my recollection that the Bureau of Mineral Resources has not called tenders for stratigraphic drilling in Western Australia, but the bureau contemplates doing some shallow bore drilling to aid its geophysical and geological surveys. The matter is of some little public importance and interest, and therefore I ask for the question to be put on notice and I will get the correct information for the honorable senator. </para>

                        <para>- I preface a question to the Minister representing the Minister who administers the War Service Land Settlement Scheme by saying that recently, at a public meeting at Horsham, it was stated that soldier settlers on the new Drung estate wereincensed because the Commonwealth Government had failed to honour a promise to make available finance to the Victorian Government for the installation of a pasteurization plant to treat milk from the settlement. 1 therefore ask the Minister whether it is a fact that Victoria is a principal State under the War Service Land Settlement Scheme and that the State Government is solely responsible for administering soldier settlement. Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Government, by agreement with the Victorian Government, makes moneys available only for the purchase of land? Has the Minister any knowledge of any alleged promise made to the Victorian Government that a special grant would be provided to install pasteurization plant at Drung? </para>

In the " Australian Mineral IndustryReview" for 1956, it is reported that theBureau of Mineral Resources has discovered iron ore deposits in the Constance Rangearea of north-west Queensland, and it is stated that these deposits are being extensively tested by drilling by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited.

                    <para>I remind the Minister that six months ago' I asked him whether the Government had considered setting up some body to consider the effects of tariff policy on the economy. As this suggestion comes from the Associated Chambers of Commerce of Australia, I ask the Minister whether the Government has advanced its thinking on the subject of tariff policy to the extent of being able to announce whether there is to be such an inquiry. </para>

This is a matter of such importance that it has been the subject of consideration by the Government from time to time. I know that my colleague, Mr; McEwen, is not yet in a position to make a statement of the kind that the honorable senator requests, but I assure the honorable senator that although the time is not yet opportune for making a statement, the matter is under close examination and a good deal of thinking is being done on it. </para>

                        <para>- The position of the copper-mining industry is causing us all some anxiety. I had hoped that the Tariff Board report would have been available ere this. The Tariff Board has a big task in examining the copper-mining industry in all its ramifications. I cannot tell the honorable senator when the report will be available, but I do know that my colleague, Mr. McEwen, has made representations aimed at getting the information as soon as is practicable. As to the reference of other base metal industries to the Tariff Board, I remind the honorable senator that the usual procedure- and, I think, the statutory procedure- is that a request for such a reference is made first to the Minister by the industry or the company concerned. </para>

The question of whether imported prawns are suitable for the Australian market is one for determination by  the  Department  of  Health.

                            <para>-  Under this heading, I should like to put before you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> a matter affecting the order of business and the placement of business in the Senate. On inquiry I learned from the  Clerk  that a message was transmitted from the House of Representatives yesterday in relation to a bill known as the Reserve Bank Bill 1957. It came from the House of Representatives to the  Clerk  Assistant, at his office, at about 7.35 p.m. yesterday. It sought the concurrence of this chamber in the measure. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </interjection>
                    <para>The message was not communicated to the Senate last evening, and I raise the matter at this stage to draw attention to a standing order which, I consider, governs that position. I refer at once to Standing Order 189, which appears  on  page 23 of The Senate Standing Orders. It reads - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Except as to Bills which the Senate may not amend, the Question " That this Bill be now read a First time " shall be put by the  President  immediately after the same has been received, and shall be determined without Amendment or Debate. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Reviewing that briefly for a moment, if I may, the first point I wish to make is that that standing order, on its face, refers to all bills coming to this chamber, whether from the House of Representatives or originating in the Senate, with only one exception. That exception is a bill which may originate only in the House of Representatives and, as the standing order indicates, may not be amended by the Senate. So my first submission to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, is</inline> that Standing Order 189 applies in relation to the particular message which arrived yesterday and which has not yet been presented to the Senate. While I am completely confident that that is the proper and only possible interpretation of that standing order, if there were any doubt about the matter, it is completely resolved by Standing </para>
                    <para class="block">Order 231. The relevant portion of Standing Order 231 is contained in the opening sentence which states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Public Bills coming to the Senate the first time from the House of Representatives shall be proceeded with in all respects as similar Bills presented in pursuance of Orders of the Senate; </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">I believe that I have established the first point that Standing Order 189 has application to the particular measure that I am considering. The next point is that there is a duty imposed on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, as President,</inline> and on nobody else. My further point is that that duty is mandatory. The wording of Standing Order 189 is -   the Question " That this Bill be now read a First time " shall be put by the  President  . . . </para>
                    <para class="block">So I contend, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> in the terms of the standing order, there is an inescapable duty upon you to read the message and immediately to put that question in those terms. My next point is that you are to do so immediately after the bill has been received. So I claim, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> it is your duty - that it is compulsory for you and obligatory upon you - to act immediately the measure has been received. </para>
                    <para>It is completely clear that the measure to which I am referring was received in the terms of that standing order when, yesterday, at 7.35 p.m., it was delivered through the Clerk-Assistant to the  Clerk  of the Senate. I point out that in the capacity of recipients, the  Clerk  or the ClerkAssistant are, in those circumstances, your agents and the agents of this chamber. They receive measures not in their individual capacities but in their representative capacity. The point I make is that receipt by the  Clerk  or the Clerk-Assistant is receipt by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> is receipt by you on behalf, not of the Government in this chamber or of the Executive as represented in this chamber, but of the Senate. </para>
                    <para>The next matter to which I believe I should make some reference in order to lay a foundation for a discussion on this matter or, I should say, for your consideration, is Standing Order 337. It deals with communications between the two Houses, to which a complete chapter - Chapter XXV. - has been devoted. Standing Order 337 reads: - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Every Message from the House of Representatives shall be received without delay by the ClerkAssistant at the Bar while the Senate is sitting, and be reported by the  President  as early as convenient, and a future time named for its consideration; or it may, by leave, be dealt with at once. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The important aspect of that, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, is</inline> that already we have in Standing Order 189 a particular provision in relation to a bill that is received from the House of Representatives, whereas here we have a general provision. The only possible interpretation and reconciliation of those two standing orders is that the first one stands simpliciter as it is unalterable, and that the second one refers to messages of  a  type other than in relation to bills received from the House of Representatives, provision for which is made very clearly in Standing Order 189. </para>
                    <para>I am fortified in my opinion by what is recorded in the publication, " Australian Senate Practice ", which is well known and respected in this chamber, at pages 205 and 206 where, in considering Standing Order 337, the author said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>If the Senate be not sitting, it is the practice for Messages from the House of Representatives to be delivered to the  Clerk  of the Senate, and such delivery is deemed to be effective delivery. </para>
                        <para>While the Senate is sitting, Messages from the House of Representatives are received without delay by the Clerk-Assistant at the Bar. A Message is received in such a manner without any interruption to the Business of the Senate. The Clerk-Assistant, having taken delivery of the Message, hands the same to the  Clerk,  who in turn informs the  President  of the receipt of the Message. The Message is read to the Senate by the  President  at any stage when other Business is not before the Senate. Actually, there is some liaison work performed here by the  Clerk,  who keeps the Leader of the House posted on the Messages received and also ascertains from the Leader his proposals regarding the conduct of the Business of the Senate. This does much to further orderly despatch of Business. </para>

                        <para>But Messages, however, are communications from the  Speaker  to the  President,  and vice versa, and are not strictly under the control of Ministers until reported, when motion must be made for dealing with them. </para>

                            <para>-  I do not think he is wrong, and I am sure that the Minister, by the smile on his face, is merely being facetious when he makes that suggestion.  I  am sure he shares with me a very deep respect for the opinion of the author of this publication. I acknowledge that that practice has not been observed. It has been the custom all the time that I have been in the Senate for the  President  to announce the receipt of a message and for  a  Minister then to move immediately either that the bill be read a first time or that the Standing Orders be suspended to enable the bill to be dealt with without delay. The bill is then dealt with accordingly. </para>

                    <para>It is clear that the standing order was not designed to do that type of thing at all. The practice, when one is forced to examine it, is, in my view, a little silly from one viewpoint. The usual practice followed here is that immediately the message is announced, the Minister moves that Standing Orders be suspended so that the bill may be passed without delay. That is obviously silly, because the practice can have no application to Standing Order 189, which enjoins the  President  immediately to put the first question. Therefore, the suspension of the Standing Orders in their application to the first reading is completely unnecessary. It is rather stupid for the Senate to employ that method. That is the first consideration. </para>
                    <para>The second consideration is that it is entirely wrong in principle for the Executive in this chamber to initiate the flotation of a bill. Everybody concurred in the practice, because nobody saw that any evil, harm or harshness could possibly result from it. One could point to numbers of standing orders which have been disobeyed and the disobedience of which has hardened into  a  practice that has become so firm as to be accepted as a rule of the Senate. I point, for instance, to the requirement under the Standing Orders that every motion proposed in the Senate must be seconded. The practice has grown up that in the case of Ministers, leaders of the Opposition and deputy leaders of the Opposition, a seconder is not required. There is a commonsense and practical understanding that if people speak at that level, they must be assumed to have the support of their followers and, therefore, that their motion is automatically seconded. In that case the procedure obviously is a beneficial or beneficent extension of the rule. It is liberal; it does not hurt anybody; it is a rule of common sense and convenience. It has hardened into a practice that really is a complete variation of the standing order. </para>
                    <para>My submission to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, is</inline> that when it is found that a practice - no matter what the practice has been - can be used harshly or undemocratically, the Senate must disregard the practice and return immediately to the rule. I confess that until very recently my mind never adverted to the purpose of the rule that was put in there. </para>

                    <para>There are several other considerations I want to put to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> The bill in question, which is the subject-matter of the message to which I am addressing my remarks, was declared an urgent bill by the Government in another place. It was guillotined to a certain time-table, and all Australia knew that that time-table ended at 6 o'clock last night. It is an urgent bill. I submit that in any circumstances this rule is designed to ensure, as a matter of courtesy to the other place, that messages from it will be, without delay, taken into consideration. A. fortiori, how much more promptly should a message regarding a bill that the House of Representatives has publicly announced to be urgent be taken into consideration by the Senate? If the Senate fails to do that, is it not an obvious discourtesy to the House of Representatives? I suggest that that is one reason why the obligation on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> has been made mandatory under Standing Order 189. </para>
                    <para>There is another aspect of the transmission of the bill to you. The Senate was conceived, and perhaps still is thought of to a small extent, as a States' House, but you, as their chief officer, their impartial arbiter, are the proper person to receive such a message, not on behalf of one party, not on behalf of a government - or of the contending factions before you - but on behalf of every honorable senator in the chamber. There are mounting reasons for the wisdom of that rule - the matter of courtesy and so on - but, of course, recent events have obliged the Opposition to look at the basis of the rule, and the harsh conditions that may operate if it is not strictly observed. One cannot help but be impressed with the wisdom and foresight of those who, long ago, designed that rule, because it is now clear that this position could arise under all normal circumstances: An honorable senator who is away from the Senate ill would know when a particular measure is due to reach the Senate. He is entitled to know that the bill will be put into the arena by the  President  immediately it is received. He knows the time by which he has to be here. He may be desperately ill, but may feel that he should be present to record a vote on something about which he feels very strongly. If it lies in the hands of the Executive to keep the bill away until such time as his illness develops, he will be -denied his democratic right as a senator to vote on the bill. That is the main purpose in making it obligatory to deal with the matter immediately - so that every member of this chamber will know when he has to be here, I thought that a proper interpretation of that sort would have required you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> when there was no business before the Senate- </para>

                    <para>The contrary opens the way to evils, to harshness, to coercion of senators, and to a situation that can be completely unfair and very harmful to the well-being of many honorable senators. The rule is well based. It is exceedingly well conceived. Fortunately only recently it has become apparent how necessary it is to observe it strictly, and bow unnecessary and even dangerous is the practice that we have allowed to develop. In the view of the Opposition - and I speak for all of my colleagues - we consider that you should return to this rule. I ask, at this stage, whether you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> are prepared forthwith to put the message in issue in relation to the Reserve Bank Bill before the Senate now, and to comply with Standing Order 189. I should be grateful if you could give an indication of your attitude in that matter at the moment because, if you are not prepared to accept my submission, I must take another course. </para>

We will be only too pleased to give them an opportunity to debate it in due course. We still have quite a number of very important matters on the notice-paper. </para>

                        quoted the Standing Orders somewhat out of context. He did not quote the headnotes. For instance, Standing Order 189 is under the chapter headed " Public Bills ". This chapter shows how such bills are to be dealt with. Standing Order 337 deals with the subject, " Communication Between the Two Houses ". There is no inconsistency at all between those two standing orders. I shall deal first of all with communications between the two Houses. Standing Order 337 provides -

                        also referred to Standing Order 189, which is in the chapter headed "Public Bills". The chapter tells us how public bills, whether initiated by the Senate itself or received on message from the House of Representatives, are dealt with in the Senate. Standing Order 189 provides -
                    </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>Except as to Bills which the Senate may not amend, the Question " That this Bill be now read a First time " shall be put by the  President  immediately after the same has been received, and shall be determined without Amendment or Debate. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> contention were upheld, it would mean that whenever a message came from the House of Representatives - and sometimes we receive as many as 30 a day - the debate then ensuing, no matter how important, would be interrupted. It is suggested - if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is serious in his contention that you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and not the Minister in charge of the bill, would put the question, " That this bill be now read a first time ". That is a fantastic suggestion. The only person who can move the first reading of a bill is the Minister in charge of the bill. Never, since federation, has such a motion ever been put in the way suggested. The question must be raised on motion by the Minister. The question does not emerge uninspired from the  President  himself. The  President  has nothing whatever to do with the passage of bills through this chamber. Every bill, whether it is initiated in this chamber, or comes here on message, is the responsibility of the Government, and is in the charge of a particular Minister. That Minister alone may move that the bill be read a first time. The question is propounded by the Minister himself. </para>
                    <para>That then is put by the  President  on the motion of the Minister in charge of the bill, otherwise the position would be completely absurd. As I say, if you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> every half-hour or hour during an important debate in this chamber receive messages from the House of Representatives, are you, not knowing anything about the relevant bills and having no responsibility for the carriage of them, to interrupt the debate by saying, " Honorable senators, I have received a message from the House of Representatives, and I move that the bill be read a first time "? What fantastic nonsense that would be! So I submit there is no conflict at all, particularly in view of the provision for dealing with public bills by the Senate and the provisions in respect of communications between the two Houses as set out in Chapter XXV. of the Standing Orders. </para>
                    <para>It is quite obvious that Standing Order 189 means that the motion for the first reading of a bill received from the House of Representatives shall be moved at the convenience of the Minister. That must be done at his convenience, because there may be amendments to be moved in the Senate. It may not always be convenient for the Minister to move a motion for the first reading immediately the bill reaches this chamber from the House of Repre sentatives, and it has never been the practice for such bills to be launched in this chamber immediately after their receipt. </para>
                    <para>As it happened, the relevant bill was received with a message after dinner last night. We had then, and we still have, a considerable number of measures on the notice-paper, measures which are supplementary to the Budget, measures which would in the ordinary course of events be dealt with and finished so that the budgetary proposals of the Government could be given effect. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to the illness of an honorable senator. I understand tha: several honorable senators are not well. In that regard, the Government is very concerned and very sympathetic, but I would have you know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that it is not the Government that has been responsible for bringing these senators here. It is entirely the responsibility of a ruthless machine that has brought them here. </para>

                    <para>It has been said that this measure was declared an urgent measure in another place. It must be borne in mind - and this is public property - that the Leader of the House had a firm arrangement with the Leader on the Opposition side providing for an orderly debate on this very important banking legislation. That arrangement was repudiated. Subsequently, shocking delays occurred last Thursday evening, when more than twenty divisions took place, wasting in all over three hours of debating time. Apparently the Opposition was not really sincere in its desire to debate the measure. It was only because the Opposition in another place gave ample evidence that it was not concerned at all about debating the merits of the bill that the Government was constrained to use the " guillotine ". <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in due course, when other matters that we consider to be important have been dealt with- </para>

                            <para>-  The Budget is anything but parish pump business. There are some very important budgetary measures to be dealt with. When the Government deems it convenient and fitting to do so, it will afford to the Opposition an opportunity of debating the banking legislation. In the meantime, and as a matter of idle interest, I should like the Opposition to indicate whether or not it is prepared te debate the measure. I should like to know whether honorable senators opposite have changed their minds again. Last night it was clearly indicated that the Opposition had no intention whatever of debating the legislation; and to-day honorable senators opposite have stated, with a display of crocodile tears, that the Government is not giving the Senate an opportunity to discharge its functions. Fancy this charge being made by a party that is pledged to destroy the Senate, because that party regards it as an anachronism which stands between the wishes of the people and their elected representatives in another place! Yet, less than two years ago, this Government was returned with a majority of 27 in the House of Representatives. In this Senate, less than two years ago, the Government won seventeen out of 30 vacancies, yet the Opposition, the champion and the bulwark of democracy, so-called, is prepared to thwart the wishes of the majority of the people of Australia so recently, so clearly, and so convincingly expressed. If honorable senators opposite want the Senate to be destroyed, they could not go about it in a better way. They are holding the Senate up to ridicule. They are betraying the trust that has been reposed in them by the people who sent them here to serve. </para>

                            <para>-  I regard this discussion to-day as only a further act in a very macabre and horrifying drama in this place and one which, as time goes on, is disturbing the sensibilities of honorable senators on both sides of the chamber. Where the responsibility for that may lie is a matter for discussion and dispute between the Government and the Opposition. There is at least one thing that can be said, so far as I am concerned, and that is that I am not responsible in any way for the presence of the honorable senator whose condition is the cause of such concern, nor am I responsible, on the other hand, for keeping him here. Therefore, if I intrude in this debate it is for the purpose of trying to bring to some conclusion as early as possible this situation which is now causing all of us so much concern. </para>

                    <para>Having said that, I direct attention on the technical side to the submissions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> and more particularly to Standing Order 189, when compared with a similar standing order of the House of Representatives. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> in a brief reference, indicated that the Senate stands in an entirely different position from another place in relation to the Constitution. The Senate was originally constituted as a States' House; a House without any definite party affiliations; a House which was to function under the Constitution in protection of the component States of the federation, if necessary; a House divorced from the executive government of the day, and a House where strict party divisions were not contemplated. The presence of yourself, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in the chair, with a preliminary but no casting vote is an indication of the desire and the necessity to preserve complete parity between the six States in the deliberations of this assembly. Therefore, it is only to be expected that the approach to the passage of legislation by the other House under its Standing Orders is different from the approach to the passage of legislation by this chamber under its Standing Orders. </para>

                        submitted that the bill having been received, the responsibility then of presenting it and moving that it be read a first time was imposed on the  President  and was apparently divorced from the executive government. Whatever may be the practice that has grown up in this chamber, that does not necessarily justify any departure from something which is specific and mandatory, if it is to be read that way, and something which is specific and mandatory because it was intended to carry into effect the very purpose of this chamber itself.

That is a completely different standing order from the one which affects our deliberations.

                    <para>I suggest that our standing order has been severely departed from in practice and convention. That is a departure which normally is tolerated, but which becomes inexcusable in circumstances such as those which have now arisen. In the last fortnight or three weeks, we have had a similar debate on a standing order of the Senate, from which the conclusion emerged that the standing order itself was difficult to operate and was, perhaps, almost indefensible. That was not the point. I do not wish to reflect on a decision of the Chair, but one honorable senator of the Opposition subsequently suggested,. I think, that the standing order should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee, because in its strict terms it would create a difficult, if not an impossible, position. But it was not the function of the Senate to depart from it merely because of that. The standing order had to be obeyed. If it could not readily and wisely be obeyed, it had to be altered. </para>
                    <para>I submit that this is the same type of proposition. The same type of problem arises in relation to this standing order. If it is not workable, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> suggests, and might involve repeated interruptions of the proceedings of the Senate, that is a matter to be rectified in another way, but while the standing order is here - specific, determined and mandatory - I feel that we have no alternative but to obey it and abide by it strictly. </para>
                    <para>It is a horrible situation in which we-, discuss this proposition coldly and academically. I suggest that in these circumstances the Senate should come down on the side of the strict observance of the standing order, particularly as that would resolve a situation which otherwise would be come more and more difficult. We do not do anything for democracy by merely obeying the forms of democracy. When there is an honorable senator who substantively is present, has a right to vote, and, therefore, is armed with a mandate to participate in these deliberations and in any decision, no government or party is entitled by any type of subterfuge to avoid the obviously declared will of the electorate by in any way postponing, in the most unrealistic manner and terms, an opportunity for that honorable senator to declare himself and to vote. For those reasons, I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> submission should be upheld. </para>

The standing order, of course, does not refer to the procedure to be adopted in relation to the other class of bill, a bill that the Senate may not amend, and one can only assume that so far as that class of bill is concerned, another procedure should apply. I invite the Senate to a consideration of the foolishness of the consequences of accepting this proposition. </para>

                    <para>I am fortified in this argument by my suggestion that Chapter XIX. relates entirely to the procedure of the Senate in the initiation of bills and the debating of them. It does not refer at any point to the receipt of messages from the other place.

I feel that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> may have unwittingly misread this standing order for the purpose of his argument. If we accepted his view, we would get the most preposterous position that the  President  is charged with responsibility for deciding when a bill, an executive act, shall be read. That is entirely contrary to the principles of responsible government, and, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is arguing on those lines now, I shall be most interested to learn what will happen if - I repeat, if - he ever gets on to the treasury bench. </para>

A problem submitted in this way allows little room for consideration. I do not know what consideration preceded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> speech to the Senate, but I do suggest, especially in view of what he said, and in view of the technical opinion put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> that if some attention were given to the way in which the Standing Orders were compiled, it would appear in this light: Chapter XXV. deals with communications between the two Houses, and that chapter contains Standing Order  337.  Chapter XIX. deals with public bills and is primarily addressed to bills initiated in this place. That contains Standing Order  189. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> obviously found difficultly in reconciling the two standing orders and, as I understood him, he suggested that it would be unnecessary and stupid to seek to employ Standing Order  189.  I may be doing the Leader of the Opposition an injustice, but that is the note I took at the time. </para>

When we look at Standing Order 337, we see that it deals with the specific subject of communications between the two Houses. The message from the  Speaker  announces that the other House transmits to us a bill, and requests the concurrence of the Senate therein. That is a message, and the standing order says that the message shall be received without delay. Of course, we do not keep the representative of the House of Representatives waiting at the bar, nor do we turn him away churlishly and ask him " to come back to-morrow ". We send our Clerk-Assistant to meet him. He has a standing obligation under the Standing Orders to wait upon the messenger and, ministerially, convey that message to the table of the  Clerk,  and then, I agree, the  President  is under a parliamentary obligation to every honorable senator to report the receipt of the message as early as convenient. </para>

Although Standing Order 231 states that bills shall be proceeded with in the same manner in all respects, whether they are initiated here or transmitted from below, if honorable senators revert to Standing Order 189 which, as I pointed out, is in the chapter dealing with bills originating in the Senate, they will find that it states -   the Question " That this Bill be now read a First time " shall be put by the  President  immediately after the same has been received . . . </para>
                    <para class="block">I direct attention to the phrase " after the same has been received ". If honorable senators examine Standing Order 185, they will note that a bill is not received into this chamber except by a motion for a committee of not less than two senators, or a motion for leave to bring in a bill. So these wheelbarrow technicalities are beginning to creak a little. I hope that the business of this Senate will not be concerned with such insupportable technicalities. </para>

Honorable senators may please themselves how they do that, but if it is to be by the vote of the Senate, I hope that the Senate will vote. If it is to be by arrangement between the party leaders, I hope that they will have regard to the purposes of democracy and the higher methods by which we can express democracy. The procedure will be, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, with due respect to the House of Representatives. I emphasize that I have said " due respect " and not " undue respect ". Members of the House of Representatives do not vote in this chamber, but we shall not be paying due respect to them if this bill is not taken into consideration by this Senate and properly debated, and if every member of the Senate is not accorded his right to speak and vote on it in accordance with the authority that the people have entrusted to him. </para>

He gave a recital of a number of instances in which the Senate had departed from Standing Orders, but I take it from his statement that he has been in accord with those departures. Because a certain situation has developed, the Leader of the Opposition now desires that we should adhere strictly to the Standing Orders as he interprets them to apply to this particular case.

                    <para>Because a sick man is waiting to vote, a great deal of play is being made upon the emotions of people; but we must not let that carry us away. I was astonished at the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne,</inline> who I think most of us recognize as being very fair, spoke in dealing with this situation. The interpretation to be placed on his speech is that, because a vote was not being taken on the measure with which we are concerned, we were holding this man at Parliament House. But to do that would be a negation of democracy. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> pointed out, there is no doubt that the Opposition intended to wipe out this bill at the firstreading stage. That would have deprived honorable senators of their democratic right to debate the measure. As my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearson,</inline> reminds me, we would not even have had the opportunity to hear a second-reading speech by the Minister in charge of the bill. This House has been established for the purpose of enabling debate to take place. </para>
                    <para>The measure in question is a very important piece of legislation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> pointed out, within the last decade probably no more important bill has come before this chamber. It is suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> that, if the measure had been introduced last night, it could have been disposed of then. This bill is of such importance that honorable senators may be required to attend for one week, two weeks, or perhaps even longer; they may even be required to be here for four weeks. When speeches are made with a view to conveying the impression that it is not right for the Senate to keep someone waiting for a day, we have brought to our minds very clearly just what is behind the Opposition's move. </para>
                    <para>I agree with the further statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that deliberation should take place. I know that it is the intention of the Opposition that there shall be no debate; but, as it has thrown down the gauntlet and is prepared to deprive honorable senators of their democratic rights in this chamber, I believe that the Government is acting correctly. </para>
                    <para>In regard to the particular matter that is now before you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I believe that the interpretations that have been given by honorable senators on this side of the chamber carry with them sincerity and a conviction of correctness. Therefore, I support what my colleagues have said. I believe that the Senate should keep in mind that in no circumstances should it allow such an important measure to come before it and be disposed of without any one having had the right to hear a second-reading speech from the Minister in charge of it. </para>

To all intents and purposes May's " Parliamentary Practice " has been followed. For the purposes of expediency and convenience, a very important Standing Order has been turned into a farce. I should like to say, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, that</inline> if it had not been for certain circumstances you may not have been the presiding officer of this chamber at the present time. Suppose the position had been dealt with by lot and the number of votes cast by each side had been the same, and I, and not you, now occupied the chair. If a message transmitting a bill were received from the House of Representatives and I purposely decided not to allow the measure in question to be discussed, my action would be contrary to the spirit of the appropriate Standing Order which clearly states that the message should be received, that it should have the concurrence of the Senate, and that the measure in question should be placed on the business paper as soon as is convenient. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has interpreted the Standing Orders very clearly, but that the Government has transgressed them for the purposes of convenience and expediency. </para>

I have followed the practice that has obtained for very many years, that is, when a message is received from the House of Representatives, it is handed to the  President  by the  Clerk  only after a Minister of the Crown indicates that he should do so. This practice has been based on the principle that the conduct of the business of the Senate is in the hands of Ministers of the Crown. Indeed, the practice obtained when the Leader of the Opposition himself was a Minister of the Crown. It is well known that sometimes practice may be at variance with the written rule or order. </para>
                    <para>I have considered whether the question as to whether the Standing Orders should be amended to conform to the long established practice to which I have referred should be examined by the Standing Orders Committee, and I propose to include that item in the agenda for the next meeting of the committee. As a matter of fact, it was only during last week that I convened a meeting of the committee for the purpose of discussing a proposal that there should be a complete review of the Standing Orders. The meeting was to have been held this morning, but owing to unforeseen circumstances, it was postponed. </para>

                            <para>-  The party to which I have the honour to belong pays great tribute to those four senators who, under great stress and difficulty, have come to do their part for themselves as senators and for their party. They feel strongly about one measure. Why pretend that it is anything but the banking legislation? It is that and that alone. They are here to vote against that measure and that alone. Three of them are heart cases. There is tension in this place. They were entitled to expect that that measure would be dealt with as an urgent measure - it was so declared by the Government - on their arrival yesterday, that a conclusion would be reached and that the strain would be taken off them. What an intolerable strain this Government has put on these sick people! </para>

                    <para>It is obvious that the Opposition is to be told nothing about the order of business, and that the order of business may be changed from minute to minute. The Government is in a position to switch the order of business from minute to minute. It has a right to do so. But what is happening now is completely unconscionable and intolerable for really sick people. I am exempting <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> for the moment. Under the circumstances, these sick people cannot leave the precincts of this chamber for a moment. If a Government senator is on his feet, he may conclude his remarks suddenly and this measure may be introduced in a matter of seconds, with- the Opposition caught off-guard. The Government is treating the processes of the Senate with contempt and is acting very unfairly to the honorable senators who are known to be unwell. </para>

                            <para>- I misunderstood the honorable senator. Arguments have been directed to the meaning of Standing Order 189, upon which I based my proposition. It amazes me to hear responsible senators seeking to give no meaning to a rule expressed with such clarity and particularity. 1 ask the Leader of the Government: How can an intervening motion be put by a Minister when the terms of the standing order make it very plain that the question " That the bill be now read a first time " shall be put by the  President  immediately after the same - the bill - has been received. The bill is received the moment the message is in the President's hands. </para>

                    <para>It interested me to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> seeking to create confusion between bills that are initiated in this place and bills that are received from another place. I say that without doubt the honorable senator knows perfectly well - I know that he knows - the principle of construction that applies in these cases. Standing Order 337 is completely general. Standing Order 189 has a particular application. Nobody knows better than the honorable senator that a particular standing order prevails over a general standing order. Nobody knows better than he that Standing Order 189 refers to two matters. It refers to bills received from the House of Representatives as well as to bills originating in the Senate. The opening words should make that perfectly clear. If they fail to do so, I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> that the one exception is dealt with in the next succeeding standing order, Standing Order 190. </para>
                    <para>How is there room for intervention if one accepts the ordinary sense of the plain English of Standing Order 189? How is there room, as the Leader of the Government has suggested, for the intervention of a motion by a Minister. Let me read the standing order again - </para>

Ministers behave like this and seek to deny to the Leader of the Opposition an opportunity to put his argument, it is a fair indication that democracy is on the way out. It surprises me very little that they are prepared to trample on sick men, taking advantage of their sickness. I shall return to my argument, but while I am dealing with the question of sick men I shall reply to a question asked of me by the Leader of the Government. He asked who was responsible for the sick men being here. In the first place, they came on their own responsibility. In the second place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold,</inline> the most sick of all, is here on my responsibility as well, based on medical advice as to the risk he took. I think every honorable senator has full knowledge of the ordeal that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> has recently gone through. I do not think anybody is under any illusions as to the seriousness of it. </para>

He has a right to vote on the first reading, the second reading and the third reading. Nobody can deny him that right, except the Government. He has got to stay here while the Government plays tricks with the notice-paper, while it retains this message under a practice that has been wrongly adopted in this place down the years. The matter is in the hands of the Government. We have to keep here day and night a man who should be in hospital. The Leader of the Government has a motion on the notice-paper which, if carried, could keep us here right through the night, but we hope to have the numbers to beat any move by him in relation to that matter. </para>

                    <para>The Government, in short, has declared war without rules on the Opposition. It complains that the Opposition will oppose the first reading of the bill. How can wc meet brutality and lack of consideration other than by the methods at our disposal? I assure the Government that this policy of toughness and lack of consideration for sick people will be met by the Opposition with every weapon it can use. All that the Opposition has are the numbers for the time being. Any trouble that exists could be cured if the Minister would hand the bill to the  President  and allow the processes of the Senate to proceed in relation to it. </para>

                            <para>-  The honorable senator is going back to  1941.  We are living in a modern age. Every member of the Opposition feels, as does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> - and he is not a member of our party - completely outraged by the fact that these men are being kept here. The Government, and only the Government, can release them. Let us get on with the banking legislation now, so that I can release them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> can then go back to hospital and our sick people can relax. They can go away free from the fear of not knowing when the Government will spring a surprise. It has reserved the right to employ any trick that it wishes. For the reasons that I have given, and because of the completely and brutally unfair Government treatment of members of the Opposition, I say that any member of this Senate who has in him any element of human compassion will vote for the motion. </para>

                        <para>. -  I do not want to repeat at length the arguments already put to the Senate. I would point out again that Standing Order  189  deals entirely with the way in which this Senate treats public bills, whether initiated in the Senate or received on message from the House of Representatives. To make the matter quite clear, I shall quote it again. It reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">Naturally, that means immediately it has been received by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President.</inline> If one looks further on, to Chapter XXV., " Communication between the Two Houses ", one reads in Standing Order  337- </para>

                    <para class="block">The mere fact that a message comes to this House, and is received by the ClerkAssistant, does not necessarily mean that the matter is before the Senate. There is a clear distinction between a message being received by the Clerk-Assistant, and its being received by the  President.  Ever since federation it has been customary for the  President  to receive the message after the  Clerk  puts it into his hands - not when it is received by the  Clerk  at the Bar of the House. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggests that as soon as the message is received it should be handed over to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, and</inline> dealt with. Such a message would refer to a bill giving effect to Government policy, yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> suggests that - without the Minister in charge knowing anything about it - it should be handed to the  President  and dealt with. </para>
                    <para>The  President  might be entirely opposed to the Government. That has happened. We have had presidents who have not been members of the Government party. On one memorable occasion it came about through pairs not being given to a government formed by the parties on this side at a time when we had nineteen members and the Opposition seventeen. One of our senators was fighting with Australian troops overseas, and another senator had on that very day been called away to hospital. We lost our majority and the Labour minority, not having given pairs, was able to obtain for its members the positions of  President  and  Chairman  of Committees. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                        would suggest that in such a case the  President  should receive any message that comes from the House of Representatives and should immediately move on behalf of the Government, that the bill be read a first time. Do honorable senators opposite suggest that that could really happen? It is so fantastic that it does not deserve consideration. Obviously, Standing Order  189  means that after the message has been received the Minister in charge of the bill will move that it be read a first time. That is the question referred to in the standing order. The question before the House is that the bill be read a first time, and that question is put by the  President,  without debate or amendment. It is as plain and as simple as that. If the arguments put forward by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline>
                        were sustained it would make a complete farce of the proceedings of the Senate.
                    </para>
                    <para>As I mentioned earlier, no one is more concerned than is this Government about the ill health of our colleagues in the Senate, but I do emphasize that the callous responsibility for their attendance here must be entirely accepted by the ruthless machine which runs the Australian Labour party. If a basic and vital principle were involved and the Government, because of its numbers, were endeavouring to ignore public opinion, 1 could understand that any Opposition with a sense of responsibility, and a consciousness of its obligation to fight and preserve those principles, would regard no sacrifice as being too great. However, 1 repeat, this Government has been returned to office ever since 1949. We have fought and won every election since then. The banking policy of this Government was well known long before the 1955 election, when the party led by the present Prime Minister was returned by a majority never previously enjoyed by any Australian government. </para>

                            <para>- The Government has a responsibility to carry out the wishes of the electorate. I am merely pointing out that our policy has been endorsed by an overwhelming majority of the electorate. In the House of Representatives the Government enjoys, by virtue of the election in December, 1955, less than two years ago, a majority of 27. In the Senate, which represents the whole of the Commonwealth, the Government at that election won seventeen of the 30 seats, and Opposition members only thirteen. Yet this brutal machine, at the risk of the health, the comfort, and the convenience of these sick senators, is exercising the ruthless domination it has over its members and is prepared, regardless of human pain and suffering to thwart the will of the people as expressed at the last general election, not in order to uphold a principle, but in order to destroy the essence of democracy. </para>

                    <para>The morbid sentiment was expressed by the Leader of the Opposition that the Opposition was not responsible for this position. I have challenged him time and time again to say whether the Opposition is prepared to debate he bill when it is introduced. Not one member of the Opposition has indicated that he is prepared to debate it. I ask Opposition senators now: Are you prepared to debate the bill, or are you determined to deny to supporters of the Government an opportunity to debate it by " killing " the motion for the first reading? Government senators would be only too pleased to have the opportunity to debate the bill and to extend to Opposition senators an opportunity to debate it. We have every reason to believe that the Opposition is not prepared to debate the measure; and is not prepared to give Government senators an opportunity to debate it. For the purpose of destroying this very important measure, the Opposition is prepared to subject its sick and suffering members to discomfort and expose them to danger. </para>
                    <para>The measure was received from the House of Representatives less than twelve hours ago. There is nothing untoward about that. During the time that I, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> have been in this Senate, measures have lain on the table for considerably longer periods than that until measures already on the notice paper had been dealt with. </para>

                            <para>- Thank you very much for reminding me of that aspect of the matter. This measure was declared urgent in another place only after the Opposition had shown deliberately and clearly that it had no intention of seriously debating it. The Opposition in another place turned that chamber into a bear garden by calling for twenty divisions within a short space of time, despite the fact that it had previously given a solemn undertaking that the debate would be conducted in an orderly manner. A complete sense of irresponsibility seemed to invade the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>.- I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> has seen fit to drag into this debate the question of sick men being brought here by our party when it is known that they have been compelled to be here by the ruthlessness of the Government parties. I shall direct my remarks to Standing Order 189. From <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Sullivan's</inline> remarks, I gained the impression that he was stating the case for the Senate being merely a chamber representative of the government of the day. Irrespective of the relationships that have existed between governments and the Senate, in the past, it is obvious that those who drafted the Constitution did not intend the Senate to be merely an appendage of the government of the day. </para>

                    <para>Admittedly, times have changed. Nevertheless we must interpret the Standing Orders correctly. It is not a matter of whether one side or the other can take advantage of the Standing Orders. This Senate is not merely a tool of the Government. In the minds of those who framed the Constitution, the Senate was representative of the whole of the people, not of only one section. The Government is representative of only a section of the Australian people - certainly the majority of the people - but this Senate is representative of the whole of the people, not of the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> has scornfully stated that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> is stupid and cannot believe in the proposition that he has advanced.

                            <para>-  That has nothing to do with the matter. It was a childish, stupid interjection. As I have repeatedly stated in this chamber, it is very stupid to continually play the game of Codlin and Short, certain honorable senators relating what they did in their time and saying, " We did better than you " like a lot of young kids. I am submitting that originally the Senate was intended to be a House of the people. Therefore, it was provided that bills sent forward from the other place should go directly into the hands of the  President  and that he would be obliged to place them before the chamber without any discussion whatever. </para>

I am trying to bring the Senate back to what it was originally meant to be, but when I try to lift the Senate on to a high plane, as being representative of the whole of the people, these people who are causing the degeneration laugh, butt in and try to put me off my point. If honorable senators opposite want the Senate to be the house of the people, they must alter their tactics and cease to be merely the representatives, mouthpieces and " ditto " marks of the other chamber. </para>

                        <para>. - I want to make one brief point, because I think it negatives the argument put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown.</inline> If the Constitution had intended that the bill should come to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> and not to the Ministers, why did the Constitution specifically make provision for Ministers in the Senate? There have always been Ministers in the Senate. Many bills begin here. On one occasion, the head of the Government for the time being actually sat in the Senate. I therefore think that the view advanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> is completely contrary to what was intended by either the Constitution or the Standing Orders. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not hope to be able to contribute anything new or fresh to the debate, but I should like to make a brief contribution to it. First, I congratulate the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> on behalf of his colleagues on this side of the chamber, on the way he has put the Government's views before the Senate and before the Parliament. This is a set of circumstances in respect of which, I say with respect, we have to acquire perspective. We have to stand off a bit, look at the matter, and see what is involved and what is proposed. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Let me make the point that the policy that the Government is adopting is no different from that which it has adopted every day on which the Senate has sat since the last election. There have been no arrangements about pairs between the Government and the Opposition since the election in 1955. The only variation of that policy has been made when a senator from each side of the chamber has gone overseas on a parliamentary delegation, and been granted leave of absence by each party. We are doing exactly what we have done since 1955, when the result of the election in that year made it apparent that to follow that policy was the only practicable way of conducting the business of the Senate, as the electorate returned the two political parties with even numbers to the Senate. In those circumstances it became the responsibility of the political parties to maintain their strength on the floor of the Senate. </para>
                    <para>That is the first point I make. I think it is the only original contribution that I can make; it is original to the extent that it has not been previously stated. From this point I repeat and adopt what has been said previously from this side of the chamber. To me, trying to keep the matter in perspective, the Opposition's claim seems a derogation of parliamentary status and procedure, contrary to any system of equity and fair play against the background of what the Senate was intended to be. It is entirely wrong of the Labour party to attempt to reject this legislation. The legislation is of the greatest national importance. It is presented in circumstances in which the Government had sweeping victories at the polls. Everybody knows that banking reform is a basic objective of the Government parties. What is the approach of the Opposition in the Senate to the legislation? Is it the Opposition's objective to consider, discuss, and amend the bill in this or that way? The Labour party, in the Senate and out of the Senate, has said that it has only one approach to the legislation, and that is to throw it out as quickly as it can. By all parliamentary standards and by every reasonable approach that can be made to the matter, the Opposition has no right at all to view the legislation in that way. </para>
                    <para>If the Opposition said, " Our desire is to look at this legislation, and to improve it, amend it, or change it in some way ", that would be reasonable. If the Opposition said that it wanted due and proper time to consider the bill, that would be reasonable. But the Leader of the Opposition in another place has said, " I want everybody who supports me politically and who can vote to be in his place in the Senate for the one purpose of throwing out this bill ". In the debate in the House of Representatives last night it was said quite openly, " Let that bill be produced on the table of the Senate and it will not get past the first reading ". In such circumstances, the Government is entitled to take advantage of parliamentary procedures and to adopt what it thinks to be the correct course to place a great measure on the statute-book. Because of the spirit in which honorable senators opposite approach this matter, I only say, man to man, that they have to take every ounce of responsibility for bringing into this chamber in these circumstances those of  their colleagues who are in ill health. The meanest and  most despicable  thing that has been  done since I  have  been in the Senate  is  the  attempt  to  put  on the Government  the  responsibility for doing that.  The  Opposition  is  bringing men here to do things that are opposed to every good parliamentary instinct, to reject legislation of major consequence brought forward by a government with one of the greatest majorities ever gained at the polls. These things are being proposed by a political party which has been discredited to an extent that no political party was ever previously discredited in Australia's political history. They are being proposed by a party that is carrying out the behests of a political leader who is prepared to sacrifice the health of his own political supporters for his own selfish, personal advantage. </para>
                    <para>Do not let us mince matters over this question. Of course, we are going to take advantage of parliamentary procedure and to adopt it in the way in which we think best! The responsibility relating to the colleagues of honorable senators opposite rests with them. The only personal feeling I have about it is that we on this side must make quite certain that honorable senators opposite shall take the blame for the lousy action they are taking. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I withdraw that remark. </para>

                    <para>This is a clear-cut issue. Each side of the Senate intends to use, to the utmost of its skill, the parliamentary procedures. Each one intends to do the best it can. We know that. Let us do away with cant and hypocrisy. Let us stick to the facts of life. The Government will adopt what it thinks is the best way of getting this legislation through, because it believes the Opposition has no right whatever to reject the bill, and because of the mandate that the Government has. The Opposition intends to do everything it can to frustrate and upset the Government. This is simply a question of straight parliamentary tactics. That being so, let us do what we will, but at the same time let us cut out the crocodile tears about the sick, the halt and the lame on the Opposition side of the Senate. </para>

                        <para>. - We have just listened to a remarkable outburst from the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner).</inline> I point out to him that whatever may be the health of an honorable senator on this side to-day, an honorable senator on the Government side may be in that unfortunate position to-morrow. Surely we should be sensible enough to realize that we are not, in our own right, the ones who may dictate what shall be the health of anyone or who shall be fit enough to attend to the business of the electors who alone have the right to send us here. I believe it has been a parliamentary practice over the years to grant pairs, especially when it is known that illness prevents honorable senators from attending here. </para>

                            <para>-  I agree with the honorable senator. I believe that a pair should have been given, that the long established parliamentary practice should have been followed in this instance. It does not make the position right simply because it would appear that in 1941 someone did not adhere to what I would have adhered to if I had the power. I say that as one who has held some responsibility in other places. Little did I dream that men could be so callous as honorable senators on the Government side. Little did I dream that honorable senators on the Government side, who, in season and out of season, have quite rightly criticized what people in other parts of the world have done, would now be refusing to live up to what they claim to be their beliefs. </para>

I have not been here very long, but I have listened to him replying on behalf of the Government, and I have often felt pleased that I did not have to back him. Of course, we shall defeat this bill, and we shall do so because, at the last election, the Government did not get a mandate in connexion with this legislation. The world knows that this is the price of money at election times. The world knows that the bankers came up here, and it knows also that the leading members of the present Government have stated, within the precincts of Parliament House, that they would be pleased to see the legislation defeated. That is the reason why the Government is subjecting one person in particular to callous treatment. Why, someone on the Government side was so worried over the health of this person that he took the trouble to ring that person's home. Knowing that honorable senator's position, the Government still refuses to grant a pair. </para>

                    <para class="block">I believe that this is one measure that we can amend -  the Question "That this Bill be now read a First time " shall be put by the  President  immediately after the same has been received, and shall be determined without Amendment or Debate. </para>
                    <para>So I say that if we have transgressed in the past, and if we have acquiesced in that transgression without bringing it to the notice of the Senate, there is no reason why we should not observe strictly Standing Order 189 when attention has been directed to it. I do not believe that that standing order has been put into operation once in the short time that I have been in the Senate. However, that is not to say that the standing order should not be observed when attention is directed to it. If the standing order is outmoded or interferes with the working of the Senate, it should be abolished or its abolition should be recommended to the Standing Orders Committee. At least, we should be given Standing Orders that are up to date and will permit the Senate to function in the. best interests of the people. </para>
                    <para>I thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> for reminding the Senate that this debate has been rather wide. I regret the whole situation. lt is true, as the Leader of the Opposition has said, that the Australian Labour party asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> first, and then his medical advisers, to attend the House if it was at all possible. I do not think that there is anything wrong with that. We did that because we could not obtain a pair for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold.</inline> If we had had a pair for him, he would not have had to come to Canberra. If we could have got one yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arnold</inline> would have gone back to Newcastle the same way as he came here and as quickly as possible. He would go back to-night if we could obtain a pair now. </para>
                    <para>I am not happy with the situation and I do not think anybody else could be happy about it. After this experience, I only hope that we shall not have any further references to the treatment of the nationals of other countries by their governments in terms that I have heard here before, some of which I have used myself. In particular, I am thinking of Hungary and other countries. I do not think that the Government's methods of attempting to get legislation through the Parliament, or the methods that the Government has forced the Opposition to adopt, are helpful to the cause of democracy. We do not want the bill. We do not want an alteration in the Commonwealth Bank or its facilities. </para>

                            <para>- I hope I am not being unfair when I say that the honorable senator has implied that more discussion will lead to an alteration in the bill. It will not. The Senate cannot improve the bill from the Opposition's point of view by talking about it. We know the position in this chamber. There are  28  honorable senators on each side. Just as we cannot amend the bill, neither can the Government pass it. I only regret that, knowing that situation as we all do, great discomfort is being caused to a certain honorable senator. I again point out that on this occasion an Opposition senator is affected and, without pointing the bone at any one, that in the not distant future perhaps an honorable senator opposite will be affected. </para>

                        <para>.- In regard to the motion that has been moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna,</inline> which, I understand, urges you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to adhere to the Standing Orders, I wish to advance the proposition, for reasons which I shall enumerate later, that you are in fact adhering strictly and literally to the Standing Orders as they are set out in the book that is before us. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Before I enumerate those reasons, I wish to refer to some of the statements that have been made by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber during this debate. One of the first matters with which I want to disagree is a statement, or at least an implication in a statement, made by the </para>
                    <para class="block">Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner).</inline> I refer to the statement or the implication that the Opposition has no right to object to and to attempt to defeat the bill that is in question. I believe that the Opposition not only has the right to object to and to attempt to defeat the bill but also that it has a duty to this chamber and to the people who sent its members here to object to it and to try to defeat it. I have no hesitation at all in saying that, if the unhappy time ever comes, when I am in opposition I will demand the right and accept the duty which I now quite happily concede to honorable members opposite. </para>
                    <para>Having said that, let me say that the Opposition has no right to expect the Government to help it in its duty to frustrate and defeat the measure. What has emerged from this debate is the fact that the Opposition expects the Government to help it to carry out its task. We have heard impassioned statements that pairs should have been granted to the Opposition to enable it to achieve this end. </para>

                            <para>-  Order! The granting of pairs is not recognized by the Senate. Therefore, the honorable senator is not entitled to discuss the matter. The subject was introduced during the afternoon, but I refrained from directing attention to the fact because I thought reference to the matter might be of value to the general debate. However, my attention was directed to the fact that pairs were not recognized. Accordingly, the honorable senator must refrain from discussing the matter. </para>

                    <para>I refer, first, to the fact that certain members of the Opposition are sick. I direct the attention of the Senate to what I think the Opposition is submitting to us. Honorable senators opposite are saying, in effect, " Every time an Opposition member is ill and cannot stand up to the rigours of propel debate on a bill, you ought to help us to stifle debate on that measure by helping us to defeat it at the first-reading stage ". ] think it is fair to say that that is the proposition that is being put to us. I do not believe that any responsibility rests upon the Government to accede to a request of that kind, particularly when, if we did so, we would be helping honorable senators opposite in a way that would reflect upon the usefulness and the proper function of the Senate. </para>
                    <para>As I disagreed heartily with the remark of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner,</inline> so now do I disagree with the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> that dis.cusion in this place can do no good and cannot produce any worthwhile result. To make that suggestion is to run completely counter to the responsibility of this chamber as a whole and of both Government and Opposition senators who, in a matter of this importance, are duty-bound to speak in this public forum as representatives of their electorates and disseminate their various viewpoints. It has been stated, by way of interjection, that the bill in question was gagged through another place. Even if that is true, surely it cannot be used as an excuse for gagging the bill through this place without one word of debate. The propositions propounded by the Opposition are that the measure should be put through without any debate whatever, and that the Government should help the Opposition to achieve that end. I reject both propositions. </para>

                            <para>- He said " forthwith " or " immediately ". But the honorable senator can put that proposition to you only if he construes two words in Standing Order 189 in the way in which he wants to construe them - that is, if he construes the words " the same " to mean the message or the bill. If we look at other standing orders, it is quite clear that that construction cannot be upheld for one moment. Standing Order 137 says that the measure cannot be dealt with unless leave is given. It is quite obvious that we could not have one standing order saying something and another standing order saying quite the reverse in relation to the same matter. Consequently, it is clear, as I have stated, that the construction that has been placed on the words " the same " cannot be upheld and that Standing Order 189 means only that the question shall be put by you, when moved by a Minister in accordance with the orders of the Senate. </para>

The interpretation placed upon the Standing Orders by the Leader of the Opposition is that when a message is received from the House of Representatives both the message and the bill to which it refers must be dealt with immediately by you. The acceptance of that interpretation, which admittedly runs contrary to the practice of the Senate over the last decade, is sought so that the Reserve Bank Bill can be introduced into this chamber and disposed of immediately without debate. </para>

Standing Order 373 states that the  President  shall immediately read the message to the Senate. That is the position in regard to messages from the Governor-General.

The debate was initiated in an endeavour to force the Minister to move that the bill be read a first time. Therefore, I suggest that the bill is relevant to the discussion.

                            <para>- Perhaps I have not made myself clear. There is an interpolation in Standing Order 185 which says, " unless received from the House of Representatives ". I dealt with that situation by referring to Standing Order 231, which states that when bills are received from the House of Representatives they shall be dealt with in the same way as similar bills presented in pursuance of orders of the Senate. That clearly indicates, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> that after you have read the message requesting the concurrence of this House in a bill passed by the House of Representatives there is needed, before the bill itself is introduced, a motion. That motion is the basis of the question which you shall put. </para>

                    <para>Great play has been made by the Leader of the Opposition on the wording of Standing Order 189. Quite clearly, considering the whole context of the standing orders, Standing Order 189 is intended to indicate that when a motion of that kind has been put, you shall immediately put the question and there shall be no debate on that motion. An exception is made of bills which the Senate is not allowed to amend, but we are not discussing a bill of that kind to-day. No motion has been moved. Consequently you have, 1 suggest, adhered completely to the standing orders in this matter. </para>
                    <para>It has been suggested that you should not have done so. It has been said that because the Opposition is handicapped - and it is handicapped by having some sick members - either you or the Government should have made concessions and allowed the Opposition an opportunity to reject the bill without any debate at all. I reject that proposition as an unwarranted request for assistance by the Government to the Opposition and as an interference with the proper processes of the Senate. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I merely wish to say that in 1955 a message was received from the Leader of the Opposition clearly and unequivocally stating that from that time, in all circumstances, by the wish of the Opposition, pairs were off. Therefore, the Government is merely following a precedent established by the Opposition. </para>

                        <para>.- 1 have listened with a good deal of interest to the arguments put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton.</inline> He quoted certain standing orders, but I am afraid that one seemed to cancel out the other. If his contention is correct, there are no standing orders at all. Standing Order 189 was designed to meet a situation such as now confronts us. I think I am safe in saying that during the 57 years for which a federal bicameral system of government has obtained, no other government has attempted to prevent the business of the country from being discussed by the upper chamber. It is true that honorable senators have quoted precedents for the Government's action, but they will not deny that over the years governments have never hesitated to place business before this chamber. This is ostensibly a house of review. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> this afternoon attempted to make great play on the fact that, since the last election, the Government has had an overwhelming majority in another place and that this majority obtained while it was discussing the legislation with which we are concerned to-night. This Senate was brought into existence by the framers of the Constitution- </para>

                            <para>- To the discomfort of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan,</inline> I shall return to it very quickly. The Senate is a chamber of review which is governed by Standing Orders. As I understand the matter, those Standing Orders were either borrowed or taken over from the State Parliament of South Australia. The first  President  of this Senate was a South Australian, and the Standing Orders of the Parliament of that State were adopted here virtually in globo. Possibly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> did not know it, or he would not have risen a moment or two ago. The fact that the Standing Orders have been taken over from the Parliament of South Australia proves conclusively that they prevent the very thing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spooner</inline> were boasting of this afternoon. There would not have been federation if the States had not been protected from a majority of members in another place, who might introduce laws which were detrimental to them. What is the measure before us - or rather, the measure that we would like to have before us? Why is this motion now before us? It has been introduced because we wish to ask the Senate to request you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to proceed with a certain measure, which has now been presented to the  Clerk  of this chamber. This legislation is of vast importance. It is so important that the Government in another place decided that it was urgent and should not be fully discussed. The Government decided that the Standing Orders should be suspended, and the rights and privileges of honorable members curtailed, so that the measure might be sent forward to this chamber as early as possible. </para>

                    <para>This important legislation deals with trade and commerce and the whole financial fabric of the Commonwealth. It deals with the banking policy of this country. Could anything be more important, or demand speedier or more effective treatment? This legislation affects every State of the Commonwealth, and the whole economy of Australia. Despite all this, the Government, having passed legislation in another place, will not bring it before this chamber! Its reasons for failing to do so have been whispered about, and we have heard that this or that was going to happen, but certainly the Government is not anxious to introduce the legislation in the Senate. The draftsmen of the Standing Orders for this chamber foresaw the day when a government would refuse to bring to it legislation with which it should deal. These Standing Orders were brought into existence before party government, as we know it to-day, existed. They were designed so that legislation should be dealt with effectively. Honorable senators represent the various States. Theoretically, at any rate, they know no party. </para>

This legislation is important and should be dealt with in this chamber. Over the years governments, being in charge of the business of the Senate, were honest with themselves and with the people and were prepared, when messages were brought here, to submit the relevant measure to the Senate. That procedure has operated very smoothly. We do not blame you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> for what has happened here to-day, but since you have occupied the chair you will have noticed that day after day, and night after night, when messages have been brought to this chamber, honorable senators speaking have been told to ask for leave to continue their remarks at some other stage so that a certain measure may be introduced. Invariably the honorable senator, following the Standing Orders, has asked for leave to continue his remarks later. </para>

                    <para>You, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, President,</inline> would read the message that had just been received and, because the government of the day wanted to proceed with the particular measure, the Minister in charge would rise in his place. You, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, would</inline> see him, and would allow him to move that the Standing Orders be suspended to enable the bill to pass through all stages without delay and to move that the bill be read a first time. The bill would be read and the debate would be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting. The  Clerk  would then immediately call on the business that had been suspended, and off we would go again. That has been the practice in this chamber for many years. </para>
                    <para>To-day, we are up against a different position. This emergency legislation - so-called - that was guillotined through another place has not been brought before us. Indeed, I understand that a pile of messages from the House of Representatives concerning the banking legislation is now accumulating. Although the Government would not grant sufficient time for the legislation to be considered in another place, all of a sudden, the emergency has disappeared. The  President  has not read to us the message that has been received from the other place; he has been prevented by the Government from complying with the Standing Orders. </para>
                    <para>Does this indicate that, at the first sign of danger, the Government intends to drop the bill? Does it mean that, after all, the legislation is not so important as the Government has claimed, and that it was introduced into the other place because the Government was coerced by the financial institutions which provided the money - the sinews of war - needed by the Government parties to defeat Labour at the 1949 general election, after the Labour government had performed so much good work for Australia? Was this legislation introduced into another place merely as a payoff for those institutions, and now the Government does not want to bring it before this chamber? Or is the explanation of the present situation to be found in the fact that certain honorable senators of the Opposition had, unfortunately, and through no fault of their own, become ill, and that the Government, which had intended to get this legislation through by stealth during the absence of those senators, the elected representatives of the States, had suddenly to revise its plans? Has the Government been instructed by those whom it serves that, come what may, it must ensure the passage of this legislation? Is that the position today? Of course it is! Either the Government introduced this legislation in another place at the behest of the financial interests, as a pay-off to them, in the hope that the measures would be passed by this chamber because the voting strength of the Opposition was temporarily depleted due to illness, or the Government was insincere when it forced the passage of the legislation by the other place. </para>
                    <para>Suggestions have been made that some senior ministers and certain supporters of the Government are against the legislation and that they had to be dragooned into voting for it. Although supporters of the Government chide honorable senators on this side for obeying caucus decisions, certain members of the Government parties in another place were whipped into submission by the powers-that-be and compelled to support the passage of the legislation. </para>
                    <para>From your previous remarks, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> in relation to pairs, I know that I would be called to order if I attempted to deal with that subject fully. However, as it was discussed in this chamber earlier, I should just like to say, in passing, that I have been a member of the Senate since 1938. During that period I do not know of an instance in which Labour has refused a pair to an honorable senator on the other side. </para>

Due to the operation of the secret ballot system, on occasions members of the minority party have been appointed to certain offices. As far as I know, at all of these elections since I have been a member of the Senate, an arrangement has operated whereby, if an honorable senator of one side is absent, an honorable senator of the other side shall also be absent during those proceedings. </para>

But, of course, the Labour party, with which I have been associated for many years, is a human party that endeavours to improve the lot of humanity. I should .be very sorry indeed -if ever the Labour party resorted .to the tactics that have been used by the Government parties during the last few weeks. If that happened, I would be ashamed to be a 'member of the Labour party. </para>
                    <para>We have heard a lot of talk about the Government wanting to debate the measure. Why, if it were introduced it could be passed, or defeated, within ten minutes.

What ^attention has the Government paid to the suggestions that were made in an effort to improve the bill? Has the Government paid attention even to the arguments that were advanced by its own followers? When some of the Government's own followers sought certain alterations, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said that their suggestions would be considered.

                    <para>The motion that has been submitted, if implemented, would have the effect of forcing you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to carry out the Standing Orders of the Senate. A message has been received by the Clerk-Assistant, who is your agent, and doubtless he has brought it to your attention. I hope, therefore, that you will rise, as you have done on numerous occasions, and announce that message number so and so has been received from the House of Representatives, transmitting a certain bill, in which it seeks .the concurrence of the Senate. The onus would then be on the Government immediately to bring the measure before this chamber. As it appears that no Minister in this chamber is prepared to bring forward the measure, we respectfully ask you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to carry out a standing order that has been in existence for many years, designed to prevent power-drunk governments from endeavouring to prevent this chamber from dealing with legislation, be it good or bad. According to our Constitution, which was framed by the founders of the federation, this chamber has the final right to say "Aye" or "Nay" to this legislation. If this Government has the interests of the people at heart, it should see to it that this house of review, which will say whether the legislation is good or bad, is given an opportunity to adjudicate upon :the matter immediately. I support the motion. </para>

                        says that when a measure comes to us from the other House, it should be immediately brought in and that the  Clerk  of the Senate should present it to the  President,  who should report that a message had been received and move that the bill be read a first time. On occasions we get 20 bills in a day, sometimes 30. Government business has to be debated in the Senate. Are debates on important bills to be interrupted continually by our following this absurd interpretation? It is complete nonsense to say that that should be done. Nobody knows better than the members of the Opposition what utter nonsense they talk when they support this interpretation. Not for one minute would they act on it themselves. If they were put in office to-morrow, do you think that they would abide by this absurd interpretation? They would do what they did years ago. They talk about Chairmen and Presidents giving interpretations. Bless my heart, I sat in the Senate and heard a Labour  President  say that he was not going to be ruled by the dead hand of the past!

                            <para>- Wait a minute; do not get on your bike. I will tell the truth. In 1941 we had a senator on active service, fighting overseas. A Labour government - a government formed by this great, humane party that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> spoke about - had given him an undertaking that he had a pair. </para>

                            <para>- I made only a passing reference to it. I will not refer to it again, except to say that he had been promised the advantage of a certain parliamentary practice - we will put it that way. When a vote came, what happened? The promise that was given to him was broken by honorable senators opposite, and it was the breaking of that promise that put that Labour senator I am talking about into the President's chair. How short their memories are! 1 want to remind the Opposition of something else. I was tickled pink to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> say that the Senate was an independent house of review, and that Labour senators could vote as they liked. We sat here when the Communist Party Dissolution Bill was under discussion and we heard honorable senators opposite speak against the bill and say what they were and were not going to do. Then twelve men outside, the federal executive of the Australian Labour party, told them what they were to do, and they came in and voted for it like lambs. </para>

They want to get a certain bill into this chamber. It is the Government's duty, privilege and responsibility to bring whatever measures it thinks fit before the Senate. There are quite a number here now. But the members of the Opposition want a certain bill to be introduced. They have brought all their sick colleagues here. For that, they must accept the responsibility. Do not try to tell us that it is the responsibility of anybody but yourselves. You have brought them here because you want the numbers. </para>

                            <para>- They want the numbers here. What for? So they can chuck this bill out on the first reading and deny the Senate the right to debate it. They talk about parliamentary practices, but they are prepared to throw this bill out before they have heard what this side has to say. They would chuck it out without any debate whatever. That is what they want to do. I would be ashamed to belong to a party which engaged in tactics such as these, which tried to throw out a bill on the first reading. That is what they want to do, and because we are not going to help them, they are getting a bit upset. Of course we will not help them. We will take advantage of every proper parliamentary practice to see that they do not deny to the people an opportunity to hear what they have to say against this bill, and what we have to say for it. The people should be able to hear the debate over the air and read it in the press, so that they can judge for themselves. But the members of the Opposition do not want that. They want to deny to the people the right to hear anything. They want to throw the bill out the minute it comes into the chamber, but, as far as I am concerned, they are not going to get a chance to do so. If proper practices of this Parliament allow us, we will ensure that they do not do that. I can quite understand honorable senators opposite getting a little annoyed about this. They have such magnificent advisers. I read in the press a statement by the Leader of the Australian Labour party, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Evatt.</inline> In it, he says - </para>

                        <para>. - Prior to the adjournment of this debate, I had been dealing for about ten minutes with some of the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong,</inline> who referred to the disadvantage that the sales tax measures would bring to the Australian people. I remind the Senate, as I did last night, of the most imaginative step that has been taken by the Government in seeking to have new exemptions included in our sales tax legislation. Some of the most important exemptions relate to products that are used for packaging. I refer particularly to the proposed exemption of iron or steel wire of gauge 19 or lighter, which is a smallgauge wire. It should be remembered that iron or steel wire of gauges 6 to 1 8 is already exempt. I refer also to the proposed exemption of steel strapping of a kind that is used to secure goods for marketing or delivery, and seals for use with that strapping. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>A very important exemption is that of the comparatively new chemical hexadecanol and other preparations or materials that are put up for sale for use in the reduction of evaporation of water in reservoirs, dams, channels or streams, and equipment and parts therefor for use in the application of these preparations or materials. It should be remembered that in recent months the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization has perfected what is known as the Mansfield appliance for the prevention of evaporation, particularly in our far northern areas. That spectacular phase of development is to be assisted by the exemption to which I have just referred. I cannot understand the sneers of the Australian Labour party in regard to this measure, because it makes provision for, amongst other exemptions, this most imaginative exemption, which is of great national importance. </para>
                    <para>A very interesting exemption is the £50 per annum exemption that is to apply to the small manufacturer. The memorandum that has been supplied by the Treasurer points out that goods manufactured by a person who satisfies the Commissioner of Taxation that the amount of sales tax which, but for this provision, would be payable by him is not or would not be in excess of £50 per annum is to have complete exemption. Under a similar provision previously in operation, exemption was allowable if the tax payable did not exceed £5 per annum. </para>
                    <para>I have dealt with the exemptions. I now wish to refer the Senate to some quite important reductions of rates of sales tax. I refer, first, to the group of goods to which a reduction from 25 per cent, to <inline font-style="italic">12i</inline> per cent, will apply. Honorable senators will remember that kit bags not exceeding 18 inches in length and attach6 cases, which are more or less school bags and cases, have always been taxed at the low rate of <inline font-style="italic">I2i</inline> per cent., but that larger bags such as travelling bags, brief bags, and gladstone bags have been taxed at 25 per cent. Those larger bags are now to be taxed at the rate of 12£ per cent. Handbags, evening bags, purses, shopping bags, and such like, Will also be subject to this reduction. At this stage, I point out that in Adelaide there is an extensive trade in the manufacture of handbags. I assure the Senate that this reduction has been received remarkably well in Adelaide, where I believe the largest manufacturers of handbags in particular in Australia carry on their business. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> was inclined to sneer at the reduction of the rate of sales tax on furniture from 10 per cent, to 8i per cent. I assure the Senate that news of that reduction also was received very favorably. 1 should like to point out that the Sales Tax Branch is regarded by the Public Accounts Committee, which investigated its activities, in a very favourable light because of the economical way in which it collects quite a sizeable amount of Commonwealth revenue. I have examined the report of the Commissioner of Taxation, which indicates that sales tax collections are carried out efficiently, and that the amount of outstanding sales tax is really at a minimum. </para>
                    <para>I make one final plea to the Government in regard to this tax. I understand that a few years ago there were 04.V three rate? of sales tax - 10 per cent., 12i per cent, and 16$ per cent. That was a desirable state of affairs, because the merchant had to cope with only three sales tax markings. I submit that that is as it should be, because then the merchant, the manufacturer, and the trader, would not have to employ clerks and others to make the most intricate calculations that are now necessary. At the present time, goods that attract sales tax come within either the 8i per cent, tax group, the 10 per cent, group, the 12£ per cent, group, the 16J per cent, group, <inline font-style="italic">th.</inline> 25 per cent, category, or the 30 per cent, category. That adds considerably to the amount of work that is required of people who handle goods which attract sales tax. You will appreciate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President,</inline> just what that means in some stores, particularly in country areas, which carry thousands of lines that attract sales tax. 1 submit to the Government that, when it is again reviewing the sales tax legislation, it should do all that it can to reduce the number of groups of sales tax for the sake of streamlining procedures and reducing the work that is involved. </para>
                    <para>Having made those remarks and the comments that I offered last night, I commend the bill to the Senate and compliment the Government upon the imaginative step it has taken. I compliment it in particular for providing some relief to small manufacturers, and also to farmers and others in the drier areas of the Commonwealth by exempting from sales tax new inventions, equipment, and chemicals that are used for the prevention of evaporation from dams and such like. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught,</inline> in the last moment or so of his speech, lavished a tremendous amount of praise and congratulation on the Ministers and all concerned with the sales tax provisions, but I am afraid that 1 will not be following in his footsteps. To-night I am here to bury Caesar, not to praise him. I had hoped that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught</inline> who is a South Australian, would make some reference to the imposition of sales tax on foodstuffs with a dried fruit content. I should also have liked to hear him say something about the motor body building industry in South Australia. Its present condition has been brought about to some degree by the high rate of sales tax on motor cars, an impost which the Government is still continuing. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It seems that after the drama of the last four or five hours, the Senate is now almost like a tomb. The Press reporters have disappeared, and the captains and the kings have departed. But I think that there are matters associated with sales tax to which honorable senators should apply themselves. It is worth remembering that in the last full year of office of the Chifley Labour Government, in 1948-49, sales tax collections amounted to £39,000,000. In 1949- 50, during which the Labour Government and this Government had approximately equal periods of office, £42,000,000 was drawn off in sales tax. In 1950-51, the first full year of office of the Menzies-Fadden Government, the amount of sales tax collected rose to £58,000,000. In 1951-52 it jumped to £95,000,000. That is the history of sales tax. The amount collected was only £39,000,000 in the last full year before Labour went out of office, but even as early as 1952, after approximately three years of the Liberal and Country party administration, it had more than doubled. </para>
                    <para>Before considering the concessions to be given to the Australian public by this bill, let me say that the Opposition is not opposing the bill. Any bill which seeks to give even the slightest measure of relief to the unfortunate taxpayers must of necessity receive the support of the Labour party. I do want to point out the inadequacies of the bill. I desire to refer to the dried fruits industry, particularly in South Australia, and to raise a matter that has been very close to my mind ever since I have been a member of this chamber. Honorable senators on both sides will have no difficulty in recalling that year by year - in fact, on some occasions, more than once in a year - I have said that the dried fruits industry should be assisted by the removal of the 12i per cent, sales tax imposed on foodstuffs with a dried fruit content. It is idle for the Government to say that mine is the only voice that has been raised on this matter. </para>
                    <para>On occasions when we have not been debating a Budget or matters arising out of a Budget, some honorable senators opposite have been prepared to agree with me that the impost on foodstuffs with a dried fruit content is completely unfair and reacts in a detrimental manner against the advancement of a very valuable primary industry. But it is peculiar that the voices of those honorable senators are quiet when the Senate is debating a measure under which relief could be given to this vital industry. I have heard Senators Pearson and Laught agree with me. I have heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> say that everything I had said on this issue was completely true. However, when the matter comes up at their party meetings, they apparently do nothing about it. It would be difficult for us to believe that they have not some say in framing government policy. The only alternative would be to believe that Cabinet decides policy, without any reference to them. I wonder whether any of them, in their party room, when sales tax is being discussed prior to the preparation of the Budget, give a single thought to the dried fruits industry of Australia. I wonder whether the South Australian senators on the Government side consider the industry in their own State. </para>

We find, on one hand, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kendall,</inline> who is apparently prepared to have a go at anything, plucks a figure of £4,000,000 out of the air. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> immediately disagrees with him and says that only £20,000 would be involved, if I hear him aright. If that is an indication of the accuracy of assessments by senators on the Government side, all I can say is that it is a wonder the Government is able to bring a budget down at all. I am not prepared to say how much this concession would cost, but I am prepared to say that it would not cost more than £100,000. I am prepared to go further and say that the benefits which would flow to the dried fruits industry as a consequence of the removal of this impost would be worth many times that amount. Of course, the benefit that would be reaped by the Australian people would be great. </para>

                    <para>Again I challenge the South Australian senators in particular, and the Government in general, to demonstrate the sincerity of their concern for the dried fruits industry by displaying some interest in it. Up to date they have done nothing to indicate that they have any interest in it. I have before me a letter from the Australian Dried Fruits Association, dated 12th July, 1957, stating that the association had forwarded to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> a request that sales tax be removed from raisin bread and plum pudding, and that it had made the strongest representations to the Treasurer. Apparently its request was rejected. I hope to have an opportunity, when I travel through the fruit-growing areas of South Australia in the not far distant future, to tell members of the association how little the Government sympathizes with the request they have made that this impost be removed. It is a farcical situation that the ingredients of a raisin loaf, for instance, taken on their own, are not subject to sales tax, but when raisins are added to bread, the Treasurer, by some extraordinary mental process, decides that the product shall become subject to sales tax. It is an unnecessary and unfair impost, and should not be continued. Not one Government supporter will say that I am wrong on this issue. I heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laught's</inline> speech, and if he made any reference to this matter it could not have been more than a passing reference, and certainly was not an advocacy of the case of the dried-fruit growers. </para>
                    <para>I come now to another extremely important matter, especially for my own State. I refer to the continued imposition of 30 per cent, sales tax on motor cars used for private purposes. At present, Australia's motor body building industry is going through something of a minor recession. In South Australia 750 men have been put off in the last month, and there is no doubt in the minds of those who have closely  analysed the  matter that this  has  resulted from  the  continued existence  of  the 30  per cent,  sales tax. </para>

                            <para>- I  am not concerned  with  last month's figures. I have been associated with the motor body building industry all my life. There has been, over  the  last twelve months,  a  steady decline  in the  number of persons employed in the industry. If necessary, I can substantiate  that  statement. My authority for it is the secretary of the Vehicle Builders Union in  South  Australia, and union representatives  in  other States, as well as the employers themselves - in South Australia, in particular. I want to make a special plea for the firm of Chrysler-Dodge-De Soto. I am not  so  greatly concerned about General MotorsHoldens Limited, because it produces a  car that  has captured the imagination, temporarily at least, of the buying public. The firm of Chrysler-Dodge-De Soto is in a totally different position. It is producing what may be said to be a middle-class automobile, which is in a somewhat different class from the Holden. </para>

                            <para>-  The organization produces something that is considerably cheaper, but sales tax adds a great deal to  its  price. The three cars manufactured by Chrysler-Dodge-De Soto are, as the name implies, the Chrysler, the Dodge, and the  De  Soto. Most of the men whose employment has been affected by the set-back to  the  motor body building industry worked  for  Chrysler-Dodge-De Soto in South Australia. That statement can be verified quite easily. Indeed, if certain honorable senators took more interest in what was happening in that State they would probably have known it before. The firm makes no secret of the fact that, despite all the efforts it has made to produce cars that are 100  per  cent. Australian made, it has not had  the  slightest assistance from the Govern;ment. The percentage is already up to 87, and recently Chrysler-Dodge-De Soto built a factory at Tonsley Park for the purpose of increasing the Australian content still further. This concern has not only spent millions of pounds in building up a valuable secondary industry, but has done What for years we have said all manufacturers should do- it increased to an ever greater degree the Australian content of its product. Despite all this, the firm has been hit to leg. Its cheapest car costs £1,600 or £1,700, and a person who could pay that sum often cannot afford the sales tax which goes on top of it. </para>

                            <para>- That is not so, but the fact remains that the 30 per cent, sales tax has forced the middle-price car out of the market. People simply cannot purchase it. They are looking for something between perhaps the Holden and the Ford Zephyr. However, I am not concerned about the various makes of car, or about trying to establish the merit of one against that of another. Moreover, I do not wish to advance the cause of one company against another, but a firm that has spent millions in demonstrating its confidence in the future of South Australia is surely entitled to some consideration from this Government. I am concerned about the employment of South Australian workers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> well knows that the motor body building industry is vital to South Australia. Indeed, if it folded up to-morrow we should very quickly be in a serious position. The continuance for very much longer of the 30 per cent, sales tax would seriously undermine the motor body building industry of this country. The Government, when it tries to extract the last penny from companies which have been doing everything possible to assist Australian development, is not applying its announced policy. Indeed, it is doing the very opposite. </para>

                    <para>I do not intend to speak at length. I want to establish these two points: First, the Government has let the dried fruit growers of Australia down, and no Government supporter can advance a reasonable case for retaining the 12± per cent, sales tax on foodstuffs with a dried fruit content. Secondly, 1 have put up the strongest possible case for a review of the sales tax on motor cars, which is ' having such an impact on the industry in South Australia. I come now to my final point. We are not opposing this bill, but the concessions given under it amount to a paltry £3,000,000 or £4,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- To use the honorable senator's own words, it is chicken feed because this year the Government will gather a far greater amount than ever before. The Government has taken from the Australian people a great deal, and it has given them back half a handful. That is the whole position in regard to sales tax. 1 hope that, even at this late hour, the Government will consider the lot of the fruit-growers of this country, and also of the fast declining motor body building industry, which is so vital to the continuance of our secondary industry. </para>

                    <para>I could go on for a considerable time pointing out that although certain reductions have been made, and certain exemptions inserted, a degree of injustice remains so far as sales tax is concerned, and that it should be rectified as quickly as possible. 1 suppose that if I went through all of the items that are mentioned here I could weary the Senate for a very long time. I do not intend to do that. I rose mainly to emphasize those two points - that if the Government continues to treat the dried fruits industry as it is doing now, regardless of the fact that honorable senators from this side, and even Government supporters, have agreed with what I have already put, one day the allegiance of some of the dried fruit growers will be withdrawn. It will be well deserved and well merited because of the hopeless lack of consideration that the Government has given to the people who are engaged in this valuable primary industry. </para>

But Government senators from South Australia, instead of assisting in <inline font-style="italic">A</inline> practical way, have merely expressed words of approval. I suggest to them that if they want to help, not me, but the State that they represent in this chamber, they should enter the fight actively. As I have said, my main reason for rising in this debate was to bring into sharp relief the two matters that are affecting seriously the State that I represent in this Parliament. I hope that the representatives of South Australia who may follow me in this debate will support what I have said. </para>

                        <para>. - In rising to speak on the bill to amend the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935-1956, I must say that it is a pleasant change, an enjoyable privilege, for the Senate, as a house of review, to be able to debate a measure that is before it. Tt is evident that any thought of freedom to debate a measure was not present in the mind of the shattered and torn Labour party earlier this evening. The Opposition has not traduced the forms of this chamber in order to prevent a review of this legislation in accordance with our function under the Constitution, as a house of review. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>It is a change for a Tasmanian senator to be able to be upstanding in his place in this chamber and express his opinion on certain aspects of the legislation. Fancy being able to say truthfully that it is a change for an honorable senator, in this States' house, to be able to express a point of view on behalf of the State that he represents! The Labour party believes that the memory of the people is shortlived. I am convinced that the people of this country will remember what has occurred this evening, and that the Labour party will rue the day. It will likewise rue the day when its ranks were not filled - as they could have been - in order to press amendments to the -social services legislation, designed to increase pensions, that it introduced. The Opposition did not muster full strength to support those amendments, because it was hypocritically insincere, and the shattered segments of the Labour party, because of their action to-night in this chamber, will also rue that day. To-day will be known as " Black Wednesday " in the annals of the Australian Labour party - the day when the various little offshoots went like a wagging tail with the pig head that ruled it. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline>
                        who has now left the chamber, must have felt it a change to be able to debate legislation because throughout his speech he referred to aspects of sales tax of particular interest to South Australia. He realized that in relation to previous measures the " doctor in the house " had said, " Do not talk; do not put the South Australian point of view ", so he had a free leg on certain South Australian interests.
                    </para>
                    <para>It is quite a change for me to be able to refer to something that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> has said, because I like debating, but usually there is little in his remarks to which one can refer. In this instance, the honorable senator criticized the rate of sales tax on motor cars. At other times - probably during a Budget debate - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> and his cohorts will probably criticize the profits of the motor-manufacturing industry and say that the profts are too large, but because we tax it too heavily the industry is sacking people. The honorable senator adopts an unrealistic approach to the matter. Facts and figures prove that the rate of sales tax levied on motor cars has not prevented the public from buying them. The only reason why there was a hiatus in the sale of motor cars in Australia - I am now getting on to my own particular hobby horse - was that this Government introduced its Budget far too late. Prophets of doom, or of confidence, always say prior to the introduction of a Budget, that there will be variations of sales tax on motor cars, refrigerators, washing machines and the like. Such forecasts are not always borne out when the Budget is brought down. However, for this reason, there was a drop in car sales during July and August of this year. I do not deny that the retention of the 30 per cent, rate of sales tax on new motor cars hit the industry, but sales commenced to pick up in October. We were late in telling the people what the position would be in relation to sales tax on motor cars, but when we did tell them, sales increased. I would be prepared to say from any public platform in Australia that I do not believe that we should reduce sales tax on motor cars simply because more vehicles are being manufactured than are sold. It is up to big business to make sure that it does not over-produce. If motor car manufacturers find that they are over-producing for the Australian market, they should show initiative - as I understand the Holden people have done - and look for export markets. By so doing, they will help not only themselves but also Australia's export trade, and thus assist the balance of payments position. So let us not panic and blame the Government for not reducing sales tax, just because sales may appear to drop at one period. Let vis see whether or not it is because the companies are making big profits. That is where we get the alternating views of the Labour party. At one moment - for instance, at Budget time - they growl at the profits of the combines and big companies. Then they forget that tune they have been singing - not altogether in unison, because, unlike a choir, they have separate parts. When they come to discuss a sales tax bill, they blame the Government for imposing too high a sales tax, which, they seem to work out in some way, allows the companies to make excessive profits. That is all I have to say in respect of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey's</inline> contribution to this debate. </para>
                    <para>I say quite frankly that I am always perplexed by the number and extremely complex nature of the sales tax bills that come before us each year. This is a point to which the Treasurer, under whose jurisdiction the matter comes, and his many and learned advisers, should give some thought in the period of at least nine months - I hope at most - that will elapse before a new Budget is introduced. We know that the sales tax is here to stay. It is like income tax, and is like the Senate - it will be with us for all time. Whether we will always be with the Senate, however, is a matter that history will tell. As sales tax is a continuing tax upon the people, I believe that it is the duty of the Government and its advisers to consolidate' the legislation. We have some ten bills on the subject, and one needs to be more than a bush lawyer to understand it. Some really hard work ought to be put into the consolidation oi this legislation to make it simpler, not only for politicians, including honorable senators, but also, for business people. </para>
                    <para>The exemptions provided by the bill we are now considering, are to give effect to the policy stated by the Treasurer in his Budget speech. It is just as well, here in the comparative calm of Senate debates., when the ranks of Tuscany have thinned out somewhat, to realize what these bills do. Rates of sales tax on household furniture and equipment are reduced from 10 per cent, to 8£ per cent. These items include domestic refrigerators-, washing machines and vacuum cleaners. There is a big percentage reduction on. handbags, baskets, travelling bags, and other travel goods. There are. exemptions from sales tax for industrial gases and cylinders, &amp;c. The total cost to revenue of these concessions in this financial year is some £3,000,000, but if the Budget had been introduced earlier, as I feel it should have been, the loss to revenue would have been £4,000,000. That is where I join issue with the Australian Labour party and, once again, with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey.</inline> They complain about the amount being small. I say that their view of the value of money is out of perspective. There are many measures by which the Government levies taxes on the people. The return to the people of between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000 per annum is something we can appreciate. </para>
                    <para>Summing up, this sales tax legislation gives benefit to the householder, and what greater body of people can be helped? Nothing could be more appropriate than that the Government should give tax relief to the householder. The effect is that the family man and woman will receive the benefit. This country needs tourists and travellers, and under this legislation the sales tax applying to their requisites is reduced. Therefore, it must be said that they are being helped. Anything that  we  can do to help the tourist trade, which  is.  partly a Commonwealth responsibility,  will,  assist the economic life of this country. </para>
                    <para>Briefly, I would say that this legislation is in line with the general measures outlined in the Budget for 1957-58. It fits into tha pattern, which the Government decided on and which the people appreciate, of giving, something to all sections of the community in all States of the Commonwealth. There is some relief in a time of fairly buoyant revenue, but as the economic situation!  is  threatened by the spiral of inflation,  we  cannot be too generous by adding too much to the spending power of the people'.  I  feel that the Government's general attitude in reducing the incidence of taxation commends itself to the people. The purpose-  of  sales tax is to take into Consolidated Revenue money from those who desire  to  spend, it and do spend it on. certain categories of goods.. Because it is a tax  on  money that people spend,, it is. a comparatively fair. tax. It. is a. tax. that many people do not realise they are paying, and therefore it is. not so unpopular as other, taxes. It takes from people some part of  the  money that they spend. Therefore,, those who decide not to spend money on goods subject to sales tax do not pay the tax. They save their money and, in that respect, sales tax is a most reasonable tax, because this country needs to restrict inflation and encourage the people to save. Sales  tax  is a back-handed way of encouraging thrift, which is so necessary in Australia to-day. </para>
                    <para>For a few moments I may be somewhat critical. I shall be constructive, I trust,  but  although I am critical I am not worried about it. I am not silenced by some outside junta. I will not be threatened  with  expulsion or the withholding of endorsement. I will not have a non-member  of  my party endorsed in my stead, as is happening in the New South Wales State electorate of Wagga. That does not happen to us. Because we are in the Liberal party we can be critical. We are free to speak in this Parliament, and we act as our consciences dictate. I suggest that before the Government introduces any new sales tax legislation, as it presumably will after the next Budget, it has a duty to make taxation laws more simple for the business people to obey. The laws should be made easier for trade and commerce  to  administer, because we must realize that when trade, commerce and business have to collect tax for a government, they become tax collectors, and it costs them money. The more difficult that legislation is to administer, the greater are the costs to trade and commerce, and costs inflate prices. Naturally, Trade and Commerce do not intend to be benefactors to the Federal Treasury. They will pass on their costs, so that in our desire to lower prices - not the standard of living - let us make our legislation simple of administration. 1 plead with the Government and its advisers to be sure that sales tax is levied fairly and equitably on all sections of the community. I emphasize that it must not become a tax that singles out any one -section. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-style="italic">I</inline>
                        regret that, so far as I can see, as a layman, the legislation contains no provision for the simplification of administration. To
                        <inline font-style="italic">my</inline>
                        way of thinking, this bill makes confusion worse confounded. As there appears to be no effort at simplification, there cannot be any reduction in costs of administration to those people who are the Government's unpaid tax collectors.
                    </para>
                    <para>I mention another point to which I hope the Government will give consideration. We propose passing a bill which levies tax under five different headings. This is a most aggravating system. It makes administration difficult for Trade and Commerce, for the retailers and the manufacturers. I suggest that two categories of sales tax which are easy to compute are all that are required. I do not mind how much the Government collects so long as the method of collection is simple. I suggest that 10 per cent, and 25 per cent, are the two most suitable rates to adopt for they strike the mean balance between the five now prescribed. The complaints I get from small, large and very big businesses about the various degrees of incidence of sales tax make me feel that it is important that we look at the position again. </para>
                    <para>To-day a question was asked in the Senate relating to decimal coinage. I think it almost certain that decimal coinage will be introduced into Australia. Indeed, I think its introduction is warranted, and I suggest that we prepare for its introduction by adopting simple percentages for the calculation of sales tax. In my view, the adoption of 10 per cent, and 25 per cent, would be doing a great service to the business community. </para>
                    <para>Although I cannot claim to be an expert on these matters, I make what I believe to be another constructive suggestion to the Government. I urge that the Government do not simply brush aside ideas that will be put forward during the debate on this measure, and I ask it to lend an ear to what the business people are saying, for there may be some merit in their criticism. In order to discover whether there is any foundation for that criticism, I suggest that within three months - I choose that period because I know how long it takes to prepare a budget - the Treasurer should call a conference between senior sales tax officials of the Government and representatives of the chambers of commerce, the Retail Traders Association and manufacturing concerns. I suggest that he give those people ample notice of the conference and that he notify them that the business to be considered will be methods of simplifying and cutting down costs in the administration of sales tax legislation. I suggest that he say to them. " Come to us with your ideas and we will consider them with our experts with a view to giving a boost to business, cutting costs and working in with those people whom we, by this legislation, make honorary collectors of taxes for the Government ". I support the legislation. </para>

                        <para>. -  I had no intention of taking part in this debate until my colleague from South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline> made certain remarks earlier. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> has just remarked, it is quite a change to hear honorable senators opposite discussing a measure in this chamber. They have had very little to say about legislation over the last 24 hours, and I welcome the participation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> in the debate on this measure. </para>

                    <para>One matter to which I wish to make particular reference is that mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey.</inline> I think he has the support of every honorable senator from South Australia in the matter.  His  suggestion is a good one, but I should like to point out a. difficulty he has not seen fit to mention. I refer to the difficulty of implementing that very desirable suggestion. I think the Treasurer would say, quite correctly, that if thisconcession were given to the dried fruits industry, so that dried fruits used in the manufacture of cakes, buns and so on were exempt from sales tax, the total benefit to the industry itself would not be more than about £20,000. I speak from memory, but I think that figure will be found to be correct. </para>
                    <para>I am sure every honorable senator who is a practical fellow will realize that it is not possible to exempt from sales tax the actual fruit contained in such foods as cakes and buns; I am sure he will realize that the only way is to exempt the vehicles, as it were - the cakes and buns which contain the fruit. If all those things were to be exempt, a very different amount of money would be involved. The growers of dried fruits would get the benefit of about £20,000, but the loss to revenue through the exemption of what might be called the vehicle for the sale of the fruits would be between £3,000,000 and £4,000,000. </para>
                    <para>It does not suit <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey's</inline> book to say that. Perhaps that was due to an oversight. I do not want to be unfair to him, but I wish to emphasize to the Senate that the loss to revenue would be more than a mere £20,000. It would not be the chicken feed to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toheey</inline> referred, but would total about £4,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- 1 am speaking from memory. I believe the amount is approximately £4,000,000 but the value of the fruit involved would be only £20,000. I take exception to a remark that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> for the second time in recent weeks. He said that if we South Australian senators knew something about our State, we would agree with him. I claim that I move about South Australia far more than does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey,</inline> and I challenge him on that statement. I visit parts of South Australia where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> is seldom seen. I would not have made that statement if this had been the first time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> had passed the remark to which I have referred, but </para>

                    <para class="block">I take exception to it when apparently it becomes his custom to repeat the charge. </para>
                    <para>It is wrong for him to suggest that he knows more about South Australia than my colleagues on this side of the House. One lives in Mount Gambier. I know Eyre Peninsula. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Hannaford</inline> knows the lower north of South Australia, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> the Adelaide Hills. Between us, we cover more of South Australia than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> and his colleagues on the Opposition side. J would not have said that had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> not repeated his statement for the second time in recent weeks. I have nothing more to say" on that matter, except to express the hope that my protest will be noted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> if he does me the honour to read the report of my remarks. </para>
                    <para>I wish to comment briefly on anotherstatement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> when he referred to the motor industry in South Australia. He implied - in fact, he said definitely - that the sales tax on motor vehicles was a great burden on the industry and was, in fact, producing unemployment, particularly in the Chrysler-Dodge group. From my observations, I believe that the decline in sales of the Chrysler-Dodge products is entirely due to the high cost of those products. That deters buyers who do not want the higher priced vehicles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> admitted that General MotorsHolden's Limited, makers of the Holden car, was not in such difficulty. That proves my point. People are inclined to buy cars in the moderately priced range, particularly When they have a very good performance record. I am supported in that statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> who said that sales have been increasing since October and following the introduction of the Budget. I believe that from June onwards, potential buyers hold off in anticipation of a reduction in the sales tax. That is good business and a wise procedure, and it is reflected in the decline in the sale of some cars. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> is now listening to me. </para>

I will not inflict my views on the Senate again, but I do repeat that probably the slight recession in the sale of motor cars was due to uncertainty at the end of the financial year before the introduction of the Budget. When somebody reminded <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> that sales of cars were increasing in October, he said, " That is of no account to me ". Of course it is of no account to him because it did not help his argument. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> and some others want to see is unemployment in Australia, not only in the motor industry but everywhere. He does not want anybody to remind him that things are getting better. That is not good news to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey.</inline></para>

                        <para>. -  This bill has some very good features because it provides for a reduction in sales tax collections by £4,000,000 in a full financial year and £3,000,000 in this financial year. It is of some interest to note that the sales tax is now 27 years old. It was first introduced in 1930, at the rate of 2* per cent. </para>

I believe that a Labour government was in power in 1930-31, but Labour supporters have been trying to dodge the fact that a Labour government was in power at that time. They have always tried to say that a Liberal government was in office. However, we are dealing now with the sales tax measure. </para>

                    <para>I listened with interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott,</inline> who spoke about the earlier presentation pf the Budget. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearson's</inline> views on that point. Whenever a Budget is presented, the effect will be the same. Buyers of motor cars, anticipating a fall in sales tax, will always cease to buy vehicles two or three months before the Budget is presented whether it is brought down in June, July, August, September or October. It is only a matter of delayed action and an early Budget will not cure that. The same caution is found in all classes of trade. A rumour is spread around. The press in particular plays a part, probably more important than it realizes, in unsettling trade. The press flies a kite about a reduction in sales tax on some commodities and sales are immediately dampened down until the Budget is introduced and buyers know what is going to happen. </para>

                            <para>- My boy, I was dealing with that when you were in your cradle. [ have been in the bakery trade for so many years that I shall be able to tell you all about that matter in a moment or two. I know more about it than you have ever thought of. You have mentioned something that I do know a lot about. </para>

                    <para>I was dealing with the fact that, for some stupid reason or other, before a budget is presented rumours are spread that there is to be a reduction of sales tax, and immediately the sale of commodities drops. Often great disorganization is caused to business as a result. As I mentioned earlier, sales tax at the rate of <inline font-style="italic">H</inline> per cent, was imposed in 1930.  Since then the rate has been increased and goods have been divided into several categories. I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> said about the number of categories that exist. As far as I can recollect, the introduction of sales tax marked the first time in Australian history that members of the business community became the unpaid tax gatherers of the Government. When mistakes have been made, businesses have been asked to pay the tax that they have not charged and have also been asked to pay tax that they have charged but which really was not chargeable. So the department gets it both ways. </para>
                    <para>What is the registered wholesaler or trader required to do under the act? His staff is required to examine the invoices, make the extensions, and indicate the goods that fall within the 30 per cent, category, the 25 per cent, category, the 12i per cent, category, the 10 per cent, category, and the <inline font-style="italic">8i</inline> per cent, category. When all is said and done, the staff of any business is human, and the human element enters into this work; but every business is liable in respect of mistakes that are made by its staff in the preparation of invoices. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott</inline> in saying that the preparation of sales tax documents should be made as simple as possible, because the work is done by the staff of the various businesses, which collect and pay the tax. The fewer the number of categories is, the better it is for all concerned. If it were possible to arrive at one overall rate of sales tax that would return the same amount of revenue, that would be ideal. </para>
                    <para>This measure provides for a number of new exemptions, and for a total reduction of sales tax amounting this year to £3,000,000 and in a full year to £4,000,000. That is not an inconsiderable amount. Honorable senators opposite advance pleas in respect of various items, but I point out that, when a government is endeavouring to grant relief in as many directions as possible, it must look at the overall picture. One feature of the last Budget that has been overlooked by honorable senators is the way in which various forms of taxation were reduced. </para>
                    <para>I note with a great deal of interest that in the list of goods and commodities that are to be exempted from sales tax fire-fighting equipment and fire-protection apparatus which is used exclusively or primarily in the prevention or combating of fire is included. That has been a step forward. Also included is machinery for the servicing, repairing or reconditioning of ships, boats, other vessels, railway rolling-stock, and parts therefor. The exemption of those goods provides a necessary form of relief. Shipbuilding in Australia is increasing, and any relief in that direction from the imposition of sales tax is well worth while. 1 had the pleasure recently of visiting the yard in New South Wales where the new Bass Strait ferry is being built, and I know that relief from sales tax on machinery purchased will mean a great deal to the people "who are engaged in that activity. </para>
                    <para>The rate of tax on furniture and household equipment has been reduced. That, too, is a desirable step forward, because young married couples in particular are experiencing difficulty in purchasing for the first time furniture and equipment for their homes. Another exemption, which I think is of great interest to the primary producer, is that of non-alcoholic carbonated beverages containing the juices of Australian fruits. I do not know whether honorable senators have given a lot of thought to this matter, but I remind them that there are many varieties of fruit juices, and that the exemption of beverages containing those juices will greatly assist in the production of these commodities. </para>
                    <para>One or two anomalies have been adjusted, also. Some little time ago, we exempted from sales tax wire used for the wrapping of cases, but overlooked steel strapping which was used for a similar purpose. That anomaly has been removed. Many items in addition to those to which I have referred have been exempted, and I think that their exemption will be welcomed in particular by those sections of industry that will benefit as a result. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the benefit is passed on in most cases. I am glad that the honorable senator has raised that point, because I noticed with great interest that, immediately after the Budget was presented, there was much advertising of the fact that new prices were being charged for various goods because of the reduction of sales tax. That is a form of direct assistance to the purchasing public. The £4,000,000 reduction is going direct to the purchasers. I think that honorable senators opposite will agree that to-day, probably for the first time for a number of years, competition is very keen in the cities of Australia, particularly in the retail trade. The retailers are passing the sales tax reductions on to the public. </para>

                    <para>For a moment or two I desire to refer to a matter that was raised by Senators Toohey and Pearson, of South Australia. It is the sales tax on the contents of vehicles for dried fruits, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearson</inline> aptly put it. I refer to cakes, puddings, biscuits and buns, which contain Australian dried fruits. Because they contain Australian dried fruits, a plea has been made that they should be exempted from sales tax. I have had very strong representations made to me over a number of years that the whole of that class of goods should be exempted. Honorable senators will agree that great hardship is imposed on the small manufacturers of this class of goods. They have to keep records for the Taxation Branch and pay to the branch the sales tax on the cakes, puddings, buns and biscuits that they make. Normally the small trader in this business is a master baker, who spends most of his time during the day in the bakehouse. He makes a variety of goods, some of which are taxable and some of which are exempt. He has to keep a record of the taxable items which he sells, and this imposes a hardship on him. Many honorable senators have made representations to have this class of goods exempted entirely. I do not think the exemption would benefit the dried-fruits industry very much, because it is such a small item. It is difficult to assess the content of dried fruits used in the manufacture of these products, because one man might put a few more currants in his buns than his competitors put in theirs. There is competition in the trade, and some seek to meet it in that way. As I have said, it is difficult to assess just how much fruit is used. I believe that the proper approach to this matter is to exempt these goods altogether. That would give a great deal of pleasure to a number of honorable senators. To those who have been trying to obtain exemption for these goods, my advice is that they should be able to make out » case if they keep on trying. </para>

I have said before that the exemptions the Government grants in any category must be related to the overall concessions granted in the Budget. If the Government is in a position to grant more concessions next year - I do not know whether it will be or not - I hope that when the matter of sales tax is being considered, the Government will have before it representations for the exemption of goods in this category. </para>

                    <para>Much has been said about sales tax, but I think it is well worth mentioning that it applies to every type of buyer.- Every person who purchases goods subject to sales tax helps to fill the coffers of the Commonwealth Government. Some people are able to evade the payment of income tax, but they cannot evade the payment of sales tax, because they have to live and they find it necessary to buy goods subject to this tax. When they buy those goods, of necessity they make a contribution to the Government. I am sure that there are a number of people who will say that any tax is bad, but that this tax at least has the virtue of reaching everybody. </para>

                    <para>There is one other matter to which 1 wish to refer. It is sales tax as it applies to freight, and has to do particularly with my own State of Tasmania. It is a matter that has been raised on many occasions. I must be fair and say that it is easy to criticize, but it is very hard to find a solution to the problem. Most of the goods coming into Tasmania are carried either by sea or air - two of the most expensive means of transport in Australia to-day. Sales tax on freight means added costs to Tasmanian industry. Two or three years ago, I made an assessment of the added cost on motor cars. I think that sales tax also applying to the freight charged to ship a car from the mainland to Tasmania is of the order of 30 per cent. Because of the tax, a car purchased in Tasmania costs about £75 more than the same type of car purchased in Victoria. </para>

                        <para>.- It gives me great pleasure to support any bill whose object is the abolition of sales tax on certain new classes of goods, and the reduction of sales tax on a group of Other goods. I regard any reduction in, or alleviation of, sales tax as a good thing. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson</inline> pointed out last night, in speaking of the pay-roll tax, any reduction is good. I believe that that is particularly so in the case of sales tax. I disagree very strongly with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Marriott,</inline> who said that It was not without merit because a person did not realize he was paying it - in other words, that it was some form of swindle, or confidence trick. That is one of the most offensive characteristics of sales tax. It hits hardest the family man, and is inequitable in its incidence. It is not based on ability to pay. It is not imposed on a graduated scale and, by and large, it can be one of the worst forms of inflationary tax. I say that it can be, because it has a twofold characteristic. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The imposition of this indirect tax has to be watched very carefully. It reminds one of the properties of the oxides of mercury. These oxides may be used to produce calomel, which is a medicament, but may also be combined to produce a deadly poison. So, too, sales tax may be used in accordance with its legitimate function - as a form of revenue-raiser in times of economic emergency, for the purpose of reducing spending power, or by way of a selective and discriminatory impost, during an emergency, on a particular luxury. I suppose that now, in 1957, it is difficult to attack the validity of sales tax as a revenueraiser. At present the tax yields the Government approximately £130,000,000 annually, and the cost of collection is infinitesimal - only £497,000. Therefore, it returns the Government a very good profit. A tax which yields such a large amount cannot arbitrarily be abolished or set on one side, although it is my personal hope that the day will dawn when sales tax will be abolished, lock, stock and barrel. </para>
                    <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Henty</inline> has pointed out, in the case of sales tax, the victim applies most of his own punishment. The Government requires a list of five separate categories to be kept, and the additional accountancy services and clerical work involved in maintaining these records is a not inconsiderable portion of the average wages bill, which, of course, finds its way into the cost structure of our consumer goods. </para>
                    <para>Perhaps one might return, step by step, to the millennium which existed before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> introduced sales tax many years ago. The bill before us releases a large number of essential items from the burden of this tax and the Government has obviously considered it desirable to choose this way of encouraging certain industries and types of production. I note with pleasure that firefighting equipment, and fire protection apparatus, being goods of a kind used exclusively, primarily or principally in preventing or combating fire, are to be free of sales tax. No sane person would cavil at their elimination from the sales tax list, but it is passing strange that, though the equipment used in fighting a fire is to be exempted, radio equipment, which is so frequently used by fire-fighters in combating this national menace, is to be exempt only when operated by country fire boards, or authorities of that nature. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wade</inline> will take me to task if I say that in very many cases communications are maintained by radio amateurs because the job is too tough for anyone else to undertake. I do hope that, in the fullness of time, some justice will be meted out to these people, who have served the public so well in every form of national and natural crisis, be it fire, flood - perhaps I ought not to say famine. Assistance of this kind is already given to surf life-saving clubs, rifle clubs and fire brigades. </para>
                    <para>Reference has been made to the imposition of sales tax on motor cars. 1 think that 30 per cent, is a very high tax to be borne by a commodity which, in 1957, can no longer be regarded as a luxury. Every family in Australia aims, at one time or another, to own a motor car. I suppose that the average amount of sales tax on a motor car is about £250. That is a rough mental assessment, made while I am on my feet, and I do not want it to be taken as an accurate figure. That is a very high impost upon an article of this kind. We are long past the day when the motor car was the possession of the privileged few, when it was driven by a chauffeur and - earlier still - when a man with a red flag preceded it. In those days it was something of a novelty, but nowadays one family in every four possesses a motor car. </para>
                    <para>As we have been directing our attention to sales tax as a weapon against inflation, it might be appropriate to make a passing reference to the importance of adjusted sales tax in combating inflation by skimming off, in selected cases, purchasing power from particular industries. I do not propose to analyse those industries at the moment and simply say that in Great Britain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Macmillan</inline> has shown that his No. 1 target for this session is the combating of inflation. He has inherited, of course, the chaos that was produced by the centrally planned economy of the Labour socialist administration which was in office from 1945 to 1950.  His  task is as hard as ours has been in following Labour's eight years of rule from 1941 to 1949. Adverting to those forms of economic difficulties which both Australia and Britain have faced, I think if we look back through history and make a careful analysis of the economic aspects of the falls of most civilizations it will be seen that there was a failure of the production of real wealth in the communities involved, and that there was some form of indirect taxation approximating sales tax or purchase tax imposed by the ruling authorities in those countries. The ancient Romans always diverted the masses with bread and circuses. Diocletian, in A.D. 301, used his brutal persecution of the Christian church to distract the attention of the masses from economic troubles. He had no senate to hold up his legislation, or interfere with his views. Diocletian was able to put into effect his own amateur forms of economic correction. He imposed a form of sales tax on corn coming from North Africa, grain from Sicily and timber from the north African provinces. One of the results was that, since most of the producers of wealth were no longer able to remain in Rome, when the barbarians prevented the shipment of merchandise from north Africa and Sicily, the Roman Empire was on the way out because its economy had been strangled from within. </para>
                    <para>Diocletian's persecution of the Christian church was not simply the brutal action of a sadist. In persecuting the Christian church, he could at least keep occupied the citizens of Rome who had nothing much to eat and nothing much to do. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. About 160 years later, the Emperor, Justinian, when faced with the same economic difficulties, tried a sales tax. I do not want honorable senators opposite to think that these matters are irrelevant simply because they happened 2,000 years ago. History has a habit of repeating itself, and in applying ourselves to the economic difficulties of the mid-twentieth century we would be throwing away some of the advantages that we possess if we failed to make a careful analysis and examination of the economic difficulties that were suffered by the nations at the dawn of our civilization. The Byzantine Empire was unable to defend itself in the middle fifth century because the Emperor, as the result of his economic measures, was no longer able to pay the mercenaries - the Goths, the Visigoths and Ostrogoths who had formerly been able and willing to defend their interests against the other barbarian hordes. </para>

I could add to the historical survey he made the information that Philip of Spain also tried sales tax in the Netherlands. It was one of the worst things he did there.

                        <para>:[l-0..5ilO-  -  - 11he :measure now before the Senate makes provision for the distribution of the balance of some £93,000,000 that was realized as profits of the Joint Organization for the sale of Australian wool. AH of these moneys were, under existing legislation, due to be distributed by 17th March last. However, of the £2,500,000, some £300,000 could not be distributed, mainly because the growers to whom the money was due could not be located. There is a prospect that many of them can now be located and there is no authority under the act to make distribution at this day. The remaining £2,200,000 is money that has been, might I say, in chancery, for the last few years, owing to an action that was taken by a wool dealer, one Poulton, who took proceedings on behalf of dealers in an endeavour to have the remaining proceeds from the Joint Organization paid to them and not to the growers. The amount was litigated. It was under threat of appeal until leave to appeal to the Privy Council was finally refused in October of last year. lt is quite obviously necessary now to have legislative authority for that £2,200,000 to be distributed to the growers. It can now, with absolute assurance and without fear of legal threat, be so distributed. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>There is a number of minor matters. Moneys have been paid into court. The legislation deals with that matter and provides that if the money remains there by 30th June, 1959, any portion remaining must be paid to the Wool Research Trust Fund. A sum of £10,000 has been put in reserve to meet administrative expenses of the Australian Wool Realization Commission's activities, and .any balance remaining at 30th June, 1959, will be paid also to the Wool Research Trust Fund. </para>
                    <para>The real purpose of the bill is to extend until 30ih June, J 959, the time for finding the true owners of the remaining proceeds and to provide that, if any moneys remain undistributed, they shall be paid to the Wool Research Trust Fund. That fund, as the Senate knows, has been established for research purposes for the benefit of everybody engaged in the industry. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition supports the measure, which is a very 'proper and necessary one. lt only remains for me &gt;to pay a tribute to those who . handled the Joint Organization activity so very successfully, and to the many distinguished Australians who -.played a major part in the distribution and acted as agents for the Joint Organization. It would be invidious for me to particularize without enumerating everybody. I merely acknowledge, on behalf of the Opposition, the debt of gratitude that Australia and those in the wool industry in particular owe for the magnificent services that they have had from so many distinguished Australians. I have very much pleasure in according the Opposition's full support of the measure. </para>

                        <para>.- I rise to express my appreciation of this measure because, like the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> I am bound to say that the Joint Organization wrote a most conspicuous chapter in our industrial history in a time of great national crisis. It was not received, in the first instance, with the acclaim that the sponsors would have desired, but by the quality of its administration it proved that it was playing a great part in the interests of the nation and of the wool-growers in particular. lt is a matter for some concern that to-day so much of our economy is riding on the sheep's back. I am afraid that, as a people, we are somewhat inclined to tell ourselves that while all is well with the wool market all is well with Australia. I suggest that that can be a rather dangerous line of thought, because the world to-day is searching for a synthetic fibre than can take the place of wool. Other world powers are expending amazing sums on research into synthetics. I am afraid that we are inclined to suggest that they can never match our product. I suggest that that is a dangerous line of thinking. Only quite recently, honorable senators on both sides have been disturbed to learn that rams sold to the South African Government have been released to private enterprise. It is true that those rams are not pure Australian merinos, as we know them. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter for a more academic mind than mine. I would suggest, with great respect, that that is a matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> could decide for himself and that I would not be interested in it. That action is an indication of how other world powers, apart from their interest in synthetics, are prepared to go to some lengths to capture the market for better class wool. So I suggest that the remaining amounts in this fund that are going to wool research are going to a very good cause. I know that there are great difficulties in finding many of the growers who, for reasons best known to themselves, whilst J.O. was operating, sold portions of their clips, such as crutchings, and dead wool, to dealers. I can well remember on one occasion listening to a debate between a seller and a buyer. </para>
