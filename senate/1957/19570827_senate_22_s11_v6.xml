                    <para>. - by leave - I am sure the Senate learned with great regret of the death on 26th May of our late colleague, John Devlin. The late senator lived all his life in the Violet Town district of Victoria. He was born at Violet Town and was educated at Tamleugh, where he spent his life as a farmer. He took a great interest in local government matters, as well as' in politics. He was the  president  of his local shire for three terms, he represented country shires on the Victorian Health Commission for many years and he was a member of the Australian Labour party from his -early days. He was a member of the Victorian State executive of the Australian Labour party for more than twenty years and was1 Victorian State  president  in 1937-38. He was first elected to the Senate in 1946, to fill a casual vacancy caused by the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> and was re-elected at the elections in 1949, 1951 and 1953. </para>

I remember that when I came into the Senate first I was the recipient at his hands of infinite kindness and consideration. Neither inside nor outside the chamber did I ever hear the late senator say an unkind or a hurtful word. It was a great pleasure and a great privilege to know him. Those of us who knew him were very distressed at the long and lingering illness which resulted in his death. Our sympathy goes out to his bereaved family. May he rest in peace. I move - </para>

As he indicated, the last illness of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devlin</inline> was very prolonged. It commenced with a very severe stroke, suffered in Canberra, as long ago as February, 1956. That left him partially paralysed and he was quite unable to attend the sittings of the Senate "thereafter. It transpired that 'that stroke was the culmination of a number -of Jess severe strokes that the late senator had .suffered over .many .years. .All of them left their mark on .him, but their effects were masked by !his tremendous physical strength and great strong-mindedness. Those strokes or visitations, unfortunately, impaired the great effectiveness that had been the outstanding characteristic of a long, loyal and useful service to the Australian Labour party in both the administrative and political fields. </para>

                    I am able to say to-day that they bestowed their affectionate consideration on him during the many years of his illnesses and ill health. I had occasion to visit him a number of times after February, 1956, when he was in hospital in central Victoria and Melbourne, and I count him as being fortunate, too, in the loving care with which he was tended by that very fine lady, his wife, and members of his family.

                    <para>. - On behalf of the Opposition, I second the motion that the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> has put before the Senate. Although we on the Opposition side knew that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anthony's</inline> health was failing, we were shocked by the tragic suddenness of his death. We find it a very -sobering thought that one who, until comparatively recently, was engaged in the most virile debates in this Parliament, should now have completed his earthly course. I have no doubt that the strain inseparable from ministerial office contributed to his untimely death. It is given to very few to gain the distinction of Cabinet rank, and the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anthony</inline> won to that position is, in itself, an acknowledgment of his personal worth, his character and his ability. Unquestionably, he gave of his best to his party, to the Parliament and to the nation. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>As the Leader of the Government has intimated, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anthony's</inline> life was largely one devoted to community service. It is always a tragedy for a community and a country when a life so devoted comes to an end. I extend to supporters of the Government and, particularly, to members of the Australian Country party, the sympathy of honorable senators on this side of the chamber in the loss of their very distinguished colleague. I join with the Leader of the Government in offering my condolences to the widow and relatives of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Anthony.</inline></para>

It was not long before his ability received recognition, for, in 1940, he was Minister without portfolio assisting the Treasurer and the Minister for Commerce. In 1941, he became Minister for Transport. In 1949, he became Postmaster-General in the present Government, and held that portfolio until his retirement, through ill-health, some twelve months ago. He was a man whom we always recognized as a forceful speaker and vigorous debater. He was loyal to his party and assiduous in attending to his parliamentary duties, and throughout his career he took a very prominent interest in all activities, especially those connected with primary production, that were carried on in his electorate. </para>

                    was a member of the Cabinet, and I well remember the many courtesies and kindnesses which he extended to me as a youthful politician. I use the term youthful as relating to political experience. I had not been here very long when I realized that Arthur Drakeford enjoyed the esteem and affection, not only of the members of his own party, but also of many other persons here. He was greatly liked and highly esteemed by all with whom he came in contact. 1 am sure that his memory will live long and verdantly in the hearts of those who had the privilege of knowing him.

                    <para>. - On behalf of the Opposition I second the motion proposed by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan).</inline> The Minister has recited to the Senate the official record of the late Honorable Arthur Samuel Drakeford in the parliamentary life of Australia. May 1 add that he was a leading figure in the trade union movement of this country. The Leader of the Government referred to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drakeford</inline> had been  president  of the Australian Federated Union of Locomotive Enginemen. He had a very long history of association with that union. He joined it in 1901, was secretary of the Benalla branch in 1903, was elected to the Victorian executive in 1908, was  president  for the year 1916-17 and then, from 1918 until 1929, was either acting federal secretary, or the federal secretary, of that great union. From 1929 to 1948,- when he voluntarily relinquished the position, he was its federal  president.  He was known and respected throughout the whole trade union movement, and his passing has left great grief in that circle. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>He left a firm mark on the history of this nation in many respects. Not only, as the Leader of the Government has chronicled, was he a very efficient and able service Minister throughout the whole of the war but also he played a major part in building the Royal Australian Air Force into the splendid fighting unit it was in the later years of the war. </para>
                <para>It was during his regime that TransAustralia Airlines was established in this country and that we saw a very great development in the sphere of civil aviation. It is true to say that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Drakeford</inline> laid the foundations for what are commonly acknowledged to be the finest and safest airlines in the world, those now operating in Australia. </para>
                <para>He suffered the hurt of being defeated in the exceptional circumstances of the 1955 general election. He accepted that defeat gallantly and without bitterness of any kind.  His  defeat had the great virtue and reward of enabling him to spend his remaining days peacefully and happily in the bosom of his family, to whom he was whole-heartedly devoted. </para>
                <para>Arthur Drakeford was a great man and a great Australian. He was a gentleman by nature, and by practice always a gentleman.  His  great efficiency and his powerful debating powers were exercised with unfailing courtesy and consideration for others. If asked to express in a single sentence my opinion of Arthur Drakeford I should say that he was a most wholesome man. In saying that I would be paying tribute to a multitude of sterling qualities; to his decency, his kindness, his straightforwardness and his truly Christian character. I would be paying tribute to a worthy husband and father, to one through whose whole life ran the golden thread of loyalty, to one who understood and practised mateship in the truest Australian sense. </para>
                <para>I had a very close association with Arthur Drakeford in the Chifley Government, in which we were both privileged to serve.  His  passing has deprived me and every member of the Opposition of a great mate whose memory will 'not fade but will live with us. The large attendance at his funeral was an indication of the respect and affection in which he was universally held. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> thank the Leader of the Government for his kindly references to our late colleague. I extend to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Drakeford</inline> and to the members of the family of our late colleague our deepest sympathy in their bereavement. </para>

                        <para>- Will the Minister representing the Minister for Trade endeavour to prevail on the Government to take immediate steps to afford a long-term protection to the textile industries of Australia by imposing adequate tariffs on textiles imported into this country, thus enabling full, employment to be maintained in the industry so that it may expand in the way that has been planned? At. the present time, there is a great deal of unemployment in the textile industry in this country, due to the scare that the conclusion of the recent trade agreement with Japan will enable considerably larger quantities of textiles to come into Australia from that country. In Tasmania, it appears likely that many more textile workers will be thrown out of employment as a result of the agreement. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the honorable senator described the present condition as a scare. That is an appropriate description because the ink on the trade treaty is hardly yet dry. There are as yet no practical results one way or the other, but to the extent that the scare exists to a material degree I should describe it as a self-inflicted wound by the textile industry which is causing this situation. So far as protection to the industry is concerned, the Government's policy remains unaltered. The Tariff Board is ready and prepared to deal with applications that are made and that are referred to it by the Minister. I have no doubt that its decisions will be as wise in the future as they have been in the past. </para>

The plans for the new vessel have not yet been completed; they are still on the way. Provision has been made in this year's Estimates for the construction of the launch, and 1 hope that the money will remain available. I assure the honorable senator that all shipbuilders in Australia will be afforded an adequate opportunity to tender for the supply of the launch when it is decided to invite tenders. </para>

                        <para>- The question that I shall direct to the Minister representing the Minister for Trade is supplementary to the question that was asked by Senator Aylett. Is the Minister aware that  70  members of the Australian Textile Workers Union residing in Hobart have already received termination notices, and that many more textile workers are to be retrenched this week? Is he aware that a large percentage of the employees engaged in fabric printing by Silk and Textile Printers Limited have already been affected by the impact of the trade agreement with Japan, which has resulted in customers withholding orders? Further, is the Minister aware that Japan's chief textile products include cotton and rayon printed goods, as well as ordinary woven goods and knitwear? Will the Minister take action to have an immediate review of these sections made by the Tariff Board, because they Will become adversely affected by the application of the terms of the trade agreement with Japan? </para>

                        <para>- I am not aware of the various circumstances detailed by the honorable senator in respect of the number of men given notices of dismissal and so on. I shall take the honorable senator's word, as I am sure he would not incorrectly cite the figures. The point that I want to make is the point that I made in reply to an earlier question, namely, that the Japanese trade treaty has only just been signed. I think it is correct to say that practically no goods have arrived in Australia under the terms of that treaty. Therefore, it is manifestly incorrect to say that any situation that has arisen has occurred as a result of the operation of the treaty. Whatever has occurred is the result of a fear of what will happen. </para>

Bird, the Victorian secretary of the Australian Seamen's Union, that certain shipowners had made payments to Australian maritime unions in return for permission to man certain ships voyaging between Australia and overseas countries with non-Australian crews at less than Australian award rates, will the Minister make inquiries and furnish to the Senate a statement covering the following questions: -  (1)  What shipowners made such payments?  (2)  What unions received such payments?  (3)  What ship's were involved?  (4)  Did the sum involved on this score in respect of the Commonwealth ship "Tyalla" exceed  £3,000? (5)
                            Was this payment included in the price obtained by the Australian Shipping Commission for " Tyalla " and, if not, why not? (6)
                            Does the Government propose to stop these practices, which are alleged to constitute a form of blackmail Sand which threaten the 'conditions and employment of members of maritime unions? </para>

However, I take this opportunity to tell him that the incomes and the sources of income of the various unions to which he refers are matters for those unions. I have no knowledge of their sources of income, and I am doubtful whether any form of inquiry that I could make would reveal the sources of their income. I say at once that when this news story was written I exhibited some concern and asked in the department how this practice might affect Commonwealth ships. I was given the assurance that none of the Commonwealth's shipping operations was in any way connected with these alleged payments. Having said that, I ask again that the question be placed on the notice-paper, so that I may have a look at it in detail. </para>

                        <para>-  I do not consider that I should be called upon to give such an assurance. As I understand the decision of the High Court of Australia, it leaves the position unaltered for all practical purposes. If that is so, and if the States desire a conference, I should think that it would be proper for them to originate such a proposal. I do not think that the Commonwealth is called upon to commence such a proceeding. </para>

                            <para>It can only be expected that, in areas where the cane harvesting is about to commence, there will be a number of men unemployed  until  the sign-ons are completed. The situation at Cairns this year has been accentuated by the unprecedented movement of labour from southern Queensland cane-fields, where crops are not up to expectations, to the Cairns area where crops are heavy. Also, more cane-cutters have remained in the northern areas after the 1956 season than was the case in previous years. My latest information is that all suitable males registered for employment with the Cairns District Employment Office will be absorbed  as  soon as the commencement of the cane-harvesting season, plus a number of the migrants who are arriving by the " Toscana " at Cairns at the end of this week. We estimate also that the remainder of these new arrivals will be absorbed as the season progresses. </para>

I have been assured by my colleague, the Minister for Labour and National Service, that the position is being watched carefully by his department and, although  it  will take some short while to absorb all of the migrant arrivals, there will not be a surplus of suitable labour when the harvest season gets under way. </para>

                        <para>Parliamentary appropriations are not restricted, generally, to expenditure in any particular State. The Commonwealth's expenditure is recorded  in  respect of each vote from details of individual  payments which are brought to account through the Sub-Treasury in each State and in each Commonwealth territory. An attempt to allocate the expenditure between States would be a major undertaking and, moreover, the analysis would be of very doubtful value. Expenditure brought to account by a particular Sub-Treasury may include, for example, payments to interstate and overseas suppliers. Further, expenditure in one State is often for equipment and supplies for projects in another State. In short, the payments recorded in any Sub-Treasury do not purport to indicate the expenditure which may be attributable to Commonwealth activities or services in that State or territory. I ask, therefore, that the honorable senator reconsider his request for an allocation of the expenditure. Alternatively, arrangements will be made for him to inspect the returns to 30th June, 1957, from the Sub-Treasuries, of expenditure brought to account through their offices. </para>

                <para>The reasons for the change are apparent. The former name, Anti-Communist, was, rather hastily conceived. At the time, we were looking for a name that would make if completely obvious to the people that the portion of the Labour party which we supported was opposed to communism whereas the party designated the Australian Labour party supported communistic ideals. Now our policies are so divergent from those of the. present Evatt party that we form a truly democratic Labour party. The Australian Labour party's policies are so un-Australian that we would have nothing more to do with them.' </para>

But it is still a long; way - a good furlong - behind the people who sit on the treasury bench.

                        <para>- - by leave - Every one is familiar with the fluctuations in our balance of trade and the consequent need for import licensing. We have witnessed the recurrence of severe restrictions followed by relaxations, then further restrictions. This process of moving by fits and starts in our import trade is disturbing and it does the economy real harm. The whole of Australian industry and commerce is so geared to imports that the jobs and profits of all are at stake if we have inadequate export income or a balance of trade that fluctuates excessively. One of the major lines of policy pursued by the Government has been to; work for greater stability in. overseas earnings. The trade agreement with Japan has been a development of this policy. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>I propose to summarize what is in the agreement and' compare the position under the treaty with the position that existed' before the treaty was signed and finally to examine the reasons why the Government negotiated the treaty. The agreement: consists of seven articles which deal broadly with the mutual accord, of most favoured nation treatment in tariffs, import licensing and exchange control, the operation of State trading enterprises, the relationship of the. General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, to, the. agreement, safeguards against serious, injury to. domestic producers, consultation between the two governments and provisions for ratification. Included in the documents annexed to the agreement are letters excluding certain territories from the provisions of the. agreement and providing far the provisional operation of the agreement. </para>
                    <para>Agreed minutes which are also annexed set out specific: treatment which has been agreed for major Australian exports on entry into J Japan These minutes also cover in detail' the- operation of the safeguards against serious injury to domestic, producers and- refer to the methods of consultation which will- be set up between: the two governments. </para>
                    <para>The agreement ensures that Australian exports to Japan will be treated for tariff purposes just as favorably as goods imported into Japan from any other country. It also provides that Australian goods will be treated for import licensing and exchange control purposes just as favorably as goods from any other country. All Australian commodities for which there are export opportunities have, equal rights of access to the Japanese market with the products of any competing supplier country. In addition to these guarantees of equitable treatment for our exports, we obtained after vigorous negotiations specific assurances of benefit for our major export commodities individually. </para>
                    <para>The. agreement provides that no import duty will be levied, by Japan on Australian wool for the next three years. There is a specific assurance that the. amount of foreign exchange allocated by Japan for Australian wool will not be restricted, except as necessitated by Japan's balance of payments position. The agreement also provides that 90 per cent, of Japan's total foreign exchange allocation for wool will be in the form of a world allocation. This global allocation means that Australian wool can compete in the Japanese market for up to 90 per cent, of Japan's imports. </para>
                    <para>With regard to wheat, the agreement guarantees competitive access to the Japanese market for our higher protein or premium wheats. It also gives an assurance of non-discrimination on our f.a.q., or soft wheats. </para>
                    <para>Australian sugar may now compete for up to 40 per cent, of Japan's total sugar imports, despite bilateral arrangements that Japan has with other suppliers. Australia provides about 30 per cent, of Japan's imports of barley, and Japan is our best market for barley. This important trade has been safeguarded against unfair trade practices and non-commercial arrangements. On a range of other commodities, such as beef tallow, cattle hides, skim milk and dried vine fruits, we formerly faced difficulties in securing access to the Japanese market. We now have assurances of reasonable access for these products. In return for these important concessions, we have agreed to place Japan on the same trading basis as practically all our other foreign suppliers of goods. This applies both in relation to the tariff and to import licensing, so that Japan, for import licensing purposes, is now treated in the same way as any other non-dollar country for all its trade with Australia. </para>
                    <para>The agreement states that the Australian Government had in mind entering into discussions with the Japanese Government before the end of the first three years of the agreement, with a view to exploring the possibility of, and examining the basis for applying the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade between the two countries. The commitment is no more than this. </para>
                    <para>So far as exports to Australia are concerned, the Japanese Government has agreed that it is important that the export of commodities from Japan shall be conducted in an orderly manner, so as to avoid serious damage to Australian industry. </para>

The Australian Government is not relying entirely on that undertaking; its reserves to itself powers to act. The Japanese Government will use its best endeavours to see that exports from Japan to Australia are conducted in such  a  way as to avoid serious damage to Australian industry. </para>

                            <para>-  If in the opinion of the Australian Government restraint at the Japanese end is ineffective and Japanese goods are causing, or are likely to cause, serious damage, special action may be taken to safeguard Australian industry. I need make no apology for the Australian Government getting the advantage both ways. There is an undertaking by the Japanese Government and a reservation to the Australian Government of power to take effective action in the unlikely event of the Japanese Government not adhering to the agreement. This action may be taken after notice in writing has been given to the Japanese authorities and after an opportunity has been provided to consult as fully as circumstances permit. </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para>In effect, the agreement is so framed that if no other remedy can be found, or if it cannot be found in time, the Government is free to impose special or emergency duties, or to impose special import quotas against Japanese goods. Consultation is required, but in an urgent case there need be no delay. This is understood by both Governments. </para>
                    <para>Before the treaty was signed, Japanese goods were subject to the maximum rates of duty in the Australian tariff. Every foreign country with which Australia has important trade pays what is called the most-favoured-nation rate of duty. This is intermediate between the British rate and the highest rate. In effect, until signature of the agreement, we were treating Japanese goods less favorably than practically any other country. In import licensing we were operating certain measures against Japan that we did not apply against any other country in the world. We discriminated against dollar goods only because the dollar is a hard currency. We discriminated against Japan, a country in the non-dollar trading world, by restricting the proportion of his quota which any importer could spend on Japanese goods. There was no currency justification for this. With respect to a limited number of items which, however, accounted for half our imports from Japan, we placed ceilings on the amount of the quota which any importer could use for Japanese goods. On the other hand, an importer could use his whole quota on imports from any other non-dollar country. </para>
                    <para>On the export side, although Japan was a heavy buyer of our wool and barley, we could make no sales of soft wheat to this market, in the face of the American policy of surplus disposals and tied sales. We had no certainty about the treatment to be accorded to our sugar. The whole position for our exports was uncertain. Our wool was being admitted duty free, but we had good reason to believe that Japan was seriously considering imposing a duty. The total picture from both the Australian and Japanese trade viewpoints was one of uncertainty and unpredictability. </para>
                    <para>As a result of the agreement, each country now gives to the products of the other the same treatment in tariff and licensing matters as it gives to other suppliers. This is what is meant by the term " most favoured nation treatment ", or " m.f.n.". It does not mean that Australia gives Japan any preferred treatment. What it means simply is that any favour or benefit or privilege we give any other foreign country, we must also give Japan. This does not interfere in any way with the preferences we give British goods under our United Kingdom Trade Agreement. </para>
                    <para>This grant of m.f.n. treatment does indeed represent a major step in the light of all the circumstances of Australia's trade relations with Japan. But in taking this step, we were encouraged by the fact that the Japanese Government readily took our point that if we were to give m.f.n. treatment to them, we needed to be sure we were getting most-favoured-nation treatment from them. That is why we have the agreed minutes setting out the position on wool, wheat, barley, sugar and other products. </para>
                    <para>As I have explained, we now have an assurance that 90 per cent, of Japanese exchange allocations for wool will be available for Australian wool, and that there will be no restriction on the exchange allocated, except for balance of payments reasons. This is a real benefit, as we are now fully protected against an arbitrary cut in wool imports directed against Australia alone. </para>

                            <para>-  The honorable senator should listen carefully and all things will become plain to him. That is the most optimistic statement that I have ever made. Moreover, the previous uncertainty about the wool import duty position has been removed. No import duty will be levied on wool for at least the next three years. The fact is that Japan spends about 7 per cent, of her import bill on raw wool. It is about her third biggest import item. If Japan experiences difficulties in her balance of payments or her overseas funds, there is room to save foreign exchange by cutting wool imports. The inducement to save on wool imports is the greater because four-fifths of the production of Japan's wool textile industry goes into local consumption and only one-fifth goes into export. Japan, unlike some other major wool buying countries, can cut wool imports to get quite substantial savings of foreign funds without cutting into her export earnings. Again, we did not wish to maintain a course of policy which would put the Japanese Government in the position where, because of Australia's uncooperative and non-compromising trade attitude, the Japanese Government might come under pressure to facilitate or encourage a switch-over in Japan from natural wool - Australian wool - to synthetic fibres. We have a policy of wool research and wool publicity designed to help wool sustain its place in world trade against synthetic or man-made fibres. It would be foolish to frustrate that by unthinking trade policy. These undertakings on wool are very real commitments. </para>

                    <para>Let me now turn to our second major export commodity - wheat. We are natural suppliers of wheat to Japan. But Japan in post-.war years <inline font-style="italic">has</inline> got her soft wheat from America, through .American surplus disposals .and related transactions. Japan imports .over 7:5,000,0.00 bushels .of wheat a year. In -repent y.ears Australian .exports of wheat to J.apan have not .exceeded about 7,500,000 bushels in any ;one year. That wheat was mostly special grades .of wheat - the higher protein wheats of Queensland and northern New South Wales, which usually command a premium in the market. But of our average quality soft wheat or f.a.q. wheat they bought practically none, although they imported more than 37,000,000 bushels of such wheat from other sources. </para>
                    <para>With the signing of the agreement, we have assurances that we will obtain a fair share of the Japanese market -based on our ability to compete on normal commercial considerations. </para>

                    <para>Because of the importance Australia attached to obtaining an assured competitive outlet in Japan for soft wheat, the agreed minutes specifically state that, should our competitors in the Japanese market resort to transactions not conforming with norma] fair trade or commercial practice, the Japanese Government will take steps to ensure that .our soft wheat is given an equitable share of the Japanese market. Without limiting what this equitable share would be, the agreed minutes specifically record the understanding - completely confirmed in the Minister for Trade's discussions in Japan - of the two governments that it would not be less than 7.000,000 bushels even in the early stages of the agreement, and moreover, that it would have a yearly increasing trend. </para>
                    <para>While the concern of Australia was in respect of f.a.q. or lower-quality wheat. which constitutes the bulk of our crop, the figure .of 7000,j000 bushels and upwards is a -net additional amount ,to .any quantities of -high-protein wheat exported to Japan. On the basis .of past performance, we would have expected to sell about 7,000,000 bushels of this higher protein wheat during the coming year, if it had been available. In these circumstances, the agreement would -have .resulted -in the -sale of not less than 14;000,000 bushels in the first year, with annual increasing .amounts of soft wheat thereafter. </para>
                    <para>The agreement was signed on 6th July last, and already entirely satisfactory arrangements have been made for the purchase of Australian wheat ,by the Japanese F.ood Agency. In the first seven weeks of the currency of &lt;this .agreement, 2,000,000 bushels .of Australian soft wheat have been bought. This is more than had .been purchased throughout the whole of the postwar period. The  chairman  of the Australian Wheat Board, after his recent visit :to Japan, said that, following ,on ,the new trade treaty, Japan could 'buy 18,000,000 bushels of Australian wheat .and could become Australia's second market for wheat. Japan is Australia's -principal export market for barley, but before the agreement was signed we had no assurance that reasonable access would continue. The agreement now gives us a definite guarantee that Japan will safeguard our barley market against unfair trade practices and non-commercial arrangements. </para>
                    <para>Australian sugar has been imported .by Japan, but we had no guarantee that bilateral arrangements made by that country would not force us out of the market. We are now assured that Australian sugar may be imported by Japan up to 40 per cent, of her total sugar imports, despite any arrangements which Japan may have with other supplying countries. The value of this may be gauged from the fact that, whereas over the five years ended 1956-57 we shipped a total of 185,000 tons of sugar, Japan has recently purchased 100,000 tons valued at £6,000,000. We had no assurances that a range of other commodities such as beef tallow, hides, skim milk or dried vine fruits, could secure access to the Japanese market. These commodities will now receive reasonable access to the Japanese market as a matter of contractual right. 1 have already spoken of the basis on which Australia admitted Japanese goods before the treaty was signed. Japan had no rights in tariff or -import -licensing matters in her trade with Australia, and of course we had no rights in our trade with Japan. Under the treaty, Australia undertakes that Japanese goods will receive normal nondiscriminatory treatment, both in tariffs and in import licensing. What the treaty does is to give an Australian importer the right to use his import quota for goods from Japan to exactly the same extent that he is free to use this quota to buy goods from any other non-dollar country. The Japanese have no rights to send goods to Australia. The only right is that an Australian importer may now buy from Japan up to the level of his total quota if he wishes to do so. </para>
                    <para>A point that should be emphasized is that, if our balance of payments position should deteriorate, we are perfectly free, under the agreement, to restrict imports from Japan more than we are now doing. Similarly, if the Japanese yen should become a hard currency, we would be free to discriminate against Japanese goods as we do against dollar goods. Similarly, Japan may reduce her imports of Australian wool or other goods, but only to the extent that her balance of payments position requires, and provided she treats other countries no better. </para>

                            <para>- I know of no formula. The honorable senator will remember that there is a specific provision in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade which gives to nations the right to make restrictions and to do things to protect the balance of payments position. Speaking from memory, I think there is a right of appeal from Gatt to the International Monetary Fund if the other trading nations that are members of Gatt think the provision is being used unfairly. </para>

                    <para>No government can surrender its right to control imports when this is made necessary by its overseas financial position, and this right to control imports must include the right to restrict imports more severely from hard currency countries than from soft currency countries. Accordingly, in this treaty, as in the .multilateral General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, provision is made for this. So far as Gatt is concerned, Australia undertakes to explore, within three years, the possibility of the application of Gatt and to examine the possible basis of application. Nothing in the whole treaty, however, in any way affects Australia's rights to continue to withhold the application of Gatt to trade between the two countries. </para>
                    <para>Why did the Government negotiate this agreement? All our other major trading partners are committed to observe certain trade rules towards Australia through Gatt. However, since we have not agreed to apply Gatt between Japan and Australia, there is no commitment under Gatt to prevent Japan taking discriminatory action against our goods. Before the present agreement, there was no other contract in existence to prevent such action. Thus we were vulnerable to changes in Japanese import policy on .our major export products. </para>
                    <para>Japan has bought £425,000,000 worth of goods from Australia over the past five years. Australia in return has bought about £65,000,000 worth from Japan - a ratio in Australia's favour of more than 6 to 1 . In fact, because of our import restrictions and because of our specially severe restrictions against Japan alone, imports from Japan were only £A.l 2,900,000 in the trading year ended 30th June last. In the same year, our exports to Japan were worth £139,000,000, so the ratio in our favour this last year was about 11 to 1. </para>
                    <para>A great disparity in bilateral trading is naturally emphasized if it is accompanied by one-sided discrimination in import treatment, and there will be a great inducement to discriminate in return in order to help balance the trade - to balance it at a lower level. The provocation for and possibility of retaliation has now been removed, and we have secured specific and tangible benefits under this new agreement. The Government's attitude was that it was not enough to look at this problem from the narrow point of view which would merely seek to maintain the existing position by a few concessions in the hope of preventing a rupture in our trade relations with Japan. Whilst there were some arguments for this course, the Government took the view that, in the interests of the Australian economy as a whole, we had to seek positive and tangible concessions. </para>
                    <para>We need all the export earnings we can get if we are to fight our way clear of import restrictions. If we have not the overseas funds, we cannot finance all the imports we need for our industrialization, for our development, or for our high overall standard of living. </para>
                    <para>A great part of our manufacturing industry is dependent on imports. The factories need imported goods for processing; they need plant and equipment; they need motor vehicles and petrol, and so on. But all these imports have to be paid for out of our export earnings. They cannot be bought in any other way. Pre-war, we did in fact finance a lot of imports through loans from overseas. Funds from this source are now a mere trickle. So the manufacturing industry of Australia, and all. the workers in industry, are dependent on a high level of export earnings. The United Kingdom is no longer the certain source of loans that she was pre-war. </para>

                            <para>-  We are giving her the preferences she has enjoyed for many years under the Ottawa Agreement and is now obtaining under the new United Kingdom - Australia Trade Agreement. The agreement with Japan will not, in any way, lower the level of preferences that stand now in the United Kingdom's favour. I repeat that the United Kingdom is no longer the certain source of loans that she was pre-war. That is one reason why we have to do all in our power to increase and stabilize our export earnings. We need as much export income as we can get, and we need it on as stable a basis as we can contrive, in order that we may keep industrial activity at a high level, eliminate import restrictions, and keep up our development programme and maintain our prosperity. In short, the trade reasons for an agreement with Japan are - </para>

                    <para class="block">These are the reasons why the Government negotiated this agreement. A critical aspect of the operation of the agreement will be the safeguards, or provisions for emergency action. I have already briefly mentioned the safeguarding arrangements which are available to protect Australian industry from serious damage under the agreement, but I invite careful attention to them. </para>
                    <para>Firstly, the Japanese Government recognizes the importance of export from Japan being conducted in an orderly manner so as to avoid serious damage to Australian industry, and will use its best endeavours to see that export is restrained so as to avoid such damage. </para>

                    <para>However, if this arrangement at the export end proves ineffective, the Australian Government, in effect, retains the right to act at the import end. It may impose either special duties or special import quotas to safeguard any Australian industry from serious damage. This is the case because Article V. acknowledges the right of the Government to suspend its obligations under the agreement in order to prevent serious injury to Australian industry. </para>
                    <para>The procedures provide for consultation with the Japanese Government if emergency action is contemplated by the Australian Government. In this way, it may be possible to avoid action under the escape clauses. However, consultation does not mean delay if urgent action is necessary. The Japanese Government understands this. </para>
                    <para>In considering any action under the escape clauses of the agreement, we must, however, remember that it is essential to operate it in good faith. The Government is not prepared to prejudice its standing in this respect, for irresponsible use of the escape clauses could bring to nought all the good which we hope will stem from this treaty. The Japanese are aware that the treaty will not last if our markets are flooded by their goods. On the other hand, if we were to operate the treaty in a selfish manner, so that we get all the benefits and erect obstacles to the power of Japan to trade with us, the treaty will not last, and we will be the losers. We must seek a mutually satisfactory operation of the agreement. There can be no authentic definition of satisfaction in these circumstances, but there must be a clear assessment of the consequences if we provoke the abrogation of the agreement on behalf of our own sectional interests. </para>
                    <para>Some Australian manufacturers have expressed fears that the Australian market will be flooded with cheap Japanese goods. In many cases these fears have been based on completely inaccurate information. </para>

The Minister for Trade has offered to arrange for continuing discussions between senior officers of his department and each industry group, preferably with representatives of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures present. I am confident such discussions will contribute greatly to the successful operation of the agreement. </para>

Safeguards are provided for Australian industry against a damaging influx of imports.
