                        <para>- My question to the Minister for National Development concerns a statement that he is reported in the press to have made to the effect that he had complained about the lack of finance that had been provided by the private "banks for home-building. In view of that comment by the Minister, will the Government consider increasing the allocation -of money ito the 'States for home-building, and {particularly to New South Wales? I believe that . the New South Wales Government could double the number of homes that are being built with its assistance in that State if .it could obtain more finance from the Commonwealth Government. </para>

                        <para>-  It is a fact that I made a speech in which I set out the progress that the Commonwealth Government had made in overcoming the housing shortage. In the course of that speech, I advanced some constructive ideas on ways in which more could be done to -encourage home-building, -and I said that I 'believed more money could have been made available by the banks for the construction of houses. However, I made a .'number of other statements which were much more important. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>For example, I said that this year 'the Commonwealth Government had made available for housing a record amount of £77,000i000. I also said that 'no solution to the (housing problem could be 'found along the lines that Senator Ashley has advocated which  i  entail 'more and .more money being found :by if he iCoirrmonwealth Government ;because, rhaving 'regard to the present state of the loan market, the provision of more money by the Commonwealth Government could mean only more taxation. What the honorable senator is advocating, in effect, is a substantial increase in taxes. The total expenditure on housing last year was £237,000,000 and if this Government is to find the difference between £237,000,000 and the £77,000,000 that it is already providing for housing, there is a problem ahead of us. </para>
                    <para>During the speech to which I have referred, I said that building societies were doing a very ,good job, but I .thought that they could make much more effective use of the money that was made available to them. I said that I believed it would be a good thing if the building societies received more support from institutions which have money to lend, and I referred in particular to insurance companies. I made some comment about building societies. I said that the societies were not doing enough to encourage thrift and savings schemes, and were not .directing enough funds of .thenown .to use for housing. All in all, I .made, in .a minor way, what i ;the.ught was a constructive approach to overcoming and reducing the (housing shortage - despite, &gt;I should add, the excellent -.progress we are making .at the present .time. </para>

                        <para>- I address a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate relating to an article appearing in to-day's " Sydney Morning Herald " in which it is -stated that the Australian Academy of Science has told the Government that the development of Australia will be tragically hindered and our standard of living lowered unless drastic measures are taken to train more scientists and technologists. I ask the Minister whether it is a fact that conditions of employment for scientists and technologists in Britain and America are more attractive than those prevailing in Australia. If they are more attractive, can the Minister assure me that the whole urgent question df remuneration and conditions will be carefully examined so that in 'future more 'of our university students will be encouraged to ienter this 1ield of work and make it 'their career? </para>

                        <para>-  I did read  recently  that the percentage of students engaged in scientific studies in Australia is lower than in America and the United Kingdom. I understand also that the relative rate of pay is not so attractive here as it is in those other countries. In respect of this matter, the powers and resources of the Commonwealth are very limited, and it is giving the Commonwealth a great deal of concern. The honorable senator may rest assured that, within its limited powers, the Commonwealth Government will do all that it can to encourage more students  to  enter those realms  of  study referred  to  by him. </para>

                        <para>-  The principle we adopt is that if suitably equivalent goods are not reasonably available, firstly, in Australia, or, secondly, from the United Kingdom, they may be admitted under by-law. For instance, if by-law entry is requested in respect of goods from America, the department makes investigations to see whether equivalent goods are available here. If they are available in Australia, no by-law admission is given. If they are not available in Australia, but are available from the United Kingdom, then they may be admitted at the concessional rate of 74 per cent. </para>

                        <para>-  My question is directed to the Leader of the Government. The Commonwealth Government has refused the Queensland Government's request for drought relief, on a £l-for-£l basis, of subsidy up to £250,000 for each government, on the ground that the Commonwealth considers drought relief to be a State matter, covered by the tax reimbursement grant. In view of this I ask the following questions: - 1. Has the Commonwealth, at any previous time, assisted in drought relief? 2. How is drought relief provided for in the tax reimbursement to the States, having in mind the fact that when the tax reimbursement calculation is made a serious state of drought might not exist in a State? 3. As such relief in Queensland would help to preserve a national asset in that sheep or cattle saved would continue to earn badly needed overseas income, and result in the collection of additional income tax, considering the matter on a broad national basis, would it not be an advantage to save as much stock as possible? 4. Does the Commonwealth Government consider it wise to stand idly by and lose stock which might take years to replace, when a comparatively small subsidy would do much to preserve some of our best national assets?  5.  Is the Government aware that, despite some storm rains, a considerable portion of Queensland's beef and wool-growing areas is still badly drought-stricken?  6.  Would the Government be prepared to reconsider the matter of drought relief for Queensland? </para>

                        <para>- I am sure that the honorable senator would not expect me to answer all his questions offhand, but I understand, as a matter of practice, that never in the history of Commonwealth relief to States has drought been put in the same category as flooding, bushfires and other calamitous happenings which can be very specifically located. After all, there are droughts and droughts. Some are of greater severity than others, and cause greater distress than others. People in business have a greater degree of prosperity in some years than in others. Similarly, they have years of very poor return. That is a circumstance which applies, unfortunately, to people engaged in rural pursuits. I suggest that the honorable senator place the other questions on the notice-paper. I should like to finish by saying that apparently it has never been the practice of any Commonwealth Government to render assistance to the States in cases of drought. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate and Attorney-General whether he recalls that during the debate on the  1956-57  Estimates I queried the very small amount set aside by this Government for civil defence. Does he also recollect that in the debate on the  1957-58  Estimates I raised the matter again and dealt more fully with the neglect of civil defence, and the lack of a Commonwealth Government policy? Is he aware that the Minister who handled the Estimates informed the Senate that civil defence was not a responsibility of the Commonwealth Government, indicated that there were constitutional difficulties in the way of the Commonwealth entering into the field, and stated that the matter was the responsibility of the States? I now ask him, as the Attorney-General: Will he provide a clear definition of whether the Commonwealth Government is barred constitutionally from setting up, and making provision for expenditure upon, the civil defence of this country? Further, is he aware that the State Premiers, having attended a conference on civil defence at Mount Macedon, are now considering what they can do in the matter, but find that the field is severely restricted because they have not the requisite finance, and the Commonwealth has not stated whether it is prepared to enter fully into the provision of moneys for the civil defence of the people of this country? </para>

However, I shall have examined the constitutional limits or restrictions imposed upon the Commonwealth Government in this matter and I shall let the honorable senator know our views. </para>

The Senate can rest assured that anything I can do to remove a hindrance, if it exists, will in fact be done. Year by year, the Commonwealth Railways have provided extra rolling-stock to meet the Christmas demand and have run as many trains as it was possible to run. I understand that similar arrangements will be made this year. </para>

We cannot provide taxation incentives in- all directions', because, after all, some one- has to pay income tax in order to provide revenue for the purposes of government. </para>

The question of freight on wheat to: be transported from Western Australia to the eastern- States- is1 currently receiving- consideration by the- Government which announced, only last week, that it: did not believe that the Commonwealth should be responsible to pay. the freight: involved. I understand that both the New South Walesand.' Queensland.' Governments  are - to make representations for the matter- to be reconsidered. In due time, an announcement, will be made: as to the fate of- these - new representations. </para>

                        <para>The issue of departmental publications is coordinated through the Treasury Publications Committee, to which the various departments are required to submit proposals for publications, for the express purpose of avoiding duplication and unnecessary expenditure. It is not envisaged that the proposed booklet being prepared by the Department of Immigration for distribution to immigrants will duplicate the booklet "The Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia ". </para>
                        <para>The proposed immigration booklet, to be entitled " How Australia is Governed ", is intended to contain information of a comprehensive nature on government at Federal, State and local levels, including a brief outline of the history of self-government and federation. The information in this booklet relating to the Federal Parliament is necessarily not as detailed as that contained in the booklet dealing solely with the Federal Parliament, but will be sufficient adequately to inform newly naturalized persons of the functions of the Federal Parliament. - More* over, it is desirable that booklets prepared for immigrant readers should be written in a specialized simple form that will be more readily understood by them than a booklet intended primarily for general distribution. It will be seen, therefore, that the objectives and scope of the two booklets are separate, but in any event the proposed immigration booklet will be submitted to the Treasury Publications Committee for approval. </para>

                            <para>The Commonwealth Government has not formulated a scheme for dairy-farm improvement in Western Australia as production problems constitutionally lie within the responsibility of State governments.

The Commonwealth is at present investigating the proposal and examining the request for Commonwealth financial participation. </para>

Other proposals which are currently under consideration relate to the provision of a permanent source of funds for research and sales promotion. These proposals will be aimed at reducing costs of, and stimulating local and overseas demand for, dairy products. It is my intention to introduce legislation to cover these proposals as soon as practicable. </para>

An Indonesian prau was in fact intercepted by a privately owned ship near Mclntyre Island on the north-west coast, where it was engaged in trochus shelling. The vessel was taken in custody to Derby where the master was charged under a Western Australian Act with fishing without a licence and using an unlicensed vessel.

Its effect was that he did not believe that imposition of the capitation tax would affect the happy relations between the Administration and the people, but that care would be needed in administration of the tax to ensure that the machinery for exemption or reduction should be used with sympathy, and that imprisonment should only be used for the most flagrant of offenders. </para>

In addition, the ordinance requires that workers be provided with accommodation, medical attention, food, clothing, cooking utensils and other items, together with rations and other items for the worker's family if accompanying him to his place of employment, and fares to and from the place of employment. Wages for skilled workers much exceed this minimum wage and range up to an average monthly wage of more than £13 in some occupations. The Personal Tax Ordinance 1957 provides that the AdministratorinCouncil may exempt areas and determine lower rates in specified areas, and that any person asssescd for personal tax may appeal to the appropriate tribunal for reduction or remission of tax on the ground of hardship. It is not considered that this tax will impose unreasonable hardship. </para>

                            <para>It has not yet been possible to complete the distribution of the Joint Organization profits. Australia's total share of the Joint Organization profits amounted to approximately £93,000,000 and it was decided to distribute these profits to growers. The distribution of the profits, which was entrusted to the Australian Wool Realization Commission, was commenced in 1949, and by now all the profits with the exception of about £2,500,000 have been distributed. The outstanding moneys are comprised mainly of the profits on wool submitted by growers for war-time appraisement through dealers. The distribution of these moneys was held up until recently by protracted litigation known as the Poulton case. Owing to the delay caused by the Poulton litigation, it has not been possible to distribute the profits before the expiration of the period permitted under the Wool Realization (Distribution of Profits) Act 1948-1955. Accordingly, it will be necessary to amend the act extending  the  period so as to permit the distribution of  the  profits as far as possible. It is proposed to have the necessary amendment passed during the current session of Parliament, in which  the  period will be extended until 30th June, 1959, or such earlier date as may be determined. Profits that  the commission is unable to distribute at the finally determined date will be paid into the Wool Research Trust Fund and will be used for the, benefit of the wool-growing industry generally. </para>

                        <para>The Bring-out-a-Briton campaign was designed to afford to individuals and organizations anxious to increase the intake of British migrants an opportunity of assisting to give practical effect to their expressed desire for more British migrants. The campaign has a number of objectives, of which the two principal are - (a) By publicity and by dissemination of information of how to proceed, to increase the number of personal nominations under the assisted passage scheme being submitted by Australian residents in favour of relatives and friends in the United Kingdom; and (b) by enlisting community co-operation in seeking out employment opportunities and suitable accommodation to arrange the movement of British migrants who would not otherwise be able to obtain sponsors or qualify on occupational grounds for selection as assisted passage migrants. </para>
                        <para>The first part of the campaign is having remarkably good success. Personal nominations, i.e. sponsorship by persons in Australia of particular persons known to them in the United kingdom, have increased by more than 50 per cent, in the ten months of 1957 compared with the same period of 1956. The figures are - </para>

In view of this increase, I have taken steps to ensure that there is shipping space available to carry these very desirable migrants to Australia by entering into a long-term arrangement for the use of two ships of an Italian shipping line to supplement the normal British commercial berths available to us for the carriage of British migrants. </para>
                    <para>The second aspect of the campaign has been slower in development because of the time it has taken to establish a network of 180 BringoutaBriton committees throughout Australia. Nevertheless, 120 families, involving 435 people, have come to Australia under this arrangement. Approximately a further 40 vacancies have been notified to the London office of the Department of Immigration and it is expected that families will embark in the near future to fill these vacancies. </para>

                        <para>Although Australian citizens do not require passports for travel to New Zealand, the New Zealand authorities do, as a rule, require naturalized Australian citizens to obtain a permit to enter New Zealand before they embark for that country. </para>
                        <para>The honorable senator will realize that the conditions which are imposed for the entry of different classes of persons to New Zealand are for the New Zealand authorities to decide and the Australian Government has no control over them. Nevertheless, in view of this Government's earnest desire to ensure that there should be no discrimination against naturalized Australians in this matter, repeated representations have been made to the New Zealand authorities in an endeavour to have the distinction between naturalized Australians and others removed. </para>
                        <para>On Tuesday, 29th October, the Minister foi Immigration in New Zealand announced that the New Zealand authorities had now decided that naturalized Australian citizens will be exempt from the need to obtain entry permits for visits to New Zealand of less than three months duration. Although this decision does not give naturalized Australians the full recognition by New Zealand that we were seeking, it represents a step towards that goal. </para>

Although limited facilities do exist at present in some departments, will the Government examine the possibility of granting to all technicians in its employ who have successfully passed their highest departmental examinations some form of educational scholarship or bursary to enable them to complete their engineering or science degree at a university on the condition that they promise to remain in Commonwealth employment for at least five years after qualifying? </para>

                    <para class="block">The sole purpose of this bill is to raise the amount of the statutory exemption from payroll tax from the present figure of £6,240 per annum to £10,400 per annum. In future, only those employers who pay wages in excess of £866 13s. 4d. a month will be  liable for tax, whereas tax was previouslypayable by employers whose pay-rolls exceeded £520 a month. Under the proposal, the increased exemption applies in respect of wages paid or payable on or after 1st September, 1957. It is therefore applicable for the first time in pay-roll tax returns lodged in October in respect of September wages. </para>
                    <para>The measure will relieve approximately 16,000 employers from liability to pay-roll tax, whilst those employers who remain liable to pay the tax will receive a greater margin of exemption. The latter are required to pay tax only on the amounts by which their pay-rolls exceed the statutory exemption. The increase in exemption will involve an annual loss of revenue of £2,750,000 or £2,000,000 in the current financial year. 1 commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">It is intended by this bill to give effect to the income tax proposals outlined in the course of presentation of the 1957-58 Budget. Each of the proposals - the substance of which I shall indicate - is of importance and serves to evidence once again the Government's policy of taxation reduction according to prevailing economic conditions. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed under the heading, Allowances for Dependants, to liberalize still further the scale of concessional deductions allowable in respect of dependants generally. Honorable senators do not need to be reminded that since taking office the present Government has taken very tangible steps to ensure that the taxpayer with family and other domestic responsibilities is called upon to bear only his fair share of the burden of income taxation. </para>
                    <para>Consistent with this policy, the bill proposes a general increase of £13 throughout the scale of income tax deductions allowable for those dependants presently specified in the Income Tax Assessment Act. By way of example, the existing deduction of £130 for a dependent spouse will be increased to £143, while in the case of a daughter-housekeeper, or housekeeper having the care of children under sixteen years of age, the present deductions of £130 in each case will likewise be raised to £143. As I have explained, the increased deduction of £13 will be general and will therefore apply in respect of the different amounts allowed for dependent student and other children, invalid relatives and parents of the taxpayer also. </para>
                    <para>Opportunity is also being taken to include parents-in-law within the field of dependants in respect of whom income tax deductions are allowable. Accordingly, it is proposed that a concessional deduction of £143 be allowed in respect of a dependent parentinlaw, as is the case with dependent parents of the taxpayer. Additionally, the bill provides for the inclusion of adopted and other children within the class of dependants in respect of whom a taxpayer is entitled to a deduction for life insurance premium, sick and accident insurance, payments to superannuation funds and the like. At present, these deductions are allowable only if a taxpayer makes such payments for the benefit of his own children. </para>
                    <para>Further important features of this bill are the proposals relating to depreciation allowances which follow the Government's adoption of certain recommendations of the Commonwealth Committee on Rates of Depreciation. As the income tax law stands at present, a taxpayer who owns and uses depreciable assets for the purpose of producing assessable income is entitled to an annual deduction for depreciation calculated by one or other of two methods - the diminishing value method, or, where he so elects, the prime cost method. </para>
                    <para>Tn short, the diminishing value method - after the first year's depreciation has been determined by reference to the cost of the asset - requires that annually thereafter the fixed percentage rate of depreciation be taken upon a reducing balance, that is, the depreciated value at the beginning of each year of income. On the other hand, the prime cost method, as its name implies, involves calculation of the annual depreciation allowance by fixed instalments, arrived at simply by dividing the cost of the depreciable asset by the percentage rate at which depreciation is allowable. </para>
                    <para>It is generally accepted, however, that as long as the same percentage rate of depreciation is applied under both methods, as is the case at present, the diminishing value method does not give an equitable allowance over the estimated effective life of the asset as compared with the prime cost method. Indeed, the diminishing value method does not result in the cost of the asset being completely written off until it is finally scrapped or sold. The committee recommended that the two systems of calculation should be brought more into line for taxation purposes by the adoption of a 50 per cent, increase in the rates of depreciation where the diminishing value method is employed. The bill incorporates provisions to give effect to the committee's recommendation. The increased rates are to apply to assets on hand at 1st July, 1957, as well as to assets purchased after that date. Concurrently with the increase of 50 per cent, in the depreciation rates where the diminishing value method is used, taxpayers are being afforded several choices as to the basis on which depreciation is to be calculated. Broadly, either method may be chosen for plant on hand at 1st July, 1957, and future purchases. Alternatively, one method may be used for plant on hand at 1st July, 1957, and the other for plant subsequently acquired. </para>
                    <para>Another of the committee's recommendations being adopted relates to depreciation balancing adjustments. It occurs not infrequently that plant is sold at a price higher than its written-down value for income tax purposes. In such cases, the amount of excess depreciation, commonly called the balancing adjustment, is brought back into the assessable income of the year in which the plant is sold. As depreciation may have been deducted in several preceding years, there may be some inequity in the taxation of the balancing adjustment as income of one year. </para>
                    <para>The committee recommended that, in lieu of assessment in the year of receipt, the taxpayer should, if he so desires, have the right to set off the balancing adjustment against the value of other assets subject to depreciation. Honorable senators will recognize this principle as having been introduced last year in connexion with the assessment of insurance and other recoveries on the loss or destruction of depreciable assets. In effect, the taxpayer is given the choice between paying taxation on the balancing adjustment, or having his depreciation allowances reduced by an equivalent amount. </para>
                    <para>The proposals 1 have just mentioned are intended to apply to the income year commencing 1st July, 1957, and subsequent income years. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed that income derived on and from 1st July, 1956, by residents of Nauru from sources within the island, shall be exempt from income tax. Residents of Nauru will thus be afforded similar exemption to that which has applied for many years to residents of the Territories of Papua, New Guinea and Norfolk Island in respect of income derived by them from sources in those Territories. </para>
                    <para>The list of specified funds and institutions gifts to which constitute allowable deductions is being enlarged to include the following: - The National Trust in each of. the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia; public libraries, museums and art galleries; the Sydney Opera House Appeal Fund; the Sidney Myer Music Bowl Trust; and the Industrial Design Council of Australia. Gifts of £1 and upwards made to these funds and institutions on and after 1st July, 1957, will be allowable deductions. </para>
                    <para>I have given in brief the substance of the proposals contained in this bill. Several are necessarily of a complex nature, and an explanation of these and the other provisions of the bill will be found in greater detail in the explanatory notes already circulated. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill also gives effect to those proposals in the recent Budget which relate to estate duty. Clause 4 of the bill has been designed with the object of ensuring that property which passes to an adopted child, stepchild or ex-nuptial child of a deceased person will bear no greater burden of duty than property which passes to a child of the marriage of a deceased person. A similar proposal is contained in measures relating to income tax and gift duty. </para>
                    <para>Those provisions in the Estate Duty Assessment Act which provide for the exemption of property passing for certain purposes or to certain institutions and organizations will be, by clause 5 of this bill, extended so as to exempt bequests, devises and gifts to public libraries, nonprofit hospitals, the Australian Council for Educational Research and the National Trusts in each of the States of New South Wales, Victoria and South Australia. </para>
                    <para>I turn now to clause 6 of the bill by which it is proposed to insert in the Estate Duty Assessment Act a new section designed to allow a rebate of duty in those cases in which a person inherits property and dies within five years of the person from whom it was inherited. Such cases have come to be known as quick successions and it has been recognized in most of the Australian States and in several overseas countries that if duty is thus paid twice within a few years, some relief is then justified. </para>
                    <para>After a close examination of the systems which have been evolved both in Australia and overseas, the Government believes that the proposed basis of quick succession relief will reflect the best features of comparable legislation whilst reducing the complications of practical operation to a mini mum. Broadly, the proposed relief will operate where the dutiable value of aft estate or a part thereof becomes subject to duty on two occasions within a period of five years. The lower of the rates of &lt;hity payable on each occasion will be applied to the value which has borne duty twice. The amount thus calculated will form the basis of the relief. If not more than one year elapses between the two deaths, then 50 per cent, of that calculated amount will be rebated. The percentage will be reduced as the interval between the deaths increases, so that it will be 40 per cent, in the second year and will further reduce, in proportion, until it is 10 per cent, in the fifth year. </para>
                    <para>I have arranged for notes prepared by my colleague, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden),</inline> to be circulated for the information of honorable senators. These notes explain in greater detail the technical features both of the proposed quick succession relief and of the other amendments proposed in this bill. The amendments effected by this bill will apply to the estates of persons dying on or after the date on which the bill receives the Royal Assent. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

                    <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to authorize the payment to the States in 1957-58 of a special financial assistance grant of approximately £23,800,000. The grant is to supplement the amount payable under the formula embodied in the State Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Act 1946-48. </para>
                    <para>In each of the last eight years the Commonwealth has supplemented the amounts payable to the States under the tax reimbursement formula. Last year, the formula grant amount to £154,645,000. In addition, the States received a special financial assistance grant of £19,405,000, which included a special allocation of £1,050,000 to Victoria. The total of the tax reimbursement and special financial assistance grants for 1956-57 was, therefore, £174,050,000. </para>
                    <para>The precise amount payable in 1957-58 under the tax reimbursement formula will not be known until the Commonwealth Statistician completes his calculations later in the year. It is estimated, however, thai the formula grant will amount this year to about £166,200,000. Unless, therefore, the Commonwealth makes a supplementary payment again this year, the States would receive about £7,850,000 less than the total tax reimbursement grant which they received last year. </para>
                    <para>This matter was discussed at a meeting of Commonwealth and State Ministers in Canberra last May. At that meeting the Commonwealth offered to make a supplementary grant sufficient to bring the total amount available for distribution among the States in 1957-58 to £190,000,000. This is almost £16.000,000 more than the total of of last year's grants. As the amount payable under, the formula is estimated at £166,200,000 this offer involves the payment of a supplementary grant of about £23,800,000. This grant is to be distributed among the States in the same way as the tax reimbursement formula grant which, for the first time, will be distributed entirely on an adjusted population basis. </para>

                        <para>. - I shall take the unusual course of speaking on the motion for the first reading of a bill of this nature, and as it is a bill that the Senate may not amend, I am free to speak of matters both relevant and non-relevant. Speaking first of non-relevant matters, I should like to thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> all honorable senators, the officers of this chamber, and the staff for their kindly inquiries and good wishes during my recent temporary incapacity. I appreciated them very much. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>Now, leaving that note, I come at once to the subject that has inspired me to rise, and that is the very important question of the defences of Australia. I was disappointed to find that the application of the " guillotine " had permitted no adequate discussion of those defences during the recent debate on the Appropriation Bill 1957-58. Both for that reason, and because of a very violent attack that has been launched against the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> recently, in relation to his defence policy, and on the Government generally as to the operation of that policy, I think it fitting that I should put the subject of the nation's defences on the beam once more. </para>
                    <para>It is not necessary for me to go back very far. I should like to lay a broad foundation by pointing out that this Government, while it has been in office, has been granted all the money that it has sought for defence - during the period, approximately £1,400,000,000, running very roughly at the rate of some £200,000,000 per annum. Up till quite recently there have been seven Ministers concerned with the defence services and the various defence activities. In the last twelve months or so, that number has been reduced to six by the amalgamation of two departments. </para>
                    <para>The next point is that back in 1951 - on 7th March, to be precise, the Prime Minister indicated to the nation that Australia had three years to be ready for war. That meant that there was an imminent danger of war and the country had to gird its loins and get the whole of its defences into order. As to the performance that followed that call to the nation, I have only to indicate that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden, the former Secretary of the Department  of  Defence, indicated to the Public Accounts Committee in August of last year that, at the end of the three years, the nation was not ready for mobilization, nor was it ready at the time he spoke. It was that pronouncement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden that triggered-off a great deal of criticism  of  the Government and investigation of its defence activities or, more correctly, its lack of them. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister, stung into action at that time by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick's</inline> disclosure, stated on 2nd October last year that the defences of the nation in peace-time were never in better shape. Then, to the amazement of everybody, only two days later - on 4th October - he indicated that the Government would undertake a complete review of the defence programme of the nation from top to bottom. Well, it took a long time for that review to take place, and it was not until April of this year that the Government's new outlook in defence was presented to the Parliament. I am certain that I do not over-state the position when I claim that that statement shocked this nation. It disclosed, on the face of it, an utter lack of preparedness on the part of Australia, the inadequacy of our equipment and the paucity of our defence personnel. </para>
                    <para>If one wants to prove the abject failure of the Government's seven or eight years' effort, one does not need to make any other case than to look at, and quote from, the Prime Minister's own speech in April last. I think it is important to remind the Senate that he indicated, as regards the Navy, that there was a shortage of ships of the appropriate kind. After eight years of his Government's rule and after all the money it sought had been made available, there was a shortage of ships of the appropriate kind! That was not the Opposition's condemnation of the Government, but the Prime Minister's own admission of the fault and failing of the Government. </para>
                    <para>The Citizen Military Force was, according to the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer),</inline> to be re-organized; some units were to be disbanded. Everybody recognizes the vast importance of the C.M.F. as the reservoir upon which the nation must draw in expanding its defence forces in time of war or approaching danger, yet that great reservoir is to be dried up! Apparently, recruitment, it is admitted, had dried up. There had been a great incursion of national service trainees to the C.M.F. and that, probably, was a factor that militated against defence training and disheartened those very good people in the community who were concerned to make some contribution in a personal way to the defences of their country. </para>
                    <para>Again referring to the Prime Minister's April statement, I find that he announced - it was a shock to the Parliament and the nation - that the national service training scheme that had been running for some six years was to be completely discontinued for the Air Force and the Navy, it having then, as he indicated, no military value to  eithcE  of those, services. Now, it took six years and the expenditure of a vast sum of money to determine that. One has only to recount that fact to state a damning indictment of the Government. A training scheme applying to all major services was allowed to run for six years, and it took the whole six years to find out that it was completely useless from a military viewpoint. It surprised me that the Prime Minister was ever prepared to make such a damning admission. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the Army, the annual intake of national service trainees was cut by almost two-thirds - from 29,000 to merely 12,000. Again, it took six years to reach a decision on that matter. There has been a waste of man-power and a waste of money. In the circumstances, the Government might well have discontinued national service training for the Army altogether,' but it has kept that token intake of about 12,000 a year. </para>
                    <para>One of the highlights of the April statement of the Prime Minister was the announcement of a proposed new brigade field force of some 4,000 men, to be equipped with the very latest type of weapons, to be completely mobile and able to move at an instant to any point of danger. The Government had to find the men for that force. It had some 21,000 men in the Regular Army, the great majority of whom were employed in caring for the Citizen Military Forces and the national service trainees, or employed in what I might term administrative base jobs. Of this force of 4,000 men, 2,000 had to be found from men who were training national service trainees. If the national service training scheme had not been curtailed considerably, it would have been impossible for the Government to find one-half of the force oi 4,000 men that the Prime Minister proposed should be established. I invite the Senate to consider the position after eight years' effort on the part of this Government. We did not have sufficient men available to make up one brigade group. The Prime Minister told the people of Australia in 1949 that the minimum force would be two brigade groups. The mountain laboured for eight years, but did not produce even one. </para>

                            <para>-  Not even a mouse. There were not enough men to form one brigade group. The Prime Minister has claimed that this force now is up to, I think, 94 per cent, of its proposed strength, but one-half of the men who constitute it would not have been there unless national service training had been, in effect, discontinued. Could anything indicate better just how slender are the real defences of this nation? </para>

                    <para>I now turn to the Royal Australian Air Force. This is probably one of the saddest stories of the lot - the one indicating the greatest dithering, the greatest procrastination and the greatest incompetence. The Prime Minister, in his April statement, indicated that it was necessary to re-equip the R.A.A.F. with new fighter and new transport aircraft. After eight years, when we might have expected the Prime Minister of this country to come to the Parliament and proudly recount all that had been achieved, we were told that the Air Force was to be completely re-equipped with supersonic fighters and other new types of aircraft. We were shocked to find that we lacked such aircraft. </para>

                            <para>-  I make that statement. The honorable senator can deal with it presently, if he so wishes. The Prime Minister went further and indicated the very type of fighter aircraft required by the R.A.A.F. It was the new Lockheed Starfighter, the FI 04, which was being produced by America. Within a few days, the Minister for Defence Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beale)</inline> stated that we would manufacture that type of aircraft in Australia and that it would be a noteworthy contribution to the Australian aircraft production industry. There is no doubt about those two statements. That was the type of aircraft selected by the Government after years of examination. After officials had travelled the length and breadth of the world looking at every type of aircraft, the Starfighter was chosen. That decision was a matter of mature consideration, one would say. </para>

                            <para>-  It is true that other types of aircraft had been supplied to the R.A.A.F. during that time - the Avon Sabre, for instance - but it is clear from what the Prime Minister said that the R.A.A.F. lacked the latest and the best types of aircraft, and that it was only then that the Government was about to proceed to get them. What happened? The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Philip McBride)</inline> went to America to arrange for the production of the Starfighters in Australia and, it may be, to buy some. What was the amazing result of his visit? The Prime Minister made another statement in September last, in which he indicated that this type of aircraft, which had been selected with such care, after such expensive trips round the world and after such deliberation, was of no use to Australia at all. He said that we were not going to have the Starfighter, nor were we going to make it here. He staggered this country when he announced that the Starfighter project was not to be proceeded with. Referring to the visit overseas of the Minister for Defence, he said, discussing the Starfighter - </para>

                    <para>The first was that it has developed as a highly specialized machine to cope with the most modern of high-level attacking bombers and that it is in no sense an all-purpose fighter. </para>

                    <para>Its use would involve a literally tremendous refinement and expansion of electronic ground controls, at present, and in the foreseeable future, far beyond our own capacity. </para>
                    <para class="block">Let me take the first of the two reasons. Why was it not discovered until after the Minister for Defence had arrived in America that the Starfighter was of that type, and was of no use to Australia? The Starfighter was not unknown. It was not a recent development. Its genesis was in 1951. It was flying in 1954. It had had nearly three years of flying operations, and had been in quantity production in the U.S.A. When our Minister and officers went abroad, did they go with their eyes and ears shut? Why did they not know what the Starfighter was like? After it had been decided that we should have a supersonic fighter, they had to go to America to find out that this type of aircraft was of no use to us at all. </para>

                            <para>-  The 1956-57 edition. At least, it gives the history of the Starfighter. Any one who looks at this volume will find that development of the design began away back in 1951 and that the first flight of the first model was on 7th February, 1954, as I indicated a while ago. The improved model was in quantity production and flew for the first time on 17th February, 1956 - fourteen months before the Prime Minister announced the decision of this Government. Where were the Australian people who were looking at aircraft, that they did not know that this was a highlevel fighter, that it had qualities about which, only a few months after his announcement, the Prime Minister complained in the following terms: " It is in no sense an all-purpose fighter "? Why did he not know that earlier? It is a dreadful indictment of this Government, and of its officers if need be, that such a stupid error was made - if the September announcement is right. </para>

                    </list>
                    <para class="block">Why was not that known earlier? Was there not for years ample opportunity to discover the performance and qualities of the Starfighter? Did not the Prime Minister know that in April? How did he come to make the grand discovery in September? It is a perfect instance of complete ineptitude; there is no other phrase to describe it. </para>
                    <para>Let us look at the tragic hiatus that that has produced in our production of aircraft. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Lawrence</inline> Wackett has complained year after year that the Sabre programme has been running out. He announced a year or two ago that it was then too late to keep the factory fully employed, that any new model determined upon would take a year, or perhaps two years, to tee up. It could not be put into production quickly. He indicated that there must be a lag. What has this Government decided? Now it does not want a supersonic fighter; it wants a sub-sonic fighter. It wants to improve the Avon Sabre, and at long last - of course, it is too late to keep aircraft production moving - it has handed out an order for some more Avon Sabres. </para>
                    <para>What has been the Government's attitude? It has been dismissing men in recent years. It has driven out trained and skilled men who have seen the shilly-shallying of the Government and who are not likely to be attracted back into this field with its uncertainties. They could have little confidence about their future in that field in the light of the obvious shilly-shallying and cursed incompetence of this Government! There must be a delay of at least one year before we shall see any of the new Avon Sabres. There will be a gap between the last of the current production and the first of the new. What kind of defence effort is that? What kind of arrangement is that for our aircraft production industry? </para>
                    <para>I come now to the question of guided missiles - one more area of complete indifference, inaction and incompetence. When this Government came to office, the Woomera project was in operation as a guided missiles testing ground. It had been established by Labour in conjunction with the United Kingdom Government. During the last eight years, activities have been developed and expanded in conjunction with the United Kingdom, and all kinds of missiles have been tested. As the Government admits, missions have gone overseas during the years to inspect what has been done abroad, particularly in England, and to learn all about the missiles of the world. But how many guided missiles have our defence forces got after eight years of testing, investigation and activity? They have only one, because honorable senators will believe me when I tell them that the only ground-to-air missile that this country has is the Prime Minister of Australia himself, the right honorable Robert Gordon Menzies! He is the one ground-to-air missile that this country has after eight years of activity in this field! There have been words, an unending flow of words, bemusing the people of Australia year after year. The same sorry record applies to the FN .30 rifle. </para>

The Government has not yet determined the type of missile that shall be acquired. It cannot even tell us whether it intends to make the missiles here or to buy them abroad. After eight years, we have got nowhere, and we do not know what we are going to do. </para>

I am dealing now with one more instance - the production of the FN .30 rifle. In 1954, the then Minister for Defence Production announced that we were to have an FN .30 rifle; but there has been complete dithering year after year while people have been sacked from the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. The truth of the matter, according to the latest announcement, is that we shall not have the FN .30 rifle until some time in 1958. Four years of dithering and fooling! Thank God the war that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> feared did not materialize! </para>

                    <para>But that is not the end of the FN .30 rifle. The Prime Minister indicated quite clearly that we were to standardize with America in relation to not only aircraft and artillery but also small arms. So that there will be no misunderstanding that his statement included the FN .30 rifle, let me read what he said -  in our consideration of the Army, we have, in accordance with the principles  i  have already described, decided to provide modern equipment standardized or compatible with that used by the United States. Our re-equipment plans -  i  am talking about the Army - can involve expenditure of nearly £40,000,000 over the next three years. These plans include provision of the new FN rifle and its related ammunition and the United States 105 mm. field artillery equipment. </para>

                            <para>- I  agree, but  I  am pointing out just what little the Government knew. One day it was standardizing with America on the FN .30 rifle and within days of the announcement America discarded the rifle and adopted another. What happened? Did America inform this Government wrongly? Or is it a case of the Government's having been stupid in not ascertaining the facts or not even knowing what was going on? These events show quite plainly that all this talk about standardization was only so many words out of the mouth of the Prime Minister on behalf of the Government. There had been no real co-operation or discussion. Otherwise, that could not have happened. Despite the announcement that we were to standardize in relation to artillery, aircraft and small arms, what has happened? We are no longer standardizing in relation to aircraft, and we have not the same important small arms unit.  I  shall be very interested to hear from the Minister for National Development what is happening in relation to artillery. Although we have had a mission from America looking us over, we do not know whether we are buying artillery, making  it  for ourselves, for the United States of America or for the South-East Asia area. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>I would be interested if the Minister could tell us, in due course, how far we have proceeded in the standardization of artillery. </para>
                    <para>As I come towards the close of this summary of the Government's ineptitude, I point out that there is not, in fact, any civil defence of any consequence in Australia. Infinitesimal amounts of money have been made available by the Government for civil defence, and there has been very little activity in that connexion. In contrast, the United Kingdom has 500,000 personnel trained in everything connected with civil defence against nuclear bombs. I was amazed to hear doubts expressed in the Senate that the Commonwealth Government would have the power to move into the field of civil defence. Was there ever a more essential need from the viewpoint of defence preparations than civil defence? No force can operate in the field, in the air or on the sea unless it has production and, above all, industrial might behind it. That means that we must preserve a civilian population. The easiest way to win a war is to wipe out the civilian population and destroy capacity to produce food and to manufacture armaments. Without a civilian population, all the armies and all the equipment in the world are useless. As the very essence of preparedness civil defence should be given a high priority, but that side of defence has been completely disregarded by this Government. </para>
                    <para>I direct the attention of the Senate now to one more example of this Government's ineptitude. The Prime Minister said, in April, that there were disturbing deficiencies on our equipment. He was speaking of the whole field of military equipment. He pointed out that far too much money was being spent on maintenance and not enough on capital equipment. At whose door did the fault lie for eight years? The fault was the Government's. It lies with nobody else. </para>
                    <para>Finally, I wish to mention the St. Mary's filling factory. If the Government permits, I hope to have an opportunity to propose a motion on the Government's policy in relation to the St. Mary's project. Therefore, I will not say any more now on that subject, but I throw it in to show that although away back in 1951 the Government decided that we had to be prepared for war within three years, it did not decide to have a filling factory until the three years had elapsed. The danger period had passed before the Government reached a decision on this matter. What would have happened had war broken out in the meantime? That is all I wish to say on that matter now, but I hope to make another statement later. </para>

On Monday of this week, the " Sydney Morning Herald " printed the second of the series of articles under the heading - " Government's Defence Showpiece is a Military Sham ". Those are very strong words and they lead me to the particular matter with which I wish to deal. From beginning to end, this article - another was printed to-day - is the most blistering indictment of the Prime Minister in his personal capacity as Prime Minister of Australia that has ever been penned. </para>

                            <para>-  Oh, yes it does! I suggest that it is also a damning indictment of the unpreparedness of Australia and what is happening now. The writers of this article have charged the Government with fraud - actual fraud - in relation to the fronting of our defences to the people of Australia. The writers have charged the Government with complete and absolute fraud. That is a serious charge in anybody's language. If what I am about to read to the Senate is true, the Government is disgraced and dishonoured and should resign. </para>

                            <para>-  There are occasions when friends fall out. That is a kindly phrase, and I do not want to be unparliamentary. I do not intend to be diverted from reading the articles to the Senate. The staff correspondents who have written the articles in this series are persons outside the ambit of politics with no axe to grind. They are on the staff of the " Sydney Morning Herald ", and the fact that the newspaper has published the caption I have quoted shows that the articles have the sponsorship and the approval of the newspaper. That is the point I wish to emphasize. These articles have not been written by somebody outside the newspaper. This newspaper is a great friend of the Liberals and of the Prime Minister. </para>

                            <para>- Look at the particularity of the charges and how easily they can be exposed if they are lies! Who suggests that it is a piece of imagination for responsible correspondents to write, " They are taking men of any ages; they are taking in skilled tradesmen as privates; they are scraping the bottom of the barrel "? Could anybody imagine that to be said by any person who had no information? I do not know where the writers get their information. Their sources of information on that matter are certainly not available to me, and I do not know where they get it. Since the Minister asks me to say whether I believe what is written in the article, I say I do. I should be surprised if they are lying like that. There is a very easy way to dispose of it, and the Opposition will not be content with the Government's merely giving a denial to these statements. We will not let the matter rest there. </para>

                            <para>- As I say, it is one of the leading newspapers of Australia, and I am certain these articles are written and presented with so much obvious care and deliberation that I shall be surprised if they have not got all the answers when the Minister replies. It is the duty of the Opposition to face the Government up in public to charges of that nature, and I should be ashamed of a government that needed to be goaded into answering them. I do not propose to pursue that further at the moment. I think I have said sufficient to put the Government in a position to face up to these charges. They have not come from the Opposition. They have been made publicly, and they demand an answer. 1 propose now to take up once more in this chamber the question of the Government's manipulation of trust funds. These newspaper articles have referred to trickery in another sense. I want now to show how the Government has employed trickery in relation to defence trust funds. I am not binding behind any one when I speak on this matter. It is no new topic, so far as I am concerned. Honorable senators have heard me refer to it frequently. Year after year I have directed attention to the fact that huge defence trust funds were being established. The Government did not appear to be listening, and year after year I asked whether there was a real reason for the funds or not. Time and again I have been answered in the affirmative. I remind the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> of the answer which he gave to me on 19th October, 1955, when I made a broad approach to this question. I may say that I do not hold him personally responsible for his answers, for he was doubtless putting what he had been told by the Ministers' whom he represents in this chamber. </para>

                    <para class="block">Let me refer to those trust funds for a moment. The Defence Equipment and Supplies Fund was established in 1953-54, more than three years ago, with a first payment from revenue of £12,000,000. There was no expenditure in that year. In the next year, 1954-55, £8,000,000 was added to the fund. Not a penny has been expended from the fund at any time. During the last financial year the Government decided that the money was no longer required for the purpose described, and transferred it to Consolidated Revenue where, no doubt, it found its way into the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve and, ultimately, was used to support State works programmes. </para>

He sests up a fund for a purpose which he says is real, but which, in truth, is not. He invests the money for purposes not connected with the trust at all, and in due course lends the money to himself as Treasurer. In the process of returning it to Consolidated Revenue he loses the sum of £500,000. </para>

                            <para>- For the moment I am speaking of the Defence Equipment and Supplies Fund only. The Strategic Stores and Equipment Reserve Fund was established in 1951 by a first payment of £57,000,000. In that year £9,000,000 was paid out. During the intervening six years a total of £67,000,000 has been paid into the fund, but only £18,000,000 has been paid out. At page 98 of the Treasurer's financial statement, in the section relating to trust funds, we find a debit, under the heading "Expenditure" of £2,068,906. It is shown there as expenditure, but one has to turn to the Auditor-General's report to find that it was really a loss on investments. </para>

                    <para>The balance in the account in 1951 was £48,000,000. In the second year it had risen a little, to £50,000,000, but at the end of the whole period a total of £48,000,000 had been invested by the Treasurer in his own Government's securities. When he finally released this money, for the purposes of the national revenue, the sum of £2,068,906 was lost. One finds that out, not from the Treasurer, but from the report of the Auditor-General. At page 67 of that report losses of £521,404 on the Defence Equipment and Supplies Fund, and £2,061,509 on the Strategic Stores and Equipment Reserve, are shown. What a performance from a trustee! He creates a trust fund simply to put away surplus funds from the defence vote and deceive the people, into believing that large sums are being spent on defence. </para>

                            <para>- Money supposedly spent on defence was diverted to trust funds. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden gave the show away in August, 1956. He said that that kind of thing had happened to funds totalling £100,000,000. The Government was only pretending to the people that it was spending upon defence all the money that it appropriated for that purpose. The Treasurer put £20,000,000 into the Defence Equipment and Supplies Account and £48,000,000 into the Strategic Stores and Equipment Account - all on the pretence that the money was needed for defence. In truth, it has never been needed. But what a time for the Government to decide that the money should be returned to Consolidated Revenue! In order to carry out the Prime Minister's defence policy, announced in April last, it is supposed to be re-equipping the Army and the Air Force, and putting down new ships for the Navy, and surely needs this money, which it has now diverted to the support of State works programmes. </para>

                    <para>One has only to state the facts to see that the Government has been guilty of trickery from beginning to end. My purpose in mentioning the matter is simply to expose that trickery. The money was never required for the purposes described to the Senate. It was put aside into these funds so that the people would think that it was being spent on defence. It was so badly invested that the loss on the conversion of the two accounts was £2,500,000. Worst of all, the money is now being returned to Consolidated Revenue - and at a time when it was never more urgently needed for the equipment of the forces. 1 conclude with the comment that this merely adds to the exceedingly disgraceful performance of the Government in the matter of defence. </para>

                        pointed with pride to a history book, " Jane's All the World's Aircraft ". History will not be much good to us if, having decided at some time to follow a certain line of action, we persist in following that line in the face of changed situations and developments, knowing that such persistence would be folly. Sometimes consistency can constitute great folly. Our attitude is that we should have the very latest and best equipment for the defence of our country, in spite of what the story books say.

                    <para>Most of the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> can be answered, and I propose to answer them by quotations from the statement made by the Prime Minister on 19th September last. Obviously, honorable senators opposite have not studied that statement. Let me deal first with the old, old story about our not being ready for mobilization. The comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden before the Public Accounts Committee were taken completely out of their context. Any intelligent person knows that no country, not even a totalitarian country, is ready for immediate mobilization. The reply given by the Prime Minister to a question asked of him in the House of Representatives in 1956 gave a complete explanation. For some silly reason, honorable senators opposite want the world to think that they believe our defences are in a wretched and backward state, when they know that, in fact, such is not the case. I really do not  understand the mental attitude of honorable senators opposite in that regard. This is the answer that the Prime Minister gave in connexion with the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden to the Public Accounts Committee -  . . <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden has never said that the defences of this country are in a hopeless position. On the contrary, he gave a lot of evidence before the Public Accounts Committee which showed a vast development in defence expenditure and preparations. If the honorable member failed to pay any attention to the statement made by my colleague, the Minister for Defence, about the defence position, then I regret it; but that statement made abundantly clear - and every word of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden's evidence supports the statement - that the defences of this country were never in a better shape in time of peace in the history of Australia. A great deal has been made of a grossly distorted newspaper report and there has been a campaign to the effect that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden is supposed to have said that Australia's defences, or the Australian defence forces, were not in a state of mobilization. </para>

                        <para>Over the week-end I read every word of the 118 pages of evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden, and I want to say that it is a pretty stimulating account of the dynamic approach that has been made towards Australian defences under my colleague the Minister for Defence, with a revamping and rebalancing of our defence programme. The critics always have their little bit of criticism given headlines. I noticed the other day that a former Chief of the Air Staff, in commenting upon his desire that there shpuld be a forward programme for building some new type of aircraft, also went on to say that the air defences in Australia were better than they had ever been before. That part of his comment did not get the headlines; it is the point of criticism that gets them. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden, quite accurately and honestly, when asked the question, "Could you mobilize to-day at once?" - I am not quoting the precise words - said, " No ". And the; same answer would have to be given by any other Minister or official in any other country except  a  totalitarian one. If this country is to be, on theinstant, ready to mobilize a great army, navy and air force ready for action - that is the point - then it cannot be ready unless it has not only a full-bodied system of long-range and long-period' conscription with men callable at will and fully trained, but also devotes from its revenues such an enormous increase in money that it is able to have, if it can get it locally or abroad, all the modern' equipment that goes to make a modern army, navy or air force. Under those circumstances, it is just simply theoretical nonsense to criticizea statement that immediate mobilization is not possible. The fact is that a country like thishas to aim at being, as far as possible, along the road to effective mobilization in time. </para>

                        McBride's top level inquiries in the United States, inquiries conducted with high technical assistance from the Australian armed services, confirmed the desirability of the C130 and resulted in agreement about the securing of this craft and feasible means of paying for them. Apart from the usual characteristics of large modern transport aircraft - a large uplift capacity coupled with a range of approximately 2,000 miles and a cruising speed of approximately 300 miles per hour - it has the additional feature of being able to land and take off in relatively short distances on improvised landing grounds and could certainly use any strip which is currently used by DC3 aircraft.

                            McBride's investigations were of immense value on these points.  His  American discussions look this problem out of the world of abstract perfection into the world of realism and accepted probabilities. He was able, by virtue of' his office, to discuss these matters with those who make policy and determine the over-riding strategic conceptions which are involved in American policy. He discovered that the operational employment of the F104 was still, to some extent, in the experimental stage, but that there were two factors in its proposed use which rendered it inappropriate for adoption by Australia.

                        <para>To add to all this, the Minister was strongly advised that the Australian Avon Sabre is at least as good as any other sub-sonic fighter plane in the world, and that for South-East Asian purposes and from the point of view of efficient co-operation in Seato, we would be playing our most effective part and also usefully continuing our aircraft production programmes by placing additional orders for the production of these aircraft. </para>

No new major modifications have been incorporated in these orders.

It is the same old story about the time the Prime Minister was in office when war broke out.

                        <para>His characteristic weakness for believing that eloquence is a substitute for action, that a policy announced is a policy carried out, that a committee formed is a plan achieved, was once again to be given full play in the field of defence. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">When the Senate receives only a very short statement, mostly read, in answer to a considered case that took 40 to 50 minutes to present, we are entitled to believe that there may be some substance in the articles that have been published by the " Sydney Morning Herald ". I am amused to find this organ of the press, no doubt because of the prickings of its conscience, for once printing something that may cause the people of this country to give more thought to the question of defence. </para>
                    <para>I thought that the Minister, who answered on behalf of the Government, would have told us something about the brigade group. Irrespective of the degree to which our views may differ on methods of defence, no one on either side of the chamber desires to see this country undefended. In the light of world events, we all believe that Australia should have the most up-to-date defence system it can afford. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> asked some specific questions. He desired to know whether, as this newspaper alleges, men who have been trained as tradesmen have been used as infantrymen in order to make up numbers? I understand that about 4,100 men constitute a brigade. </para>
                    <para>The Opposition wants to know the facts. If the statements contained in these articles are not true, I should be one of the first to condemn the newspaper for attempting to inculcate distrust in the minds of the people of this country on the question of our defences. The Opposition desires a reply from the Government to some of the questions that have been asked. It does not help the defence of this country to have, every few months, a statement on defence presented by the Prime Minister, the latest statement very often contradicting a previous one. We are told in one statement that something is going to be done, but after waiting a few months we find that nothing has been done. We are then told that the reason for the inactivity is that new machines have been perfected. </para>
                    <para>The Government talked a lot about a new rifle and the tooling up process at the Lithgow Small Arms Factory. When the factory was almost in a position to commence rolling the rifle off the production lines, as it were, the Government found that the rifle was no longer suitable. Nobody would criticize the Government for changing its mind if world events made that necessary. However, we have representatives in the United States of America. We are closely allied to the United States, and I hope we will remain in that close association. If we decide to link our armaments with those of the United States, surely it should not take us long to find out what is necessary. Why should we tool up our factories to produce a certain rifle, only to find that the rifle we are ahout to produce is out of date? Surely no honorable senator is satisfied with the frequent changes of policy that have taken place or with the state of our defences on which we have spent ?1,200,000,000 or ?1,300,000,000 in the last few years. </para>
                    <para>We take these newspaper articles for what they are worth. Quite candidly, I do not claim that they are correct. </para>

                    <para>But what do we find after September? It was reported in the " Sydney Morning Herald ", of 24th October last, that the Government had spent £1,300,000 on remodelling the cruiser " Hobart " and, having partly completed the work, put the vessel into mothballs. Is it any wonder that one of the leading newspapers of this country has taken the Prime Minister to task? The few statements I have read show clearly that the Prime Minister has been using words and still more words but there is little defence preparedness. </para>
                    <para>Let me refer again to the right honorable gentleman's April statement. As has been pointed out, that statement shocked not only the Parliament but also the- nation. It contained the famous announcement that the national service training scheme as it related to the Navy and the Air Force was to be scrapped. It took the Government six years to discover that to take national service trainees into the Navy and the Air Force was useless. In that time the Government spent £1,300,000,000 or £1,400,000,000 on defence. I can recall when the Government said that if national service training were applied to all arms of the forces Australia would have an excellent potential defence weapon. But on 4th April the Government announced that the yearly intake of trainees was to be reduced from 29,000 to 12,000! I shall refer later to the reason for the Government's decision. </para>

The scheme has had  no  defence  value  at all, and what concerns most of us is that six- years elapsed before that fact was discovered. A number of youths have had some experience of discipline but they have no practical military, air force or naval training. </para>

                    <para>Let me revert to the statement that was made by the Prime Minister in April. The Government reduced the number of national service trainees from 29,000 to 12,000. It instituted a brigade force. The Prime Minister announced that that force would be fully equipped with the most up-to-date weapons so that it would be mobile and ready at a moment if needed. I simply ask the Government now to answer the questions that were submitted to-day by the Leader of the Opposition. I repeat those questions which relate to the brigade force - How many trained military tradesmen are there in the regular army brigade as infantry privates or, I will go further, as non-commissioned officers? How many members of the brigade are due for retirement in six months, a year, two years or three years? Is there any age limit on mem. bership of the brigade and what are the age groups, year by year, of members of the brigade? </para>
                    <para>The Opposition is entitled at least to an answer to those questions. The Government must have the figures and the Senate is entitled to know the answers. What is more, the people of Australia, particularly those who have read the articles that were published by an erstwhile friend of the Government, will want to know the answers. The people will not sit down for ever and allow the Government to vote about £200,000,000 a year for defence without a challenge. They are entitled to ask what they are getting for their money. I ask the Government to answer the questions that I have repeated so that there can be no equivocation about them. Let us consider the Air Force. In his speech on 4th April the Prime Minister said - </para>

                        <para>The Air Force should include fighter aircraft of the most modern kind to ensure local air superiority and to deal with any raiding bomber  . . We are planning to re-arm with fighter aircraft of a performance equivalent to the Lockheed F104. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">In September, the right honorable gentleman discarded the statement he had made in April. Apparently the Prime Minister is no longer concerned with raiding bombers. Now, he says, in effect, we do  not need what we needed in April because in his later speech he made a statement to the effect that the Avon Sabre aircraft would be all right in South-East Asia. Does that mean that we will defend Australia only so far as South-East Asia is concerned? Are our financial resources such that we cannot plan our defences beyond South-East Asia? I remind the Government that the war went much further afield than South-East Asia on the last occasion. If we wanted Lockheed F104's iri April, why were they discarded in September? This nation is entitled to have the most modern Air Force that it can obtain. I am amazed at the apparent change in the situation. </para>
                    <para>When I read the speech that was delivered by the Prime Minister in September I thought, " These are wonderful words ". That viewpoint at least supports the attitude of the section of the press which has given so much of its space to Australia's defence recently. Referring to the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Philip McBride),</inline> the Prime Minister said - </para>

                    <para class="block">Let us examine those words again. When we wanted the Lockheed F104's, according to the words of the Prime Minister himself, they came within the category of " abstract perfection ". And I remind Government supporters that we are spending nearly £200,000,000 a year on defence. Is it any wonder that the newspapers have said that the Prime Minister will talk you blind. He will tell us, in effect, that the defences of Australia are almost as good as those of the United States of America and other large nations and from then on we get words, words, words. </para>

                            <para>- The aircraft are outmoded. They are subsonic aircraft. I hope that the Government is right in its belief that we shall have to worry only about South-East Asia. I join with the Government in its desire to defend the country to the best of our ability, but we should not be so stupid as to think that once  we  have dealt with the position in South-East  y*sia  everything in the garden will be lovely, that we will be able to go on our merry way, that we will continue to provide £200,000,000 a year for defence, and have only £9,000,000 floating round in the air. It seems that the Government has been doing this, that it has had £9,000,000 floating round in the air and that then somebody suddenly decided to put it to the defence estimates. When we remember these actions, we cannot wonder at some newspapers publishing articles such as those referred to to-day. If we had in this country a press that would print facts and give news instead of views, not only the Sydney press but the whole of the press in Australia would be taking up this matter and honorable senators on the Government side would not be as complacent as they are now. </para>

Surely he does not suggest that the Leader of the&gt; Government answered those charges merely by reading, ' reading and reading as he did. While he was reading at great length, I glanced at the faces of honorable senators on the Government side, and I know from what I saw that they felt most uncomfortable. All that the people of this nation want is an answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna's</inline> questions and it should be an authoritative answer. In fact, I say without any equivocation whatever that I should like a committee to be appointed to investigate the whole matter, and I do not say that with any idea of adversely affecting the defence of this country. The plain fact is that the Government cannot get away with its attitude all the time. </para>

                    <para>There has been given to what we have heard before a new impetus because of three articles which have appeared recently in the " Sydney Morning Herald ", and which I have no doubt the Leader of the Opposition read at leisure and on which he based a number of his attacks on the Government. New flaccid fabrications have been added to what we have heard before. Whatever the reasons behind these fabrications may be - and I, for my part, think they are dishonorable - I believe they should be answered as they have appeared in a newspaper with a national circulation. I also believe that they can be answered: because I think they are completely irresponsible. I think that insofar as they tend to lead the nation to regard the brigade group which has been established as a political sham, they are a danger to Australia. I believe they discredit this country. I believe that if they cannot be sustained - and in my opinion they cannot be sustained - then those who are responsible for publishing them in a newspaper with such a huge circulation and such responsibility have fallen down in carrying out their duty to the Australian people. If I may say so, seeing that the Leader of the Opposition nods approbation, those honorable senators opposite who accept and endorse those criticisms, unless they are sure that these criticisms are adequately based, also do discredit to the defence of this country and to the Australian nation. </para>
                    <para>Before going on to consider in more detail the allegations made in this newspaper, I think it right that some of the general observations made by the Leader of the Opposition should first be answered. Of course, they have been answered before. Those general observations are that this Government has been inept in the matter of defence, inefficient in the matter of defence and has secured nothing to show for the money which has been expended over the eight-year period since it has been in office. I think that, in considering those observations, we must first examine what the situation was when this Government took over from the Labour administration. </para>
                    <para>I do not blame Labour for what it did then; I merely mention its actions as a statement of fact. If we look back to the period immediately following the second world war, we remember the general feeling obtaining then in America, England and Australia was that we could hope that war was an instrumentality of the past, that war was something which no longer needed to be resorted to if we could persuade the Russians that we were genuine in our desire for peace. Because of that feeling, we, in conjunction with the United Kingdom and the United States, demobilized the forces that we had at the end of the war. This meant that towards the end of 1949' Australia did not have in being an air force of any significance either in numbers or equipment. It was small in numbers and equipped with DC3 transports and Mustang fighters. At that time we did not have a </para>
                    <para class="block">Navy of any significance in either numbers or equipment. It was small in numbers with no aircraft carriers, few destroyers and a fleet air arm equipped with obsolete aircraft. Further, we had only the nucleus and skeleton of an army. </para>
                    <para>I am glad that this country demobilized its forces .to that extent at the &lt;end of the second world war. We :showed the way to peace in the world by demobilizing in conjunction with the United Kingdom . and the United States. I lay no blame on Labour for doing what it did then; I merely state that that .is in fact what .happened. The munitions establishments, on which the .armed forces rely .in war-itime for munitions and instruments of destruction were disposed of in like manner - Salisbury to the Woomera rocket range, and St. Mary's to private enterprise. </para>

Equally unfortunately, all countries did not believe that we, in common with our present Allies, were genuine in our desire for peace. It became evident, step by step, in Europe and the Far East, that our genuine gesture was being construed as weakness, and that if we did not look to our defences we should be in danger of being overthrown by .those who had not demobilized. </para>

                    <para>From *hat day - the day when this Government came to office - onward, it was necessary to turn round and build up, once again, the armed forces and the logistics upon which they depend. Facing that proposition we found, too, .that there had been such immense advances in aviation, in the requirements of an army as to munitions and supplies, and in the requirements of a -navy,, that a level of expenditure which might previously have proved adequate was now completely laughable. We found that a Mustang fighter which had previously been adequate, and had cost £5,000, was now quite out of date. There were no jets in Australia when this Government came to office. 'The Mustang had been superseded by jet aircraft which cost tens of thousands of pounds per unit. We found it necessary to provide for the Navy aircraft carriers and a fleet air arm equipped with aeroplanes enormously more expensive than we had been accustomed to - with a consequently greater burden on the defence vote. </para>
                    <para>We found it necessary to rebuild our armed -forces from almost nothing, and provide them -with all the equipment and munitions which ,they needed to acquit themselves in modern conditions - indeed, as "they idid in the war in which Australia found herself engaged towards the end of 1950. We have been told that all the expenditure to that end has been wasted. We began from the situation which I postulated, without blame to any one, towards the end of 1950, and finally reached a situation in which we had fighter squadrons equipped with Avon Sabres, bomber squadrons equipped with Canberras, long-range anti-submarine reconnaissance squadrons equipped with Neptunes, and our own brigade group, and a battalion group, equipped and supplied from this country. We had also the controversial, but nevertheless physical facilities, available at St. Mary's to supply these fighting forces of all arms with the bombs, shells, and munitions which they and our allies would need in the event of war. </para>
                    <para>We are told that all this has been wasted, but at least they have been provided - they are physically apparent. The force has been in being, in the form of an army, a navy and an air force, and has been paid, for eight years. An aircraft carrier and other equivalent and necessary ships have been in being. I agree that our air force has not been equipped with the FI 04, but it .has had good Avon Sabre fighters and Canberra bombers, with all the electronic and meteorological aids which are necessary in an air force these days. Aerodromes have been built throughout this country and New </para>

                    <para>What is the basis of this criticism? First, it is a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden that this country was not ready for mobilization in 1953 or 1956. Great play has been made upon that statement by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Kennelly),</inline> but those gentlemen have not directed attention to what the Public Accounts Committee itself had to say on the subject. It was, of course, the committee before which this evidence was given. I refer especially to paragraphs 82 and 83 of the committee's report. Therein the following appears: - </para>

                            <para>" Mobilization " may mean " general mobilization ". In this case, mobilization is the marshalling of the national resources for a total war effort. This point was not reached during the 1939-45 war until 1943. </para>

                    <para>By 1943 that strength had been reached. </para>

                    <list type="decimal-dotted">

                            <para>In answer to questions, the Secretary of the Department of Defence informed us that Australia had not been ready for mobilization in 1953, and that was still the case in the current year. </para>

                    </list>
                    <para class="block">That refers to total mobilization of all national efforts for a war. That was, of course, quite true. Is it not also true that no democratic nation, and few totalitarian nations, can at any given moment of time be mobilized in that sense, unless they have complete conscription of man-power, and all forms of materials, all the time - so that at any given minute they can be said to be ready for mobilization. That is the only sense in which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden referred to mobilization. </para>
                    <para>I ask the Leader of the Opposition, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, or any one who sits behind them to read the whole report of' the committee on the defence services and the relevant estimates, and disagree with me when I say that the evidence given by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Shedden, to which most of the report is devoted, shows that right up to the time at which he was speaking - last year - there had been a steady and constant growth of the defence potential of this country, even though we were not ready at any given moment for the total diversion of national resources to war,  yet  that is one of the grounds on which this criticism is based. </para>

Guided missiles of what kind - ground-to-air, air-to-air, or airtoground? We were not told. I believe that, in fact, we have guided missiles of an airtoair type - a very significant type developed at Woomera which was, if you like, a joint enterprise of the Opposition and ourselves. I do not think that we have at the moment a ground-to-air guided missile - if that is what was referred to - but I do believe that, as a result of what has been done at Woomera by the joint efforts of our own Government and the Government of the United Kingdom, the development of a ground-to-air guided missile has been greatly accelerated and that we are much closer to adopting a proper prototype than we have been before. </para>

                    <para>But I do not want to deal any more with what we heard before. I want, rather, to deal with the criticism which is the real basis of this attack on the Government - the criticism voiced by the " Sydney Morning Herald " as, I believe, the result of a personal vendetta. I think it is malicious and completely irresponsible. I want to look at the first of this series of articles on which much of this attack has been based. The Leader of the Opposition read the words at the top of this article and claimed - I think justly - that they were a paraphrase of what he himself had said some time previously in the Senate. Personally, I do not think he is entitled to take any credit for that, because these words constitute not an objective study of our defence position or of what we have done, but a personal attack on the Prime Minister - the kind of personal attack which it is easy to make on any man at any time. </para>
                    <para>Let us look at some of the allegedly factual statements made in this first article. The writer of the article was referring to the years 1951-1953. He wrote - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>What would Australia's position have been if war had broken out by 1953? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">He ignored the Korean war. </para>
                    <para>That left the Regular Army. Far from having two brigade groups, it would have been hard pressed to put two battalions in the field, let alone supply them wilh the necessary reinforcements. </para>
                    <para class="block">Since the outbreak of the Korean war towards the end of 1950, the Regular Army had had two battalions on active service in Korea. It kept them there till the end of the war and supplied them with reinforcements. In addition, it supplied with ammunition, not only those battalions, but other elements of the Commonwealth Division. Yet we are told that the Regular Army would have been hard pressed to put two battalions in the field! They were put there and they were kept there. They were not there alone, because, with the backing of every senator in this chamber, one of the first elements which took part on the side of the United Nations in that war against communist aggression was Number 77 Squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force, which was in action within the first four days of the war. Nor were those forces without support from the Royal Australian Navy. That is one of the allegedly factual statements in this series of scurrilous articles. What is another? Referring to the Prime Minister, the article continued -  " If Malaya is vital to our defence ", he declared, " we must make Malayan defence our business ". How? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> did not explain. The total force that we were capable of sending to Malaya was one battalion group, two R.A.A.F. wings, and a few naval units. </para>
                    <para class="block">We had one battalion group in Malaya, quite apart from the other defence commitments we had to meet and quite apart from our home forces. In this article, on which this attack is based, the fact that we were able to send to Malaya a battalion group, two R.A.A.F. wings, and what is described as " a few naval units ", is brushed off in a casual, contemptuous way. We are told that there is nothing to show for the defence expenditure of this country. Those forces did not only go there. After they arrived, they operated, sustained casualities and were maintained on active service, yet that is contemptuously brushed aside. </para>
                    <para>But worse even than that is the article on which the Leader of the Opposition based more of his criticism. It is the second article, which described as " a military sham ", " a political fraud ", and " a particularly shoddy political fraud ", the brigade group raised by this nation for the discharging of its responsibilities to its allies in the area to our north. I could not agree more with the Leader of the Opposition's statement that those were grave and serious charges to be disseminated amongst the public of this country in regard to our front-line troops, our first defence against aggression. </para>
                    <para>On what is this general condemnation based? It is based on a number of unsubstantiated statements by an anonymous writer. One of the first things on which it is based is this statement - </para>
                    <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
                        <item label=".">
                            <para>. The brigade group is quite incapable of going into action for one very simple basic reason. It has no first reinforcements. Yet reinforcements must be available before any unit can be committed to action . . . </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">Everybody will agree with that. Of course, reinforcements are necessary before a unit can be committed to action. When I read that very definite and unequivocal statement, I got in touch with the  Deputy  Chief of the General Staff in Melbourne, to ask whether it was, in fact, true that this brigade group had no first-line reinforcements. Not on my own authority, but on the authority of the  Deputy  Chief of the General Staff, I make the definite statement that it does have first-line reinforcements - that there are now in training, apart from the 4,100 men who comprise the establishment of the brigade group, 450 first-line reinforcements, or approximately 10 per cent, of the establishment of the group. They are ready to fill any vacancies caused by sickness, incapacity or otherwise. In addition, there is a cadre, which will be replenished, to keep at least 10 per cent, of that establishment in training as first-line reinforcements. I specially dwell on that, because anybody who has been a soldier - and there are many ex-soldiers on both sides of this chamber - must have been shaken by an unequivocal statement that there were no first-line reinforcements in training. We all know that it is essential that there should be such reinforcements. I prefer to believe the  Deputy  Chief of the General Staff rather than an anonymous journalist. I hope that any anxiety on this matter which may have been caused will now be removed. What does the article state after that? It states - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>An armoured regiment equipped with obsolescent Centurion tanks has had to be included. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">These. " obsolescent Centurion tanks;" are the- current equipment <inline font-style="italic">tot</inline> the United; Kingdom, armoured, forces serving with, the Nato regiments, on the continent. It may-  ber- .  I do&gt; nob know^that there-. are perhaps- in&gt; Russia- new tanks with heavier armaments, 06 greater force, of more resistant armour. But at least, if the United. Kingdom- is equipping its Nato force which will take the first shock of any direct Russian blow with Centurion tanks, then surely it is not a very cogent criticism to level at the Australian regular brigade that it, too, is equipped with Centurion tanks of the same kind and of the same capability. Rather it must be stretching to the utmost any attempt that can be made, to denigrate any force described by this despicable article as the scrapings of the barrel. </para>
                    <para>The Leader- of the Opposition asked a number of other specific- questions all' of which - although I anticipated to some extent what he would say - I am unable to answer at this stage, but-  1  do know - and this again is said, I emphasize, on the authority of the Deputy Chief of the General Staff - that it is true to say that there is no age limit for enlistment into the regular forces or into this brigade group. It is also true that every man. enlisted in this brigade group must be passed as medically A  1  fit for service anywhere in the. world. I would say that a. medical assessment of that kind of the capability of the soldiers enlisted in this force would give better results than would an arbitrary and unalterable age limit. </para>
                    <para>Another criticism which has been made - and this one is not as completely devoid of all substance as were the previous ones - is that a brigade group, if sent abroad - and it is ready to go abroad at fourteen days' notice - would not be able to be sustained completely logistically from this country. I presume that this is what this article means; it- is not what it says. It says- - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The brigade group has no proper logistic, support. There are yawning gaps in its logistics set-up. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>That means that it- has some logistic support, but not as much as it should, have; but in any case that, is different, from having no proper logistic support-. It: has, never been envisaged that this brigade group' would- operate as- an entirely separate unit from the forces with which it was working, in the. Seato area. For that reason, it has been integrated with the United. States forces, the Viet Nam forces, the Korean forces,, the Formosan forces, the Thai forces. - all the forces in that area. For that reason,, it will use the same small arms, ammunition, the same howitzer ammunition and the same aircraft ammunition, as the forces of the.se countries, and operate in that way with those forces. For it. to be called a liability is, I suggest again,, something which can only do disservice to this country - something, which I was very sorry indeed to hear, the Leader of the Opposition, endorse as. his own opinion. </para>
                    <para>Well, that is the gist of that second article. I have approached the Minister foc the Army. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer)</inline> and asked him whether, he would supply to tha Leader of the Opposition, specific, answers to the otherspecific questions that he has asked, that is to. say, the number of- men. whose time will be " up " in six months. B.ut again, speaking on the authority of the  Deputy  Chief of the General Staff, I say this: No man was enlisted in that brigade group who did not have at the time of his enlistment  12  months of his service to run. It may be that, at the.present time, some men have six months; undoubtedly, at any time you choose to. take in the future; because men are enlisted in the Regular. Army for three or six years, some men will have only six months- to run, some three months, and some, of- course, three years. A force of that kind is not a static thing but something that is being turned over from time to time. Men are approaching the end of their enlistment, men are beginning the term- of their enlistment or men who, after the first six months' service, have two and a half years to go. As the Leader of the Opposition wanted to know specifically how many have only six months to go - I do not think it is significant in view- of what I have said - I have asked the Minister whether he would supply an exact answer to. that question. </para>
                    <para>I think there is only one specific query that has not been answered, that is; the number of tradesmen who are employed- as- infantry privates. If I werethe Minister for the Army, I would like to know more of what is required before I' tried to- answer that- query. Is a man who goes out with patrols-- with front line platoons, who is in charge of a walkie-talkie set but is armed, too, who has the tradesman's skill to keep his set in order and to keep his transmitter and receiver operating, a tradesman or an infantry private? In fact, he operates as both. Is a fitter and turner who goes out with a patrol, but is armed, who is driving a jeep or maintaining a jeep, a tradesman who has been drafted in as an infantry private, or is he one of those- very necessary persons in a modern army, a fighting soldier with a trade? He operates as both. Until it is made a little clearer just what is meant and wanted in that way, that particular question would be hard to answer. </para>
                    <para>Having answered as best I can these specific queries, having expressed my own opinion that these arguments are a farrago of quarter truths, that they have been spawned by personal spite and cannot stand up to proper examination, that the Leader of the Opposition has been misled by regarding them as objective criticism and that the statements made in them and therefore the statements made by him based on them are untrue - demonstrably untrue - I merely wish to conclude with these statements: The overall problem of defence is, and must always be, a most complex and most difficult one. It is very hard to tell whether we in this country should concentrate purely on atomic defence, on civil defence with the capacity for an atomic offensive to the detriment of conventional arms, because if we do that and if those who are likely to be our opponents have conventional arms and attack us, then we are placed in the dilemma of either submitting to their conventional attack or initiating atomic war. Yet, if we rely simply and solely on conventional armaments, then we are at the mercy of any country which has atomic armaments able to wipe us and our armies out. It is easier for countries like the United Kingdom and the United States to guard themselves on both these fronts. We, with our limited capacity and our need for development, cannot properly do that. We cannot have the most modern aircraft of all types, the most modern tanks, the most modern ships, the largest army and the largest capacity to deliver atomic blows. But we can, in accordance with the advice of our Chiefs of Staff and of our Allies, create a force designed to integrate with the forces of our Allies in whatever type of war may come, should any type of war come at all. That will involve, of course, changes from time to time. When these changes occur, it will be open to any member of the Opposition so inclined to say that what was spent previously on a previous type of armament was completely wasted, yet those who may be so inclined to criticize should remember that in the years that have passed the safety of this country has depended on such armaments, even though now they may have become obsolete and need replacing. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators opposite, or any one else who attacks this Government, or the defence services as apart from the Government, or those in the services, should think of the wars which have been fought in Korea and Malaya and of the ground work which has been done in this country. The speech made in April by the Prime Minister, which has been quoted so often, indicates that in that time we have built up a navy, although it may not be sufficient of itself to protect us, and an air force which, on the advice of the Chiefs of Staff, is of the type necessary to enable us to contribute to the common defence. We have also built up a brigade group for which we are supplying reinforcements, and we are correlating its arms and those of our Allies. At the same time, we are maintaining in Malaya, in the Strategic Reserve, a battalion group, two wings of the R.A.A.F. and a few units of the Navy. We have installed the most modern radar equipment. We are conducting at Woomera, in conjunction with the United Kingdom, experiments in guided missiles, and we are conducting, in conjunction with the United Kingdom, atomic experiments at Marilinga. </para>
                    <para>With all that, we have kept in being, during all those years an army sometimes fighting and sometimes protecting us merely by being in existence. I finish as I began. None of those things were present at the end of 1949. Who can say that the bringing of those things into being has wasted money, as we were told earlier in the debate? </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to make other than a passing reference to the statements' contained in the articles in the "Sydney Morning Herald ". I find it rather strange to see the Government being attacked by one of the daily newspapers of this country, and obviously the Government finds it strange, too, because it is very bitter about it. I detect a note of insincerity, almost of hypocrisy, in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton's</inline> claim that this newspaper is conducting a scurrilous vendetta against the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> I think it would be fair to say that if the " Sydney Morning Herald " set out to attack the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate or in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton's</inline> comment would be " More power to their elbow ". Let us be practical about these things. Why all this sob stuff in defence of the Prime Minister because he is attacked now and again, when probably he merits more than the attacks that have been made against him? </para>

                            <para>-  It has done so from time to time. If the honorable senator were to do something useful some day, it might attack him. I want to refer to some of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> but before doing so I will acknowledge that he does apply his mind very closely to debates of this character. What I have to say in criticism of the arguments he has advanced will be in no way directed against <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> personally. </para>

                    <para>At various stages of his address to-night he set out, I think, to describe situations in a way which he himself felt was not correct. He described them in a way which did not give the Senate a true picture. He dealt, first of all, with the state of the defences of this country when the MenziesFadden Government assumed office in 1949. He said that at that time certain arms of the services were at a comparative low ebb, but he went on to say that he did not blame the Labour government for that situation, because it had been brought about - I think I am correct in paraphrasing him in this way - by the fact that at that time there was a desire for peace throughout the world and this country was merely following the same trend as other countries by decreasing the strength of its armed forces. </para>
                    <para>That, of course, is not the true picture. That desire for peace may have had something to do with the situation in 1949, but the basic reason for speedy demobilization was the post-war rehabilitation requirements of Australia. When the war ended, the government of that day was faced with the great task of bringing back to this country hundreds of thousands of servicemen and servicewomen and rehabilitating them in civil life. It was beyond the financial and physical resources of this country, having expended so much on prosecuting the war, to maintain our armed forces at full strength after the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> would have been more correct if he had told the Senate that the main reasons for the situation that existed in 1949 were the requirements of post-war rehabilitation. </para>
                    <para>I wish to make a passing reference only to the statements contained in the " Sydney Morning Herald " articles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> denied that there was any substance in the criticisms and referred to them as a host of quarter-truths, but, by doing so, he acknowledged that there was some foundation for some of the statements made by the newspaper. I think that is a fair assessment of the position. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Kennelly)</inline> were perfectly right in saying that some of the allegations made by the newspaper had been previously stated from time to time by honorable senators on this side of the chamber, but the fact that the newspaper has reiterated those allegations does not indicate that we on this side were the first to become aware of them. As 1 develop what I have to say, I shall remind the Senate of some of the things that honorable senators on this side of the chamber have said during the last three or four years and which have been proved to be true, some of which are inherent in the criticisms contained in the articles in the " Sydney Morning Herald ". </para>
                    <para>Before dealing with a statement made by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan),</inline> let me say that I do not think he contributed very much to this debate. As a matter of fact, he did not reply, or even attempt to reply, to the claims of the Leader of the Opposition. He went into the realms of the past and referred to statements made by John Curtin. He said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> congratulated the preceding government upon having taken certain defence measures. I am not disputing the fact that at some time in 1941, 1942 or 1943 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> made such statements, but </para>
                    <para>I am not unaware of the circumstances in which he made them. Perhaps those who have been members of the Senate for much longer than I have, and who have had some association with war-time government, will recall that to a certain degree the hatchet was buried during that period. Some of the statements made by John Curtin and quoted by the Leader of the Government in this place this afternoon may have been made out of the kindliness and generosity of his nature rather than from the viewpoint of accuracy. </para>
                    <para>In view of the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'sullivan</inline> has made such a song and dance about the situation that existed at that time, and because of the obvious insincerity of his remarks, I propose to quote a passage from a speech delivered by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. H. V. Johnson)</inline> on 23rd September, 1942, which gives a very clear indication of the state of Australia's defences when the Curtin Labour Government took over from the MenziesFadden Administration in 1941. </para>

                    <para class="block">That is, the Menzies-Fadden Opposition -  to say that until a Labour government came into office there was no defence of Western Australia. Before leaving Canberra in July last for Western Australia, I asked the permission of my party to be absent from the next sittings so that I could visit the north-western portion of that State, which had already been attacked by the enemy. When I told the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> of my intention he said that his party would grant me a pair during my absence. However, when I reached Western Australia and discussed my proposed trip to the north-west with Major-General Plant, who was in charge of the defences of that State, I was astonished to hear him say that it was no use for me to go there, as instructions had been received to abandon all the north-west of the continent. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Marwick.</inline> - When was that? </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. JOHNSON.</inline>
                        In July last. From my discussion with Major-General Plant I learned that the whole of the north-west was to be abandoned. When I inquired what area was included in the territory to be abandoned the General said that the most northern defence line would be More River, which is 65 miles north of Perth as the crow flies. When I asked whether that meant the whole of the north-west of the State, which includes Geraldton, with its valuable harbour, .and Mullewa, with its important railway station, as well as all the rich midlands, he replied, " That is the position. With the forces and equipment at my command there is no alternative ". It was then that I advised the Government of the position in Western Australia.

If that information were more readily available, perhaps the Government would not blunder quite so much and would receive a greater degree of cooperation from the Opposition. We are not satisfied with the way in which the Government is spending the money, nor are we satisfied with the answers that are given to questions that are asked by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and his  deputy  in another place.

                            <para>-  I have a due sense of modesty and I am not prepared to debate that assertion. Some of the matters that give rise to suspicion about the way in which Australia's defence programme is being carried out and which lead the press to publish articles such as have been published by the " Sydney Morning Herald " are the vague and incomprehensible answers that are given by the Prime Minister and the Minister for Defence. No one, including, I think, even Government senators, can say that the replies that -are given to the probing questions of Labour members in another place are satisfactory. No one will disagree with me when I repeat that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> has given us more information to-night - whether it is accurate remains to be seen - than has been given by the two top men of this country in reply to questions that have been asked in another place. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    </continue>
                    <para>The Minister for Defence, like the Prime Minister, has come in for a lot of criticism from the press during the last twelve months or so. Whatever the state of Australia's defences, I do not believe that all the blame can be placed on <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Philip</inline> McBride. Perhaps some of the criticisms that have been levelled against him are unjust.  He  inherited the .defence portfolio at a jime when our defences were not good. Perhaps his predecessor should accept more blame than the present Minister, and I am not speaking against him in this debate on a personal 'basis. </para>
                    <para>I suggest that the Minister is the victim of an inept government and, perhaps, an inept predecessor. It has  been  said that when the Minister for Defence went to Washington recently to negotiate with the United States Government on an interchange of weapons and some .degree of standardization of weapons, he failed in his mission. Again, the press were the culprits in making that charge. I use that expression, not in a sense of condemnation, but because I believe Government supporters have made the press the culprits. They set out to establish that the Minister's mission to Washington had failed. </para>
                    <para>The fact that emerges very strongly is that the members of both chambers have not been given the full facts about what really happened in connexion with the Minister's mission to the United States. I defy any honorable senator to establish to my satisfaction that any member of this Parliament has received complete information on the Minister's mission. There seems to be a lot of hush-hush about it. I am sure that some of the back-benchers on the Government side know no more about the Minister's mission than I do. Certainly they do not look as though they know anything about it. </para>
                    <para>There are several features of defence which I consider to be particularly important. The Opposition has stated that there has been wasteful expenditure on defence. We believe that to be the truth. During the past three years when I have spoken on defence in the Senate I have attacked the wasteful expenditure that has been associated with national service training. I know there are two schools of thought on this matter. Those who subscribe to one view go all out to place every young person in Australia in training for military service even if it costs millions of pounds. They believe that the end is worth the expenditure. The Opposition believes that the truth is that the average young man who undergoes three months' national service training forgets all he has learned in the next three months, and the money expended on training him has been poured down the drain. </para>

                        <para>It may be appropriate to explain our proposals in relation to national service training. This scheme has given great benefits to our country in instilling ideals of personal discipline, loyalty and service. We introduced it and we are very proud of its results. Largely as a result of its introduction, we have today, as I have already indicated, a total of over 180,000 men who have received basic training. But we are no longer able to count defence potential in terms of numbers of partly trained men. </para>

                    <para class="block">What the Prime Minister said in about 150 unnecessary words was that the Government was concerned about the amount that was being expended on national service training and, as a consequence, proposed to curtail it. He could not skate around the proposition.

                    <para>I come now to a point which 1 have stressed frequently in this chamber. I believe it is just as important now as it was when I first referred to it. 1 refer to aircraft building in Australia. Some three years ago, thousands of men who were highly skilled in the art of putting aircraft components together were scattered throughout the various States of Australia. I reiterate that before a person can achieve the degree of skill necessary for him to qualify as an aircraft worker, he must undergo considerable training. The Government had work being done in its own establishments, and in addition, entered into contracts with big firms throughout Australia - I know of two in my own State - which utilized their own machinery, as well as that owned by the Government in some instances, for the assembly of aircraft components. Approximately 1,200 highly trained men and women were employed in this work in South Australia. To-day, il would not be possible to find 100 skilled workers in the aircraft building industry in Adelaide, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> and other honorable senators have mentioned that the position is somewhat similar in their respective States. This means, of course, that aircraft building is virtually at a standstill in this country. lt will be remembered that I asked a question of the appropriate Minister recently on this subject and the answer given was that the only people now employed in that field of activity are those engaged on aircraft maintenance at Parafield and that there will be no revival of aircraft production work in Australia. The consequences that flow from such stupid actions on the part of the Government are twofold. First, if it should be decided at some time in the future to begin some type of aircraft construction in this country, the Government will have to comb the employment markets of Australia to find suitable. men for the work. Without doubt, it will approach those who worked in the industry previously, and, if my knowledge of workmen may be taken as a guide, they will refuse to come back. It was an absolute blunder on the Government's part to let such a valuable industry slide, simply because the Government wanted to expend probably wastefully in some other direction the money it had been spending on this work. </para>
                    <para>The only thing I can say in commendation of the Government - I do not want to be attacking it continually - is that I agree with the suggestion made by the Prime Minister in his statement on defence that all sections of the armed services should have their head establishments at Canberra. That is a step in the right derection, and I hope it is put into effect. lt seems to me wrong that some sections of defence are established in one capital city and other sections in another capital city. They should be co-ordinated and broughl to the National Capital where they will be readily accessible to the Government in times of requirement. I repeat that I agree with that proposition suggested by the Prime Minister. </para>
                    <para>Let me conclude by saying that honorable senators on this side are just as conscious as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton</inline> and others on the Government side of the complexities of present day defence needs. We are fully aware of the fact that with advances in science weapons may change from day to day. We are not unaware of the possibility that the Government could get caught with expenditure on some type of weapon that could be modern this month and perhaps obsolete in six months' time. If the Government would only come forward with a reasonable and logical explanation of the situation, the Opposition would be satisfied. What is causing us concern, what is obviously causing the newspaper world concern, and certainly what is causing the people of Australia concern is the fact that there is too much mystery about the way in which this money is being expended. Whenever anybody has the temerity to ask a question, it is suggested that he is doing something detrimental to the proper defence of this country. </para>
                    <para>We say to the Government, " It is obvious you have made some blunders, and you will do your best to cover them up, but now is the time to come out into the open. If you want co-operation instead of criticism from this side, you will have to take us into your confidence to a greater extent than you are doing at the moment. Until you do so, you will continue to get justifiable criticism from honorable senators on this side, and you will continue to get justifiable criticism from the press of this country ". </para>

                        <para>. - lt is so much easier to produce destructive criticism than it is to do a good, solid, constructive job of work. It is very much easier to be critical than it is to be constructive, and no target is easier than the defence effort. </para>

                    <para>I think, with respect, that we have seldom heard sillier criticism than that which emanated from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> who said that there is too much mystery about the way in which the Government is spending its money on defence. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey</inline> of the information that was distributed to all honorable senators during the Budget debate. I draw attention, in particular, to the many pages of information giving statistics relating to the numbers of the forces, expenditure under the various headings, and the graphs showing the way the money was spent, and to the separate explanatory statement of the defence estimates isssued by my colleague, the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cramer).</inline> Never was more information provided to a House of Parliament by responsible Ministers than was distributed during the debate on the Estimates which has just concluded. With respect, I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey's</inline> statement that there is too much mystery about the way in which money is being spent on defence is completely indicative of the calibre of the criticism levelled at the Government in the Senate to-day. </para>
                    <para>There is no mystery about the way in which the money is being expended, and there is no suggestion of any mystery about it. The fact that honorable senators opposite have had to dredge to the bottom of the barrel is indicative of the fact that they have really no substantial ground for criticism in any stage of the debate. </para>
                    <para>I have said that, for the critic, no target is easier than the defence effort. This is so because of the conditions with which we have to contend. Those conditions are difficult not only because we live in an atomic age, not only because we live in a changing world but also because the only prospective enemy with respect to whom we have to make our arrangements is geographically situated at the centre of a circle and can change the venue of his pressure from Europe to the Middle East ot to the Far East, and different defence conditions obtain in connexion with each different venue. Our prospective enemies are capable of putting pressure in the Middle East, of putting pressure in Europe, and of putting pressure in the Far East. The citizens in most countries controlled by them have got to do as they are told and pretend to like it. They are capable of a defence effort very different from our own. They have great material resources on which to draw, and can, by enforcing their wishes upon others, absorb a greater proportion of those resources for defence than we could hope to do. </para>
                    <para>Any one who enters this debate with any intention to act fairly will agree that, to begin with, in a democracy the profession of arms is truly a thankless one. The officers who graduate at the colleges at Duntroon and Jervis Bay undergo preliminary training equivalent to the winning of a university degree. They must maintain that educational standard and degree of scientific knowledge throughout their professional lives. They must also maintain great physical fitness. This demands a life of devotion, and constant study. History shows that it is almost a truism to say that in a democracy, in which it is difficult to divert an adequate share of resources to military preparedness - in contrast to what happens on the other side of the iron curtain - men who follow the profession of arms during the years of peace often lose their professional reputation, their most cherished possession, on the outbreak of war, for they are not backed by the resources that are available to their fascist or totalitarian enemies. A democracy needs some time, at least, in which to accumulate the resources needed for a military effort, and those who must lead the democracies in the early stages of a war must bear the burden of this. </para>
                    <para>I believe that that is a reasonably accurate picture of what happened in 1914 and 1939. In the lieht of that, nothing could be more feeble than the attempt of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>

The way in which that statement was played up is a superb illustration of the fact that newspapers always seek the sensational. .No democracy can ever be ready during peace-time for immediate mobilization. That will be just as true in the years to come as it was in 1953 and in the years before and after. No democratic government, whatever its political colour, will appropriate a sufficient proportion of a country's resources to enable it to be ready for mobilization in peace-.time. The adoption of such a feeble argument does the Leader of the Opposition no credit. . </para>

                            <para>-  I have certainly read the relevant paragraphs, and I do not wish to retract one word that I have uttered concerning them. The type of criticism that we have heard from honorable senators opposite is just as invalid as the continual newspaper criticism which is echoed so thankfully by honorable senators on the other side of the chamber. One would think that there was vice, not virtue, in our having a Prime Minister with such a great gift of expression. We are indeed fortunate to have a man with such attributes as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr, Menzies</inline> at the helm of this nation. Of course, this criticism comes from the Prime Minister's enemies, political and otherwise, within Australia. If we could conduct an 'international -gallup poll we should find that no other man is regarded as a greater figure on the international political stage. Honorable senators opposite do not like 'to admit it. I ask them: Who was chosen to lead the -mission to  President  Nasser? </para>

                    <para>Let me look now at such of the criticism from the Leader of the Opposition as can be described as definite, and not merely vague and indiscriminate. I described <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Toohey's</inline> remarks as the most foolish 1 had ever heard, but I think he was surpassed by the Leader of the Opposition when he said that a brigade of the Australian Imperial Force could be a liability. Interjecting, I said, " That will be the day! " During the suspension for dinner, I have been wondering how I could improve on that interjection and have found that I can- not. We are asked ito accept the view that a brigade of men who have <inline font-style="italic">&gt;no</inline> -equal as fighters in the world would be so poorly equipped as to become a liability. Nothing could more adequately prove that we are a nation of knockers, and that the Australian Labour .party is the prince of all knockers. Honorable senators need have no doubt about the matter. When troops are needed the fiercest competition of all will be for the services of the A.I.F. </para>
                    <para>I have -said already that the profession of arms has its problems. 1 might add, not without some diffidence, that the measure of success in military effort, particularly in a democracy, notwithstanding all the changes that have taken place in modern warfare, is the state of the volunteer forces. After all, the members of the permanent forces choose their calling voluntarily. Therefore, not entirely, but to a material extent, we must look to the effect of our policies on the volunteer element in the forces. I refer the Senate -to the numbers of men in the Navy, Army, and Air Force, as shown by .the defence statistics. In 1950 the total number of men in the forces was 57,568, whereas to-day the total is 132,988. I do not say that we have done everything that we should have done, but after all, irrespective of technical advances, it still remains true that in any circumstances it is the personnel of the forces that provides the backbone of defence preparedness. I think that a good deal of satisfaction can be felt in the growth of the forces from 57,500 to nearly 133,000 in the period I have mentioned. </para>
                    <para>We heard what I regarded as confused arguments on the intake of national servicemen. Defence is -a very costly business, and there is a limit to the 'depth of the purse and the amount of money that we can .provide. We have to spend the money that is available to what we consider to be the best advantage. It is true that, as the years go on, an increasing proportion of the overall defence expenditure is being directed to what might be called the scientific services. In Australia we have been fortunate that the United Kingdom is doing an increasing proportion of the work in that direction that is being done at Woomera. We are trying to achieve a balanced effort. We are aiming at a Commonwealth military force of about 50,000 men, of which the national service intake will provide 12,000. 1 wish to refer particularly to one irresponsible statement on the part of the Opposition. I get 'the statements of the Opposition and the newspaper somewhat confused. Perhaps I should not do so. One point that emerges, above all others, from this debate, is that all that the Opposition is doing is jumping on the " Sydney Morning Herald " bandwagon and trying to ride it home. The Opposition has no views or policy of its own. All that it is prepared to do is to adopt the criticism of any critic of the Government, no matter whom he may be. The particular criticism to which I refer is that the Government should have discontinued altogether the national service training scheme. That is an irresponsible statement. </para>

                            <para>-^I do not know that it took us six years or thai we have made any mistakes. I hold the view that the national service training scheme has been one of the greatest .contributions to the building of national character in Australia, and I should have liked us to have the resources to maintain it. It is irresponsible to say that the scheme should be discontinued, because it makes a substantial contribution to the defence effort. Not only does it provide the numbers to make up the Commonwealth military force, but it also provides in that force a substantial proportion of tradesmen and other skilled personnel. </para>

                    <para>It was also stated that the brigade group is a military sham and a political fraud. Nothing really could be further from the truth. All the advice that we have is that this brigade group of the Regular Army will be a highly trained, hard-hitting, mobile force which, in the early stages of any emergency, could make a most effective contribution. Of course, we wish we had two brigade groups, but we have one, and it is a very effective force for the purpose for which it is needed. It is said that tradesmen ;have been -drafted as infantry privates and than men 'with 'only -'Six months more to serve and men over sthe age of 35 years have been posted to the brigade group. All that we can say is that we are unable to find proof of these allegations, lt is a new method of approach "for the Leader 'of the Opposition to call on us to disprove these allegations, and 'to conclude by saying, "Here is this newspaper criticism. I want answers to question's A, B, C, D and E. I want this information provided by the Government ". Opposition senators produce criticism which is not substantiated and put on the Government the onus of disproof. Instead of being men enough to substantiate the allegations they rely on newspaper reports. </para>
                    <para>One of the newspaper articles states that there are no reinforcements for the brigade group. The fact is that 450 to 500 men, Who can be used for that purpose, are always in 'training. The Army makes the best use of its manpower. It would be nonsense for the Army indiscriminately 'to transfer tradesmen into non-trade appointments. The establishment of this brigade group has required a large scale reorganization. When thie Oppposition makes such an allegation, it is the responsibility of the Opposition to prove it and not to hide behind the skirts of the " Sydney Morning Herald ". This is the Parliament of the country. If the Opposition wants to make this allegation, let us have chapter and verse in support of it. I do not believe for one minute that it is correct. In a large scale reorganization, there may have been a few such instances, but if so we have not any knowledge of them. The job of the Opposition is not to make vague statements; If it has a sense of responsibility it should give us some specific illustrations. </para>

                            <para>- They were not questions asked. The Opposition produced them as allegations, but lacked the courage to say that it made the allegations. It is quite wrong to say that men who are on the verge of retirement are transferred to the brigade group, because, so far as we know, nobody with less than twelve months to serve has been transferred to the group. The criticism is that they have been, transferred. </para>

                            <para>- Why does not the Opposition give some information in support of these statements, instead of only froth and bubble? Not one substantial statement has come from the Opposition during the debate. The men who were transferred to this brigade group had to undergo a most rigorous and vigorous medical examination. Everybody posted to the brigade group, so far as we are informed, was classified medically as being class 1. </para>

                    <para>I think that the criticism that has been levelled at the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Philip McBride)</inline> is grossly unfair. He is one of the most capable and experienced Ministers in the Cabinet, and I should think that no Minister has a more difficult portfolio to administer than he has. It is all very well to sit in an armchair, or on the Opposition side, and refer loosely to the FI 04 fighter aircraft. We, as a government, are always willing to provide the best material and equipment that we can for our fighting forces, within the limits of our resources, and I hope we are always willing to look at things sensibly and not be afraid to do what is right each time. </para>
                    <para>I find no problem in acting upon advice which says, in effect, that remembering the integration of forces that will come in an emergency, remembering that this nation will do this, and that nation will do the other thing, the best course for Australia to adopt is to re-equip with the Sabre. I find no difficulty in that. It is to our credit that we have done so, even though there may have been a temptation to have a more spectacular machine. What we have done, events in the future will show to have been the sound, proper and correct course. </para>
                    <para>Then there is all this nonsense about the FN rifle. We are getting the FN rifle just as quickly as it is possible for us to do so. You cannot make a rifle without plans and specifications, which you cannot get until they are released from overseas. This has to dovetail with other arrangements. It is completely wrong for the Opposition to say that there has been delay in this matter. With respect, I say that the Opposition has got to learn the lesson that abuse is not criticism. That has been the tenor of the debate. There has been no criticism of consequence, and no constructive statements from the Opposition. </para>
                    <para>I shall repeat what I said earlier, that I doubt whether a more detailed explanation has ever been given than was given during the debate on the Appropriation Bill. Remembering the wealth of information that was provided, I say that it does no credit to anybody to say, or to insinuate, that the Government has put its defence effort forward in an attempt to commit a fraud, or to deceive the country. Everything has been open and above board. The Opposition hardly mentioned defence during the debate on the Estimates. </para>

                        had the effrontery to say that there has been trickery in dealing with the trust funds. All these trust funds are before the Parliament each year. They go before the Auditor-General, and I think I am correct in saying that the majority of them have been the subject of examination by the Public Accounts Committee. As I have said, it is all out in the open. In 1950-51, £57,000,000 was paid into the Strategic Stores and Equipment Reserve. Tn the following year, 1951-52, £10,000,000 was paid in, making a total of £67,000,000. The defence allocation in 1950-51 was £133,400,000 and we expended £148,000,000 thus overspending the defence allocation. We would have been justified in drawing upon the trust account to the extent of the over-expenditure, but we did not do so. We felt that it was a wise and prudent course to let the trust account run on in order to provide for contingencies that might arise in the future. In 1951-52, the vote was £149,000,000, but we expended £159,000,000. We drew on the trust account to increase expenditure by a further £7,800,000. In the third year, 1952-53, the vote was £200,000,000, but we expended £215,000,000. Again, we might have drawn on the trust account for the excess, but did not do so.
                    </para>
                    <para>To summarize the position, 1 point out that in 1950-51 and 1951-52 we paid into the trust account a total amount of £67,000,000, and in the three years we withdrew £18,100,000 from the trust account, leaving a balance - I think this figure is correct- of £48,900,000. Therefore, the defence expenditure ran close enough to the appropriation year by year, in the last two years being almost exactly equal to the estimate. </para>
                    <para>In the early years, there were great difficulties in getting equipment. The Government acted wisely and cautiously in making appropriations to cover those contingencies and in not drawing upon the trust account when it perhaps could have done so because its total expenditure on defence exceeded the votes. When we got to the stage at which appropriation and expenditure were running fairly evenly, we decided there was no further need for the trust account and we transferred the balance in that account to the Loan Consolidation and Investment Reserve. In truth, we took the money out of one pocket and put it into another. As is always the case, I understand, in these transfers of government accounts, the transfer was made on the basis of the market price of the securities as at the date of the transfer. </para>

It must be remembered that in debates on defence the Opposition has consistently talked in terms of reducing the defence vote, but never at any stage has it given any indication of the way in which it says that the defence vote could be spent to greater advantage than it has been spent by this Government over the years. For the reasons I have given, and against the background I have portrayed, I say that the criticism of the Opposition is not justified. </para>

                        <para>. - The Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner),</inline> along with his colleagues the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O'sullivan)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gorton,</inline> spent a considerable time condemning the series of articles written by the staff correspondents of the " Sydney Morning Herald ".

It has changed and chopped its policy every few months as a result of the activities of the Minister foi External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> who has been running round the world minding every one else's business. </para>

                    <para>If we are to accept as a criterion the piffling platitudes that have been uttered this evening in defence of the Government's policy, it is no wonder that our defences are so vulnerable and so open to criticism. The Opposition is duty-bound to raise lithe Parliament at the first available oppo&gt; tunity the criticisms that have been made of the Government's defence policy by the press. I commend the Leader of the Opposition for the brilliant manner in which he presented his case to the Senate this afternoon. Not one of the points he raised has been answered effectively. </para>

                        used extravagant language. By virtually abusing every one on this side of the Senate and by abusing those who write for the " Sydney Morning Herald ", he demonstrated the weakness of our defences and of the defence policy of the Government.

                        quoted from a statement of defence statistics recently circulated by the Minister for Defence
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Philip McBride).</inline>
                        That statement in itself is eloquent testimony that

                        Shedden was quite right when he said that in 1953 Australia was not ready for mobilization. One article says, " Menzies has given us words but not soldiers ". The figures contained in the statement circulated by the Minister for Defence bear out that assertion. The statement gives the personnel strength of the Defence Forces for the period from June, 1950, to June, 1957, and the estimated strength for 1957-58. The estimate for 1957-58 is 123,645, compared with an actual figure of 132,988 in June, 1957. That is an estimated reduction from 132,988 to 123,645. The figure for June, 1956, is shown as 146,576.

He spent his time uttering piffling platitudes that were not worth listening to. It is annoying to find the Government, as it were, running away from this debate with its tail between its legs and not answering the charges that have been made. It is a crying disgrace that we have such people responsible for the defence of this country. The Opposition has a duty to criticize. It also has a duty to support any move that is made by public spirited and responsible people in the community to check upon the Government's policy, or lack of policy. I would not mind so much if the Government had a policy, but although the Prime Minister has dealt with all sorts of things in his various defence statements, what he has said really amounts to nothing. On one occasion, he said- - </para>

The FI 04 is an aircraft which can travel much faster than the speed of sound. Aircraft of this type could protect this country adequately from attack by any present long-range aircraft. There is a barrier to aircraft travelling much faster than, say, 4 or 5 machs. It is the heat barrier. Because metals start to melt, we cannot get past the heat barrier as we can get through the sound barrier. Therefore, if we were to have aircraft like the FI 04, which can easily break the sound barrier, we would have efficient aircraft for some years at least until guided missiles were developed with such accuracy that they replaced aircraft or until metals that could withstand the heat barrier were developed. So far, aircraft that can pass the heat barrier have not been developed. If the Government were to have aircraft like the FI 04 to defend our shores- </para>

We could handle the defence of the Pacific quite adequately with such aircraft.

In fact, the Americans are not prepared to supply the exact details on the ground of security. Let us get on with a consideration of the Government's policy or lack of policy. Great play has been made of the speech that the Prime Minister delivered on 19th September. The right honorable gentleman, referring to his April statement, said - </para>

                        <para>After describing the structure of the Air Force, I indicated that we were planning to re-arm, by the addition of fighter aircraft of a performance equivalent to the Lockheed F104 and the transport aircraft of the type of the C130. </para>

                    <para class="block">Then he described the CI 30 as having a large uplift capacity coupled with a range of approximately 2,000 miles and a cruising speed of approximately 300 miles an hour. The Government proposes to buy a dozen of those aircraft, which are to form the transport command. To purchase twelve such aircraft is just a piffling token rather than a proper workmanlike approach to the problem of defence. I emphasize that we are not talking about offence but about defence in these days of inter-continental guided missiles. We cannot throw our weight about and bluff our way; we must be content with defending this country in conjunction with our allies. </para>
                    <para>The Government not only has not honoured its promise to provide adequate defence measures but also has adopted the attitude that, if any one dares to raise the subject by way or" asking questions, to divulge the information sought would be to breach security. If the matter is raised by way of open generalized criticism, the Government adopts the attitude that it is inspired for political purposes. We need only to take the replies that have been given by the Leader of the Government in this place and the Minister for National Development to show that the Government has no policy at all but that it is leading the Australian people up the lane, so to spealc, and is giving them a false sense of security. </para>
                    <para>Co-ordination is lacking, particularly in regard to the maintenance and construction of roads. Every time the question of roads is raised, the Minister for National Development says it is a State matter. The State Premiers are continually crying out for more money for roads. The co-ordination of the various State roads programmes should be a defence responsibility. </para>
                    <para>Figures indicating the enormous cost of the maintenance of aerodromes have been quoted. Half of the money that is being expended on the Air Force is being used for this purpose. If this country were to be threatened, I do not know where the Government would obtain the necessary finance to manufacture a fast aircraft to supersede the Avon Sabre. Even though, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kennelly</inline> has indicated, 50 petcent, of the personnel employed in the aircraft production industry have been allowed to drift to other industries, I believe that we must retain intact the nucleus of our aircraft production industry. That so many people should have been allowed to drift from the industry is an indictment against the Government. I believe that, in the absence of a satisfactory alternative, we should have squadrons equipped with Avon Sabre aircraft, at least to train men in the operation of jet aircraft. There is no doubt that jet aircraft will be the weapons of the future until such time as guided missiles are perfected. </para>
                    <para>The defence departments have no definite continuity of policy. The Government's policy has been one of chop and change, as is illustrated by the fact that the Prime Minister's April statement is almost quite the reverse of his September statement. </para>
                    <para>I should like to mention one other passage from the right honorable gentleman's September speech, which is germane to the matter now under consideration. He said -  lt is important that I uJould again say something about the strategic and tactical conceptions which determine the nature of the Australian armed forces, lt is quite impossible from the point of view of the national economy to prepare simultaneously for every conceivable kind of war. </para>

                        said that no democracy would appropriate a sufficient proportion of its resources to enable it to mobilize in peace-time. The Government cannot have two bob each way. Even though  we do  not mobilize in peace-time, we must have a line of defence to protect the internal structure of the country until such time as we do mobilize. I say without equivocation that the Government has no defence policy, that the statements on defence are more or less a sham, and that we are being furnished with a lot of words but no soldiers.

Apparently the author is seeking publicity to make his book a best seller. In this case, I believe that it should not go unchallenged. I wish to quote from a statement that was published to-day in the Sydney " Daily Telegraph ". I realize that probably most Australian newspapers have published this statement. The " Daily Telegraph ", under the headline " Australian troops ' blasted ' ", carried this story - </para>

                    <para>Australians were the worst disciplined troops carried by " Queen Elizabeth " and " Queen Mary " in World War II, says a doctor who served fifteen years in the ships. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>The doctor, Joseph Maguire, has written a book entitled " The Sea My Surgery." My own hope is that his book will find a watery grave. I know it is the custom of cheap writers to make money from their books by condemning a prominent figure. We have had books by cricketers, war lords and others who have condemned prominent persons and have allowed their condemnation to leak out to the press in the hope that the feelings of the public will be stirred. Only recently, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> was the victim of such a publicity-seeking practice. Other cheap authors practically pray that their books will be banned and that the censor's ban will then be lifted so that they may make a fortune. That is their sales talk. </para>
                <para>As for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maguire,</inline> I know that he was not the ship's doctor on the first voyage that " Queen Elizabeth " made as a troop transport. The ship sailed from Sydney on 1st April, 1941, with 3,500 Australian troops for the Middle East via Hobart. I remember that there was a doctor on the ship and he inspected some troops in the sick bay. When he had finished talking to one digger and had moved away, the man who had been examined turned to his cobber and said, " I wonder what he did in Ciwystreet". Perhaps he wrote books like Maguire. </para>
                <para>In criticizing the statements that have been made by the author of this book, I claim that I have some small knowledge and much sincerity. T was orderly room sergeant, ship's staff (military), on " Queen Elizabeth " when it sailed on that voyage from Sydney, and I would be the first to say that it would be easy to upset the 3,500 troops aboard who were leaving on a voyage of mystery to embark on a life fraught with danger. </para>
                <para>There was trouble on board the ship, but it was not caused, as this penny comic author has tried to suggest, by the indiscipline of Australian troops. The trouble was fomented in the five ports of call that were made after 1st April. I make these allegations sincerely and with a lot of knowledge. First of all, " Queen Elizabeth " had a polyglot crew of British merchantmen. For security reasons, they were put on the ship in the United Kingdom not knowing where they were going or what was in store for them. They thought the ship was to undergo trials in the Firth of Forth. The members of the crew were not volunteers. While they were at sea, they were frightened of what the future had in store for them. They tried by every means, at the five ports where we called, to delay the sailing of the ship. 1 exempt the officers of the ship and the engine room crew from any criticism that I am levelling or any charges that I am making to-night. I do say that the other members of the crew took action - and, in some ways, effective action - to cause disturbances. The service personnel included members of the Air Force and, I believe, naval men as well as soldiers, but the trouble was not caused by the indiscipline of the Australians. The crew tried to cause trouble which <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maguire</inline> has attributed to lack of discipline among the Australian troops. </para>
                <para>First, the crew tried to burn the vessel in port. I will stand in any court in this land and prove that allegation to be correct. The members of the crew stole the food that should have been issued to the troops. That was a dastardly action in any man's language. In a clandestine manner the crew tried to sell and, unfortunately, did sell some of the choice joints of meat at prohibitive prices to hungry men of the </para>
                <para class="block">A.I.F. and the R.A.A.F. Would not these actions cause disturbances? In safe Australian waters, and not after we left Fremantle, members of the crew tried, by insidious propaganda, to stir up feelings of uncertainty about and dislike for the service life for which Australians had volunteered. Generally, their attempts to stir up disloyalty were abortive. </para>
                <para>The ship's staff had to combat these pseudo-communistic practices. We knew that there were communist elements among the polyglot crew on " Queen Elizabeth ", but they forgot they were dealing with Anzacs. I say in reply to Maguire - cheap publicity seeker as he is - that the men of the R.A.A.F., the R.A.N, and the Second A.I.F. aboard that ship were not undisciplined. They volunteered for service as did the men of the original A.I.F. in World War 1., and attempts to spread communist seeds of discontent fell on barren ground. </para>
                <para>I do not deny that there was trouble on board the ship. There was almost a brawl in Fremantle. That was the last port where the ne'er-do-wells had an opportunity to cause dissatisfaction in a comparatively safe area. The reaction of the troops was more in the nature of psychological worry, not physical trouble, and I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Maguire</inline> that the A.I.F. marched and sailed according to custom and tradition. I say to him also, because evidently he thinks his pen is mightier than the sword, that he will fail dismally if he attacks the troops of the Second A.I.F. and the members of the R.A.A.F. who sailed in " Queen Mary " and "Queen Elizabeth" between 1939 and 1945. </para>
