            <para>- Has the attention of the Minister for Civil Aviation been drawn to Ansett-A.N.A. advertisements for certain &#34; Rocket &#34; services between capital cities? ls the Minister aware that Trans-Australia Airlines has been using the term &#34; Rocket &#34; in advertising certain of its services since 1951 and that the term is still used in current T.A.A. flight schedules? Is it a fact that airlines advertising slogans are registered with an international air transport body and that since 1951 the term &#34; Rocket &#34; has been so listed as a T.A.A. promotional term? Will the Minister indicate whether this unethical attempt by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ansett</inline> to appropriate a term already extensively used for years by T.A.A. constitutes fair competition? Will the Minister ensure that T.A.A.&#39;s government-assisted competitor will observe accepted business standards in the future? </para>

            <para>- I am aware, of course, that for some years T.A.A. has operated services which it has styled &#34; Rocket &#34; services. I have seen the recent advertisements to which the honorable senator refers in connexion with services now operated by Ansett and described as &#34; Rocket &#34; services.  I  am not aware that there has been any infringement of any ethic, of any undertaking or of any principle that may be laid down in the rules of an international air transport body. I should have thought that had T.A.A. been upset about it, my attention would have been drawn to the matter long before this. That has not been the case. However, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline> raises the possibility of there being some infringement of an undertaking, I shall certainly  be  prepared to have a look at the matter, but  I  do not think there has  been  -such an infringement </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Labour and National Service. Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to the disastrous strike of waterside workers in Sydney? This has been continuing for more than a week and is costing the shipping companies &#163;30,000 a day. In addition, shippers and owners of cargo are suffering serious losses. The dispute has spread to Melbourne and Hobart. Wharf labourers in Melbourne have refused to handle cargo for Sydney left in an overseas liner. This may mean that the liner will have to return overseas with the shipment. It is reported that a ship left Hobart recently without having discharged several hundred tons of sugar urgently required by the Tasmanian fruit-processing industry. This may cause great loss and hardship to fruitgrowers in Tasmania. Is the Commonwealth Government taking immediate action to deal with this urgent situation? If so, what action is being taken? </para>

            <para>- My question, which deals with a subject similar to that referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wardlaw</inline> in his question, is addressed to the Attorney-General. As the Attorney-General is aware, the waterfront stoppage in Sydney was caused by a man named Krespi, who has been described by the Minister for Labour and National Service as &#34; one of our least desirable imports &#34;. The Minister will also be aware that although this man alleges that he was wrongly deregistered by the Australian Stevedoring Industry Authority, he has, with the connivance and support of the Communist party and the Waterside Workers Federation, refused to appeal to the Commonwealth Industrial Court against his deregistration. The Minister will also be aware that the Waterside Workers Federation has placed a black ban on the employer who dismissed Krespi and that the union&#39;s Communist leaders have virtually brought the port of Sydney to a standstill, have spread the dispute to Melbourne, and are trying desperately to spread it to other ports. I ask the Attorney-General - (1.) Is it a fact that on Thursday last a member of the Sydney branch of the Waterside Workers Federation, named Buchan, lodged an appeal to the Commonwealth Industrial Court against his suspension for refusing to work for Krespi&#39;s employer? (2.) Is it a fact that on Friday last the Waterside Workers Federation obtained in the High Court an order nisi to restrain the Commonwealth Industrial Court, and Buchan, from proceeding with the appeal? (3.) Is it not a fact that Buchan and the Waterside Workers Federation have combined to start these proceedings in order to allow Krespi to claim that there is no tribunal to which he can appeal? (4.) Will the Attorney-General have an expert examination made of the documents filed in these cases to ascertain whether, although they purport to be independent of one another, and to have been filed by separate solicitors, they were in fact typed on the one typewriter? (5.) If the documents were in fact typed on the one typewriter, will the Attorney-General advise the Senate whether this attempt to deceive the High Court constitutes any criminal offence by the union, or its officials, or Buchan, or the solicitors concerned? (6.) In any case, as the High Court action is only a sham, and is the result of collusion on the part of Buchan, the union and its Communist leaders, will the AttorneyGeneral move at once in the High Court to have the proceedings struck out and thus expose this plot to prolong the strike and to keep Krespi away from the properly constituted appellate tribunal? </para>

            <para>- My question to the Minister for National Development relates to the recent announcement by the Prime Minister that the Government proposes to make available to the Western Australian Government an amount of &#163;2,500,000 for the development of the north-west of Western Australia. That offer was very generous in the circumstances and was very favorably received by the general public in </para>

          <para class="block">Western Australia, although it was inappropriately reported in the &#34; West Australian &#34;. The Premier of Western Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hawke,</inline> has already endeavoured to embark upon mineral production as a State enterprise and recently announced that he proposes to utilize all the money to which I have referred for mineral production in the north-west, although 1 admit that he has not announced the circumstances in which he proposes to do so. In view of those statements by the Premier of Western Australia, will the Minister inform the Senate that the Government does not propose to make any of this money available for use by the Hawke Government for nationalist or socialist enterprises in the north-west of Western Australia? </para>

            <para>-  I hope that there is no conflict of ideologies or principles between the Commonwealth Government and the Western Australian Government. I should think that the amount of &#163;2,500,000, spread over five years, might well prove a very solid foundation for development in the Kimberleys area which we have been hoping to see for a long time. I should hope that the two governments would work amicably in spending the money to the best advantage. From memory, I believe that the only reservation made by the Commonwealth Government in making the money available is that there must be agreement between the two governments on the projects to which the money will be applied. In those circumstances, I do not consider there is any room for apprehension that the money will be used in a manner unsatisfactory to the Commonwealth Government. I am sure that the Commonwealth Government would be very greatly influenced by the representations of the Western Australian Government on the order of priority in which the money is to be spent. </para>

Secondly, is the Menzies Government aware that if the prices of wheat, bran, and pollard are permitted to rise abruptly by as much as 25 per cent, to 33 per cent., it will cause hardship and ruin to poultry farmers and will cause the price of bread to rise by as much as 4d. a loaf, thereby seriously increasing the cost of living of the people of New South Wales? Thirdly, will the Minister give serious and urgent consideration to the position in New South Wales that has been caused by the drought, to the necessity to import wheat from other States, and to the passing on of freight and other charges to the consumers? Fourthly, will the Menzies Government follow the example of the preceding Labour Government which, on 27th May, 1947, introduced a bill to provide for a payment of &#163;750,000, which is equal to about &#163;2,500,000 in terms of to-day&#39;s money value, to assist New South Wales and also to meet freight on the carriage of wheat to non-wheat-growing States? </para>

If the commission was aware of that fact, did it know that there was a good deal of public interest in the matter in Australia? Why did the commission fail to broadcast the result of the election on Sunday morning last, and especially on the 12.30 p.m. and 1.30 p.m. news services? </para>

Has the attention of the Minister been directed to press reports of a police court case in Perth where a person was charged with having insufficient means of support? Upon the attention of the magistrate being directed  to  the fact that the accused person was in receipt of unemployment benefit, the police still maintained that the .charge should stand, being one of having insufficient means of support. If social service payments are insufficient, according to police standards, and if any citizen unfortunate enough  to  have no income other than a social service: payment is likely to be charged with an* offence, will the Minister consider raising, the amount of the payments to make them more in line with the standard of adequacy required by police standards? </para>

            <para>-  I desire to address a question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. By way of preface, I point out that the general manager of the Victorian Chamber of Commerce, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curphey,</inline> who recently returned from Europe, has been reported as having said that West Germany and Italy have capital, in relatively large amounts, available for investment in Australia. He is further reported as saying that West Germany was &#34; booming beyond anticipation &#34;. As the percentage of immigrants from West Germany and Italy has been very high, could the attention of interests in those countries be invited to the importance to channelling some of their surplus capital towards the provision of housing for their nationals in Australia? The housing policy of this country, by providing accommodation for West German and Italian immigrants, has in the past undergone considerable stress and strain. </para>

            <para>-  My question, which is supplementary to that asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Anderson,</inline> is directed to the Minister responsible for matters concerning bush fire relief. My question is as follows: - If the Commonwealth Government is to make a grant to those who have suffered tragic loss in the Blue Mountains fires - and we must all concur in any such action - will the Government insist that in future the New South Wales Government, and also local governing bodies, take adequate precautions and put out fires in their initial stages, instead of waiting until they reach dangerous proportions before doing so? Is the Minister aware that, though fires were burning near Leura several weeks ago, there was little concerted effort to put them out when it would have been a relatively simple matter to do so? &#91;Question not answered.&#93; </para>

            <para>The registration of every medical and hospital benefit organization under the National Health Act is conditional upon compliance with all relevant State laws. This requirement recognizes the traditional responsibility of the States to exercise control and supervision over friendly societies and other organizations providing similar types of benefits. In Victoria, a number of organizations has adopted differential contribution rates for persons over and under 50 years of age in accordance with requirements of the Victorian authorities. Similar differentiation also applies to Tasmanian friendly societies. In all other States, medical and hospital benefit organizations operate flat-rate contributions regardless of age and have been able to build up reserves on this basis. </para>

          <para class="block">The main purpose of this bill is to amend the Acts Interpretation Act 1901-1950 by defining the &#34; Governor &#34; of a State, for the purpose of any reference in a Commonwealth act, so as to include any other chief executive officer or administrator of the government of the State. The need for the amendment arises as a matter of urgency, in order that an agreement may be executed without delay with the State of Queensland, pursuant to section 5 of the Statistics (Arrangements with States) Act 1956, for the integration of the statistical services of the Commonwealth and the State. This section provides that the Governor-General may enter into an arrangement with &#34; the Governor of a State &#34;. </para>
          <para>The office of Governor of Queensland is at present vacant, and will remain so till February next. The duties of the office are being performed by the Chief Justice, as Administrator. But there is no definition enlarging the meaning of the expression &#34; Governor &#34;, for the purposes of Commonwealth acts, so as to include the person administering the government of the State for the time being. This is the first occasion on which the absence of a provision of this nature has created any difficulty, though the problem could easily have arisen in connexion with other provisions in Commonwealth legislation for the taking of action by a Governor of a State, such as section 78 of the Public Service Act 1922-1957, which provides that the Governor-General may arrange with the Governor of a State for the performance of services for the Commonwealth by an officer of the State Public Service. It is, in fact, surprising that a difficulty similar to the present one has not arisen earlier. </para>
          <para>What is now proposed is an amendment of the Acts Interpretation Act, to extend  to  the interpretation of Commonwealth acts generally the principle already recognized, but only for the purposes of the Constitution itself, by section 110 of the Constitution of the Commonwealth. This section provides that references in the Constitution to the Governor of a State shall extend and apply to the Governor for the time being or other chief executive officer or administrator of the government of the State. The opportunity is also being taken to elaborate the definition of &#34; the Governor-General &#34;, as already contained in the Acts Interpretation Act. The present definition, which is contained in section 17 (f) of the act, provides that &#34; &#39; the Governor-General &#39; shall mean the Governor-General of the Commonwealth, or the person for the time being administering the government  of  the Commonwealth, acting with the advice of the Executive Council &#34;. </para>
          <para>The Constitution of the Commonwealth makes provision, in section 4, for the appointment by the Queen of a person to administer the government of the Commonwealth in the absence of the Governor-General, and, in section 126 for the appointment by the Governor-General himself of deputies to perform such  of  his functions as he may assign to them. The existing definition of &#34; the GovernorGeneral &#34;, contained in section 17 (f), refers to an administrator, but does not refer specifically to a  deputy  appointed by the Governor-General. While no difficulty has been occasioned by the present definition, it is nevertheless desirable that it should contain a reference, not only to an administrator, but also to a  deputy.  The present amendment merely recasts the definition of the expression &#34; the Governor-General &#34;, appearing in any act, so that specific reference is made to a  deputy,  when exercising any function conferred on the Governor-General by the act, and assigned by the Governor-General to the  deputy.  I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

          <para>Clause 6 of the bill is designed to confer on Commonwealth police officers, in relation to the laws of the Commonwealth, all the powers and duties of State police officers, either at common law or by the statute law of the States. The formula at present used follows in substance the provision which has existed since 1925 in the Peace Officers Act. Since the bill was drafted, doubts have been expressed by a New South Wales magistrate whether, by reason of the particular wording of certain State laws, the present formula really achieves the desired result. I am advised that the present formula is adequate, but I see no advantage, a question having been raised, in allowing such a provision to be open to any doubt. A fresh draft of the clause has accordingly been prepared. </para>
          <para>With regard to the schedule, in the interests of brevity and simplicity, the oath of service at present prescribed by the bill is an oath that the officer will well and truly serve &#34; the Commonwealth &#34;. Several of our colleagues have stated a strong preference for an oath of allegiance and service to the Queen, in the usual form. There is, of course, no legal objection to the change, and appropriate new forms of oath and affirmation have been drafted. </para>

It first applied for a period of two years and was then extended following recommendations by the Tariff Board in its report of 8th February, 1957, for a further year to 31st October, 1957. </para>
          <para>Honorable senators will recall that the Tariff Board recommended a three years&#39; extension of bounty, but the act was extended for only one year pending a comprehensive review by the Government of the necessity for the further maintenance of the industry, including the Flax Commission, and the form of assistance. The review has disclosed that the industry is operating under considerable difficulty, attributable principally to the depressed world market for flax following the pressure exerted by Russia in selling low priced, low quality, flax line fibre, and also the necessity for considerable capital expenditure on modern plant and adequate straw coverage. There exists intense overseas competition in the finished product. </para>
          <para>Flax fibre is processed in Australia by the Flax Commission, which is a Commonwealth authority operating mills at Ballarat, Colac, Drouin, Lake Bolac, Myrtleford, and Strathkellar in Victoria, and at Mount Gambier in South Australia. A small cooperative company also operates, with material assistance from the State government, a mill at Boyup Brook, i* Western Australia. The main function of the Flax Commission, as expressed in the Flax Industry Act, is the maintenance and development of the flax industry in Australia to ensure that sufficient supplies of flax are available for defence, and that the industry will have the capacity to produce adequate supplies of flax in the event of war. lt is now, however, apparent that continued assistance to the flax industry cannot be justified on defence grounds alone. </para>
          <para>In the light of the continuing trading losses of the Flax Commission, which last year exceeded &#163;100,000. despite the receipt of bounty, and the urgent need for further capital, the Government has decided to withdraw from the field of flax production at the earliest opportunity by the closure of the mills in Victoria and South Australia after the current year&#39;s harvest has been processed. Naturally, consideration will be given to any offers to purchase mills as going concerns, and the benefits of the bounty will continue to be available on the flax subsequently produced and sold. </para>
          <para>The following amounts of bounty have been paid on flax produced and sold since 1st November, 1954: - Year ended 30th June, 1955, &#163;4,907; year ended 30th June, 1956, &#163;58,070; year ended 30th June, 1957, &#163;49,823. The present bounty entitlement for the current year is &#163;40,922. </para>
          <para>The productive capacity of Australian processors of flax line fibre is regarded as being in the vicinity of 1,450 tons per annum, but actual production has not attained that figure. Tonnages sold to spinners during the years ended 30th June, 1955, 1956 and 1957 were respectively 1,188, 1,157 and 871 tons. In the last two years this fell far short of the capacity of the market to absorb supplies, and 934 and 1,216 tons of fibre were imported in the respective years. </para>
          <para>The bounty proposals follow the Tariff Board recommendations, except in two directions. It is proposed to re-commence the application of the recommendations as from 1st November, 1957, and to eliminate the annual limitation on the amount payable as bounty on the sales of any one year. The extension of the period of bounty for a further period of three years is proposed because it would cover the Flax Commission during the closing down of operations, would give the co-operative in Western Australia the opportunity to rehabilitate itself and complete its plans for the installation of new machinery and facilities so necessary for economic production, and would give a measure of assistance to the purchasers of any of the commission&#39;s mills. </para>
          <para>An annual limitation on the amount payable as bounty is deemed unnecessary because the maximum rate of bounty has been fixed at &#163;75 per ton of fibre and payments are limited to what the market can take; that is, bounty is paid on sales. The expectations are that bounty payments are unlikely to exceed &#163;90,000 per annum. The basic rate of bounty is &#163;65 per ton of Grade B fibre, and it is proposed, in accordance with the Tariff Board recommendations, to reduce this rate progressively by &#163;5 in the second and third year as results flow from the anticipated efficiency following in the capital improvements. The present practice of adjusting the basic bounty rate inversely, and by the same amount, as movements in the landed cost of imported fibre, will be continued. The maximum amount by which the rate of bounty can so rise is &#163;10. </para>
          <para>Honorable senators supported the bill for the original act to give assistance to this industry, and I am sure that they will raise no objection to the extension of its application till 31st October, 1960. The question of further assistance after that date will be the subject of a reference to the Tariff Board, and will receive consideration in the light of the circumstances then prevailing. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

          <para>That the bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para class="block">The main purpose of this bill is to give effect to the proposal announced by the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Arthur Fadden)</inline> in his budget speech for an increase in the rate of Commonwealth additional hospital benefit. I would like to refresh honorable senators&#39; recollections by explaining two terms used to describe hospital benefit. The term &#34; Commonwealth benefit &#34; means the 8s. per occupied bed per day paid by the Commonwealth as the result of an agreement with State governments, and the term &#34; Commonwealth additional benefit &#34; means the amount paid through hospital benefit organizations to persons who insure themselves with those organizations. </para>
          <para>At the present time, the rate of Commonwealth hospital benefit is 8s. a day, and the rate of Commonwealth additional benefit is 4s. a day. The increase proposed is to the additional benefit, and it is a substantial one. Commonwealth benefit is de- ducted from the hospital accounts of all patients, both insured and uninsured. Additional benefit is, as I have said, paid to the persons who are members of hospital insurance organizations registered under the National Health Act. This bill provides that the rate of additional benefit will be increased to 12s. a day for persons who are insured with registered hospital benefit funds for a fund benefit of 16s. a day or more. The Commonwealth additional benefit rate of 4s. a day will be retained for persons whose insurance premiums entitle them to a fund benefit of at least 6s. a day, but less than 16s. a day. It will be entirely a matter of choice for contributors, but I would like to point out that a great many are already insured for 16s. a day or more. It will be apparent that this increase will be a great help both to members of hospital insurance funds and to all concerned with the problems of financing hospitals throughout Australia. I want to remind the Senate that the principle of the Commonwealth additional benefit is to help those who help themselves, to assist individuals to make provision for expenses they may incur. This was clearly stated when the scheme was first introduced. It is in fact subsidized insurance, a partnership between the government and the people. The Commonwealth additional benefit is designed to help individuals to handle their problems of living and make their way in this developing country. </para>
          <para>This scheme has been an outstanding success. The number of persons covered by registered hospital insurance organizations has increased from 1,900,000 in January, 1952, the year in which the scheme was introduced, to nearly 6,000,000 to-day. Approximately 61 per cent, of the Australian people are now covered for hospital insurance. Many others are taken care of by direct Government aid, e.g., pensioners, repatriation patients and others. </para>
          <para>Commonwealth ordinary benefit of 8s. a day for every hospital patient is now being paid at a rate of more than &#163;6,000,000 a year to public hospitals and &#163;2,000,000 a year to private hospitals. The total value of this direct aid to hospital patients and hospitals throughout Australia has been over &#163;37,000,000 over the last five years. </para>
          <para>Commonwealth additional benefit of 4s. a day to insured persons is now being paid at a rate approaching &#163;2,000,000 a year. Payments of this benefit have been worth nearly &#163;7,000,000 to patients during the last five years. The same patients have also received, by way of fund benefit, something like &#163;20,000,000 over the last five years, and these payments of fund benefit are currently being made at a rate of &#163;7,000,000 per year. These are very large sums of money, and they speak for themselves as to the benefits flowing to hospitals and hospital patients as a result of the Commonwealth hospital insurance scheme. This amendment will produce further benefits. </para>
          <para>In passing, it is appropriate to point out that these two benefits are not by any means the only assistance provided by the Federal Government to the Australian hospital system. Another instance of which I wish to remind the Senate is the fact that the Commonwealth provides all the capital expenditure for chest hospitals, and nearly all the maintenance expenditure. As a result of this, such buildings as the thoracic blocks at Royal Prince Alfred Hospital, the Royal North Shore Hospital and St. Vincent&#39;s Hospital in Sydney, the large hospital being completed at Chermside in Brisbane, another large chest hospital in Perth, and many others throughout the Commonwealth have been erected without cost to the States, who will make full use of them. </para>
          <para>It is considered that this increase in the Commonwealth additional benefit rate will only be completely effective if it is accompanied by something like a corresponding increase in the payment of fund benefit. It is for this reason that the bill provides for the 12s. a day Commonwealth additional benefit to be payable to persons who are insured for a fund benefit of 16s. a day or more. The premium for a fund benefit of 16s. a day is about ls. 6d. a week (family rate). </para>
          <para>I am sure all will agree that the benefits to be derived from such a low premium are now most attractive, and that contributors who are insured for a lower amount have every reasonable incentive to transfer to a 16s. a day or higher rate table and so qualify for 12s. a day Commonwealth additional benefit. In common with all other hospital patients, these contributors will also have the Commonwealth benefit of 8s. a day deducted from their accounts, making, with the fund benefit, a total of at least 36s. a day available towards the cost of their hospital expenses. It may be, however, that some contributors will prefer to remain in their present tables, for example, 6d. a week for a fund benefit of 6s. a day, or ls. a week for a fund benefit of 12s. a day. For these persons, the present Commonwealth additional benefit of 4s. a day will be retained. </para>
          <para>Up to the present, Commonwealth hospital benefits have always become payable immediately upon a contributor joining a registered insurance organization. The organizations themselves find it necessary to provide for a waiting period - generally of about two months - after joining an organization during which fund benefit is not payable. With the introduction of a new Commonwealth rate of 12s. a day, the Government thinks it is reasonable that there should be a waiting period for Commonwealth additional benefit in conformity with the practice of hospital benefit organizations. This bill, therefore, provides that as a general rule Commonwealth additional benefit will not be payable at either the 4s. or 12s. rate in respect of hospital treatment given during the first two months after a person becomes a contributor. An exception will be made in cases where the organization pays fund benefit in accordance with its rules, for example, accidents which occur after a contributor joins a fund. The waiting period clause will not debar payment of benefit in cases where the contributor transfers from one registered organization to another, or in cases where a contributor transfers from one benefit table to another within his own organization. Those already insured will, of course, be unaffected. This is consistent with the Treasurer&#39;s announcement in his Budget speech. </para>
          <para>There is, moreover, an important reason for this waiting period. As the Commonwealth additional benefits are now substantial, it would be quite possible to defeat the principles of hospital insurance by shortterm insurance so that contributors obtained only temporary cover and ceased to pay contributions as soon as they left hospital. It is obvious that this could have widespread effects of a most undesirable nature. I need hardly point out that the institution of a waiting period makes it all the more advisable for those contemplating hospital insurance to effect it as early as possible, especially as it is expected that the benefits provided by this bill will be made available for hospital treatment received by insured persons on and after 1st January next. </para>
          <para>As a consequence of the increase in the rate of benefit, this bill includes a number of clauses to effect necessary amendments to machinery provisions of the hospital benefit sections of the act. I will be pleased to explain these amendments in detail and to provide honorable senators with any additional information they require during the committee stages of the bill. </para>
          <para>In addition to the increase in Commonwealth additional hospital benefit rates already referred to, it is proposed by this bill to correct a number of anomalies and inconsistencies in the amounts of medical benefits specified in the schedules to the act. Numerically, these amendments are fairly extensive, but no general increase in the rates of benefit is involved. Many of the medical services concerned are new medical techniques, or treatments which have come under notice since the schedule was last revised. A statement giving full particulars of these amendments is being circulated for the information of honorable senators. </para>
          <para>The opportunity is also being taken to effect a complete revision of the format of the schedules of medical benefit. This revision has been undertaken at the request of medical benefit insurance organizations, who are experiencing certain mechanical difficulties in processing claims under the existing schedules. This revision involves a re-arrangement and renumbering of the items in the schedules, but the changes in amounts of benefit or the substance of the items in the schedules are negligible. The statement circulated to honorable senators fully explains the nature of the changes being made to the schedules. These alterations are also expected to be effective from 1st January, 1958. </para>
          <para>This bill will provide very substantial benefits for the community. The value of the increase in rate of Commonwealth additional hospital benefits is estimated to be about &#163;3,000,000 in a full year. The medical benefits amendments are mostly by way of minor adjustments but are estimated to be worth about &#163;105,000 in a full year. I therefore hope that the bill will receive the full support of all honorable senators. </para>

            <para>.- Before the debate was adjourned, we were quite obviously looking for an opportunity to consider these regulations, and, as we were drifting towards an adjournment, I did take the trouble to direct the attention of the Senate to the provisions of the regulation which exempts these canteens from any licensing laws of a State. Regulation 24 permits the Royal Australian Air Force Canteens Service Board, upon such terms and conditions as it determines, to - </para>
          </talk.start>

              <para>. grant to any person a licence to trade in an Air Force establishment or unit for the purpose of rendering a service not catered for in that establishment or unit by the Canteens Service. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">Further consideration of these provisions induces me to believe that, unless there is a practical instance of abuse, one would be justified in accepting the view that they will be strictly confined to Air Force canteens purposes and can be permitted. </para>
          <para>But a perusal of regulation 19 shows what I think is a serious departure from the proper situation that we should permit. These regulations are made under the Air Force Act in relation to Air Force canteens. Regulation 19 reads - </para>

              </item>
            </list>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is difficult to understand the situation here because the Regulations and Ordinances Committee had before it, in May, 1956, a similar bid for power on the part of the Air Board itself by means of an Air Force regulation. That regulation provided that where the Commonwealth had suffered damage, or where there was a deficiency of stores, if the Air Board considered that the loss or damage had been caused through the neglect of a member, that member should be liable to pay to the Commonwealth an amount, and the amount should be deductible from the member&#39;s pay. </para>
          <para>The Regulations and Ordinances Committee reported to the Senate that the regulation authorized deductions from a member&#39;s pay not only for deficiency of stores and materials, but also for third party claims. That objection is not available to the regulations now under consideration. The Regulations and Ordinances Committee also reported that the regulation authorized deductions from a member&#39;s pay of unlimited amounts, without appeal, without providing a member with any procedure, such as a court martial or civil court action, to be heard, and without protecting any proportion of the member&#39;s periodical pay. </para>
          <para>When that report was tabled, the Minister for Air <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Osborne)</inline> withdrew those regulations. The Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Davidson)</inline> withdrew similar regulations in his department, and we are still waiting - with some anxiety and increasing impatience, as I indicated to the Minister when I spoke on the Estimates - a replacement of those regulations by regulations which are proper to protect Commonwealth property consistently with justice to members of the forces. </para>
          <para>It is in that context that this lapsed regulation provides that where, in consequence of a sentence or award of a court-martial, a sum is required to be paid by a member of the Air Force to make good loss or damage occasioned by the commission of an offence by the member, that sum shall be deemed to be a debt. I owe an acknowment to the draftsman of the regulations inasmuch as this regulation 19 is to some extent an improvement on the regulation made in 1945, which it intended to replace, in that the liability under the old regulation was expressed to be imposed on the member, irrespective of whether there has been a court-martial or other inquiry. </para>
          <para>Having said that, I submit that this regulation directly infringes what is proper in respect of a regulation. The Senate will notice that the regulation states, &#34;Where, in consequence of a sentence or award of a court-martial, a sum is required to be paid to make good the loss &#34;. The regulation does not say, &#34; Where in pursuance of the order of a court-martial . . .&#34; or &#34; Where, in accordance with the award of a court-martial, a sum has been adjudged by that tribunal to be paid &#34;. It says, &#34;Where, in consequence of a sentence or award of a court-martial ... a sum is required to be paid &#34;. Such language is totally inapt to impose liability in respect of a decision of court-martial or the C.O.&#39;s orderly room. I can see how the draftsman has lapsed into that latitude because he has embodied language which was in the previous regulation in another context. But the fact is that the regulation, if permitted by the Senate, will apply to the case where, in consequence of a court-martial, a member is required by the Royal Australian Air Force Canteens Service Board to pay a sum in replacement of loss or damage. If it depended upon that technical position, I do not know that I should be disposed to persist in opposition to it, because I would think that any draftsman to whose attention that obvious awkwardness of expression was drawn would remedy it by an amendment to the regulations. </para>
          <para>But the objection to this regulation stands out clearly. The regulation purports to give to an Air Force disciplinary tribunal, a court-martial or a C.O.&#39;s orderly room, the right to adjudge the payment of a civil liability as a debt without limit in respect of amount. </para>

That is to say, where, in consequence of an officer&#39;s dealing summarily with a charge, a sum is required to be paid by the member to the Canteens Board to make good the loss to any of the board&#39;s property, that sum shall be deemed to be a debt due and owing by the member to the board.

          <para>Apart altogether from this surprising situation, there is a matter to which I direct attention. In consequence of an officer dealing summarily in an orderly room with a charge or as a result of a court-martial an unlimited amount may be required to be paid, and that sum becomes a debt. It is not the function of either a court-martial or a commanding officer&#39;s orderly room io adjudge whether a member of the Air Force :is civilly liable to pay to the Canteens Service Board a sum of money to make good damage that has been done to the board&#39;s property. The proper function of a courtmartial and a commanding officer&#39;s orderly room is simply disciplinary. </para>
          <para>Apart from other authorities established for the purpose of imposing discipline, they are quite properly invested with authority to make deductions to a limited amount from a member&#39;s pay so long as an appropriate proportion is retained after each deduction to make a liveable surplus available to the member. That penal deduction, by way of discipline, is the function of those authorities alone. </para>
          <para>We must be alert in this House to protect members of the forces from having disciplinary tribunals adjudicate upon their civil rights and debts. I am not speaking of this matter merely in the abstract because a relevant case is now actively under consideration by members of this Parliament. It is claimed to be a long lingering example of gross injustice. The amount adjudicated <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> this case was &#163;601. It is a matter of longstanding and reveals the degree to which a sense of injustice has burned into the soul of the complainant concerned. </para>
          <para>I submit that it is entirely wrong for -disciplinary tribunals to claim that they -should have the right to adjudicate on civil debts. It is perfectly appropriate that they should have the right to make a penal deduction up to a limited amount, so long as they preserve, in the weekly deductions, a proper balance between the amount that is deducted and the liveable surplus upon which the man concerned can maintain his family. As to the right of the Air Force under this regulation to deduct &#163;601 or &#163;1,000, I submit that it is our responsibility to protect the members of the forces, while requiring a ;proper regulation to be brought in for the protection of Commonwealth property. </para>
          <para>I have mentioned a particular case because at the committee stage, I intend to move an amendment to the bill designed to -exclude Regulation 19 from the regulations to which this bill seeks to give validity. </para>

            <para>.- I had intended to speak on this bill in a context different from that which it has been discussed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I had intended merely to direct the attention of the Senate to the extraordinary manner in which history repeats itself, and to acquaint the Senate with the sensitivity that was felt in the House of Commons when a similar matter arose. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> and the department under his administration, having assumed responsibility for ensuring that the regulations under discussion are tabled, have conceded that the failure to table them previously was the result of an oversight that has not been allowed to run on for a very long time. I was interested to read in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Morrison&#39;s work &#34; Government and Parliament &#34;, which was published as recently as 1954, a whole section dealing with Ministers and civil servants under the heading &#34; An Unfortunate Blunder &#34;. </para>

          <para>At the risk of prolonging this debate unduly and, perhaps, of boring honorable senators, I think it would be salutary if I read a section of this work as part of my contribution to the debate, because I think it would be as well for honorable senators to realize how an unfortunate circumstance of this kind was handled in the Mother of Parliaments. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morrison</inline> recalled an incident such as this in these words - </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morrison</inline>goes on to discuss a position that arose in England in the early stages of World War II. when it was decided to bring the national fire-fighting services under a central authority - particularly the services in Scotland - so that a common rule would apply to all of them. First, there was departure from constitutional practice which would be to present a detailed bill to the House of Commons and let procedures merge in a detailed act of Parliament. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morrison</inline> was not prepared to do that because of the exigencies of war so he insisted - to use his own term, &#34;to the dismay of the parliamentary draftsman &#34; - on presenting a small bill, leaving the substance of the requirements to be carried into effect by rather extensive regulations. Then,  by an unfortunate oversight, the regulations were not tabled. That position continued for three years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morrison</inline> continues the story in these words - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I had one such experience when I was Home Secretary and Minister of Home Security in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill&#39;s</inline> War Government. It was a curious and, in a way, sad circumstance that this serious mishap occurred in the Home Office with its long traditions of constitutional rectitude, and not in the freshly created war-time Ministry of Home Security. The service concerned was the Fire Service. The use of the incendiary bomb by the enemy involved widespread fire risks. Experience showed not only that it was very difficult, if not impossible, to get a quick mobilization and concentration of the local fire brigades over a wide area on a town or district that had been subject to severe enemy attack, but also that the differing practices and the grading of the officers and men and the variations in equipment and methods of fire-fighting made it impossible adequately to blend the contingents brought together from a wide variety of local authorities of various sizes and with somewhat varying practices and traditions. They were all brave men, and I am not here arguing about the efficiency of the local organizations for their peace-time duties. But we were at war; and, though I am a local government man and did not like taking away local authority services, the nation was fighting for its life and the national interest really required that we put the situation right for the period of the war. So it was necessary to establish a National Fire Service. All the strains that fell on Ministers at that time, especially on those who, like myself, were taking a major part in resisting the enemy, made it undesirable that much parliamentary time should be spent on the consideration of what would inevitably have been a substantial and detailed Bill, quite apart from the labour involved in its preparation. I therefore decided (at first, I fear, somewhat shocking the parliamentary draftsman) that the Bill must be a short one. In substance it enabled the Secretaries of State for the Home Department and for Scotland by means of Regulations to transfer for the war period the local fire brigades to themselves and to set up a National Fire Service. </para>
            <para>Naturally, however, the parliamentary right to challenge the Regulations was provided for. The Act accordingly stipulated that each Regulation should be laid before Parliament &#39; as soon as may be after it is made&#39; and that either House could by negative resolution annul it within twenty-eight sitting days after laying. The quick merging - and it had to be quick - of the local fire brigades into the National Fire Service was a huge task which very much occupied the labours and attention of the Home Office Fire Division and myself. Anyway, a terrible thing happened - everybody forgot to bring the Regulations before Parliament; the Department forgot, I forgot, and it was no less extraordinary . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I think it was very extraordinary -  that neither House of Parliament noticed that the Regulations had not been submitted. Not one M.P. or Peer spotted it. Nor did the Press. </para>
          <para>It was not until some three years after the passing of the Act, during which we had gone right ahead in organizing and operating the National Fire Service, that somebody in the Home Office discovered that we had&#39; committed a capital parliamentary offence </para>
          <para>Those are the terms in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morrison</inline> regarded matters of this sort - as &#34; a capital parliamentary offence &#34; - and that the National Fire Service was without full and proper parliamentary authority. Those concerned were most apologetic and very mortified. I was very mortified and very cross. I made my displeasure known, but, after all, I had myself forgotten, although a Minister rather expects the Department to bring such things forward. Nevertheless, I was guilty as well as the Department. And indeed the House of Commons and the House of Lords were guilty, too, for not noticing the offence. But whilst I gently mentioned the fact to the House I was careful not to  rub it in &#39;, for it would not be human to expect the House of Commons to blame itself when it had a Minister &#39; on the spot &#39; who had no alternative but to plead guilty. And it is always well to remember that in the last resort the House of Commons is the master. So I went down to the House of Commons and to its consternation explained what had happened and confessed my guilt, sincerely apologizing &#39; in italics &#39; for the offence; for it was indeed a most serious offence. It was necessary to bring in an Indemnity Bill to validate the error and this gave an opportunity for further apologies. As a whole the House was generous, although quite naturally there were criticisms and some pointed observations about the dangers of delegated legislation. Although (and I do not complain) no M.P. criticised the House and its Members for not having noticed the failure, probably a number of them wished they had noticed it, for what an opportunity it would have been for a really exciting Question in the House whereby the Home Secretary could have been put in the soup. The Home Office and its Secretary of State almost went into mourning. After all, we were not a new-fangled Department like the Ministry of Supply. This serious sin against the rights of parliamentary democracy had been committed by the Home Office with its rich experience of constitutional matters; the Home Office, which was the guardian of civil liberty, the rights of the subject, and of constitutional rectitude. We certainly were ashamed of ourselves </para>
          <para class="block">I just happened to come across that passage, and I thought that in these particular circumstances it would be interesting to bring it to the notice of the Senate. I do not expect the Minister who bears the responsibility for this matter and in whose office, perhaps, the error occurred to come into the chamber thoroughly ashamed or anything of that nature; but the report does show that these things are seriously regarded in that place from which our parliamentary procedures stem. </para>
          <para>There is some reflection on members of this chamber. When all is said and done, it is our responsibility, subject to demands on our time and the opportunities that are available to us, to keep our eyes on such matters. Of course, it is not always practicable to do so, but it is a salutary thought. I think that in future we should regard such matters with the same care and concern as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Morrison</inline> seriously and obviously conscientiously regards a minor dereliction on his part. One thing will be noted: Although this was a time of war, he did not plead that fact as a circumstance of palliation; that was no defence at all. It was a grievous sin against constitutional practice, and he merely pleaded guilty. </para>
          <para>Having said that, I wish to refer briefly to the submission made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> which I feel disposed to support in the committee stage for the reasons advanced by him. Some of the reasons I had the pleasure of hearing; others I can imagine having been submitted because of our previous association on the Regulations and Ordinances Committee with the regulation that was subsequently disallowed. The regulation that was withdrawn went far beyond what I shall call the pernicious features of the regulation that is now under criticism and attack. In the former case, a civil liability was established, even in the absence of a specific charge and penal proceedings. At least, a penal procedure is involved and is required in the case of the regulation now before us. A civil liability may emerge, that being the matter which is criticized and disputed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline></para>
          <para>Having made those observations, <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> indicate that I shall support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> proposal at the committee stage. I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Herbert</inline> Morrison&#39;s comments to honorable senators. </para>

            <para>. -  in reply - I shall deal with the last comment first. I quite agree with the sentiments that were expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Byrne</inline> in regard to the failure to table the regulations. There is no excuse for it. All I can say is that this is the first time in ten years that it has happened, and I hope that it will not happen again. </para>

              <para>-  I know that. The record is not a bad one, but once in ten years still is too often. That brings me to the proposition that has been advanced by Senators Wright and Byrne. 1 think that it has been misconceived by both of them. Regulation 19 does not purport to give to a court-martial the power to inflict penalties, to make charges, or <inline font-style="italic">to determine that</inline> moneys are payable. That authority is conferred on courts-martial by the imperial Air Force Act to the extent to which it has been adopted in Australia. That act has been adopted in Australia not in whole but in substantial part. </para>

          <para class="block">The regulation does not attempt or purport to clothe a court-martial with authority to impose a monetary penalty. As I indicated, that authority is given under the act. But, a penalty having been inflicted, the regulation prescribes how it is to be recovered. The only substantial difference between the present regulation and the 1945 regulation is that the money, when it is recovered, belongs to the Canteens Service Board and not to Consolidated Revenue. Hitherto, fines and penalties so recovered had to be paid by the Air Board into Consolidated Revenue. This regulation provides that it shall be the property of the Canteens Service Board. </para>

              <para>- As I indicated earlier, regulation 19 does not clothe  a  court-martial with power to inflict a penalty but merely says that, consequent upon  a  penalty having been inflicted by a courtmartial, it shall be recovered in a certainway. The earlier regulation that was disallowed merely provided that the Air Board, by an administrative act, could declare  a  certain amount to be owing by a person. So the disallowed regulation and the regulation now before us are quite different. I point out, too, that since the disallowance of the earlier regulation a courts-martial appeal tribunal has been established. This obligation to pay what constituted a debt to the canteens board can apply only after a conviction by a court-martial or a ruling by  a  commanding officer. The regulation reads - </para>

          <para class="block">At present there is a provision - there was not earlier - for appeals from decisions of courts-martial to an independent tribunal called the Courts-martial Appeal Tribunal, consisting of a distinguished Queen&#39;s counsel and other distinguished counsel practising on their own account. In the earlier regulation, which, with all due respect, I say was very properly disallowed, there was no appeal at all from an administrative decisions of the Air Board. I think that, on further reflection, the honorable senators who haveraised this issue will agree that action under this regulation follows the decision of a court-martial. The regulation does not authorize a court-martial to do anything. A court-martial is constituted under a specific act, incorporating the English Air Force Act. This regulation merely provides how a sum ofmoney, so determined, shall be paid to the canteens board. </para>

              <para>- That is so. It was suggested that it would not be sufficient if it were deducted from the member&#39;s pay. Suppose it were determined that a substantial amount was owing by a member of the services to the canteens board and the only method of collection open to the canteens board was deductions from pay. The person concerned might cease to be a member of the services. In that case, the debt would not be paid, although there had been substantial damage to the canteen board&#39;s property. </para>

              <para>- I do not think that that is a subject for a court-martial. The question before the court-martial is the charge made against the airman that he has been the cause of &#163;X worth of damage to Air Force property. The court-martial has to determine whether he is guilty or not guilty of that charge. If he is found guilty by the court-martial, this regulation provides a method whereby restitution can be made. If the airman is not satisfied with the decision of the court-martial as to his guilt, or thinks that the amount awarded against <inline font-style="italic">him</inline> is grossly excessive, he has a right of appeal to the Courts-martial Appeal Tribunal. No rights are being taken from him. </para>

              <para>-  That would not take the matter any further. The question to be decided on appeal is whether the man is guilty or not guilty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> says that the Air Board could determine an unreasonable rate of repayment which was incapable of being met by the airman concerned. In reply to that suggestion, I say that this is not an exclusive remedy. There is nothing to stop the Canteens Board from sueing in a civil court, from making the man bankrupt and levying distress. There is no means whereby the Air Board can be restrained from insisting on payment forthwith if the man has sufficient assets. I do not see any reason why the common law remedies of the Canteens Board should be whittled down. The main thing, on which I. think we all agree, is that the man should be given a fair trial on the issue as to whether he is guilty or not guilty. On that issue, he has a right of appeal to a higher tribunal. </para>

              <para>-  That is not my proposition at all. I suggest that an ordinary criminal court has an exclusive right to decide in what way restitution shall be made and that neither the Attorney-General&#39;s Department nor any other department can make a decision relating to the repayment of the amount of any defalcation. There is a right of appeal from the decision of a civil criminal tribunal which, under this regulation, would not be given to an airman. </para>

              <para>-  Quite so. 1 was merely pausing so that honorable senators would have time to consider my submission. If the suggestion of the Attorney-General as to the effect of the regulation is correct, it would only result in a regulation set-up instead of, as in ordinary circumstances, a common law set-up. I cannot see that there is any great dependence upon the validation of this regulation. What 1 am concerned about is the conversion of a court-martial, or commanding officer&#39;s orderly room, to a civil court which, by virtue of an award or sentence, and without limit as to amount, may adjudicate that a man is liable for a debt. </para>

          <para>We of the legal profession are most scrupulous to ensure that when a man has to face an adjudication for civil liability in respect of a certain amount, which in my own State is more than &#163;250, he is entitled to a Supreme Court Judgment. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> has referred to the Appeals Court.

              <para>-  I am pleased to have the support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Critchley,</inline> because he has taken a most persevering interest in the welfare of servicemen. My submission is reinforced by the possibility of injustice occurring in an actual case, and I am not merely theorizing. It is merely a matter of preserving the protection of the serviceman by the maintenance of a proper judicial system. There is, on the part of service tribunals, a disposition to be arbitrary and to brush aside the judicial process. Courts-martial were never intended to adjudicate upon civil liability. I should have thought that no damage could be done to the framework of these regulations by the acceptance of my amendment and that, in the calm of the morrow, or during the next fortnight, a proper regulation could be brought down remedying any omission that might be caused. </para>

Regulation 19 flows from the pronouncement of the courtmartial. It does not clothe the court-martial with any authority to make an edict, award or sentence which it does not already possess. Regulation 19 merely determines what shall happen in order to give effect to the award. With all due respect to the points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> whether or not we like courts-martial and the way they are established is quite beside the point.

          <para>One or two honorable senators on this side of the chamber are disturbed about regulation 19 of the regulations that are now being validated - and validated retrospectively. There has been some discussion  of  the matter, and I should like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          <para class="block">O&#39;sullivan, who has now entered the chamber, to be good enough to listen to the propositions that have disturbed Opposition, senators and tell me whether I correctly interpret the regulation. </para>
          <para>As I understand the position, this regulation has nothing to do with the functioning of courts-martial, or with officers acting pursuant to another authority dealing summarily with offences. That lies in  a  separate category of law altogether, and it is subject to the appellate system that this Parliament set up in respect of appeals from courts-martial and the rest. In the light of the explanation that the AttorneyGeneral gave before the suspension of the sitting, it seems to me that regulation 19 deals only with a situation where under proceedings properly instituted under other law altogether, a member of the forces <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> found responsible in respect of damage done to property of the canteens board. AsI understand it, where there is a penalty of that kind imposed by a court-martial  or  otherwise subject to appeal, the money iscollected and the proceeds go into  Consolidated  Revenue. </para>

              <para>- Let me put the case this way: Suppose a member of the forces misconducts himself outside a  canteen  by assaulting an officer, that he does damage to an Air Force car, and then  upon  entering the canteen he wrecks the furniture in one of the rooms. I think in that case he might be charged before a courtmartial in respect of three matters.  Let  us say that the court-martial fines him somuch for the assault on the officer, and so much for the damage done to the car, and decides to recover from him &#163;10 for the damage done to the canteen property. Thisregulation, in my comprehension, provides that if a court-martial - to confine it to that  nne  body - decides that some amount is  to  be repaid for damage done to the canteen property, then the sum of &#163;10. instead  of  going in  the  normal course into Consolidated Revenue will be paid to the canteens board so that the board can repair  the  damage done to its room, and the board is thus restored to its original position. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>As I understand the position, this regulation does not empower courts-martial to act or otherwise officers summarily to fine people. It simply says that if the ingredient of damage to canteens property arises in the course of those proceedings, then the fine or the amount of damages awarded will go to restore the canteen property. </para>

              <para>-  It is very clear that it does. It is clear that the board, in the case I have instanced, may order the &#163;10 to be paid by instalments deducted from the man&#39;s pay. I am interested to ascertain whether, under other legislation, the board is precluded from taking the whole of a man&#39;s pay. I should imagine there would be some provision elsewhere in law that would prevent the board from taking the whole of the pay of a member of the Air Force. One or two honorable senators on this side are intimately concerned with this matter, and I should be glad if the Minister would explain the position. </para>

              <para>-  I remember it as a very recent event. We are not concerned with the process of court-martial or summary jurisdiction and appeals. This regulation picks up the position where, after all those bodies are functioning, with the right of appeal and everything else, and says that if in the award or fine imposed there is an ingredient of damage to canteen property the amount awarded, instead of going intothe Consolidated Revenue, shall go to the canteens board. But boiled down, the regulation empowers the Air Board to make deductions from the salary of the man, in such instalments as it thinks fit. I think we quite reasonably believe that the board in determining the instalments would have regard to a man&#39;s family commitments, the need to exist. </para>

              <para>-  I see. If that is the case, I should like to be advised  further  on that point. I would not favour that proposition. If a tribunal has authority to award damages of an unlimited amount, unquestionably there should be a right of appeal against that award. But I do argue that that is not a matter which arises in considering the regulation. It arises in relation to the legislation which deals with courts-martial and with appeals from them. </para>

              <para>-  Yes. Let us assume that this regulation goes. Whatever right of appeal is now available under ordinary court-martial procedure would still be available. The only difference, by and large, would be that the amount recovered as a result of an award in respect of damage to a canteen would go to Consolidated Revenue, not to the board controlling the canteen. That would be the only difference if this were cut out. It seems to me to be a very proper provision that if a member of the forces does cause damage and an award is rightly made against him by some tribunal in respect of that damage, the proceeds shall go back to the body aggrieved. </para>

I rose out of consideration for some of my supporters who have an active interest in this matter, and I undertook to present their viewpoint, as they were disturbed. I put the matter from that viewpoint in quite an objective way. I conclude by asking the Minister whether there is some law, apart from what we are now considering, that would prevent the Air Board, pursuant to the authority conferred here, from taking the whole of a man&#39;s salary. </para>

            <para>. -  I listened with a good deal of interest to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna).</inline> He expressed very concisely some of the problems in relation to regulation 1 9, but one aspect of the regulation which he touched on only lightly is causing me a great deal of concern. The regulation, as I see it, seeks to give to the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Air Board a certain power of directing how money shall be paid by an airman who has been convicted of an offence and ordered by a tribunal - either his commanding officer or a court-martial - to pay a specific sum in pursuance of his conviction and sentence. As I see it, the Air Board is being given a semi-judicial function and, in addition, the right to determine how the money shall be repaid - whether from the airman&#39;s pay, by instalments, forthwith and so on. Normally, those are the functions of the tribunal itself. </para>
          <para>In civil life, if a man is charged with an offence relating to property and is convicted, the magistrate or the judge has full powers to order repayment of the sum embezzled, either forthwith or by instalments. Then the courts can enforce that judgment by process of execution, against either the person or the property of the accused. I submit that those are judicial functions and that the Air Board is being invested with a portion of those functions. </para>
          <para>I do not for a moment quarrel with the regulation so far as it goes. I think that in certain circumstances it would be proper for the Air Board to be invested with the function of ordering the payment of an amount of money. My concern is with the rights of the accused after the Air Board has taken that step. To my mind, the accused has no right of appeal in respect of the determination of the Air Board. I am not suggesting that the decision would not be just. 1 do not think that that is relevant to this discussion. I feel that in the exercise of any judicial process, or portion of any judicial process, there should be some right of appeal, and I submit to the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> that this regulation gives no right of appeal so far as the Air Board&#39;s activity is concerned. </para>
          <para>Again, I apply my reasoning to what happens in civil life. If a man is convicted by a criminal court of an offence and is ordered to make restitution of a specific sum, either immediately or by instalments, he can appeal, not only with respect to the amount or quantum of the fine or order, but also with respect to the order for repayment, and an appeal tribunal can say, in effect, &#34; We think the order is too harsh. This man should not be required to pay this money forthwith, but should be allowed some time for repayment &#34;. There is no argument about whether an appeal tribunal can do that. </para>
          <para>When we apply that principle to this regulation, we see that there is nothing in the regulation which gives anybody a right of appeal. I do not object to the Air Board&#39;s having this right. I think there are circumstances in which the Air Board should have such a right. It might not be actually a part of the court-martial&#39;s task to make such a determination. There might be circumstances wherein a court-martial could not make a determination, or would not feel disposed to make it. That is entirely the province of the court-martial. I see nothing objectionable in giving the Air Board this right with respect to public property, but, having given the board the right, we should, I submit with great respect, ensure that the man convicted will have some right of appeal in relation to the Air Board&#39;s direction.  1  am not arguing that this regulation affects the processes of courts-martial. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the regulation does not in any way attempt to affect the activities or functions of courtsmartial. It is an administrative act when the Air Board directs payment by a convicted person to the account of the Canteens Board.  1  think that that is a very proper power. My argument is that in using that power the Air Board is exercising a quasijudicial function, or perhaps a completely judicial function, and that in those circumstances there should be some right of appeal. The regulation could very easily be modified to give a right of appeal such as is now given to a convicted person under the present courts-martial procedure. </para>

            <para>. -  I have listened with interest to this debate and I quite agree with my leader and other honorable senators that there should be a right of appeal. There is a principle inherent in this regulation with which I thoroughly disagree. I submit that no tribunal should be able to make an order which would authorize the deduction from&#39; a man&#39;s wages or salary of money to discharge a penalty which the tribunal has inflicted. In the very early development of the Labour movement, we had a hard fight to have adopted in Australia legislation known as the Truck Act, to prevent any tribunal from ordering deductions from a man&#39;s wages or salary, on which his family was dependent and his commitments were based. If a nian commits a crime, a tribunal should not be in a position to say to him, &#34; You caused damage to the extent of  &#163;500.  That sum will be recovered from your salary at so much a week.&#34; That is <inline font-style="italic">wrong.</inline> No tribunal should have that power. If a man is in a position to contribute something from his salary, that is a different matter. For instance, if the penalty imposed is  &#163;500  and a man finds, after examining his affairs, that he can afford to pay so much out of his salary, then I see nothing wrong with his signing a procuration order permitting that to be done in order to amortize the debt over a period. If he is not in a position to do so, then his salary or wage should be sacrosanct. If there is an alternative penalty, if the penalty is  &#163;500  or six months&#39; imprisonment and if a man&#39;s family responsibilities and other commitments are such that there is no balance of salary from which to meet payments towards amortizing the  &#163;500,  then he will have to serve the term of imprisonment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In any event, it is wrong in principle to permit a man&#39;s wage or salary to be garnisheed by a tribunal against the decision of which he has no appeal. It is wrong to allow his income to be garnisheed irrespective of whether his wife and other dependants will be left with enough on which to live after satisfying the garnishee. It is wrong to place those dependants in such a position that they could become an embarrassment to society. </para>
          <para>I suggest that we provide for an alternative penalty, such as being confined to barracks or to imprisonment for a certain term. I submit that a man&#39;s income should remain sacrosanct, that it is something to which he is legally entitled. It should not be garnisheed in any way. It he is in a position to pay something towards satisfying his debt, then let him sign a procuration voluntarily. </para>
          <para>I admit that if a man has committed a misdemeanour he should be punished, but it is wrong in principle to give any tribunal power to impose a penalty for a misdemeanour and then garnishee a person&#39;s income to satisfy the penalty. I admit that a person who commits the crime should pay the penalty, but until it can be established that he has no other commitments or prior claims to his income no authority should have the right arbitrarily to take so much from him each week. I repeat that his salary should be sacrosanct although his penalty certainly must be met in some way or other. </para>

              <para>- That has to be decided. My submission is that the fundamental principle is that a man is entitled to his salary irrespective of whether his actions have been wise, unwise, criminal or otherwise. That salary should not be interfered with by any tribunal. No tribunal should have power arbitrarily to deduct anything from it in satisfaction of a penalty that may be imposed. Whether a man be in the Army, the Air Force or any other service, in all probability his salary would cease upon commission of a serious crime, and then there would be nothing from which to recover a penalty in any event. </para>

          <para>The fundamental principle for which Labour has always fought is that a man is legally entitled to salary for his services and nothing should be taken from it unless he voluntarily signs a procuration order or enters into some other arrangement. No tribunal should be allowed to say to any person who has committed a crime that as he is earning, say, &#163;10 a week, then irrespective of what his present commitments may be, irrespective of his family responsibilities, so much will be deducted from that &#163;10 each week. Such a practice could cause untold hardship. For instance, a man may have a large family, and I point out that the members of his family have not committed the crime. </para>

              <para>- The authorities could do what they liked with him. It is his affair if he commits a crime. If he is in gaol his family will receive a certain amount of support because it is a principle of British justice that no one other than the guilty person shall be punished for a crime. The honorable senator knows full well that when a man is sent to prison for committing a crime the State takes some responsibility for his wife and family while he is in gaol if the family&#39;s circumstances warrant it. I say that this Senate should recognize the principle that a man&#39;s income is sacrosanct, that nothing shall be taken from it arbitrarily. As I have suggested already, if his present commitments and family responsibilities are not such as would absorb the whole of his income, then I see nothing wrong with his voluntarily signing a procuration order for so much to be taken in amortization of the debt over a period. Do not let us establish a position in which a tribunal can order that so much be deducted from a person&#39;s income irrespective of his civil and moral responsibilities. Such a principle is wrong in every sense and should not be tolerated, for it can lead to a position in which the innocent as well as the guilty are punished. </para>

I agree that this has nothing whatever to do with either the Constitution or the procedure of courts-martial. This relates to something that happens after the court-martial has sat, heard evidence, weighed the evidence and made its determination or awarded compensation. This is what follows after that. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McKenna</inline> has pointed out, this ii restricted in its application not to all penalties awarded by courts-martial in the Air Force but only to awards made in respect to compensation for damage done to Air Force canteens property. It would have nothing whatever to do with a penalty inflicted for personal behaviour, for burning down an aerodrome, or for damaging aircraft. It is restricted exclusively to damage done to Air Force canteen property. </para>

Whether that was right or wrong, wise or unwise, is not for me to debate now. That has been the practice, and the chief purpose of this regulation is to ensure that if an award is made in respect of damage that has been done to Air Force canteen property, the Royal Australian Air Force Canteens Service Board should be reimbursed and payment should not be made to Consolidated Revenue. </para>

              <para>asked if any provision had been made for a minimum reservation of salary after deduction of an amount pursuant to an award such as it contemplated in these regulations. Under the imperial act, which we have incorporated substantially in our own act, that provision is made. We have also incorporated in our legislation a minimum residue, but I am not able to say now precisely what that figure is. The point is that some statutory requirement has been made to ensure that a minimum residue must remain. I am quite sure that no air board with a sense of responsibility, and no government, would approve of dependants being deprived of money to such an extent that they would be destitute. </para>

This is not a judicial matter under which an appeal in law could arise to determine whether a man should pay 10s. or 1 5s. a week. That is an administrative matter. The point I am making is that at the time of a man&#39;s conviction before a court-martial, in the first instance, or at a subsequent hearing before a court-martial appeal tribunal, he has several courses open to him. Those who have seen courtsmartial in action, know that they are very just. </para>

              <para>-  There is  an  order. The court-martial makes an order that the man should make reparation. It could direct that reparation be made on terms. Generally, there is adequate provision to ensure that there is no miscarriage of justice, and expense is no item in providing legal representation for the  man  charged. Counsel is provided for the asking. If the court-martial, in the first instance, makes an award for a substantial amount against the man who has been charged, his counsel may plead that the man cannot pay that amount. He may want time to pay and counsel can bring evidence of the man&#39;s circumstances. </para>

              <para>-  That is true, but we disallowed that regulation. That has gone entirely. The regulation that the Senate disallowed some time ago related to an administrative act of the Air Board. The point is that if the man believes that an award is more than he is in a position to pay, or that it will cause undue hardship  to  himself or his family, his counsel may tell the court that he requires time to pay. I should imagine that the court would consider the man&#39;s circumstances. That would be relevant to the judgment, conviction, award or sentence which was still appealable to a civilian tribunal which this Parliament has recently established, which is presided over by a distinguished Queen&#39;s Counsel and which contains in its membership other eminent counsel. An appeal can be based on the whole issue before the court. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has said that it can be made on a conviction only. After all, this regulation contemplates something that is done following a conviction. I direct the attention of the Senate to the provision of the Courts-Martial Appeals Act 1955. Section 20 states -  (1.) Subject to this Act, a person convicted by court-martial after the commencement of this Act may, with the leave of the Tribunal, appeal to the Tribunal against his conviction. (2.) A person is not entitled to apply for leave to appeal to the Tribunal against a conviction, other than a conviction involving sentence of death - </para>

          <para class="block">As I read the act, and subject to correction, a man could be convicted and ordered to pay a given amount. The tribunal might assess the damage he has to pay at &#163;2,000. It would be quite competent for the appeal tribunal to state that the finding was unreasonable. Let us suppose an award was made that the amount should be paid forthwith. That also could be found to be unreasonable in the light of the circumstances that the appellant could bring before the appeal tribunal. It is much more satisfactory to have a man&#39;s rights determined in an open tribunal to which the public is admitted and where those who appear before the tribunal can be represented by counsel. Justice is much more likely to be done in that way. 1 cannot see that any infringement of the rights of an individual are involved. The regulation provides that all these rights may be pursued to the full before the matter goes to the Air Board for determination. If this regulation is wiped out entirely, we would not be helping any victim of a wrong or the perpetrator of a wrong because, in the absence of this regulation the money would be payable to Consolidated Revenue. The person against whom an award for compensation was made would have to make his peace and come to terms with the Treasurer. </para>

          <para>Before I come to the regulations now before us, let me take the trouble to mention to the committee that during the suspension of the sitting I had a look at the Australian Military (Canteens Service) Regulations. Although obviously those regulations were the mould in which the regulations now before us were shaped, that is, in giving trading powers and other constitutional powers to the canteens board, they contain nothing that resembles Air Force (Canteens) Regulation 19. I looked also at the naval regulations, which in general structure are similar, but again I found nothing resembling the Air Force regulation that is now before us. So, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chairman,</inline> no argument can be offered to the committee to show that my proposal would strip bare the Air Force Canteens Service Board and expose it to the ravages of malicious members of the Air Force, because up to the present time no similar provision has existed in the Army and Navy canteen regulations. </para>
          <para>Now let us see what regulation 19 substitutes for the very clear language of the 1945 legislation, which, I repeat, simply provided that any penal deduction from the pay of a member in recompense for damage to canteen property shall be paid to the board. </para>

          <para class="block">But, if we allow this regulation to become law, the tribunal which adjudicates that the sum payable in consequence of a courtmartial award in compensation for damage to property, whether it be &#163;10, &#163;1,000, or, as the Attorney-General mentioned, &#163;2,000, is to be a debt is the court-martial itself. A court-martial is not the appropriate body to adjudicate upon civil liability. A courtmartial is the appropriate body to deal with penal deductions in order to enforce discipline, but when the question involved is constituting as a debt a sum in compensation for damages, a court-martial is quite an inappropriate body, even if its decision is appealable. </para>

              <para>-  I claim that a courtmartial has no jurisdiction other than of a disciplinary and penal nature. Therefore, anything it properly awards is a part of a conviction. The very essence of my argument is that we should not allow a courtmartial to turn compensation for loss or damage to property into a debt. A court-martial might make an award that an airman shall pay &#163;2,000 in recompense for whisky lost because of negligent navigation of an aircraft. Honorable senators smile, but there is nothing ridiculous about that. Within a month of our considering the previous regulation an aircraft touched the mast of a yacht in Sydney Harbour, causing upwards of &#163;2,000 damage to the aircraft. lt is not merely the serviceman&#39;s regular periodical pay that we have to protect, but also his reserve pay. I mentioned this afternoon the case of a man who has been complaining of arbitrary injustice since 1945. The whole of his reserve pay was confiscated to pay a debt exceeding &#163;600 that had been adjudicated upon by a courtmartial. If this regulation became law, once a court-martial made an adjudication such as that, the sum involved would be deemed to be a debt: and the Air Board could, as it were, stride over to a civil court in Sydney and lodge a writ of summons. The member of the Air Force concerned would have no defence against the writ because the legislature had said that the court-martial was a proper authority to specify a sum in its award. That sum would constitute a debt due and payable by the member to the Air Board. As I have said, there is no comparable regulation in the Army or the Navy. This regulation will extend the civil authority of a court-martial to an extent never dreamed of in the original regulation. </para>

          <para>I therefore ask the committee to say that this regulation should not be validated. An appropriate regulation designed to give effect to the provisions of the 1945 regulation could be put through the Executive to-morrow. If it survived the scrutiny of the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, it would then become law. </para>

            <para>.- I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has been making a mountain out of a molehill. The general powers and functions of the Air Board are very clearly defined in the new regulation, which deals with the activities of the canteens board, the moneys that come under its control and the protection of its property. As most of us know, the property of the canteens board must be protected from the enthusiastic Air Force member who allows his enthusiasm to overrule his judgment. The regulation provides that, as a disciplinary measure, the canteens board shall receive, as recompense for loss or damage of its property, any fines imposed by a courtmartial on&#39; a member for an offence involving such loss or damage. I feel that the traditions of the Air Force are such that the Air Board would not penalize a member of the Air Force to such an extent that his family would be deprived of sustenance. </para>

              <para>- That provision has always applied. While a man remains in the Service, he must comply with any sentence that is imposed on him by a properly constituted court-martial. I think there is a certain amount of confusion between two things. It is implicit in this regulation that previously the moneys were paid to the Air Board and then into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. This regulation provides that the money shall be paid to the canteens board, so that the board can replace the damaged property. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator has waxed sarcastic to-night. He has been tilting with windmills for so long that he has become bemused. I conclude by saying that the Air Board is fully aware of the family responsibilities of members of the Air Force. By obtaining, in the form of a fine, recompense for damage done by a member to canteen property, the Air Board is acting in accordance with the traditions and practices of the Air Force. There is no basic departure from practice in this regulation. </para>

              <para>- Yes. The courtmartial makes an order for the payment of  a  sum of money. It is payable to some one, not to the Archangel Gabriel! My advisers and I believe that, normally, under section 81 of the Constitution, it would be a debt payable to Consolidated Revenue. To make it perfectly clear, we do not say that the operative words are, &#34; that sum shall be deemed to be a debt &#34;. It is a debt. The operative words are, &#34; a debt owing by the member to the Board &#34;, and not to Consolidated Revenue. </para>

              <para>- The point is that the court-martial has determined that there is a debt. The accused can appeal to  a  service tribunal - the Courts-martial Appeal Tribunal, which is constituted of civilians learned in the law. Whether or not an  appeal  is made against the decision of the court-martial is beside the point, for it has been determined that a sum of money is payable to some one - in the absence of any other expression, to Consolidated Revenue. Therefore, for the purpose of clarifying the matter, we say, &#34; to the canteens board &#34;. That is the whole purpose of the provision. I should like to emphasize once again that if regulation 19 were entirely deleted it would give comfort to no one. It would not prevent courts-martial from proceeding to fine persons convicted by them, or from awarding damages against such persons. </para>

              <para>-  I am sure that I could, but I have not the provision at my fingertips. If what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> says is indeed correct he need not worry, because nothing in regulation 19 authorizes courtsmartial to do anything. I challenge any honorable senator to point to one sentence in the regulation which authorizes or empowers a court-martial to do anything. All it does is provide that after a courtmartial has made an award, or recorded a conviction, the award shall be collected in a certain way. I cannot put it any more simply than that. </para>

              <para>-  I should think that it is probably because these regulations are the more modern. It h*s nothing to do with the rights of individuals before a courtmartial. It deals purely with the disposition of the award of moneys made by a courtmartial. I regard it as an improvement, which probably springs from a more enlightened approach to the provisions and obligations of section 81 of the Constitution, under which, according to general opinion, all moneys belonging to the Commonwealth must be paid into Consolidated Revenue. For instance, our taxes are paid to the Commissioner of Taxation, but no one suggests that he does other than receive them on behalf of Consolidated Revenue. The mere fact that the sum has to be paid to the board does not mean that the board keeps the money. Similarly, moneys are paid to the Comptroller-General of Customs. It is not suggested that he keeps them for his own department. It is merely the method by which payment is made. In the case before us, it is made perfectly clear that though the money is paid to the board it is the property of the Commonwealth. </para>

My advisers and I believe that it is not necessary for an authority to be expressly given power to extend terms of repayment, and that the power to inflict a fine carries with it the power to permit the fine to be paid by instalments. Under section 21b of the Crimes Act - which is a Commonwealth act - Commonwealth tribunals have often allowed time for the payment of penalties that they have imposed. Section 21b provides - </para>

              <para>- The Air Board would only come into it to determine what instalments, if any, would be acceptable when the court-martial or court of appeal had not done so as part of its judgment. That is the point which I made earlier. The person affected would, as a rule, be represented by counsel. If terms were required counsel would strongly urge that they be granted, and would place the circumstances of the offender, or victim, before the court. I should imagine that if such an order were at all warranted it would be made. If it were not, the appeal would then have to be made to the Air Board. I have no doubt that if the court order provided for terms the Air Board would have to accept its decision. </para>

It would not be a matter of an order any more than if I went to the Commissioner of Taxation and said, &#34; I cannot pay my taxes immediately, but I am prepared to pay so much a month &#34;. That is an arrangement. But that would not arise in regard to embezzlement. This regulation concerns the loss, damage or destruction of property. It is no more an award than if the Commissioner of Taxation, in the instance I have mentioned, granted time to pay. It is not a judicial discretion against which there is no appeal. If an award were made to order X to make deductions of pay in relation te damage to canteen property, that would be a matter of arrangement. </para>

            <para>. - After listening to the contributions to this debate by the legal fraternity, I am quite convinced that there is grave room for suspicion. The Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> has stated that the regulation does not deal with courts-martial. I point out that the court-martial declares the debt, and therefore references to courts-martial are completely relevant to the regulation under discussion. It is clear from what the Minister has said that Air Force courtsmartial are overriding the civil courts of Australia, and if this practice is allowed to continue it will ultimately displace the civil courts. The Minister has stated that there is a right of appeal against verdicts or findings of a court-martial. Is there a right of appeal to the Supreme Court or to the High Court? No! An appeal can be made only to another court within the Air Force. Therefore, a serviceman suffers a disadvantage compared with civilians from the point of view of appeals. </para>

The regulation provides that the Air Board may decide the amount of damages and the instalments to be deducted from moneys due, or to become due, to the airman. The Minister has not yet said that an appeal may be made against the decision of the board. There may be an appeal against a conviction, but not against the amount assessed in respect of damage and the weekly deductions that shall be made. </para>

          <para>Of course, I could mention another case of injustice in relation to an ex-serviceman, but I shall not do so now. The Government clamps down, not only on servicemen, but on ex-servicemen. It seems to be the function of certain high officials to grab money from people as quickly as possible. These officials are not greatly concerned about the hardship that is caused thereby. Do honorable senators think that the board will be any more lenient in its collection of debts than the other officials to whom I have referred? </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has pointed out, an airman convicted by a court-martial will have no right of appeal against the assessed amount of damages or deductions from his weekly income as ordered by the courtmartial. After listening most attentively to the remarks of the Attorney-General, I am convinced that a convicted airman will have no right of appeal in this direction on the ground of hardship. I agree 100 per cent, with the contention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Vincent</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that the rights of the civil courts to determine these matters should not be usurped by courts-martial. </para>

As a legal man, surely he believes, as I do, that members of the services should enjoy a right of appeal similar to that enjoyed by those outside the services. It is apparent from the debate that has taken place between the legal members of this chamber that members of the services are at a disadvantage in this respect. I firmly believe that there should be a right of appeal against the assessed amount of damages and the weekly deductions from pay. </para>

            <para>. - The Opposition approves and gives its support to this bill. The natural criticism of such measures is that they do not provide enough assistance, but on the other hand one realizes that it is most difficult to make a beginning with a project of this kind. The Government has presented a bill under which it proposes to make available &#163;500,000 a year to assist in the stratigraphic drilling for oil. This is not a lot of money when one considers the amounts expended in searching for oil; nevertheless, I congratulate the Government on at least having made a beginning, and I hope that in future much larger amounts of money will be made available. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The discovery of oil would be of amazing benefit to Australia. I do not think that at this stage it would matter whether the discovery were made on the mainland or in the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. The important thing is that oil should be discovered. The importation of oil involves a serious drain of Australia&#39;s overseas resources. During the last few years, great refineries have been built in this country, and our economy has benefited by millions of pounds through the reduction of petrol imports. But even now. although we have oil refineries in almost every State, oil imports cost &#163;120,000,000 a year. Until such time as we are able to develop power from nuclear fission, oil will continue to be most important to our modern way of life. It is essential to provide the power we need to keep industry moving. Transport, whether on the ground, by sea, or in the air, is almost entirely dependent on oil, and so the Government finds it very difficult to cut oil imports, because any reduction is reflected in every phase of Australian industry. </para>
          <para>The need to expend &#163;120,000,000 a year on oil imports will, of course, disappear, if we can discover oil in payable quantities in this country. In the last few years much has been done. I suppose that in the last 50 years &#163;50,000,000 has been spent in the search for oil in Australia, with little or no result. Certainly, it has not resulted in the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. Of that &#163;50,000,000, about &#163;30,000,000 has been spent by the Caltex organization, which is associated in Western Australia with the Ampol organization. The circumstances associated with the discovery of oil at Rough Range, in Western Australia, were most unfortunate. An incredible thing happened. The first bore put down by the organization struck oil, and it seemed as if the oil was present in commercial quantities. Actually, the number of bores that have now been put down are very few indeed compared with what has been done in the great oil-bearing countries of the world, where hundreds of bores were put down before oil was found. In some instances, as many as 2,000 bores were sunk before oil was finally found in commercial quantities. I believe, therefore, that the discovery of oil in Western Australia at the first boring, was in effect, rather a setback, because great disappointment followed when it was found that the oil was not present in commercial quantities and further boring did not prove the presence of oil. </para>
          <para>I congratulate the Bureau of Mineral Resources on its work in the search for oil. It has spent a good deal of money in an unobtrusive fashion in helping the search for oil in this country. As the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Speener)</inline> said in his secondreading speech, the bureau has already spent over &#163;1,500,000, and in this financial year it will spend just under &#163;400,000 in oil search activities. It is now proposed that an extra &#163;500,000 shall be expended annually until 1961, so that the Government will share with private companies the cost of drilling stratigraphic holes to prove the nature of the country, and this is very important for investigation purposes. In one respect the Government is at fault. I suppose the matter has been well considered, but the Minister&#39;s speech contained no reference to what will happen if, in stratigraphic drilling activities, we are fortunate enough to discover oil. I am one of those who believe that if that should happen the Government should not just walk away. </para>

              <para>- That seems to be the intention. It would not even sell its interest. If, by some fortunate circumstances, oil were discovered as a result of drilling a stratigraphic hole, would the Government merely shake hands with private enterprise and say, &#34; Good-bye and good luck &#34;? I should think that after spending perhaps &#163;100,000 or &#163;150,000, the Government should retain some interest in the venture if oil is discovered. Failing a retention of interest in the bore, the Government should evolve some method of recouping the expenditure incurred by it. The Minister was silent on that point in his second-reading speech. From a national point of view, something wonderful would have been achieved in discovering the oil, but as the same time 1 do not think the Government should turn its back on a potential sources of great wealth if, by some fortuitous accident oil was discovered. Why, in all countries where oil has been discovered the governments are extracting greater and greater sums by way of royalties from the companies exploiting the oil deposits. Something along those lines could be done here. To me, the one weakness in the bill is that, having shared the burden, the Government apparently intends to turn its back on this potential source of great wealth and leave the benefits to the companies. </para>

          <para>Another interesting point is that it is proposed that all preliminary expenses shall be borne by the oil companies. For instance, they will be required to build the access roads. These are very expensive. Finally, the Government will share the cost of putting down a bore, constructing the roads, preparing the site and so on, provided the Government has agreed that the bore be put down in a particular site. The Government will then make progressive payments, but no subsidy will be payable until the drill hole has reached a depth of at least 2,000 feet. I cannot recall an exact figure, but I should say that by the time a company had built access roads, done all the preparatory work, and sunk a bore to 2,000 feet it would have expended a very large amount of money indeed. </para>
          <para>Each bore, of course, has a different cost. A bore on a readily accessible site would be relatively cheap compared with one put down in the highlands of New Guinea where the cost might be anything up to &#163;1,000,000 by the time access roads have been built and all the other preparatory work carried out. Certainly that is in difficult country, but I am wondering how far &#163;500,000 subsidy will go on the proposed fifty-fifty basis. I do not wish to be critical because I realize that the great difficulty always is to get these schemes started. I congratulate the Government upon having made a start, but I am afraid that &#163;500,000 will not go very far anyway, especially if the <inline font-style="italic">Government accepts</inline> responsibility for a percentage of the cost of access roads and the preparatory work. To me it would seem that with &#163;500,000 we could subsidize only two or three bores each year. </para>
          <para>But do not let us criticize the proposal. I congratulate the Government upon making a start because there can be no denying the fact that at the moment nothing could be more important to the economy of this country than the discovery of oil. What it would do for Australia is beyond our imagination. The mere fact that it would mean the saving of &#163;120,000,000 a year in foreign exchange would be only a minute fraction of the tremendous advantage that would accrue to this country from the discovery of oil in commercial quantities. </para>
          <para>The Opposition does not oppose the bill. We congratulate the Government upon laying down a principle that may prove of great value indeed to Australia in the future. </para>

            <para>, -  I am indeed pleased that the Opposition does not intend to oppose this measure, and I congratulate the Government upon making available &#163;500,000 a year for payment by way of subsidy to drilling companies searching for oil in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With other supporters of the Government, I have spent a considerable amount of time travelling around Australia inspecting operations in the field. I have also communicated with all the major oil companies to ascertain from them what they think the </para>
          <para class="block">Government should do to help them in the search for oil. One of the major recommendations made by almost every company was that the Government should subsidize deep drilling in Australia in areas that have not been proved hitherto. This measure will be of considerable assistance to those companies that are looking for oil in Australia, and it is interesting to know that already eight or nine companies have approached the Government with a view to taking advantage of this legislation. </para>
          <para>Oil is vital to Australia. That this is true has been amply illustrated during the recent Suez crisis. While that crisis lasted, some European countries had to resort to the rationing of petrol. Indeed, the Australian press stated that we would have to introduce petrol rationing, but fortunately, we had adequate stocks to carry us through. But who knows what may happen In the future? I do not think any sum would be too great for any government to spend on the search for oil. </para>
          <para>Australia has erected some large refineries in the last four or five years, and we axe now refining from 80 per cent, to 9.0 per cent, of our total requirements. Despite the erection of those refineries, imports of oil are costing Australia about &#163;120,000,000 a year and the cost is increasing by about 10 per cent, each year. If we did not have refineries in Australia treating about 80 per cent, of our requirements, the cost of 011 imports to Australia would be nearer &#163;200,000,000 a year. </para>
          <para>Over the past 50 years, approximately &#163;50,000,000 has been spent in Australia on the search for oil. It is interesting to note that &#163;33,000,000 of that &#163;50,000,000 has been spent by oil companies in Australia and New Guinea during the past four years. The Government can help the oil companies in the search for oil in two ways. One is through the Bureau of Mineral Resources by making the bureau&#39;s mapping section available to its geologists so that they can do the necessary geophysical and geological surveys and make them available to the oil companies. The oil companies can then engage in concentrated geophysical work and decide where drilling can best be started. </para>
          <para>The second way to assist the oil companies is by way of income tax concessions. At present, shareholders are given a tax deduction in respect of 33i per cent, of all calls made by companies engaged in the search for oil. An oil company may be granted a tax concession in respect of all expenditure incurred in exploration work, drilling and setting up of plant to produce oil, retrospective to the initial commencement of operations, but only if and when oil is found. </para>
          <para>Overseas companies searching for oil in Australia use money that they have obtained from the sale of petroleum products in other parts of the world. They can claim expenditure on oil search in Australia as a tax concession in their own country, but until oil is found, an Australian company and those who have subscribed the capital for it, do not get the benefit of such a tax concession. The Government could well investigate that matter. </para>

              <para>- No. I did not say that. I said that the major American oil companies which are producing oil and are selling it at a profit can search for oil outside America and claim expenditure thereon as an offset in determining their net profits from the sale of oil. Australian companies and investors can claim a tax concession on expenditure in the search for oil only when oil is found. Until oil is found, the persons who invest capital in an Australian company which is searching for oil can claim as a tax concession only onethird of the calls levied upon them. Once oil has been found, the company concerned can claim the whole of the expenditure incurred in the search as a deduction for income tax purposes. </para>

          <para>I congratulate the Government on taking the step that is implicit in this bill because it will be of great assistance to the oil companies. Quite a few of them will take advantage of these concessions. Already nine of them have approached the Government, through the Bureau of Mineral Resources, for assistance. We shall find oil in Australia only by increased drilling. Although we have expended about &#163;50,000,000 on the search for oil in the past 50 years, we have been able to drill only about 400 holes in Australia and the Territory of Papua and New Guinea. Before oil was found in the Sahara, the major oil companies sank about 2,000 miles of drill-holes. In Alberta, about 3,000 miles of drill-holes were sunk over a period of 30 years before oil was discovered. </para>
          <para>We are only scratching the surface in Australia. The Minister indicated in his second-reading speech that about 400 miles of drill-holes had been sunk. If we have to sink between 2,000 and 3,000 miles of holes before oil is found it will be seen we are now only one-fifth or one-sixth of the way towards our goal. This bill is designed to encourage the companies to increase drilling operations in Australia. I have no doubt that we shall find oil eventually in Australia if the search is intensified. Western Australian Petroleum Limited struck oil with its first bore at Rough Range No. 1. The company and the Government were disappointed to find that oil was not present in sufficient quantities to make Rough Range a major field. The oil was found in only a small area. The company hoped to find more oil nearby, but no more oil has been discovered although eight or nine additional holes have been sunk. </para>
          <para>The company is confident that there is oil in Western Australia. Company officials have said that they do not know whether they will find oil or not, but they intend to keep on trying, and the assistance proposed by the Government will help them considerably. As the Opposition does not intend to oppose the bill, I shall not detain the Senate further. I hope that the Government will take advantage of all practical constructive suggestions that are made to it so that the search for oil in Australia can be intensified. The introduction of legislation of this kind is one of the most important ways in which the Government can help the industry. I have no doubt that it is examining other ways in which it may help, but the availability of &#163;500,000 in an ordinary year and &#163;300,000 in this financial year will be of considerable benefit. I congratulate the Government upon having introduced the bill. </para>

            <para>. - 1 think it is apparent to every Australian that it is necessary for this country to discover oil as soon as possible. We have only to think for a moment or two of the sum that Australia spends overseas on the purchase of oil supplies to realize the truth of what </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">I have just said. If, by discovering oil within this country, we could save ourselves that expenditure, we undoubtedly would be able to engage in further development and 40 achieve greater things than we arc achieving at the moment. The daily demands of oil-burning machines should remove any doubt that we may have about the need for money to be taken from the coffers of the Commonwealth and spent on the search for oil. </para>
          <para>This measure provides for an annual subsidy of &#163;500,000 to companies and other organizations that are engaged in a certain kind of boring in the search for oil. We of the Opposition support the measure and say that the idea behind it is a splendid one. If a similar offer had been made 20 or 30 years ago, possibly we would now be using our own oil. I should like to see a sum of at least &#163;1,000,000 a month spent on the search for oil in Australia and the Territories of the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>I can recall a discussion that took place in this chamber some years ago in relation to the purchase of deep-boring plant. 1 held at that time that whatever was done in that direction was strictly in order. I added that, if I had any objection at all, it was only in regard to the number of plants that were being purchased. I think that the number should have been trebled and that the Government itself should have engaged in boring operations. </para>
          <para>The method of distributing the sum that is to be made available may be quite all right. I have no doubt that the Minister for National Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Spooner)</inline> and the highly skilled officers of his department will get their pound of flesh and will have some arrangement whereby they will have full knowledge at any time of what is being done by those who will seek the subsidy, and will be able to judge whether the money is being spent properly. We all know that some companies raise shareholders&#39; funds, select a site somewhere in Queensland, the Northern Territory or Western Australia, and seek to find an oil supply. We know, too, just how unsuccessful such companies have been, and that, after the shareholders&#39; funds have been exhausted, no more exploration work has been undertaken. That has happened repeatedly and we do not seem to have got anywhere in the search for oil; but I think that the new arrangement is quite a good one and that the scientific knowledge that the department has at its disposal may, when made available to the companies, lead to a discovery of oil. </para>
          <para>Almost every lay person in Australia has some idea about where oil may be found. I have my own idea; I think that, if the boundary between the Northern Territory and Western Australia were followed, eventually oil would be discovered. I think it is more likely that it will be found in that locality than elsewhere on the mainland. Some companies have spent huge sums of money in the Territories that are under the control of the Commonwealth, but we know just how unsuccessful they, too, have been so far. Perhaps they are following a too scientific course and are being guided too much by what has been done before and the information that scientific study has made available to them. The great mineral discoveries of Australia have been made by chance. The Mount Morgan gold mining field, which is one of the most notable, was discovered not by a geologist but by a miner. The great Mount Isa silver lead mining field was discovered by a fossicker who had great difficulty in persuading even his own workmates that he had discovered a valuable mineral. Uranium was discovered, not by a scientist or geologist, but by a nomad who was wandering through the country surrounding Rum Jungle. </para>

              <para>-  There may be very little parallel, but we know just how often a fossicker has m&#39;ade such discoveries without being assisted to any great degree by scientific knowledge within the Commonwealth. I could cite other discoveries, including the discovering of opals and coal. Only twelve months ago, I visited a certain part of Queensland where an open-cut coal mine was being worked no more than a mile or two away from an underground mine where coal was being mined perhaps several hundred feet below the surface. That outcrop was discovered purely by accident. We will probably find that at some time in the future companies that are searching for oil will, contrary to scientific advice, sink bores in certain places and discover oil. </para>

          <para>I support the bill. I have already indicated that I have one fault to find with it - that is, the sum to be provided is insufficient. Not too many companies can be subsidized annually with &#163;500,000. When we see just how many motor vehicles are on the roads, how many internal combustion engines and industrial plants are in operation, and how much modern heavy equipment is being used, we know that the discovery of oil in Australia is essential if we are to stabilize and improve our economy. 1 hold the opinion that no country can become great, in the sense that America and Canada have become great, unless it has its own oil supply. I need not dwell upon that proposition because it is apparent to every one. If Australia had its own supplies it would be a vastly different country within a year or two. We speak about developing power from uranium, but perhaps that is still a long way off. Even if such power were developed, Australia would still have to import oil from other countries. I look forward to something tangible being achieved as the result of this money being made available. </para>

I think that that is an extraordinarily long shot. It is not contemplated that oil will be struck in the drilling of these holes, which are to be drilled for the purpose of obtaining geological information. </para>

              <para>-  That is the reason why the subsidy is to be paid. It is not considered likely that oil will be discovered in these holes, but the Government wishes to encourage people to drill the holes, or, at least, not to do anything to discourage people from drilling them. </para>

          <para>This is not a simple matter. If the unexpected occurred and oil were discovered in one of these holes, many considerations would be involved. The company that was drilling the hole, for which it was receiving a subsidy, would own the plant and have a lease or a title to the area in which the drilling was taking place.  It  would, most likely, have spent large sums of money in searching for oil in other areas and by other means. The fact that oil is discovered does not mean that the discovery will be a commercial proposition. Many are called but few are chosen. A company might strike oil and then spend large sums of money to exploit the discovery, but still not obtain the harvest  it  expected to garner. </para>
          <para>What would be the position as far as the Commonwealth Government is concerned? What proportion of future expenses would the Commonwealth find, and what would be the equitable way of apportioning the interests involved? That is all I shall say on that point. It would not be just a simple matter of oil being found and the profits being split 50-50 by the two parties. </para>

              <para>- I do not think the Treasury would lose. Let us take another case. A stratigraphic hole might be drilled, and, as a result of information obtained from it, another hole might be drilled a mile away and oil found in the second hole. The Government might not be able to claim an interest in the second hole that had been drilled by the prospector. I make that statement without intending to commit myself as to what would be the position. I think a case like that would have to be looked into. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline>said that, as he read the legislation, a prospecting company would be called upon to spend a large sum of money before it became eligible for a subsidy when the hole was down to a depth of  2,000  feet. That is so. But if honorable senators will look at the legislation, they will see that the process is in two parts. The company puts a proposition to the Minister. If that proposition is approved, the company, at that stage, asks for a subsidy. It may be that the money will not be paid until the prospecting company has made a substantial investment. That is as it should be. We do not want to pay out Government money and then find that the prospecting company is unable to carry out its part of the bargain. The proposition is put to the Government and approved by the Government. The company knows then that when its work has reached a certain stage, it will be able to obtain a subsidy. It carries on its programme against the background of a definite and certain arrangement. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline>has said that  &#163;500,000  will not go very far. That remains to be seen. It is at least  &#163;500,000  more than has been available in the past. A good deal of organization must be done. There are about a dozen of these sedimentary basins in Australia and Papua and New Guinea, and the Government&#39;s aim is to have stratigraphic holes drilled in each of these basins. A great deal of this drilling has not been done up to the present time, because it is a very expensive proposition. As I said in my second-reading speech, the natural inclination of the oil companies, and of the people who invest money in these speculative ventures, is to drill holes where they think they will strike oil, instead of drilling holes to obtain information on which to base a long-term search for oil. We will have to wait and see. It may be that this  &#163;500,000  will produce the result at which we aim - to have one deep stratigraphic hole drilled in each of the twelve sedimentary basins. Four or five such holes have already been drilled by companies engaged in the search for oil. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline>dealt with income tax concessions. He stated the position accurately when he said that at present one-third of the amount paid on calls is an allowable deduction. A company that is successful in striking oil has the right to set off against its profits in the future the expenses it has incurred in its search for oil. We have also to remember that, quite apart from taxation concessions, there is a tremendous reward waiting for a company that is successful in striking oil. That reward will far outweigh any advantages to be gained. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Benn</inline>suggested that he would like to see more money spent on the search for oil. He advocated the expenditure of  &#163;1,000,000  a month, and intimated that he would prefer to see the Government itself engaged in boring operations. I must differ from his point of view - not on any ideological ground, but on the ground that the whole art of the exercise is to get people searching for oil in as many different areas of Australia as possible. </para>
          <para>In the judgment of the Government&#39;s professional advisers it is infinitely better that we should employ our resources upon the work that is basic to a good oil search programme. I refer to the early geological and geophysical surveys concerning the nature of the country, upon which are based geological maps that are available for all to see. The Government provides this basic, foundational work. The experience of oil search throughout the world has shown that a government is more likely to attract interest and encourage actual search if, instead of dissipating its resources upon boring, it provides this basic information. Boring is, of course, the last act in the process of searching. It is the culmination of what I have always pictured as a detective research job. First, the geologists, and other experts, examine geological formations with the assistance of aerial photographs. They are followed by geologists and geophysicists operating in the field. A geological picture of the area is then available, and from it conclusions may be drawn as to where the hole should be drilled. </para>
          <para>The provision of subsidies to encourage deep drilling is another link in forging the chain of adequate information, which is needed if we are to attract, not only local investment, but also investment from overseas. Tn my second-reading speech I gave some figures to show how necessary it was that large scale investment be encouraged, for substantial sums of moneys are involved. The Government&#39;s policy, based on professional advice, has been to provide basic information in the most adequate way possible. </para>

            <para>. - The bill seeks legal authority for the payment of repatriation benefits to natives of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea, or an island of the Torres Strait, and other adjacent islands within the jurisdiction of the Commonwealth, who served in the Australian forces during the second world war. Since the war eligible natives have been granted repatriation benefits, and this bill does no more than give legal authority for the continuance of such payments. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Minister pointed out in his secondreading speech that in 1941, when it was decided to raise native units, the natives were paid according to the social and economic conditions which they enjoyed at the time of enlistment. The rates paid to those who worked for the Administration of the Territory of Papua and New Guinea were different from those paid to, say, Torres Strait islanders. </para>
          <para>The bill specifically provides for the application of the War Gratuity Act, and repatriation benefits, as well as compensation for incapacity or death, to natives who have served this country in time of war. It is perhaps worthy of note that, notwithstanding the absence of legal authority for so doing, full appreciation has already been shown, in the granting of repatriation benefits, to those natives who so greatly assisted the Australian forces. We must never forget the great contribution that they made, under extremely adverse conditions, to the war effort. They permitted their village life to be interrupted, though they could quite easily have remained at home, despite the occupation, and profited by physically assisting the enemy. However, they felt a basic loyalty to this country and its people and it is a great tribute to the pre-war administration that, in contrast to what has happened in countries which have been branded as colonially minded, the natives of our Territories responded to their humane treatment by volunteering in such a grand way. Their attitude was further revealed in the many acts of devotion to duty and heroism that they displayed during the worst stages of the war when we most needed their help. I should think that considerable attention will have to be given to the question of the eligibility of a native to receive the benefits provided by the bill, because many Australian ex-servicemen have experienced difficulty in establishing their eligibility for repatriation benefits. As we know, over the years attention has been focussed on the onus-of-proof provision of the act. Because records are incomplete, or were lost, many ex-servicemen have been precluded from obtaining repatriation benefits. Although the wording of the bill is sufficiently wide to include the natives who served with our forces during the war, I do not consider that the full spirit of the Repatriation Act has been incorporated in this legislation in order to ensure that the natives who suffered incapacity through their war service are properly compensated by means of repatriation benefits. So that we may retain the full confidence of the natives, which we enjoyed during the war years by doing something worthy to acknowledge their assistance to our forces, I think that the district patrol officers should assist natives in their areas to establish their claim for repatriation benefits if their disabilities are attributable to war service. </para>
          <para>The Opposition does not oppose this measure, the desirability of which, we believe, has been overlooked in the past. It provides to the natives who rescued many of our servicemen who had been injured while fighting in the jungle, and brought them back to casualty clearing stations, tangible evidence of the appreciation of the Australian nation. In a small degree, it shows that we deeply appreciate the assistance that the natives rendered to our forces during World War II. The Opposition gives the legislation its blessing. </para>

            <para>. -  The Opposition supports the bill. It is a purely machinery measure to amplify the definition of &#34; Governor-General &#34; in the Acts Interpretation Act, to include the GovernorGeneral through his deputies acting on the advice of the Executive Council. There is a corresponding provision in relation to the Governor of a State. The term is expanded to include an administrator acting in that capacity. The existing definition of &#34;GovernorGeneral&#34; in section 17 is repealed. These are necessary provisions, and we support them. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>. -  I regret my action in detaining the Senate at this late hour, but I wish to bring before honorable senators a matter that, to me, is very important; if I do not do so now, I may not have another opportunity to refer to it before the end of this session. This afternoon, I received from the Minister acting for the Minister for Immigration a reply to a question I had asked, upon notice, on the subject of child migration, in which I have been intensely interested ever since the inception of the post-war scheme based on the 1946 legislation. In 1947, I met the first batch of child migrants that came to this country. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The agreement to bring child migrants to Australia from Great Britain and Malta was brought about by the exigencies of war and the necessity to find homes for as many war-orphaned children as could possibly be accommodated. Due to the necessity for speedy action at that time, some aspects of the matter were overlooked, and they havenot since been rectified. I do not think sufficient attention was given at the time, nor has it since been given, to the care of these . children after they reach the age of sixteen years and are no longer able to remain in institutions; when they no longer are the direct responsibility of various child, welfare organizations. </para>
          <para>At this stage, I should like to pay a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Young,</inline> the child welfareofficer in my own State of Western Australia. He has done, and is still doing, a wonderful job in connexion with child migrants. Unfortunately, however, during, the last few months a few of these teenageboys, as well as other teen-agers in-the community, have been running foul of the law. The percentage of migrant boys soinvolved has been considerably less than the percentage of boys from the rest of the community, but the very fact that some boys involved are migrants has been unduly stressed in the press, with the result that there has been a great deal of adverse publicity and criticism, not only of theboys but also of the whole scheme. I regard this criticism as being completely unwarranted. However, it does raise a problem which I have discussed with the various authorities concerned. </para>
          <para>Unfortunately, honorable senators did not hear the answers given to me this afternoon by the Minister for Immigration. Most of those who have been in some kind of conflict with the law - they are mainly boys, because boys have been giving the most trouble, as usual, I suppose - are between the ages of 16 and 18 years. This, naturally poses a question as to how far the responsibility of the Commonwealth Parliament extends to children whom it has helped to bring to Australia. </para>
          <para>In Western Australia alone, there have been 1,394 child migrants in the last ten years. Of those, 298 have been absorbed by the Fairbridge farm school scheme, which was well established long before the war, and has an excellent organization both here and in England. It has its own after-care officers, and its wards are of the type we need in this country. </para>
          <para>Of the other children, eight have gone to the Methodist Children&#39;s Home, 195 to the Church of England Swan Homes for girls and boys, and 893 to Catholic institutions in the State. I was astounded, as perhaps other honorable senators will be astounded, to learn that the Commonwealth Government&#39;s sole contribution to the support in Australia of these children is only 10s. a week in child endowment. The United Kingdom Government, or the Government of Malta, in the case of those children who come from Malta, contributes 12s. 6d. a week for each child. The Western Australian Government contributes &#163;1 2s. 3d. a week for each child, plus ls. if the children receive education at schools on the premises of these institutions. An amount of 7s. 6d. per week is provided by the Western Australian Lotteries Commission. We are rather getting migrants on the cheap when we have recourse to a lotteries commission to help us support these children. I know that the institutions are very glad to get this money, but although the Commonwealth Government has sponsored the scheme it is paying only child endowment toward the cost of their maintenance, in addition to an outfitting allowance of &#163;10 to equip a child with clothing on arrival in Australia. </para>
          <para>The Minister&#39;s answer also states that &#163;146,000 has been made available in Western Australia as a joint contribution by Commonwealth and State governments towards the capital cost of providing accommodation for migrant children, and more than &#163;500,000 has been spent for this purpose throughout Australia. I understand from official sources that Western Australia has received more than half the child migrants under this scheme, but it has received only a little over one-quarter of the total contribution towards capital cost of accommodation. The Commonwealth Government has been paying, on an average, 4s. a week for each child for accommodation in Western Australia. We take due cognisance of that fact, and thank the Government for it. </para>
          <para>I come in contact with numbers of these boys. Many of them visit me at my home, and since they first arrived many have called me &#34; Aunty &#34; because I have taken a personal interest in them. I know some of their problems. Coming from institutions, they go into employment and, for the first time in their lives they have money of their own in their pockets. For the first time, they have complete independence. An examination of their ages shows that they were born either in the year war was declared or in one of the early years of the war. In their youth they knew nothing but war and the problems associated with it. The result is that, when they have money in their pockets for the first time, the first things they buy are pink socks and yellow shirts, or some kind of so-called bodgie outfit, not because they are bodgies but just because that is what the other lads are doing. We find that the greatest problem is that of accommodating them after they have left the institutions and providing them with proper supervision. It is all very well for the department to say, as the Minister said in his reply, that adequate arrangements with the Child Welfare Department and church organizations exist for the after-care of these children. Fairbridge, of course, has its own after-care officer. </para>
          <para>I have discussed this matter with the church authorities concerned. They, too, are very anxious about the problem, but their funds will not extend to paying welfare officers of their own to see that these children are adequately supervised. Although these organizations do their best - I pay a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Robertson</inline> of the Anglican church and to Miss Sanderson of the Catholic Migration Committee for the work they are doing in trying to keep supervision over these lads who are scattered in various homes - their task is difficult. I think the Government should perhaps help by subsidizing the cost of employing at least one officer to carry out supervisory work for all the church committees, as they are the ones who are sponsoring these children. That is not a great deal to expect. Officials of the Child Welfare Department are at the present time fully occupied with all their other duties. They have to look after neglected and destitute children, and children who are committed to their care by the Children&#39;s Court. The Child Welfare Department has not the time or the personnel to ensure that this job is adequately done. I have visited some homes in which children are billeted, and have found that in some instances the homes are one of the causes of the problem. They are not always satisfactory, and a boy is sometimes moved from one home to another because satisfactory arrangements are not made. In many instances there is nowhere for him to go after the evening meal. Sometimes he is regarded as a meal ticket by the householder, and after the evening meal he has either to sit in a back room of the house or go down to the corner milk bar. In no time he is in a street gang, and in a few weeks he is in difficulty before a court. </para>
          <para>I know that these things are true. In the last few months I have spent some days in courts speaking on behalf of children who have become involved in minor breaches of the law. They would not be so involved if we had some kind of hostel for the care and accommodation of boys of from sixteen to eighteen years of age. Nobody asks for expensive buildings, but they need some place where they could become more used to the ways of the world and be more easily assimilated into the community. Of the boys who leave institutions each year, a high percentage would be normally assimilable into good families. Many people are only too pleased to take these children into their homes, but, as in every community, there are always problem boys, and those are the ones of whom we must take more cognizance. </para>
          <para>I have been making a survey of the various suburbs where the lads are located, and I find that lads in those suburbs which are most conducive to the existence of gangs are far more likely to finish up in some kind of trouble. Some of the homes to which they go are not very suitable, and some of the boys are in trouble with the persons in the houses to which they are assigned. I should like the Commonwealth to consider helping the church or welfare authorities to establish a church hostel. They are quite willing to work in together on this matter. I have spoken to all the authorities concerned and they are willing to work together to help the boys between sixteen and eighteen years of age. This would not require a very big institution. It would not need to be a replica of the one they had left. Perhaps the better system would be to have several small homes catering for an average of twelve boys who would gradually become ordinary members of the Australian community. </para>
          <para>These are really worth-while lads. They are very likeable lads. Even though some of them have served prison sentences, I have been very proud to have them in my home. They come to see me regularly, and I submit that it is the responsibility of us, who pass legislation to bring these boys to Australia, to do our utmost to carry the job through to a successful conclusion by helping these lads through the very difficult period between sixteen and eighteen years of age and to see that each of them is given the opportunity to become the decent citizen that I know he can be. </para>

            <para>.- I, too, regret having to detain the Senate at this late hour, but I cannot ignore an invitation by the Minister for Shipping and Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Paltridge)</inline> to take any means at my disposal to obtain redress in the matter to which I am about to refer. The only means I have at my disposal for ventilating the matter, if I feel that my electors are not being treated fairly by government departments, or if I feel that Commonwealth officers are not playing the game fairly, is to bring the matter before the notice of the appropriate Minister in the Senate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have been doing that. About twelve months have elapsed since I first took up this matter, and I propose now to give reasons why I approached the federal authorities. On 5th October, 1956, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. H.</inline> R. Driscoll, manager of the Agricultural Bank in Hobart, sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Shea</inline> a letter which read, in part - </para>

          <para class="block">He did not say &#34; State &#34;-  is binding on all closer settlement boards, and  I  must therefore require you to let me have a payment forthwith and to make payments regularly in future. </para>
          <para class="block">On 19th October, 1956 - which was not yesterday - <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Driscoll</inline> concluded a letter addressed to me, with these words - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I would suggest that if you desire to make representations on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Shea</inline> you should approach the Minister for Primary Industry in Canberra. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Honorable senators will notice that he did not say, &#34; the Minister for Agriculture in Tasmania &#34;. He said, &#34; the Minister for Primary Industry in Canberra &#34;. </para>
          <para>Naturally, accepting that good advice, I raised the matter here. I have asked a number of question, and I have raised the matter on the motion for the adjournment. In the first instance, the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator O&#39;sullivan)</inline> took up <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> question. He soon fell out. I was then directed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Colquhoun. Mr. Colquhoun</inline> asked me for certain information in the form of affidavits. I obtained that information and handed it to him, and the charges I make are based on what is contained in those affidavits, not on hearsay. They are based on what is contained in the affidavits and what I saw for myself - but mainly on what is contained in the affidavits. </para>
          <para>On a number of occasions I have asked whether the statements contained in those affidavits were statements of fact or whether they were not. The Minister has sidetracked answering on every occasion. He has refused to answer &#34; Yea &#34; or &#34; Nay &#34;. He will not dispute them. He will not say they are false, and he will not say they are true. That leaves me in mid-air again, and in the circumstances I can only bring up the matter here. </para>
          <para>The Minister himself has admitted that he is not an agricultural man. He has amply demonstrated that. If he had been an agricultural man, he would not have put up the Aunt Sallys that were passed up to him when he spoke last on that matter here. I shall deal with them shortly. </para>
          <para>In the course of his reply to me on the last occasion, the Minister said - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I sum up. This man contracted a debt through inefficiency, and there is obviously no reason at all why the public purse should be expected to subsidize inefficiency. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">If this man had contracted this debt through inefficiency, purely through his own fault, I would not be here to-night speaking in his defence. I charge the departmental officers with displaying as much inefficiency as that shown by this man. I assert that 75 per cent, or 80 per cent, of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Shea&#39;s</inline> so-called inefficiency was due to sickness in the family and to accident, and emphasize that there is no excuse whatever for the inefficiency shown by the departmental officers. </para>
          <para>If this man was so inefficient, why did not the departmental officers step in sooner and direct him? It must not be forgotten that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Shea</inline> offered to stay on that property. He was not anxious to move off. He offered to work on the property under the direction of the officers, and to take so much as wages. He has stated that in a signed affidavit. The departmental officers refused his request, and sold him up. If there was any inefficiency there, I submit that the departmental officers showed as much inefficiency as did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Shea,</inline> especially in connexion with the purchase and sale of O&#39;Shea&#39;s stock. If what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Shea</inline> says about what was circulated about his stock, who bought the stock and for whom it was bought is true, does it not reek of something shady, does not the transaction bear all the appearances of being shady? I repeat that this man&#39;s allegations are contained in an affidavit signed by him. I now ask the Minister whether he can produce affidavits from departmental officers contradicting what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Shea</inline> has said. </para>
          <para>Let me go a little further. The Minister put up the argument that this man had ordered a new car. Can he produce a signed order form from any car dealer to show that this man did order a new car? I have done a little car selling in my time, and I know that no car is ordered until a man&#39;s name is on the dotted line of an order form. Every car salesman knows that. No car salesman will say that any man has ordered a new car unless he has some proof of it, especially if the prospective buyer is buying on hire purchase. Let the Minister produce the signed order form. Do not let us have Aunt Sallys built up on hearsay or on some statement circulated by somebody who is out to down another man. </para>
          <para>Let us now deal with the other car mentioned by the Minister. If O&#39;Shea&#39;s wife was able by some other means to save money and buy an old second-hand car, is that to be held against the ex-soldier? If she has money of her own, has she got to put it in to wipe off this man&#39;s alleged debt to the Government? I should like the Minister&#39;s reply on that point. Has she got to put her own money in? Has she got to put in money that she has obtained from other private sources? In any event, O&#39;Shea could not afford to run it or to keep it on the road, and it lay in the back yard. </para>
          <para>Having dealt with the point raised by the Minister in connexion with the car, I come now to another matter mentioned by him. He said that too much superphosphate had been applied to some paddocks on O&#39;Shea&#39;s property, and that none had been put on others. Did the departmental officers go to O&#39;Shea and tell him he was making a mistake? Were they there to see what superphosphate he had spread over the paddocks? If they were, did they check him and tell him he was making a mistake? I should like to know. I say they did not. I say that the superphosphate is on the area now. The suggestion put up is that O&#39;Shea applied two bags to the acre on some of the land and none to other parts of the land. According to the Minister&#39;s own words, some of the closer settlement land - I am not referring to King Island now - that this Government has been backing financially requires the application of 5 cwt. to the acre. As one who knows a little about the land, I can only say, &#34; God help the public purse if land has to be fed with superphosphate at the rate of 5 cwt. to the acre in order to grow grazing grass &#34; ! Some of this land might have had two bags of superphosphate to the acre, but O&#39;Shea might have been directed to fertilize it heavily. The main point is that O&#39;Shea bought the fertilizer and it is now on the land and the person who is making a success of the property now is getting the benefit from that superphosphate. The man whom the Government is asking to pay for the fertilizer is getting no benefit whatever. The man who followed him would get the benefit and this ex-serviceman is not to be allowed any compensation for the manure, although he claims that he could have made good if he had been given an opportunity once he recovered his health. </para>
          <para>The Minister said that this man was guilty of a terrible crime. He must be put off his property because he spread too much manure on one part of his land and not enough on others. The Minister&#39;s second <inline font-style="italic">point was that</inline> the settler should be put off the farm because he allowed his bull to run with the cows. I was milking cows in 1930 when butterfat was 6d. per lb., so I can talk with some knowledge about bulls running with cows, but I doubt whether the Minister for Primary Industry knows anything about it. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Colquhoun</inline> gave this explanation I thought he was joking. I did not think that he would have the cheek to get the Minister to put this matter to the House. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the proposition. What sense is there in keeping the bull away from the cows at certain times of the year? If a dairyman knows his job, he will want the cows to come in at a certain time. On most farms it is not possible to have cows coming in at all times if the farmer hopes to treat them properly. Unless he has help, he must have cows coming in at intervals so that he can handle the stock. An efficient dairyman knows that all the calves have to be reared as a rule, and a man is in a fix if he tries to handle 20 calves at a time on his own. There is the brutal way of doing it by leaving the calves in a paddock so that they will either drink or die. Some of them will die before they will drink. Calves should be nursed. It was essential for this farmer to have his cows coming in at intervals. He was quite within his rights and could do no harm in allowing the bull to run with the cows unless they would come in too early, and the district is an early one for feed. </para>
          <para>The Minister said that the man had a broken ankle. He had his bull fenced in one paddock and he had to get his cows to the bull. What hope did he have with a broken ankle and a crazy, mad bull on one side of the fence and a half-crazy cow on the other side? Is the Government going to put a man off a farm because he did not separate the bull from the cows when he had an broken ankle? Honorable senators who know nothing about dairy-farming may laugh, but anybody who knows the finer points of the industry, will realize that these are hard cold facts. This farmer had every good reason to run his bull with the cows. With his broken ankle he would have been in a terrible fix if he had not done so. </para>
          <para>The Minister said that the settler broke his ankle playing football, and that that was sufficient reason to push him off the farm and sell his property. When a man goes on to a war service land settlement property, does he have to stay there day and night, Saturdays and Sundays included, and not have some recreation? Is he to be just a slave for the War Service Land Settlement Division? Must he ask permission of the division before he can play cricket, or golf, or football? Any honorable senator could trip on the steps while walking out of this chamber, and break his ankle. Would it be said that he had no right to be on the steps, and that he should have been sitting in the chamber doing his job? Can the Minister claim that because a man wants a little recreation after working his farm it is a crime for him to kick a football with some of his mates? Is it such a crime that he should be sold up and put off the farm? The Minister will not deny that he gave that reason among others for putting this man off the property. </para>
          <para>These are Aunt Sallys that have been put up by the Minister because the Government has not got a case to answer the representations that I made. This man has been accused of being lazy. The Minister should ask his present boss, the man for whom he has been working ever since he was pushed off the farm, whether or not he is lazy. His employer will not describe him as being lazy. If he had been lazy, he would not have kept his employment all the years since he was put off the farm. </para>
          <para>The Minister said, for good measure, that the settler suffered his illnesses a long time ago. That is true. If he had not been sick a long time ago, he would not have been pushed off the farm. He lost the property because of his bad health. His wife has had a heart attack, or a stroke, since then, and the settler has been in the repatriation hospital, but his recent illnesses have not compared with those he suffered when he lost his farm. </para>
          <para>I reiterate that the Commonwealth Government has not played fairly with me by stating that this is a State matter. It has kept me waiting for twelve months before trying to slip out from under. For twelve months, Commonwealth officers have accepted the responsibility. Now they want to say that this is a State responsibility. If it is a State matter, why did the Commonwealth authorities enter into negotiations on this case? Why was I not referred to the State at once. The State authorities said that this was a Commonwealth responsibility and that they could do nothing about it. I have correspondence from the State officers to that effect. Therefore, I have no recourse but to raise this matter in the Senate. If I cannot get any satisfaction or reasonable redress for this man, I will raise the matter wherever I speak, from one end of the electorate to the other, because I believe that I have a good case. </para>
          <para>The Government has not bowled over my case. I do not blame the Minister for Shipping and Transport for not having answered my questions adequately. He has to put forward the reply that is suppliedto him. I do not propose to accept it in this instance. </para>

            <para>. -  I do not propose to speak at length in reply  to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett.</inline> There is no need to do so because this case has been before the Senate frequently. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has not failed to use every opportunity to bring this matter to the notice of the Senate. The cold unyielding facts are that the man concerned was settled on a war service land settlement farm. It should not be necessary to me to remind the Senate that it is not the function of the War Service Land Settlement Division to kick ex-servicemen off farms. It is the function of the division to establish  them  on properties. As I have said on a number of occasions, in every State throughout Australia the record of the division is one of which we as a Parliament, and not as party supporters, should be justifiably proud. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> has come forward with an isolated case, and has said that this man has not been given a fair go. He claims that this man has been unfairly treated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I submit that this case has been examined with a sympathy that is characteristic of the administration of the War Service Land Settlement Division. The case has been given every consideration. It has been considered by State officers who are responsible for the administration of the scheme. It has also come before the responsible federal officers and the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. McMahon),</inline> and has received the attention of those men because it has come on the representations of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett.</inline></para>

          <para>Despite the fact that this matter has engaged the attention of State and Federal officers for a long time, the decision remains unaltered and, I fear, unalterable. This man has proved himself, by every standard, to be an inefficient farmer. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> says that is not right; but I say that, on the evidence submitted by the honorable senator, it is right. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> now claims that he has some fresh evidence which is available, as I understand it, by way of affidavit, I invite him to submit that fresh evidence and let the case again be re-opened on that basis. On the basis of the evidence that he has produced in the past, the whole case fails. </para>
