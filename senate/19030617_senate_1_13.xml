            <para>- I think it necessary very briefly to state the circumstances which surround the proposal before the Committee, in order that honorable senators who were not present last Friday may know what we are about to do. The standing order under consideration enables the motion, &#34; That the Committee do now divide &#34; - which is a closure motion - to be applied to any debate. Those who oppose that standing order failed to carry a provision that there should be a two-thirds majority in favour, of such a motion, and it is now proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith</inline> that the closure must be carried <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> a majority of not less than four. I submit that that is a just proposal. It would be in the power of a majority of four, if they so wished, to close the mouths of those senators who had not spoken to the question under consideration. I . learn that the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives have considered a proposal of this kind, and have rejected it absolutely. That House has not in its draft standing orders anything approaching the proposal now put forward by our Standing Orders Committee. Surely if the House of Representatives, consisting of 75 members, can get along without a standing order of this kind, a more limited House like the Senate, consisting of only 36 members, can do without it. </para>

              <para>- I do not know the meaning of that interjection. The honorable senator is like a boy who throws a stone into a yard. He does not aim at anything, but hopes that he will hit something. No other legislative body in the world has such a standing order as this. Let us understand how it came to be- put into operation in the Legislature of South Australia. I understand that there was there a gentleman named Ash. </para>

              <para>- I learn from a member of- the House of Representatives that the only time that he saw this standing order used was when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ash</inline> conceived it to be his duty to &#34; stone- wall &#34; at great length a Factories Bill which was under consideration. I believe that he kept the House of Assembly up all one night, and that the members, with the exception of the Minister in charge of the Bill and the Chairman, left  the chamber. Strangers were excluded from the gallery, and the affair became such a scandal that it was deemed absolutely necessary to put the standing order into operation. &#39; If I am mistaken on the point I have been wrongly informed, and some South Australian senator will be able to correct me. But I have had occasion to look at the debates of the South Australian Parliament, and, democratic and liberal as the people there -generally are, the majority did some autocratic and tyrannical things. They took up a very dictatorial  attitude towards a small minority opposed to them. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator would have done it when he was a younger man. There are times when people become intolerant. Their minds are made up j they think that the very last word has been said on a particular subject ; that they have all the wisdom, and that nobody need say anything else because there is no other side to be put. We want to give the minority an opportunity of being heard. I may not be in a minority always. I know that some, honorable senators think that I am looking after my own interests in this matter, but it is possible that I may be in a majority some day, and I might want to close up <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford.</inline> I wish to be prevented from doing that sort of thing. I feel certain that honorable senators from New South Wales and other States, which have had no experience of such a standing order as this, will not tolerate anything of the kind, and will vote for  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Smith&#39;s</inline> amendment. </para>

            <para>- The honorable senator who has just sat down says that, there is no such stringent provision as this in the standing orders of any Parliament in the world, except that of South Australia. He must have forgotten the closure rules of the British House of Commons, which are infinitely more stringent. Prevention is often considered better than cure.. In the House of Commons the rule provides that any member may move at any time &#34; That the question be now put,&#34; and the  Speaker  rules. If there is a division on the question, the only qualification is that 100 members, out of a House consisting of 670 members, shall vote in favour of the closure motion. I venture to say that there is no danger in this provision. It has been proved to work well in the Senate, as well as for a great number of years in the Parliament to which I have been more accustomed. The standing order was not instituted in South Australia in consequence of the conduct of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ash.</inline> I went into the South Australian Parliament in 1878, and the rule had been in force a great many years before that j in fact, I believe it is as old as the original standing orders of that State. The informant of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> told him two things which were utterly inconsistent with each other. One was that this standing order had only been used there in a case of very exceptional abuse, when a man kept members up all night wasting time. In the next breath he spoke of the dictatorial way in which the minority of South Australia were used by the majority. I appeal to all my honorable friends who come from South Australia to say with me that there has never been any dictation there any more than there has been here; and no one can assert that our proceedings in the Senate have not been conducted with great decorum. We have been conducting our proceedings with this standing order in force all the time, and no one can say that it has been abused. In South Australia it has never been complained of by anybody, and during the number of years I was there there was no party on either side of the House that wished to get rid of the rule. But I do not think the matter is of very much importance. We are not a very large body in the Senate. There are only 36 of us. But we do not want a set of circumstances to arise, under which we shall be kept here all night, supposing any honorable senator, becoming recalcitrant and troublesome, endeavours to delay business, rather than produce any result, or to delay producing results.We may pass the standing order with confidence, inasmuch as it has been in operation for many years in another Parliament, has never caused any trouble there, and has met with universal approbation. Now it is proposed that the closure motion shall be carried by a majority of at least four. When real obstruction has set in a large number of members go away. The attendance gets thinner and thinner, and it might be a matter of immense difficulty to get a majority of four at the very time when the closure motion was most wanted. </para>

            <para>- I think we should have some intimation from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> and those who show so much enthusiasm in supporting the infamous gag, as to how they feel disposed to treat the new amendment. Many of the proposals we have made are exceedingly fair, and the least we have a right to expect from the representative of the Government is an intimation as to whether he is prepared to accept them or not. I believe <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has already referred to the matter, but I take advantage of this opportunity to mention the remarkable fact that the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives, representing a House of 75 members, cut out every one of these closure standing orders. And yet we have the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate submitting an infamous standing order of this description, and the Government supporting it. </para>

We are told that it is the invariable practice in South Australia that Ministers, and those who have already spoken, do not vote for such a motion, and it seems to me that if we are to adopt the South Australian practice, and to require a minimum vote of thirteen to carry this motion, the whole thing will be rendered nugatory. If, on the other hand; we do not adopt that practice, by insisting upon a minimum vote of thirteen in support of this motion we make it more stringent than if we allow the standing order to remain as it is, with the understanding that the South Australian practice is to be followed.

            <para>- It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake</inline> to speak of what has been the invariable rule in South Australia. The honorable and learned senator has become very credulous all of a sudden. He must know that the rule to which he referred was not followed in this Chamber. Honorable senators from South Australia ought to know that it has not always been followed in that State. There have been men in the South Australian Parliament who were prepared to vote when even the Constitution would prevent them, and it is within my knowledge that members of the South Australian Legislative Council who had already spoken upon a question voted when it was to their interest to have the motion put - That the House do now divide.&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> says that what we have proposed would make the standing order impracticable. But why would it make it impracticable? The honorable and learned senator has said that in the House of Commons, which honorable senators are so fond of quoting and following, it requires 100 to apply the &#34;gag.&#34; I cannot call it anything else. If 100 are required in the House of Commons where the attendance, unless in very exceptional cases, is&#39; never more than between 200 and 300, surely 13 in the Senate, where the attendance is very often up to 30, is not an excessive vote to require in favour of such&#39; a motion. It does not matter a great deal to me, but when there are honorable senators from other States who have suffered from the application of the closure I think some consideration should be given to their views. </para>

            <para>- I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal,</inline> when  President  of the Legislative Council of Victoria, used in this Chamber to put such a motion himself. I have been told that it was quite usual for the honorable senator to tell a member of the Legislative Council ofVictoria that he had said enough already. He had the closure in his own hands, and the honorable senator, while  President  of the Legislative Council, was a standing order unto himself, and, I believe, a very good one. Here we have a reasonable request that at least thirteen senators shall assent to any motion of this description. If there are not thirteen senators present prepared to vote for stopping a debate, no great harm can be done by allowing- the debate to continue, until the absentees had an opportunity to return. Therefore, I hope -that the Committee will support the amendment. I do not waste very much time in the Senate, and I hope the gag will not be applied to me here as it was applied to me in the Legislative Council of South Australia where, we are told, it has been the invariable rule for Ministers not to vote on a motion for the application of the closure. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator MILLEN</inline>(New South Wales).The Postmaster- General has addressed to the Committee an argument from which he has attempted to show that the practice ruling in one State Parliament will necessarily be adopted here. But why should the practice of the South Australian Parliament, more than that of any other State Legislature, be taken as necessarily indicating  the practice which will be adopted here <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> In the New South Wales Legislature, where a provision somewhat similar to that proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> is in vogue, it has been the invariable practice of Ministers to vote, as I contend that they ought to vote, on such a question. No honorable senator, whether a Minister or otherwise  should shirk his responsibility by retiring from the Chamber when a vote of this character -is submitted. Whatever may be the result of this amendment, I hope that no such practice as that which I am astonished to learn is countenanced in South Australia, will be adopted in the Senate. I think the suggested minimum of thirteen is most reasonable. We require that a quorum shall be present for the transaction of our business, and ii&#60; it too much to ask that there shall be at least thirteen senators voting in the affirmative on a question involving a somewhat similar principle <inline font-style="italic">1</inline></para>

            <para>- The honorable senator who has just resumed his seat did not hear the discussion which took place last week, or he would not have said that in South Australia Ministers invariably leave the .chamber when  what has  been called this &#34; infamous gag &#34; is applied. I have never known of an instance in which they failed to vote on the question. The rule is that they vote against the application of the gag. That wa!s the position taken up by Ministers in South Australia during my experience as a member of the State Legislature from 1S68 until I entered the Senate. There may have been one or two instances in which they did not follow that rule, but that was the practice. It is very singular that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dawson</inline> should call this an &#34;infamous gag.&#34; He quite forgets that when the South Australian labour party was organized, they were thoroughly familiar with the standing orders governing the State Parliament : and they thought this such a wise provision that they adopted it in their own standing orders. Thus this &#34;infamous gag&#34; is the gag of the labour party in South Australia. The fear that this standing order will be unfairly applied is altogether without reason. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor</inline> cannot say that the similar provision in the South Australian standing orders was unfairly applied to him on the occasion when he was speaking in the State Legislative Council. He was unmistakably &#34;stone- walling&#34; at the time, and the closure was rightly applied in that instance. He cannot bring forward any case in which it was not rightly applied there. It  is much better that we should leave the standing order as it is, for I feel sure that in a Chamber like this it will never be applied unless it is richly deserved by the party against whom it is directed. </para>

            <para>- I regret that I cannot share the enthusiasm that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> evidently entertains for all the doings of the South Australian Ministry. I am also unable to find myself in agreement with the Postmaster-General, who has indicated a ready willingness to submit himself, for all futurity, to the practice and precedents of the South Australian Parliament. That is an attitude of which I cannot approve, and which, I think, is utterly unworthy of the Postmaster-General. I have consistently voted for this standing order, believing that in doing so I was maintaining majority rule. I still propose to maintain majority rule. There are two ways in which a minority might carry out their desire. A minority might have their way in the Senate if they were allowed to continue a debate in spite of the wishes of the majority, and they might also have their way in preventing a debate. Unless at least thirteen vote for the application of a provision like this, we shall have practically minority rule. The reason why I support this amendment is because I believe &#39;in majority rule, and because I object to a minority of less than thirteen deciding any question in the Senate. The amendment is a wise one, although I do not know whether those who are most anxious for its adoption know what it really means. It may be argued that thirteen is an arbitrary number. It is not, because we have to recognise that twelve form a quorum in this Chamber. It is because thirteen is one more than the number required to form a quorum that I am, going to vote for the amendment. </para>

            <para>- Under our Constitution twelve honorable senators are required to form a quorum, but the amendment practically proposes that when twelve honorable senators are present we should not transact any business if some honorable senator moves &#34; That the Committee do now divide.&#34; In such circumstances some honorable senators might leave the chamber, just as we have seen them do before. If there were sixteen senators present, and twelve voted for &#39;the motion, &#34; That the Committee do now divide,&#34; while four voted against it, when there would be a majority of eight in favour of the question, it would still be impossible for the Committee to close the debate. In other words, four honorable senators would out-vote twelve, because the amendment is that at least thirteen shall vote for the application of the &#34; gag,&#34; as the standing order has been called. It is true that in the House of Commons there must be 100 affirmative votes for the application of the closure. That is practically oneseventh of the total number of members. In the Senate a seventh would be a little over five, or say six senators, so that, by requiring that at least thirteen honorable senators shall vote in the affirmative, we shall make the rule quite as difficult of application as it is in the House of Commons. </para>

            <para>- A\7e have listened with very great pleasure to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walker&#39;s</inline> arithmetical calculations, but if we are to compare the House of Commons with this Chamber, we must make the comparison complete in every way. Twelve honorable senators, or one-third of the total strength of the Chamber form a quorum, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> proposes that the number of affirmative votes cast in favour of the motion, &#34; That the Committee do now divide,&#34; shall be one more. Forty members form a quorum in the House of Commons, or slightly over one-sixteenth of the total number of members, and yet the number  of affirmative votes necessary to impose the closure is- 100,  or two and  a half times the  number of  the quorum. If we followed that rule we should, m therefore, require 30 affirmative votes. It is only necessary to carry out the analogy to the full extent in order to see how ridiculous it is. I have often said that it is absurd to compare our procedure with that of the House of Commons. We are here representing a new country and a new Constitution. We are building from the foundations, and we should build according to our own ideas. I am very much surprised&#39; that, in a Chamber where so many of the foremost constitutionalists of Australia find a place, an attempt should be made to deprive the representatives of the people of the rights which are conferred upon them by the people. I have often seen, in connexion with legal procedure, the words &#34; <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires.&#34;</inline> I do not know their exact  meaning  but I have <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> faint impression that they mean that some individual has done something which he has no right to do. In any case, it appears to <inline font-style="italic">ma</inline> that the Senate is attempting to do something which, under the Constitution, -it has no power to do. That is the position I take up. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Fraser</inline> is a great admirer of the Constitution, but by supporting this standing order, it appears to me that he is trampling it underfoot. Why are&#34; we sent here ? Are we not elected for the purpose of representing the ideas and wishes and aspirations of our constituents ? </para>

              <para>-The honorable senator has formed a very correct estimate of his own capacity, I regret to say. We are here sent by our constituents to represent their case here, and yet a majority of honorable senators desire in this standing order to usurp the power which belongs to only the constituencies. For instance, if my constituents sent me to Melbourne to support a certain proposal, the majority of the senators could deprive me of my right to speak. What is the object of this standing order&#39;! Is it not to stifle discussion? If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> had twenty witnesses to examine in a court who could each testify to a particular thing, what would he think if after the tenth witness had been examined the Judge quietly said, <inline font-weight="bold">&#34;Mr. Dobson,&#39;</inline> I do not want to hear any more evidence; my mind is made up <inline font-style="italic">1&#34;</inline></para>

              <para>- Certainly there is. The honorable and learned senator would complain, and very fairly, that an injustice was being done to his client. The evil of the rule appeals to him immediately when it is applied to a case in a court, and it is intensified a hundredfold when it is applied to a question in the Senate, where the interests of the community are at stake. Seeing that nothing better can be done, I intend to support the amendment. It is, I think, a very fair compromise. It is not asking for very much. It places the power of stifling discussion in the hands of thirteen senators in a House of 25.. What more do the friends of the gag want? Surely that is quite sufficient for them <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If they want anything more they must be epicures in the matter of gagging. </para>

            <para>- I am surprised at the opposition which is shown to this very reasonable amendment. I do not believe in closure rules. I have always voted against their application in Queensland, and I shall always vote against their application in&#34; the Senate. I am very anxious to ascertain the motives which actuate honorable senators to favour the adoption of the closure. During the last two years has there been any sound reason advanced why the closure should be applied ? It has been applied once or twice. To my regret it was applied once against the Government when I was  very anxious that they should win. It seemed to me &#39; to act unfairly on that occasion. If there was no strong justification for the application of the rule during that long session, when most controversial measures were debated, why is it now desired that it should be embodied in our code of Standing orders ? It appears to be feared by some honorable senators that something serious may happen, and that it will be well to have this weapon available to silence those whom they do not wish to hear on a question. Supposing that, in a reasonably full Senate, we are discussing a question of very great moment, affecting, it may be, the welfare of the people of Australia - at any rate, the people of some State. What objection can there be to a rule requiring that thirteen honorable senators shall support a motion to close such a debate. Some honorable senators have found fault with the PostmasterGeneral because he supports the standing order. I presume that, as acting leader of the Senate, he is bound, in fairness, to take the course which he has taken. I know that he has smarted more than once under the very stringent rules of the Legislative Assembly of Queensland. I have smarted there time and again, and I am not anxious to smart in the Senate. I am very much disappointed that honorable senators cannot see their way to support this very reasonable amendment. </para>

            <para>- Any question relating to what is termed &#34;the gag&#34; is always received most  unpopularly  in a House, because honorable members do not like to interfere with the fair opportunity of  every  member to express his opinions in his own way, so long as he shows fair consideration for the opinions of others. In New South Wales I had experience of the application of &#34;the gag,&#34; and I believe that, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Millen,</inline> I always voted against its application. The Standing Orders Committee prepared this code with the desire of meeting as many cases as might possibly arise in the future. We had to bear in mind that if we determined upon having a rule of this kind it could only be enforced by a majority of the senators present. The statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> that he supports the provision because he believes in majority rule will be seen to have no weight at all. Supposing that we had a rule to the effect that no clause of a Bill should be passed unless at least thirteen senators voted in the affirmative; should we not be reducing our legislation to a farce? The Constitution says that twelve senators shall form a quorum, and shall be empowered to transact all. the business which may be presented. If we were to provide that no question should be decided in the affirmative&#34; unless thirteen senators had so voted, we should be doing the very thing which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce</inline> suggests with regard to the closure ? The strong sense of justice in the  majority of the senators will always prevent any unfair use being made of &#34; the gag.&#34; </para>

              <para>- If a question has not been discussed fairly and fully, there will probably be a number of honorable senators who will desire to speak, and who, if for no other reason than that, will oppose the application of the rule, unless they recognise that such gross abuse is being made of the privilege of speech that it is better to close the debate than to speak themselves. In Committee a senator can speak as often and as long as he likes, and if we had no closure rule, four or five determined meLL could prevent the Committee from coming to any decision within a reasonable time. We do not desire that sort of thing to happen. We wish to be in a position to say to honorable senators - &#34; You have debated this question for a long time. You know that you are defeated, but as you are determined to &#34;stone- wall&#34; and make it almost impossible to pass the clause under discussion, we will put an end to the debate at once.&#34; I am not a believer in applying the gag where it can be avoided. But I do not think that we should be justified in introducing such an amendment as that proposed. If we have 25 senators present it would mean that the closure motion could be enforced, but if- there were only 16 or 17 senators present there would be no possibility of closing the debate, if there were a few who were determined that it should not be closed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Higgs</inline> has been fighting this question very determinedly.

              <para>.- I do not know what arguments the honorable senator would have&#39; adduced. . As to the question of majority rule, I would point out that if a majority of thirteen be required to stop a debate, by the same parity of reasoning there should be thirteen to decide any question put to the Senate. To insist on that would be to reduce the whole business to an absurdity. I intend to vote against the amendment, although I have every objection to interfering with honorable senators&#39; speeches. But the majority have a right to some consideration when there is &#34; stone-walling&#34; going on. Four or five men could effectually &#34;stone-wall&#34; in a Senate of sixteen senators, and it would be quite impossible if this amendment were carried to put an end to a debate of that kind unless a large number of those present walked out of the chamber. </para>

              <para>- The Constitution does not decide questions arising in the Senate, but in making standing orders controlling our proceedings we must be careful not to insert any provision that would be distinctly <inline font-style="italic">&#39;ultra vires.</inline> Assuming the standing orders not to be <inline font-style="italic">ultra vires -</inline> and I think there can be no doubt about that - then comes the question : Is there any power to put in this limitation which is sought to be imposed ? The amendment, under cover of regulating proceedings iii the Senate, says that the quorum to determine acertain question shall not be twelve, butshall be at least fourteen. The amendment thus requires to cany amotionmore than thequorum settled by the Constitution for deciding the most solemn questions over which the Senate can exercise jurisdiction. Leaving out the question of the &#34;gag,&#34; about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart</inline> holds strong views, and assuming that it is a correct principle to prevent debate being stopped, the amendment before us at present is not only be- 3&#39;ond our power to pass, but is, I submit, unreasonable, because it requires that, in order to exercise the power of necessary control over debate, the number of honorable senators present shall exceed the number, which the Statute has authoritativel}&#39; fixed as a quorum for conducting business. </para>

            <para>- I find that theamendment is on allfours with a standing order which has been in force in the State from which I come, for nine years. Strangely enough I find that it was passed thereon the 11th July, 1894, so that it has actually been in force in the New South Wales Legislative Assembly - which is the largest deliberative body in Australia - for nine years. It has been found to work admirably there. Seeing that we have had an account given of the experience of another State where the Parliament is smaller than the New South Wales Parliament, and in view of the fact that in a Parliament, which at the time the standing Order was passed numbered 141 members and now numbers 125, it has been found to work admirably, and it has never been proposed to alter it- -I, for one, think I shall be justified in supporting this proposal. </para>

              <para>- There is no proposal to alter the Constitution in an amendment upon a standing order to the effect that a certain number of votes shall be required before the rule shall be effective. The question of the quorum has no more to do with it than the price of wax matches in Kamtschatka. It is a mere legal sophistry to say that the quorum fixed by the Constitution is interfered with by determining that a certain majority shall be required to carry a certain motion. I submit that the very eagerness displayed by a section of the Senate to obtain this power is the best possible evidence of the risk to which minorities will be subjected if this amendment is not adopted. I have listened attentively to the debate, and have heard senator after senator with a tine flavour of toryism - I am a bit of a tory myself, but not of this kind - making a dead set to do what? To destroy the right of free speeoh on the part of minorities. It is not the majority for whom standing orders of this kind are required. It is the minority who should be principally considered, because the majority have the power of voting, whilst the minority have nothing but the power of speech by means of which to advocate their opinions, and to seek to attain that for which the people sent them here to struggle. Eor these reasons I think that there should be a fixed number required to carry the motion of closure. I am not wedded to thirteen. Thirteen is a very unlucky number in the view of some people. I do not want to establish a &#34; Thirteen club &#34; or anything of that sort here. I do not mind if the number is fixed at eleven or twelve, and, if the present amendment is not passed, I shall be willing to make one to fix- the number at such a figure. If it were fixed at eleven or twelve, the point submitted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> would be destroyed. But I am absolutely against placing the power of closure within the control of a bare majority, no matter how many are present. Are we going to say that when business is being conducted with a statutory quorum of twelve senators, seven are to have the power to shut up the other five, and not allow them to be heard, nor allow the views of those who sent them here to be represented by one word in the records of the Chamber ? Such a proposal is abhorrent to any one&#39;s sense of constitutional rule and parliamentary methods. </para>

              <para>- Do honorable senators seriously suppose that it would be better to have the Senate counted out than to allow a senator to express the views he is sent here to represent. The matter is a great deal more serious than some honorable senators appear to think. It means that for fear one senator maymake his observations at undue length all other senators may be prevented from expressing their opinions. Such procedure strikes at the very base of all argument. There are people in the world who are afraid to hear discussion. If such people take advantage of this rule and move the closure, and it is carried, others will have to submit without one word of discussion. That is a very much more serious thing than that there should be a little prolixity on the part of onehonorable senator. To suggest that honorable senators who are sent here from the four winds of the Commonwealth are to have their mouths closed because there happens to be one more opposed to them than there, is on their own side, is a proposition that cannot possibly, upon reconsideration, meet with the support of a majority in this Chamber. I again repeat, that if this proposal for an. affirmative vote of thirteen be not assented tos I shall be prepared to vote for any less number. In New South Wales, the affirmative vote required is 40 out of a House of 125 members. Whether the number fixed here be 10, 11, 12, or 13, I care not, but there should be some specified affirmative, vote required before the right of free speech, which is supposed to be guaranteed by the Constitution, is taken away from honorable senators. </para>

            <para>- &#34; The right of free speech &#34; is a splendid sounding phrase, especially in the ears of the labour party. But what would be said if the minority were to permanently override and gag the majority <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> In plain English, what is desired now is that Parliament shall be controlled by the minority. We have had to listen to many grandiloquent phrases about &#34; gagging,&#34; and all the rest of it, and while I admit that there are some very decent men amongst the labour party, I think they need to be educated, and that they did not get enough of the mother&#39;s birch in their young days. Are we to conduct our business by minority or majority ? Honorable senators appeal to their constituents, forsooth, for sanction to defy the majority, but they have no such sanction, ind will never get it. The constituents are viser in their generation than to allow a small ninority to override the majority in Parlianent. The may at times not like what maoritiesdo, butthey come round inalittletime to the view that it is safer to trust the najority than to trust the minority. I  rhink  that our safest course will be to ppose the amendment, however simple it nay appear. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Downer</inline> nd others who say that the amendment is a contravention of section 23 of the Contention, which provides that the majority the Senate shall rule. </para>

I say that one of the privileges of members of the Senate is the privilege of debating questions, and a privilege we acquire, I take it, from the House of Commons is that of speaking to a question, and it cannot be affected except upon the lines laid down by the practice of the House of Commons until we have fixed our own standing or-ders. I am very doubtful whether the word &#34; questions &#34; as appearing in section 23 would refer to a motion &#34; That the Senate do now divide,&#34; because it seems to me that such a motion is merely part of the procedure of the Senate, or of a rule laid down to enable questions to be dealt with.

              <para>- There is also a provision for the suspension of the standing orders, and it was determined again and again in this Chamber during last session, that to carry such a motion an absolute majority of the Senate was required. Section 23 of the Constitution deals with questions of laws - questions concerning Bills - and there must be a majority to carry those questions. It would, perhaps, be unconstitutional for us to say that they should be carried by a two-thirds majority, or by a majority of four. But when we come to deal with standing orders for the conduct of business in the Senate, I contend that we have unlimited power under section 50 to make such standing orders as we please for the purpose. If it were not so, will honorable senators contend that the framers of the Constitution were ignorant of what they were doing when they passed section 23 ? </para>

          <para class="block">If they were not, why did they not in section 49 insert the words &#34; subject to the limitation laid down in section 23 &#34; ? The reason is that they recognised fully that they had laid down no such limitation. I recognise that certain members of the Senate have made up their minds upon this amendment, not upon its merits, but simply because they intend to use the power given by the standing order &#34; willy-nilly,&#34; and no argument will move them. I see nothing at all in the constitutional objection which has been raised to the amendment, and I ask honorable senators to support it. </para>

Having regard to the terms of our Constitution, and the specific power which is therein set forth that we are to make our own standing orders as to the regulation and conduct of our business, I think that the amendment is essentially one relating to the conduct of our business, and is therefore in order.

I would urge them not to say. that this standing order should be passed without the addition of a provision such as I have proposed. I am sure that in such a crisis as that described the other day by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> when honorable senators generally were thoroughly tired of the whole debate, the  Chairman  would be satisfied that the question had been sufficiently discussed. Unfortunately, the debate regarding this standing order has ranged almost completely round the case of honorable senators who might desire to obstruct business, and take up the time of the Senate by &#34;interminably talking,&#34; as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Zeal</inline> said just now. Those are the honorable senators whom the Senate is trying to get at.

Surely, if he is prepared to concede to the  President  or the  Chairman  the right to say - &#34;I consider that this motion infringes the right of the minority, therefore I shall not put the question,&#34; he ought to be prepared to concede that right to thirteen senators ?

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales). - I do not think that the proviso ought to be made, because it will prejudice the position df the minority who wish to continue the debate. In the first instance the  Chairman  would have to decide whether, in his opinion, the motion should be put. Any senator who had not been paying very much attention to the debate might be influenced by the opinion of the  Chairman,  who had heard all the discussion, and for that reason lie would probably vote for the motion. It would be a mistake to put the  Chairman  in that position. The motion does not involve debate. It has to be put at once, and the rights of the minority are protected by the provision that thirteen senators must vote in the affirmative. Almost the full strength of the Chamber is behind the senator whom any one is trying to stop. I feel sure that it will not be possible to get thirteen senators to vote unfairly to close any one&#39;s mouth. But certainly the &#34;Yes&#34; or  &#34;No&#34; of the Chairman will put the question before the Committee with added force. I do not wish to see such a power placed in the hands of one man. </para>

            <para>- I suggest that this question ought to be looked at from the Chairman&#39;s point of view as well as the member&#39;s point of view. Is it not very unfair to ask the  Chairman  to unnecessarily place himself in possible antagonism to three or four  senators who think that they ought to be allowed to continue the debate? It will bring the  Chairman  into unnecessary friction with senators, and that is not fair to him.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline> (Queensland). - I was very much surprised to hear such a speech from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker.</inline> When a senator accepts the position of  President  or  Chairman  of Committees he knows quite well &#39;that at some time or other he will by reason of his decisions have against him certain senators. For instance, last session, because the  President  voted in Committee in a certain way, certain senators got an animus against him, and it still lives in their breasts and is likely to do so for years. Every presiding officer has to undertake that risk. Evidently in the interests of the minority, members of the House of Commons demand that their  Speaker  shall take the risk of incurring the animosity of individual members. It is only human nature for a senator to think that the  Chairman  is wrong when he rules against his own view. Since, apparently, honorable senators are determined that a majority of thirteen shall silence those who have not spoken, it is only fair that we should adopt the House of Commons practice, and let the  Chairman,  who sits there as an umpire, decide whether the question shall be put. If, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> suggested, two or three senators .are likely to be actuated by animus against the  Chairman,  it- is quite possible that in a time of heated discussion thirteen or fifteen senators may be actuated by that feeling and try to stop a senator. The  President  or the  Chairman  is always more cool and collected than any other senator, and he can see whether there is an attempt on the part of a simple majority to infringe the rights of the minority. Surely it is not asking too much of the presiding officer to undertake that duty ? If at any time three or four senators are filled with animus against the  Chairman,  the majority will always see that he gets fair play, as they have done in the past. I do not like the standing order at all, but, since the majority demand that it shall be passed, they might give the minority the benefit of the House of Commons procedure in its entirety. </para>

To say that that decision will be received with equanimity at all times is to deny that knowledge of human nature which we all possess to some extent. Nothing is more necessary than that the presiding officer should be kept in a strictly impartial position, and should not be charged with the invidious duty of expressing opinions on subjects which we have to decide. </para>

            <para>- This standing order should be amended in order to allow select committees tobe chosen by ballot in all cases. The method of selection by ballot is very properly provided for in Standing Order 347. I can anticipate no practical difficulty. It is wrong to cast upon any three senators, it  might be  the odium of demanding a ballot as against the mover of a motion for the appointment of a select committee. As it stands, the standing order requires that three senators shall im- .molate themselves by casting themselves into the breech, and doing something which may be unpleasant. I move - </para>

            <para>- This standing order follows the practice which we have adopted ever since the Senate has been in existence. Every committee we have appointed has been chosen on the motion of the mover. That has been the case with the House Committee, the Library Committee, the Standing Orders Committee, and all other select committees. If there is no objection it seems to me that the course proposed in the standing order will facilitate business. </para>

            <para>- It may expedite business, but when a senator wishes to get a particular person appointed to a committee he has to do a very unpleasant thing. He has to move that the matter be decided by ballot, and thus has to place himself in antagonism to the mover of the motion for the committee. There is no possible objection to the course proposed in this standing order applying to formal committees like the Library Committee and the House Committee&#39;. In the South Australian Parliament the personnel of select committees is decided by ballot. That is the fairest way, and it avoids any unpleasantness. When an honorable senator moves the appointment of certain senators to form a select committee, other honorable senators do not like to oppose him, although they may feel that he has made a mistake in the composition of the committee which he proposes. It is a great deal better to have a ballot by which the Senate will be able to act freely in selecting the men to be appointed to a committee. When a member of the Senate, in moving, for instance, that a Bill be referred to a select committee, chooses the members of that committee, he will probably choose those who hold opinions similar to his own. I think it is far better to adopt the South Australian practice, under which all these committees are balloted for. I shall support the amendment. </para>

            <para>- The argument appears to be that because some one may be destitute of sufficient moral courage to do that which he believes to be right, the Senate is to be burdened with the process of going through a ballot on a motion for the appointment of a select committee, when- in not one case in a dozen will there be any  conflict of  opinion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> seems to think that the amendment proposes that the names of the members nominated to a select committee shall be submitted; and that we shall then go to a ballot, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has not proposed that any names shall be submitted. If no names are submitted, how can a reasonable result be arrived at ? Someone moves for a select committee, and then, without any names being submitted or the Senate having any knowledge of the honorable senators who may be willing to serve on the committee, we go to a ballot. What kind of nonsense is that ? Last session the only select committee appointed on a private motion was one to take evidence with reference to steam-boat communication with Tasmania, and there was absolute difficulty in obtaining seven members of the Senate to serve on that committee. If we have a ballot without names being submitted, it may result in the selection of members of the Senate who will not serve. We shall have carried the motion for the committee, and will have failed to appoint them. This is an entirely new proposal. Apparently it is not new in South Australia, but what is proposed in the standing order is the practice of the Houseof Commons, theHouse of Lords, and I take it of the vast majority of Legislatures - that a senator proposing the appointment of a select committee shall name the senators whom he proposes shall serve on that committee, and then, if it is desired, a ballot is taken. Under the standing order it is proposed that three honorable senators may demand a ballot, and I should be willing to permit any one member of the Senate to demand a ballot, but certainly the names of those who are willing to serve should be submitted in order that honorable senators in balloting may know what they are doing. I take it that there is sufficient moral courage amongst members of the Senate to demand a ballot without such a demand being regarded as a reflection on the mover of the original motion for a committee. On the argument which has been used we should lack the moral courage to move an amendment to any question. If I were in order I should be prepared to move an amendment to provide that one voice should be sufficient to demand a ballot. I am willing to meet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> to that extent, but I say that to have a ballot without having the names of honorable senators first submitted seems to me perfectly childish. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator PLAYFORD</inline>(South Australia). - It is not a question of moral courage at all, and there is no difficulty about the naming of the members of the committee under the practice which I suggest. It is found to  be a very simple process indeed, because the mover of the select committee always issues his list, and those opposed to him issue their list. The question then goes to the ballot, and the majority decide. The mover of a committee would go round to ascertain whether certain members of the Senate would be willing to serve upon his committee, and  those opposed to his views would probably do the same,, and there would then be the two lists upon which the majority would decide. That is certainly the best way in which to appoint all these committees. </para>

            <para>- I do not think there is the slightest difference between the two propositions. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has pointed out, in our practice the names are not in the first instance mentioned, and there is simply a motion for a committee. If there is a motion for a ballot, and it is carried, the House proceeds to take a ballot. All the invidiousness arises when the mover of the motion for a committee submits his list of names. According to the argument which has been used, it would then be difficult for any one else to submit any names other than those already submitted. It is said that there would be a feeling of delicacy in doing anything of that kind. But under the South Australian practice, whenever either the Government or the Opposition have proposed a committee, there has never been the slightest delicacy or hesitation in opposing the list of names submitted. What difference does it make whether the mover of a motion for a select committee mentions in his motion the names of honorable senators whom he desires to serve on the committee, or, a motion having been carried for the appointment of a select committee, a list of names is submitted ? </para>

              <para>- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> that a demand for a ballot by one honorable senator should be sufficient. It may be that a ballot is not desired, and that when the names are mentioned there is no objection to them ; but if the standing order is altered in the way suggested there must be a ballot, and time will be wasted in voting upon a matter upon which everybody is agreed. I was referring merely to the question of invidiousness, and to submit a list of names in antagonism to one already submitted is  certainly more invidious than to demand a  ballot. From the point of view of convenience, I prefer the standing order as proposed, and if there is any invidiousness in the matter it exists in each case. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that the amendment proposed will improve the standing order as submitted. I see no reason for departing from what is almost the invariable practice of the House of Commons, and the practice also of most of the States Legislatures, simply because in one State there happens to be the rule now proposed. We have it on the authority of two honorable senators that that rule is a perfect farce, the list handed round being in almost every case accepted. The ballot is taken and time is wasted in arriving at a conclusion in that way which could be arrived at upon a simple motion. If the time comes when the mover of a motion for a committee in connexion with a contentious matter has not selected his committee fairly, any three members of the Senate could protest and demand a ballot. I doubt whether one honorable senator should be allowed to demand a ballot. Let us adhere to the usual practice, unless it is shown to be wrong, and do not let us depart from the usual practice, when it is shown that the departure proposed works out in exactly the same way Us the rule ordinarily followed. </para>

              <para>- I do. I say that this thing has become a farce under the present practice, because owing to the fact that three honorable senators must demand a ballot under our rules no ballot is asked for, and the nomination of the mover of the committee is accepted in nine cases out of ten. I think that there should be a ballot, and I think the means of securing a ballot should be made as simple as possible. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford</inline> has pointed out how this can be done. We have heard some ludicrous remarks about the difficulty of obtaining a I ballot unless somebody nominates certain senators, but there is no difficulty in the world in obtaining a ballot because a list is sent round, and Standing Order 347 prescribes the method of taking a ballot. </para>

              <para>- On the contrary, it would not save time ; but I do not object to the proposal from that stand-point, for it is not a very valid objection. I contend that inasmuch as honorable senators arechosen to serve the people they should be prepared to let the people see exactly how they vote in every capacity. If the appointment of a select committee were desired, and certain honorable senators were nominated to act upon it, it would be quite possible for an honorable senator having a distinct bias against anyone of them - but wanting the requisite courage to openly sa)* so - to shield himself by means of the ballot and to vote against that honorable senator whilst at the same time appearing to him to be a very nice fellow.- That kind of conduct should not be tolerated by us. J. always opposed the adoption of the ballot system in the State Legislature of Queensland, and I shall vote against its adoption here. </para>

To do so would be to give the honorable senator objected to a direct slap in the face. Such a course should be unnecessary. </para>

            <para>- Exactly. Why should we do so when there is no necessity for anything of the kind. When there is a necessity to speak out we should not hesitate to show our courage. Courage is sometimes a very high attribute, but there are many occasions in which its display is out of place. I see no greatobjection to theoriginal proposal, except that under it three honorable senators would have to rise in their places to demand a ballot. The selection of a committee is sometimes a very serious matter. A committee may be appointed to deal with questions to which the Senate attaches great importance, and it may involve a great deal of expenditure. Therefore, the best way of making a selection would be by the corporate vote of the Senate as proposed by the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I have not heard of any great objection to the practice which has been followed in the case of sessional committees, which are appointed at the beginning of each session. We have endeavoured to secure the separate representation of each of the States upon those committees, and to see that honorable senators are so distributed over them that as far as possible each shall have something to do. That is a matter requiring careful arrangement and much consideration, and I do not think that result would be obtained by the adoption of the ballot system. If that system were followed, we should probably have the same names recurring in the list of members of all the committees, while a number of honorable senators would not be asked to perform any duty in connexion with them. Some select committees are of very great importance. An honorable senator who is deeply interested in some particular subject and moves for the appointment of a committee to consider it, has generally taken care to ascertain who will be willing to serve on that committee&#39;. </para>

              <para>- Perhaps so. No doubt he seeks to have the different States represented on the committee, and to a very great extent he may also desire to insure the presentation of a report in a particular direction. Surely if it were a contentious matter of that kind, and if the object of the honorable senator were to obtain a committee which would bring up a report of a particular character, three honorable senators could be found ready to move that the committee be appointed by ballot. I think, therefore, that the standing order provides fairly for these two cases. So far as the sessional committees are concerned, I have not heard a single complaint with regard to their composition. I have not heard the slightest whisper of any dissatisfaction. In nominating them I endeavoured to meet the general desire of the Senate. </para>

It was not intended that the mode of appointment should be set out there ; the matter was left to the particular chapter with which we are now dealing. On behalf of the Standing Orders Committee, I may say that it was intended that the most convenient practice - the practice which would take up as little time as possible - should be adopted. I do not think it would make any material difference whether we required three or only one honorable senator to demand a ballot. If there is any desire for a ballot it should be granted, but if there is not, why should not the mover be allowed to propose that the committee be appointed. </para>

            <para>- I hope that the Committee will not adopt the proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> It has been pointed out very clearly that the object of allowing the mover to nominate the committee is to save time when there is no objection to the personnel. In other cases it may be better that the committee should be selected by ballot. The Senate has first to determine whether it will appoint a committee and incur all the incidental expense. The mover generally takes good care to nominate those men who he thinks are generally in accord with his views, but who nevertheless are prepared to see that a fair inquiry shall be made into the subject-matter. All the proceedings are reported, and if any undue bias is shown there is the corrective which comes afterwards when the Senate has to deal with the report. If a ballot be taken, it will be quite impossible to insure that a committee shall be composed of a representative from each State, and the probability is that more senators will be chosen from one State than from another. I am not, however, carried away with that argument, because I wish the fact to become recognised that it is the duty of a senator, no matter what State he represents, to do what is fair to all the States. Take an ordinary case where a senator  moves for a select committee, and nominates three or five men from one State, and two -from another State. If I recognised that the subject-matter of the inquiry was one of general importance, and that the nominees were generally fair men, and the Senate seemed to think it was desirable to hold an inquiry, I should not object, because I believe that the committee would act straightforwardly. We represent the Commonwealth as a whole, and the sooner senators recognise the fact that they represent all the States, the better it will be. I think that the balance of advantage is in favour of leaving the standing order as it is. I am under the impression that the standing committees of the House of Commons are appointed under similar circumstances. In New South Wales it has been the invariable practice for the mover to nominate those whom he desired to serve on any select committee, but it was open to any member to demand a ballot, and, if he did, his action was not regarded in an unfriendly light. </para>

              <para>- I thought that we had followed the House of Commons practice, and distinguished between select committees and standing committees. Clearly there is n difference between standing committees and select committees in the House of Commons practice. If it is desired that that alteration should be made, it will be necessary to insert a new standing order in chapter 5 when it is reached. The only thing we can do is to remodel No. 282 with that object, and a portion of No. 283 will certainly have to be transferred to chapter 5. </para>

If no senator makes a nominar tion, what is to take place? The word &#34; shall &#34; should be substituted for the word &#34;may.&#34; It will be well to distinguish between sessional committees and select committees. I am quite willing to allow ordinary committees to be nominated by the movers, and, if necessary, to leave out the concluding words of the standing order. </para>

We came to the conclusion that what we propose is the shortest possible way of getting through the business. The suggestion of invidiousness never occurred to us, and after having heard the discussion : that has taken place it does not appeal to me now. There will be no secrecy in voting by ballot in the Senate. It will practically be open voting. At present the practice is that the names of the senators who are to be members of a select committee are handed round. The list of various parties are submitted for the consideration of honorable senators, and there is no more secresy about it than if the names were nominated openly. The first thing that a mover for theappointment of a standing committee does is to pass round the names of the members he suggests. What does it matter whether the names are chosen in that way, or whether they are balloted for <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> If the names suggested by the mover commend themselves to the Senate, why waste time in having a ballot % If they do not suggest themselves to the Senate, another list can be passed round. </para>

It might happen that in the opinion of the Senate the particular honorable senator moving for the appointment of a select committee might not be a proper person to be a member of it. The matter is of small importance, because in 99 cases out of 100 an honorable senator moving for a committee would be appointed a member of it. I desire merely to point out that the standing order has not been submitted in the form in which it is before the Committee, inadvertently. The Standing Orders Committee considered the point, and came to the conclusion to which I have referred.

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania). - I intend to oppose the amendment for the very good reasons which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has told us guided the Standing Orders Committee. It by no means follows that an honorable senator who asks for the appointment of a select committee should be a member of it, or will be a desirable person to appoint as a member of it. I see no reason why, because an honorable senator chooses to move for the appointment of a select committee, he should be exempted from the ordinary rule of ballot. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> has suggested that an honorable senator moving for the appointment of a select committee should be prepared to do his work by acting upon the committee. In nine cases out of ten a committee is . moved for by an honorable senator because he desires to secure a certain position. I do not agree that because the Senate consents to the appointment of a select committee, it is to be assumed that the honorable senator who moved for it is better fitted than any other honorable senator to take part in its proceedings. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lt.-Col.</inline>GOULD (New South Wales). - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Neild</inline> in proposing his amendment is following the invariable practice adopted in appointing select committees. When an honorable senator moves for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into a certain matter, he will have seized himself of the particulars connected with it, and will be in a position to take the lead in the inquiry proposed. He does not invite a number of his fellow senators to form a committee to inquire into a matter to which he has given no special consideration. I think it is necessary that the mover of a motion for the appointment of a select committee should be a member of that committee, and he should recognise that if he asks for a select committee, it is a duty cast upon him that he shall be in a position to advise the committee on the subject of their inquiry, and to point out the sources from&#39; which evidence is available. </para>

              <para>- It is not a question of his funking the ballot, but the honorable senator moving for a committee will probably be better qualified than most other honorable senators to deal with the subject of inquiry. If an honorable senator is strongly imbued with the necessity for the appointment of a select committee to inquire into any matter, and moves its appointment, it will be a very extraordinary thing for the Senate to decide that the matter shall be inquired into, but that the honorable senator who moved for the committee shall take no part in it. </para>

              <para>.- Whose claim is it but that of the honorable senator who first puts the business on the paper ? I think it would be very much better to follow the practice which has existed for so long. It is all very well to say that we should make new precedents, but most of the new precedents suggested are proposed by honorable senators who have had no previous parliamentary experience. It &#34;may be that they are better qualified to suggest the way in which business should be conducted than those who have had parliamentary experience ; but when we can point, as in this matter, to the practice of the Imperial Parliament, we have a very good authority for following a practice which has already been adopted in all the States, and which I hope will be adopted b)r the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I intend to oppose the motion for the reason actuating <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> in supporting it. At present the honorable and learned senator is anxious that we should follow the Imperial practice, but a little time ago he did not care so much about it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> must be very innocent in matters political, or they must be a very fine people in New South Wales, if it has never happened there, even to the honorable and learned senator himself, that after he has taken a very great deal of interest in discussing a question and is just on the point of moving for a select committee to inquire into it, some other member jumps up and does it before him. In such a case <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould</inline> might be just the man to appoint to the committee, and might be qualified to act as  chairman  of it, and yet, under the amendment which the honorable and learned senator is prepared to support, there may be no room for him on the committee because some one else, merely for the sake of being on a select committee, and for the sake of taking the wind out of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gould&#39;s</inline> sails, moves for its appointment, and under the amendment must be a member of it. If the appointment of a select committee is left to the good sense of the Senate, and anything of the kind I have suggested occurs, the other members of the Senate will, I think, have grace enough left to see through a dodge of that description, will appoint senators who are entitled to be members of the committee, and may even leave off the man who has jumped another fellow&#39;s claim. I hope that the amendment will be negatived, and that the selection of these committees will be left entirely to the Senate. </para>

              <para>.- I think this standing order is designed to render it impossible for a member of a select committee to go behind the backs of his fellow committeemen and make a disclosure to an outside person. For example, a special inquiry might be proceeding in regard to which it was undesirable to give any information until its close ; but some one might make a disclosure, and the facts would then become public property. If the Senate ordered a report to be given, it could be obtained at any time. </para>

              <para>- I am not prepared to say that the practice is followed in the Queensland Parliament, but I know that it is in the House of Commons and in the South Australian Legislature. It may not necessarily be right because that is so, but the theory of all parliamentary proceedings is that the majority rules. Undoubtedly protests and minority reports are brought up sometimes by Royal Commissions. They are also presented in the case of select committees, but they appear in the proceedings. The theory upon which this is done is that the  chairman  of a select committee prepares a report and submits it to the members clause by clause. When that is done any member of the committee may move to strike out any clause, and to insert some fresh provision. </para>

          <para>Thus every member is in a position to make his protest known. The votes and proceedings of a committee, which are brought in with the report, set forth how many members support it, so that the same object is effected, although in a manner different from that suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> If it is the desire of the Committee that power shall be given to a select committee to bring up a minority report,  just as a minority report may be brought up by a Royal Commission, it will be necessary to alter the whole of this standing order. The procedure would have to be different, otherwise minority reports would be presented twice. We should have them in the Votes and Proceedings, and also as an addendum to the committee&#39;s report. It is not a matter of substance where the report of the minority appears, because not only the minority report but the opinion of every individual member of a select committee who differs from the  chairman  appears in the Votes and Proceedings. It is only a question of procedure. </para>

            <para>- There is no provision in the South Australian Standing Order as to the addition of any memorandum of dissent to a report. It leaves the matter an open one. There is a great deal of force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker&#39;s</inline> statement that when a report drawn up by the  chairman  is discussed clause by clause, and when the committee has the fullest power to move amendments, the members are able to give full publicity to their views, and therefore .that there is not the necessity that exists possibly in the case of Royal Commissions to provide for minority reports. . Very likely the reports of Royal Commissions would not be agreed to in the way prescribed in this standing order. There is no standing order regulating the way in which they shall work. They work as they please. I have been a member of various Royal Commissions, and I have had occasion, sometimes, to dissent from what has been done. In some of these cases, perhaps, one or two other members of the commission have shared my views : while others have dissented from the report of the majority on different grounds. It often happens that, by being able to state the grounds on which he dissents from a report, a member is able to bring before the people views which he holds upon particular questions which would otherwise not be put before them owing to the fact that no regular procedure is followed by the commissioners. Under this standing order, however, a regular procedure is provided. Amendments can be moved in the draft report, new clauses can be proposed and added, and the Senate, as well as the public, are able to see what are the views held by those forming the committee. I think we might adopt the South Australian Standing Order, and refrain from providing that honorable senators shall not be allowed to append protests. An instance might occur in which they might wish to append a protest. Owing to reasons over which they had no control, they might have been absent when the report was being prepared ; and, therefore, they might desire to embody their views in the form of a protest of some kind. Perhaps it would be as well to strike out the latter part of the standing order. </para>

            <para>- It appears to me that the amendment is somewhat unnecessary, and I am inclined to think that it would be mischievous. There is the fullest opportunity for every member of a select committee to express his views as to the adoption of the report or otherwise. It is generally brought up by the  chairman,  but it may be drafted by another member of the committee, and to every clause amendments can be moved, and frequently are moved. If any members do not think a matter of sufficient importance to move an amendment of course their views do not get so amply recorded in the proceedings as they otherwise might do. But any man who has or thinks he has good reasons to differ from the report can move an amendment to every line, and in that way he has the fullest opportunity to record his protest. Therefore, it appears to me that it is unnecessary to alter the rule which is in accordance with the practice. I am inclined to think that the amendment will work out in a mischievous manner. Suppose that a select committee is inquiring into some subject of intense feeling or of party politics. To gain time in expressing your opinion may be of great advantage. A member who did not exactly consent to the report adopted might give some hints as to making a protest. He might go outside the premises and hear of some telegram or public feeling in some part of his State, and then intimate to the  chairman  that he did intend after all to enter a protest. He might then set to work to compile a protest based upon evidence and opinions of electors which he had heard practically after the report had been adopted. In that way, in one case out of a hundred or a thousand the amendment might absolutely work a mischief. Even if it is adopted, I think it ought to be provided that any such report or protest ought to be handed in immediately after the report has been adopted. I hope that the standing order will be passed as it is. </para>

            <para>- I cannot understand the position which is taken up by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> and others with respect to the reports of select committees. 1 have been on Royal Commissions and select committees.When the report of a Royal Commission is drawn up, eveiy commissioner has the right to move amendments, and the Senate, if necessary, has just the same opportunity of seeing the evidence of a Royal Commission as it has of seeing the evidence of a select committee. Because it has been the practice in some Parliaments to allow no dissent from the report of a select committee, is that any reason why it should be adopted here? If any members of a select committee differ from the majority, they have the right to embody the difference in a protest or dissent. Supposing that a member of a select committee endeavours to amend the report and his amendments are defeated, does <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson</inline> imagine that in the Senate any senatorswill look through the record of proceedings to ascertain what positions different senators took up ? They generally look to the report of the select committee, and leave the record of proceedings alone. It would be much to the advantage of the senators who disagreed from the report, and of other senators who might like to discuss the report to see in a concise form the reason for such difference. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir RICHARD</inline>BAKER (South Australia). - I am afraid that this matter is not properly understood. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGregor,</inline> says that a member of a select committee who dissents from the report cannot make a protest. He can make a protest. Certainly it is not called by that name but it is just as effective. I have been on a great many select committees, and when I have disagreed with the  chairman  or the majority, I have always put my protest on record. On one occasion the  chairman  brought up a draft, and I moved that clause 1 be struck out and that another clause be inserted in lieu thereof, as the report of the committee. What was that but a protest ? My protest appeared, not in the report, but in the proceedings. </para>

              <para>- In a Royal Commission the practice is different, though I admit that the result is just the same. After all, we are really fighting a question of practice, not a question of principle. Either on a Royal Commission or on a select committee any one who disagrees can put his dissent on record, and it is brought up and is considered by the appointing body. Supposing that a select committee is appointed, and a senator is in opposition but is in a minority, all he has to do when the draft report is considered is to say - &#34; I object to this clause, and I move another clause in lieu thereof,&#34; or, &#34; I object to the whole of the report, and I move another report in lieu thereof.&#34; The whole of the protest or objection in both cases is put on record. I can see no difference in substance between them. If honorable senators wish to call the dissent of a member of a select committee a protest, I have not the slightest objection to their doing so. I do not see that there is very much objection to their putting it in as a protest, but I say that they ought to amend the whole of Standing Order 303 and adopt a new procedure. I have the standing orders of the Legislative Council of Victoria, the House of Assembly of South Australia., and the Legislative Assembly of New South Wales, and they are fill identical. </para>

              <para>- Then the practice of the House of Commons prevails according to their standing orders, and no protest can be added. I may be mistaken ; but I do not think that <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> protest has ever been added to the report of a select committee; it appears in the record of the proceedings. What difference in substance is there between the two things <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> None that I can see. It is only a question whether a dissenting senator shall enter his protest in the ordinary manner in which it has been done, in my opinion, not only in the House of Commons, but in every Legislative Assembly in Australia. The practice has been that no such protest shall be added to the report. </para>

              <para>- The same thing happened as if there had been a protest. The dissent with the reasons came before the House in the report of the select committee. If honorable senators will refer to the report of the Standing Orders Committee, they will see that every proceeding, including the divisions, is recorded, and that is done in the case of- every select committee. However, I am not going to labour the question, as I do not think it is of much importance whether the dissent is called a protest or an objection. I can see no reason for departing from the ordinary practice of legislative bodies, which comes to &#39; exactly the same thing in effect as the practice of Royal Commissions. </para>

          <para class="block">That undoubtedly is the rider. During the last session I was in the Queensland Legislative Council quite a number of select committees were appointed, and riders were, I think, appended to the reports in a great many cases. It is clear that the standing order of the Legislative Assembly provides for a protest being appended to the report, and, unless my memory is quite wrong, the practice of the Legislative Council agrees with that standing order. </para>

            <para>- The value of a minority report is shown in the case of the Royal Commission that inquired into the sugar works and black labour question in Queensland. The majority of the members of that com mission were in favour of black labour. If there is any advantage in the case of a Royal Commission, the same must apply to a select committee, because select committees are often appointed to avoid the expense attached to Royal Commissions. There was a minority report in connexion with the commission to which I have alluded, and also in connexion with the Mining Commission. The great value of a minority report lies in the fact that very often when people look at the report of a commission and see a minority report they may be- led by the observations contained in it to regard matters in a somewhat different light than would be the case if they only read the report of the majority. If we refuse to allow a minority to make a report, we convey the impression that the report of the committee was unanimously agreed to. To ascertain whether there was a minority of a different opinion, the reader would have to look through the volumes of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> or the <inline font-style="italic">Reports and Proceedings.</inline> As the publishing of a minority report would only cost a few pounds extra - or it may be a few shillings - there is no reason why it should not be permitted. </para>

            <para>- This standing order will have to be altered. Since it was drafted an arrangement has been made between the two Houses by which messages may be passed from one to the other, although both may not be sitting. That practice has been found to be most convenient. Therefore it will be better to strike out the words &#34; during the sitting of the Senate.&#34; The effect will be that messages will be received by the House of Representatives while the Senate is not sitting, and <inline font-style="italic">vice versa</inline> ; a practice which has been conducive to the prompt discharge of public business.- I move - </para>

            <para>- I shall state the reason. There must be some stage of finality in reference to all matters. Whether that is reached after one, two, three, or half-a-dozen conferences does not appear to me to be a matter of very much importance, because both Houses will be looking forward to the final stage for the settlement of a difference. Conferences have been found in England to be so unsatisfactory that they have been altogether abandoned, and they have not had a conference between the two Houses there for a great number of years - I think for . 100 years. We must have some stage of the proceedings at which we shall finally agree or disagree. I am loth to mention the South Australian practice, because it has been so often referred to, but I may be permitted to say that in South Australia we found that a number ofconferencesservednogood purposes, because the representatives of both Houses always put off coming to a final conclusion until the last conference The object appeared to be for one side to hang on as long as possible in the hope that the other side might give way, and that resulted merely in a waste of time. That is the reason why the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate arrived at this conclusion, and I believe that the Standing Orders Committee of the House of Representatives arrived at a similar conclusion. </para>

Probably the points in dispute in connexion with Money Rills will be settled by messages between the two Houses. I am doubtful if we shall ever get to the conference stage in dealing with such matters, and, even if we do, there will be no good purpose served in providing for too many conferences. </para>

            <para>- This standing order is in accordance with our present standing  order, and with the practice we have so far followed. It is quite true that I have not asked the officials to bother me by asking my leave, and strangers are always admitted on the order of any honorable senator to that portion of the chamber outside the Bar. But supposing that in connexion with some question there is a great desire on the part of strangers to attend the Senate, how is the difficulty to be arranged? If every honorable senator may give orders for admission, which honorable senator must give way? So far as I am concerned, I have taken no trouble about the matter, and honorable senators have had the right in practice under a similar standing order to secure the admission of any of their friends. They will continue to have that right, but I think that we should provide for some proper procedure in case of a crush. </para>

            <para>- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will withdraw his amendment. &#39;The honorable and learned senator must know that some one must have control of that portion of the Senate which is outside the Bar, and on certain special occasions, which may not arise once in five years, if the amendment proposed is accepted each honorable senator may desire the admission of three of his friends, and we may have 30 or 40 people trying to get into seats which will accommodate only half that number. In a case of that kind, surely the  President  of the Senate should be given the power of control which has been vested in him in the past, and which, in most Legislative Chambers, is vested in the  Speaker  or the  President.  The fact that the  President  has not interfered so far, shows that the standing order will not be made use of unless upon some special occasion when the traffic - if I may use the expression - requires regulating, and then its regulation should be left in the hands of our presiding officer. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- It is, of course, very easy for honorable senators to raise a bogy of this kind, and by the aid of imagination to picture a state of things which will. never happen. It is easy to say that the standing order is framed to provide for something which none of us will live long enough to see. We shall never see the time when this chamber will be so crowded that it will be necessary for the  President  to interfere to keep order. If we do, I have no doubt that the  President  will be found equal to the occasion. It is argued that we should leave the standing order -as proposed because it will be nugatory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has informed me that we have been working under a similar standing order, and I was not previously aware of that, but I do not believe in passing standing orders which are never to be enforced. Without any disrespect to the present occupant of the chair, I may be permitted to say that we might have a  President  of this Chamber who would exercise the power given to him under this standing order arbitrarily against some particular senator or a section of honorable senators. I shall persist in my amendment, as I am not alarmed by the bogy. Outside of that absurd fear, I see no reason why honorable senators should not exercise the privilege which has been so far conceded to them. </para>

            <para>- I think the bogy in this matter is started by the other side. A standing order of this character is in the interests of the Senate itself. We have seating capacity here for perhaps 20 or 25 people. Members of the other House are supposed to come here sometimes, and there are 36 members of the Senate. If some very interesting subject were on for discussion, and each of the 36 senators desired to introduce two or three of his friends to listen to the debate, we could not accommodate that number of people. There must, therefore, be some authority to regulate the number to be admitted. If it is proposed that the rule shall be first come first served there will, of course, be an end of it. In the New South Wales Legislative Assembly a member goes to the  Speaker  and says, &#34; I wish to introduce a friend to the gallery.&#34; The  Speaker,  as a matter of course, gives the member a card, and looks upon him as sponsor for the suitability of the person admitted. If the gallery is full he intimates that fact, and there is an end to the matter. It would be better to leave the power in the hands of the  President.  If it -were left in the hands of honorable senators generally I might, for example, think that I could squeeze another stranger into an already overcrowded gallery, and endeavour to do so, to the great &#39; inconvenience of others present. At any time some very important matter might come before the Senate, the discussion on which very many people would desire to hear. </para>

              <para>- There is no bogy about this standing order. It does not mean that any honorable senator will be under an obligation to the  President.  If there is room the  President  will invariably admit strangers ; on the other hand, if there is no room, an honorable senator will be saved a great deal of trouble by being able to say to his friends, &#34; The  President  will not issue any more cards.&#34; I think some objection might very well be taken to the latter part of the clause; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> has indicated that he intends to move an amendment in regard to it, I shall content myself by saying that I trust the Committee will not adopt the amendment now before the Chair. </para>

            <para>- I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will not press this amendment, because we have been working under a precisely similar standing order up to the present time. I understand that the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives enjoys the privilege which it is proposed to confer upon the  President.  At the opening of Parliament, from time to time, the galleries will probably be crowded, and without this standing order some honorable senators might bring in so many friends that others would not be able to find room for any. Although, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Playford,</inline> I. hesitate to mention the South Australian precedent, I would point out that it is the practice in the South Australian Legislative Council to leave this matter in the hands of the  President,  and that the practice has never been&#39; abused. For example, it is difficult to estimate how many ladies will desire to be present when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dobson&#39;s</inline> Divorce Bill is under discussion, and it is absolutely necessary in our own interests that the  President  should have some control over the number of  persons who will then be pressing for admission. </para>

              <para>-The honorable senator is surprised to find me supporting anything hailing from the quarter from which this amendment has come. No doubt we do not get much common sense from that point of the compass; but on this occasion the honorable and learned senator seems to have struck the right chord, - and I am going to assist him. I was always under the impression that honorable senators were permitted to introduce their friends into the seats at the rear of the Bar, but this standing order says that the  President  alone shall have the privilege of &#39; introducing strangers to that portion of tlie chamber. </para>

              <para>- We might have a martinet in the position of  President,  and if the power is not used and not intended to be used, why should it be given? The&#39; first to come should be the first served. If people are extremely anxious to witness the proceedings in this Chamber, they will come early, and those who do so deserve to obtain seats. The galleries may sometimes be nearly full, and if this power is retained in the hands of the  President,  influential honorable senators, or perhaps those who are not members of the Chamber, will obtain the use of the seating accomodation behind the Bar, with the result that there will be no room for any one else. </para>

          <para class="block">The Committee will agree that thife is a more serious question. I think we should place the  President,  whoever he might be, in a somewhat invidious position if we were to ask him to say what stranger is so distinguished as to justify the Senate in affording him a seat on the floor of the Chamber. Such a question should be decided by the Senate itself. From the point of view of the distinguished stranger himself, I think the amendment is also desirable. It would be a greater mark of respect to him if the whole Senate conferred upon him the right to a seat on the floor of the Chamber. </para>

The stranger himself might not care to see the conduct of the debate disturbed in that way. It would be far better to allow the  President  to permit a distinguished stranger to take a seat on the floor of the Senate. If the  President  declined to allow such a stranger to take a seat on the floor of the Chamber, it would be optional for any honorable senator to move that that courtesy </para>

            <para>- I think we should adopt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker&#39;s</inline> suggestion, which conforms to the jjractice of the Legislature of the model State which he so ably represents. In the South Australian House of Assembly the  Speaker  simply says - &#34; By the leave of the House, I wish to. introduce <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. So-and-so</inline> to a seat on the floor of the Chamber.&#34; . Honorable members say &#34;Hear, hear&#34;; and, if there is no objection, the introduction takes place. It is simply a matter of form, and if the honorable member who is speaking at the time is interrupted at all, the interruption is only of momentary duration. </para>

When he takes part in the debates in Committee we are prepared to give him most diligent attention, but he can hardly expect us to remain absolutely silent or to do everything which is mentioned in the standing order. I suggest that it should begin with the words &#34; Whenever the  President  whilst presiding.&#34; That is obviously what is meant, and if it is meant it ought to be expressed. In the standing orders there has been a confusion in more than one instance in dealing with the  President  when he is in the chair and when he is not in the chair. </para>

            <para>- In the marginal note we are told that the standing order is new, but that it is the practice of most States. I think it will be generally admitted that this matter in any other deliberative body has been decided purely by courtesy ; no standing order has been passed to read to the members a lesson in courtesy. It has been invariably regarded as a courteous thing for a member to speak with his face to the Chair so far as he can. Originally, I intended to move that the &#39; standing order be omitted, but if that were done I should perhaps miss the opportunity of doing something which I think is very desirable. I believe that, unwittingly, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has shown discourtesy to the  Chairman  in addressing the Committee time after time from a point behind the Chair at the table. From my point of view, it would be more courteous to the  Chairman  for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> to face the Chair when he is speaking in Committee. It is extremely difficult for the  Chairman  to know when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

            <para>- The universal practice is that a member shall address himself to the Chair. He cannot address himself to the  President&#39;  or the  Chairman,  and then turn his back to theChair. If the standing order is amended as proposed, what is to prevent me, if I desire to address the gallery, from turning my back to the Chairman? Supposing that I were to turn round in my place in order to have an altercation with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Barrett,</inline> I might prevent other senators from hearing what I had to say. I think that allowance will be made for the representative of the Government and the leader of the Opposition on account of the position which they occupy at the table. Inasmuch as there are so many senators who cannot make up their minds to support either the Government or the Opposition, and sit on the cross benches, it is necessary for the leaders, who speak at the table, to turn their backs slightly to the Chair. I think that in that respect the standing order might be allowed to remain as it is. I am inclined to agree with SenatorClemons, but a senator should not address the Committee from behind the Chair. I would much prefer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> to take his seat as a democrat amongst us in the body of the Chamber. I believe that it would lead to better feeling, and that we should come to look upon him more as one of ourselves than as a person who is np in the clouds and quite beyond us. </para>

            <para>- Senators are supposed to speak from their places in the Chamber - that is, from the benches. . For instance, the place of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Saunders</inline> is where he is sitting now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing</inline> always spoke from that place last session, and always, therefore, had the Chairman&#39;s back towards him.

His  place in the Senate is in the Chair, and no place is allotted to him when he is out of the Chair. I think it is to be regretted that this matter was mentioned at all, particularly in view of the arrangement of the seats, making it, in some instances, impossible for any senator on either side to speak from his place, without having the Chairman&#39;s back more or less towards him. I agree with the insertion of the word &#34;unnecessarily,&#34; and I hope that the standing order will be earned with that word in it. </para>

I do not wish to speak offensively, but I submit to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> that, as a matter of courtesy, it would obviously be better if he himself spoke in Committee from a place upon the floor, of the Chamber.

The argument that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ewing,</inline> or any one else, sat at the far end of the front bench in a seat behind the  Chairman,  and addressed the Chair from that point, is no argument at all that could justify <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> in being discourteous, even if the other honorable senators referred to had been so. </para>

              <para>- For any honorable senator, even though he may be  President  of the Senate, to address the  Chairman  of Committees from some point entirely behind the Chair is discourteous. I do not say that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has been wittingly discourteous ; I should say so frankly if I thought so ; but it is fairly arguable that to address the Chair from such a position is discourteous to the <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman. Senator Baiter</inline> may have hurt the Chairman&#39;s feelings without knowing it. I put it to him that in the House of -Lords, which is at least equal, in dignity to this Senate, the Lord Chancellor, when he addresses the Committee, does so from the floor of the Chamber, and that it would be more courteous if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> when addressing , the Committee, would do so from the bench upon which I sit or from the opposite bench. I should not have mentioned this subject at all had not a standing order been inserted in this document, which was directed principally towards Ministers ; because it is only Ministers - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Symon,</inline> when he has spoken from the table in his position of the leader of the&#39; Opposition - who hitherto have been hauled up under the standing order. Surely when a matter of courtesy is in question, there should be no one more willing to set an example than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> himself. </para>

If there is any analogy between the Senate and the House of Lords - and I entirely deny that there is any ; we are not governed by the procedure of the House of Lords ; but if there is any analogy - it certainly does not apply in reference to the woolsack, which is outside the House of Lords itself. I hope that the Senate will accord to nae the same position as they have done in the past. I do not see any reason whatever why the standing order should be altered. At the present time, where I am now standing, I am just as much in view of the  Chairman  of Committees, and just as courteous to him, as any honorable senator who sits down there. And is it not rather peculiar . that those same honorable senators who object to a standing order which says that honorable senators shall not stand with their backs to the Chair, at the same time want to bring in a standing order to the effect that a senator - because I am only a senator when I speak in Committee - shall not address the  Chairman  when he is looking straight towards him, although the  Chairman  only sees those other honorable senators side-face ? I have no more to say. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator CLEMONS</inline>(Tasmania).- With regard to the Lord Chancellor in the House of Lords, I never said what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has attributed tome ; but I did say what he is unable to deny, that when the Lord Chancellor addresses the House of Lords in Committee, he does so from &#39;the same position on the floor as does any other member of the House. I point out again that there is no other Chamber of legislation where the practice we have adopted obtains. I have heard the  Speaker  in the House of Representatives address that Chamber in Committee, and I know what his practice is. It is not the practice which has been adopted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> here. I venture to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Speaker</inline> Holder would never for a moment think - though he has the same sort of sitting accommodation in that House as the  President  has here - of addressing the House of Representatives in Committee of the whole except from a seat on the one side or the other. It remains for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> to set an example of dignity - of his sense of dignity - that no other  President  or  Speaker  in any British Parliament has ever attempted to do. I say that he does not enhance that dignity by addressing the </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Chairman</inline>of Committees from a place behind the Chair instead of from a place upon the floor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has tried to show that it is not as discourteous to stand behind the Chair and address the Committee from that position as to stand sidewise. I submit that that sort of argument is ludicrous and absurd. There is no objection to his speaking from one side or the other upon the floor of the chamber, but it is a false sense of dignity - it is even spurious - as well as being discourteous, to speak from his present position. </para>

            <para>- ! confess that I have very considerable sympathy with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> in this matter. I think he is on the right track once again. I do not see any reason why the  President,  when addressing the Committee, should not come into the body of the chamber, just as other members of the Senate have to. do. In Queensland, when the  Speaker  of the Legislative Assembly speaks in Committee, he comes into the body of the chamber, and speaks from one of the ordinary benches. He does not take up a position behind the  Chairman  of Committees. There is another point. We have a standing order which says that when two or more honorable senators rise to speak, the  Chairman  shall call, upon the senator who first rose in his place. Suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .Baker</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> wished to address the Committee at the same time, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> rose first. The  Chairman  not having eyes in the back of his head could not possibly see <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker,</inline> and would, therefore, naturally call upon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons.</inline> I think it absolutely necessary that every member of the Senate who desires to address the Chair should be in full view of the Chair. I do not know what reason <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> has for persisting in seating himself behind the Chair, or in speaking from a place behind it. But I think that, as a mere matter of convenience, it would be very much better for him to speak from a place on the floor of the chamber just as other honorable senators do. </para>

              <para>- I disclaim at once, as emphatically as I can, any intention to wound the feelings of the  President.  In his absence, I also desire to say that I think he is a good  President.  I have had occasion to think so over and over again. I know that he has pulled me up sometimes, but I have had no reason to find fault with his decisions.  I  say  again, in one of my calm moments - when I am not &#34; stone- walling&#34; or doing anything of that kind - that he is a good  President.  I affirm that in what I am saying, I am influenced by no personal objection to the conduct of the  President,  but as time passes the position of the  President  of the Senate mli carry much greater influence than it does now, and 1 say that, when the Senate is in Committee, the  President  should come down and take his seat with us, if it be only to show that he is of the same common clay as ourselves. The honorable and learned senator appears before us in wig and gown, and I can well imagine that a few years hence some young politicians entering this Chamber may be disposed to pay more attention to the words spoken by the  President  on account of the traditions attaching to his office, than the importance of those words entitle them to. </para>

              <para>- I personally take the opportunity of saying that I am perfectly satisfied that, in speaking from the position which he usually occupies, the  President  has never at any time intended any disrespect to the Chair or to honorable senators. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> will not attribute to him any such intention. I urge the&#39; honorable and learned senator to withdraw his amendment. While I admit that it has been the practice in the Victorian Parliament, and in several other Legislative Chambers, for the  President  or the  Speaker  to take his place in the body of the Chamber when the House is in committee, yet, by reason of the fact that the Senate has acquiesced, so to speak, in the practice of allowing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> to sit where he does sit, I think that the amendment will be assumed to have been directed against him personally.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Pearce.</inline> - Possibly, if the question had been raised at any other time. </para>

            <para>- I think that the standing order had better be allowed to remain as it is. One cannot get away from the feeling that this amendment will be regarded as directed at the  President  in consequence of the practice that has grown up. He is the only honorable senator who does sit behind the Chair, he has been referred to pointedly in tlie remarks which have been made, and if such an amendment upon the standing order were agreed to, people could not helpregarding it as being directly aimed at the  President.  Is it worth while to do anything of that kind? No honorable senator goes behind the  Chairman  when speakings though some of us may turn our backs partially to him. I have known honorable senators to be called to order for turning their backs to tha Chair, when it has appeared to me to be unnecessary, because, though theoretically while speaking we are supposed to be addressing the Chair, we are in reality addressing honorable senators. I think it would be very much better not to accept the amendment suggested, because it has the very unpleasant and invidious attribute to which I have referred. I should be quite willing to have the whole standing order eliminated, because it deals purely with a matter of courtesy, and no honorable senator would willingly be discourteous to the  President  or  Chairman  of Committees. I think we may very well leave it to the good sense of honorable senators to act courteously. </para>

I should be very sorry indeed to see it carried in the amended form proposed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons,</inline> because I can quite imagine that &#39;it would be regarded as a slight upon the  President.  T arn inclined to think that it would be a slight upon the honorable and learned senator, and I should so regard it myself. We have acquiesced in the practice up to the present time, and I cannot see that it has led to any bad results. I do not think that any necessity whatever has been shown for making such a rule as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clemons</inline> now proposes. </para>

            <para>- T should like to draw the attention of the Committee to a point which I think has been entirely overlooked in the discussion, not only of Standing Order 393, but of every standing order referring to the  President.  I am under the impression that when we elected our  President,  we did so in the belief that he would exercise his privileges in every way impartially. If that be clearly understood by honorable senators, we have put the  President  in a place in the chamber where he stands by himself, and simply because he leaves the Chair when &#163;he Senate goes into Committee, I see no reason why we should divest him of the attribute of impartiality with which we have surrounded him. If we forced the  President  away from his position behind the Chair, and compelled him to speak in Committee from one side or other of the chamber, we should do that. So far from there being any discourtesy in the  President  addressing honorable senators from the position which it has been his custom to occupy when speaking, I hold that that is the only place from which he can address honorable senators and maintain the impartiality of his office. Those are my views for what they are worth. </para>

              <para>- Undoubtedly. The  President  is  President  in the Senate, and in the Senate only. As soon as the Senate resolves itself into Committee we have no  President,  and the  President  becomes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Raker.</inline> This is especially important in this Senate, because, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> will remember, the Constitution Contains many provisions dealing with the votes and actions of honorable senators having regard to the fact that each State is equally represented in the Senate. When the Senate is in Committee <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> is one of six senators from South Australia, enabled by the Constitution and by our standing orders to speak, and enabled by the Constitution, although  President,  to exercise a deliberative vote and not a casting vote. So that in every respect his function as  President  ceases as soon as the Senate goes into Committee. That is the essential point in the whole of our arguments, and I am afraid <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has entirely overlooked it. I desire to say a word with regard to my personal attitude in moving this amendment. It has been said that it will be taken as a direct slight or a direct blow aimed at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker.</inline> I have heard it said by way of interjection that this question should have been raised long ago, but I remind honorable senators that there was no previous opportunity to raise it. I do not suppose that anyhonorable senator will say that I have been personally afraid to move in this matter. I can assure honorable senators that there has been no fear on my part, but I have had no other opportunity of raising the question. How could I, under the standing orders under which we are working at the present time, challenge <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker&#39;s</inline> right to stand behind the Chair while speaking ? The standing orders would not have supported me if I had done so, and I could only have appealed to the honorable and learned senator&#39;s sense of courtesy to the Chair. I preferred to wait until the proper opportunity arose, and if these standing orders had come before us for consideration last session I should have raised the point then, in order that the practice for the future might be decided. Because neither I nor any other honorable senator has &#39;had an opportunity of drawing attention to this practice, we are told that we allowed it to grow. That argument is erroneous and unfair, because no opportunity previously arose to check what has been called a practice, and no member of the Senate could have prevented <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> speaking from behind the Chair under the standing orders at present in force. I have taken the first opportunity  of trying to prevent a practice which is not in accordance with the practice of any other Parliament in the world. where English is spoken. I am told that I should withdraw this amendment because it will hurt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker&#39;s</inline> feelings. I have no desire to hurt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker&#39;s</inline> feelings, but I do desire that we shall adopt the practice which obtains everywhere else, or that we shall be given <inline font-style="italic">some</inline> reason why that practice should be departed from. I feel that I am justified in taking advantage of the earliest opportunity to check a practice which should never have been allowed to grow up, arid of trying to prevent the establishment of a practice which has no warranty anywhere else. &#34; </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator HIGGS</inline>(Queensland). - I hope that honorable senators will not agree to strike out this standing order, simply because some of them, and apparently the majority, think that the  President  will be annoyed about it, and that he will take offence at this proposal if it is carried. They should consider whether the amendment proposed is right or wrong. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> has supplied us with proof of the correctness of our arguments. The honorable senator has said that if we make the  President  sit upon the benches on either side of the Chamber, we take away  from him his impartiality or his appearance of impartiality. That is the very thing I desire to take away from him. </para>
          <para class="block">I desire that the  President  when out of the chair shall be recognised simply as a member of the Senate, and that honorable senators shall not pay any more attention to his arguments, owing to the weight and added influence of his position as  President,  than they would give to the arguments of any other honorable senator. That is the sole cause of our action&#39; in- this matter. We desire that the  President,  when he leaves the chair, shall take his place with us without any of the added influence of wigs and gowns. There is no desire whatever to inflict a slight upon the  President.  We must remember that what we do now will probably constitute the practice for all time. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> is dead and gone and others take his place this practice will be followed, and the  President  of the day will sit behind the Chair. If we strike out this standing order that practice will never be altered. We should not allow any consideration for the feelings of the.  President  in regard to this particular matter to influence us in any way. The objection offered on that score is absolutely groundless. </para>

            <para>-! see no reason why an honorable senator should not be - permitted to read his speech if he desires to do so. We wish to hear the views of an honorable senator, and if he can give utterance to those views more satisfactorily by having previously committed them to paper, surely it is to the advantage of the Senate, as well as to the advantage of the honorable senator himself, that he should be permitted to do so. I see no reason for this prejudice against written speeches. We hear a great deal for and against written sermons ; but I believe that written sermons are very often, very much better than those that&#39; are delivered extempore. I shall vote against this standing order. </para>

            <para>- For the information of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart,</inline> I may perhaps be allowed to relate an anecdote. In America, at one time, Congress had no such standing order as this. The consequence was that there grew up in W ashington a class of gentlemen who lived by writing speeches for members of both Houses. While this practice prevailed, a practical joker, who had been offended in some way, wrote the same speech for no less than three honorable senators, who deli vered or attempted to deliver it. I think the incident supplies a sufficient reason for the retention of this standing order. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator STEWART</inline>(Queensland).- The explanation given by the  President  is a very interesting one. If we could only carry this provision a step further, I think it would be eminently desirable. It struck me, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> was giving his explanation, that the application of a somewhat similar rule to the courts of justice might perhaps be a very good thing if it did away with the lawyers. We have in the courts a class of men who monopolize the business, but no one seems to find any fault with them. Some persons are so fortunate as to be able to commit to memory a speech and deliver it. What guarantee, therefore, have we that any senator&#39;s speech is his own ? None whatever. If a senator can express his thoughts better in writing than in speech he ought to be permitted to read his written thoughts to the Senate. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McGREGOR</inline>(South Australia). I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stewart&#39;s</inline> view will &#34;not be taken seriously, although I believe that he is in earnest. If we had no such standing order, what an advantage it would be to a senator with a fertile imagination if he wished to do a little &#34; stone- walling.&#34; He could write or type a speech to last for a week, and all that he would have to do would be to stand in his place and deliver it. Although we may find it necessary sometimes to do a little &#34; stone- walling &#34; in the interests of the community, yet I hope that we shall never become professional &#34;stonewallers.&#34; For that reason I should like every senator to deliver his speech unwritten. </para>

            <para>- I do not think that the standing order is wanted. In South Australia we had a practice by which we overcame the prohibition against the reading of extracts from newspapers. We quietly folded the extract within a paper and made out that we had memorized the matter. We read the extract and no one called attention to the breach of the rule. I expect that a similar practice will grow up in the Senate even if we adopt this standing order. It might as well be omitted for any good that it will do. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baker</inline> that we should be allowed to quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and to carry his idea a little further, we might as well be allowed to quote from papers or reports of debates, even if we had not <inline font-style="italic">Hnnsard.</inline> A clever speaker can evade the rule with the greatest ease, but it takes a new member a little time to learn the art of reading extracts from papers referring to debates of the same session. </para>
