            <para>-I love these 'if not, why not' questions. I wish honourable senators would stop asking them. They are like 'beating your wife' questions. The position is a simple one. My work and that of the Department has been concluded about a fortnight. We took a very wide cross-section of views. We were most anxious to get the view of the trade union movement. That took a rather long time to get, but we have it. I believe that it was necessary to take the time to get that. I believe that the document is a good one. It has been presented by me to the Government. It is now being studied by the relevant government departments which have a common interest in the whole problem. It is hoped that the report will be ready before very long. I shall be trying to get it out so that I can present it to the Parliament before we close. If I cannot do so, I shall present it as soon as possible after I have it finalised. I cannot really give any firmer undertaking than that. I have approached the matter on the basis that it is important. It ought to have the widest possible input, which I believe it has had. It certainly needs to have the attention of other government departments, which it is now getting. I hope that when it does come out it will receive public examination and there will be some genuine attempt to approach the problems of manufacturing in a bipartisan, non-political style. </para>

              <para>-On my living standard I am not familiar with caviar. I am not terribly well up on the caviar world. I know that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> said is substantially correct. Because of pollution of the Caspian Sea, it is said, the volume of caviar that is being produced out of sturgeon is declining at a fairly fast rate. Therefore, with world demand increasing, maybe the substitute product will have increasing attraction. There is a well-known story of a British Army commander who between the 2 wars was camped on the shores of the Caspian Sea with his troops. Of course, they were being fed regularly on the local product close to the Caspian. One morning at breakfast, in company with his orderly officer he asked: 'Any complaints?' One of the soldiers said: 'Yes, this jam tastes of fish'. What I will do is inquire whether we have any hope for the dairy industry in Australia. </para>

In the light of significant structural changes in business and the relocation of employees resulting therefrom due to economic upheavals over the last 4 years, can the Minister say whether the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations is able accurately to predict, by statistical method or other objective processes, the extent of the effects on other employers and community employment levels of the closure or contraction of a particular industry in the community? If not, are there methods used overseas which could be adapted for use in Australia? Would not such information be vital to the preparation of Budget estimates in respect of the unemployment benefit, relocation allowances, etc.?

            <para>- The honourable senator has asked a number of very important questions, the answers to which would demand a fairly high degree of technical knowledge and understanding of areas in which certainly one would need to be highly expert. Although I am not in a position to provide the honourable senator with answers to the specific questions he has asked I certainly will pass on the questions to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations whom I represent in this place and obtain answers as soon as possible. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Education. It follows the 17'/i per cent devaluation of 28 November last. Does the Minister agree that the short term inflationary effects of devaluation will necessitate further allocations to 'cost supplement' education funding if serious reductions in spending levels are to be avoided? In view of the Minister's undertaking of 4 November 1976 that 'the Government will continue to supplement programs to meet unavoidable cost increases', will the Minister now give an undertaking that the Government will provide full cost supplementation to education funds to cover the reduction in spending levels caused by the devaluation? </para>

            <para>- The matter raised in the first part of the question is one primarily for the Treasurer. The success of the devaluation move, in terms of its effect or otherwise upon inflation, will depend upon a whole series of concomitant activities, including the Australian community's attitude towards wage spirals, wage escalation and other inflationary things. If there is a general restraint and if the Australian Labor Party will assist the Government in urging general restraint in Australia, then there is no need at all for inflation to occur; the very reverse is true. The very healthy trend towards a reduction in the rate of inflation that started this year can be continued if there is a bipartisan approach by the Government and the Opposition in this country towards getting the rate of inflation down and not exacerbating it. As to cost supplementation, the statement means what it says. It is clear in its meaning. It relates to all unavoidable costs and will be interpreted as such. </para>

            <para>-I shall refer first to the implication of the second question. My understanding is that technically the optimum desirability is to site the Omega station relatively far to the south-east of Australia so as to get the most effective triangulation. That being so, I understand that the experts regard a site in Tasmania as being desirable. If the Labor Party were to have second thoughts and were willing to consider Tasmania as a suitable site, I have no doubt that my colleague in another place would be interested so to hear. I am not aware of any such changes. I am not aware that any alternative sites have been finalised. Clearly, the Government is looking at a series of sites in an area in south-eastern Australia which would be desirable. It has now been established, thank goodness in a bipartisan way, that Omega is a valuable peacetime navigational aid and in no way represents a threat of military consequence. That was the foundation recommendation of the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. It should also not be overlooked that the Omega station, wherever it is sited, will bring not only valuable capital equipment but also some useful employment and prosperity to the area. </para>

            <para>- I have not issued instructions to the Director-General with regard to the number of job applications that should be interpreted as showing that reasonable steps have been taken to obtain employment. As I understand it, the Director-General has issued no directive on the standard number of job applications that he would regard as complying with the Act. The third part of the question suggested that there was an attitude that whether one application or 101 applications for employment had been made by a school leaver there would still be a rigid application of no payment of unemployment benefit. That is not accurate. It is an area where some flexibility needs to be exercised so that reasonable steps to find employment are the objective of the school leaver. Special benefit is able to be paid to those students in a situation where hardship exists. Again in the area of special benefit the Director-General determines whether eligibility for that benefit has been achieved by the person who makes the application. </para>

            <para>- I understand that Commonwealth funds have been made available for this project under the community health program. Specifically, it is expected that a total of approximately $191,000 will be allocated to this centre in the 1976-77 Commonwealth block grant to the Health Commission of New South Wales. That Commission is primarily responsible for the development and management of projects such as the Eden community health centre, the Commonwealth's role being related to broad policy issues, planning, evaluation and the provision of financial assistance. Based on information held by the Commonwealth Department of Health it is my understanding that consultation has taken place between the local health professionals and the regional directorate of the Health Commission of New South Wales. I understand that this consultation is continuing and is particularly directed at ensuring the coordination of services when the health centre opens. The State authorities have the detailed management of this project and any more detailed answer to the main point of the honourable senator's question lies with those authorities. </para>

            <para>-Yes, it certainly will. One of the problems of the tourist industry- and we have talked about this in the Senate on previous occasions- has been the growing imbalance in funds taken out by people leaving Australia and taking their holidays abroad for various reasons and those brought in by people from overseas coming to this country to see Australia. There has been a growing amount of difference; it has been quite substantial. The difference was about $60m about 4 years ago, and in the next year it could be more than $400m. That is a great deal of money to be worried about. There has also been a decline because of factors in the domestic tourist industry, which has had a marked effect on Tasmania and particularly on the Gold Coast and other areas in Queensland. For those sorts of reasons the Government set up a select committee on which all parties have joined together to study this matter. I believe that Tasmania will get out of this devaluation a very considerable improvement in its domestic travel industry through people on the Australian mainland travelling to Tasmania as a good logical alternative to travelling abroad. As I have said before, and I think it can be fairly said, Tasmania has an immense range of attractions, not the least of which are the honourable senators from Tasmania in this place. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I am extremely pleased that it is not going to his colleague the Minister for Administrative Services because he has openly admitted in this chamber many times that he does not read the newspapers. I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> does. I point out that on page 2 of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Independent</inline> of 21 November there appeared an article which was headed: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Checks to intensify. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The article talked about more intensive checks to be earned out on international aircrews at the Perth Airport following the conviction of 3 South African crew members who were trying to smuggle live parrots and revolvers out of Australia. Having had some experience with the Customs people at Perth Airport over the past few months, I am concerned that there has been a decrease in the number of officers on duty whenever international aircraft arrive and depart. I ask the Minister: Will he advise the total strength of the Customs inspection force at the Perth and Fremantle offices in Western Australia. How many of those officers are attached to Fremantle and how many to the Perth Airport? What is the difference between that figure and the figure, say, 12 months ago? If more intensive checks are to be made, will the Minister advise by how many the force will be increased and when it will be increased? </para>

            <para>- I am not so rigid in my attitude to the reading of newspapers as my Leader in the Senate. On the other hand, I am not an avid reader of newspapers and I am certainly not an avid reader of the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Independent.</inline> So the article to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> referred me did escape my attention. Also, I have not had the advantage of international travel in recent months, as has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman.</inline> Therefore I am not so familiar with the Customs checks at Perth Airport, Fremantle Harbour or wherever else in Western Australia from which one may go abroad. Nevertheless, the matter that the honourable senator has raised, which is based partly on her own experience and partly on newspaper reports, raises an issue that is certainly of some importance and perhaps of some concern. The honourable senator seeks a good deal of statistical information which I do not have at my disposal. I shall certainly pass on her question to the Minister whom I represent in an endeavour to obtain an early answer. </para>

I also understand that the Government has had consultations with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ian</inline> McLennan, who is the  Chairman  of Am Del, with respect to the Government's future attitude towards it.

I am not conversant enough with the subject to know whether his colleague has the power to ensure that, but I ask the Minister to ask his colleague to exercise whatever power he might have to ensure that such material is not brought into Australia, particularly for the purpose of enabling someone to make a fast buck from it. </para>

            <para>-I did not hear the <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> program this morning, but I have read in the Press of the decision of a court to allow the execution- I think by firing squad- of a convicted murderer to go ahead. I have also read in the Press reports that there may be a filming of this situation because the execution will take place outside the walls of a gaol. I think that the matter raises 2 questions of human taste and judgment. The Senate is aware of my feelings. I find it more repelling that anyone would seek to execute anyone else. I find the filming secondary to that in terms of ethnical judgment. I am astonished that the Leader of the Opposition referred only to the question of filming. It is a matter of conscience whether or not one believes in capital punishment. If it has to be, I share his view that it is macabre and I share his feeling about the filming of it. I will refer his question to the Minister in the other place, but I am bound to say to the honourable senator that the question of a government exercising censorship on this or any other matter would raise the gravest doubts in my mind. What I would hope is that the good taste of the Australian people would be such that they would share the honourable senator's revulsion at what to me is a horrible spectacle. </para>

I will look at the several points that were raised in the question and see whether any information needs to be given to clarify the position.

            <para>-Has the Minister representing the Treasurer seen a report in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that a system of quarterly tax payments for companies is to be reintroduced? Is the Minister able to confirm or deny the veracity of this report? If the system is to be reintroduced can the Minister assure the Senate that there will be sufficient notice to companies of the implementation of the decision so as to avoid undue pressure on the liquidity of companies at this critical stage of economic recovery? </para>

            <para>-I had a bit of bad luck this morning. I missed reading the <inline font-style="italic">Australian,</inline> so I do not really know what is in it. I do know that once upon a time we had a traditional pattern of company tax payment. It has been altered variously. There have been arguments that it distorted the monetary position and it is therefore logical speculation- and that is all it can be said to be- that people will be looking at this aspect. I know no more than that. I have no official information whatsoever. I will just have to suggest that the question be placed on notice if the honourable senator does not mind so that I can get information for him. </para>

            <para>- I am not aware whether school leavers are provided with a special form by the Commonwealth Employment Service, but I will inquire about that. As far as the right of appeal is concerned, in the Department of Social Security every person is advised of his right of appeal. As to the question relating to the sittings of the Appeals Tribunals, the tribunals decide themselves the times and dates that they sit but I assume that they will be sitting throughout the year. I will check whether they have made arrangements quite independent from my Department not to sit, but my assumption would be that they would continue to service appeal applications throughout the year. </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the circumstances which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> has outlined. Assuming that what he has stated is factual, I cannot respond as to whether <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mosley</inline> 's views are personal views or otherwise. I do say that the concept of the Australian Conservation Foundation is an excellent one and one should be careful not to confuse the general concept with what might be judgments on actions of individuals. It is a matter for those within the voluntary organisations to act to ensure that views of the organisations represent a true cross-section of the individuals. </para>

          <para>I am bound to say, being a member myself of that organisation, that over a period of time I have had some grave reservations about views that have been expressed as being the views of a cross-section of the body; but that is a matter, as in all voluntary organisations, for the people within them to do something about. Certainly it is true that the body concerned receives a grant- in-aid, I think from the Commonwealth Government. I will look at the substance of the question from that point of view, but I have no other information than that. </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator was good enough to advise me that he would be asking a question along those lines. I have 2 briefing papers from my colleague in the other place which I think I ought to read for the sake of clarity and definitiveness. In general, under current policy, residents from Taiwan may make private and unofficial visits to Australia. Entry for each individual is conditional upon his holding an ordinary passport and submitting in advance a written declaration that he will not purport to represent Taiwan, China or the Republic of China. Residents of Taiwan enter Australia on letters of authority which are usually issued through our Commission in Hong Kong. Persons from Taiwan wishing to participate in medical or scientific congresses in Australia must do so in a private and unofficial capacity consistent with the terms of the general declaration outlined above. For example, they should not seek to use a flag, insignia or any other form of identification suggesting that they are national or government representatives of Taiwan, China or the Republic of China. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think that basically answers the honourable senator's question. There was a specific instance of the Secretary-General of the Australian Medical Association writing to the Minister for Foreign Affairs on 16 July of this year seeking advice on whether visas would be issued to people from Taiwan wishing to take part as representatives of the China Medical Association in a congress of the Confederation of Medical Associations in Asia and Oceania to be held in Sydney in 1 977. In replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Repin</inline> the Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock,</inline> briefly outlined the conditions governing the entry to Australia of people from Taiwan and suggested that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Repin</inline> had indicated it would only be possible for participants from Taiwan to attend as representatives of the China Medical Association, it seemed clear that they could not meet the conditions of entry for residents of Taiwan and therefore would not be able to obtain visas to attend the congress. In the event it appears that the Am was unable to make arrangements for the congress which would enable people from Taiwan to take part except as representatives of the China Medical Association and accordingly felt obliged to cancel plans for holding the congress in Australia. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question to the Minister for Education by remarking that I have noticed that some post-secondary educational institutions in Brisbane are competing for students by offering courses of a similar nature. I refer in particular to some departments of the University of Queensland and the Queensland Institute of Technology. At times, the competition for students has become quite overt. Whilst there may be some value in such competition, I question whether this is in the best interests of the community, given the scarcity of resources available for education. Can the Minister advise whether any mechanism is available to the Commonwealth to ensure that unnecessary duplication of courses does not occur at post secondary educational institutions in Australia? </para>

            <para>-I think this is an important point. I, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston,</inline> have seen the advertisements and the competition. Primarily, the matter is one for the higher education authorities in the Queensland State Government because, as the honourable senator will know, the primary constitutional responsibility for such colleges rests with the State governments. A residual responsibility remains with the Commonwealth for 2 reasons: One is that we pay the bills- that is always a salutary one- and the other is that we do have some final say in the accreditation of courses. That, in itself, is of some help. </para>

          <para>I am looking forward to the report of Professor Williams' committee on education and training, as that committee will have to look at the whole question of co-ordination and rationalisation.

I share the honourable senator's concern. </para>

The Minister for the Northern Territory has informed me that it is true that the member for Night cliff in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Dawn</inline> Lawrie, has criticised the decision by the Darwin Cyclone Tracy Relief Trust Fund to grant funds totalling $545,499 as a contribution to the Tracy Memorial Cultural Centre. </para>

          <para>It was implied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Lawrie</inline> that the dispersal of the funds for this purpose was outside the terms of the trust deed. Accordingly, the Minister has asked the Crown Law Officer to examine the matter. The Minister and the members of the Trust Fund will, no doubt, be guided by such legal advising as is tendered. The Minister said that the members of the Trust Fund had acted at all times in the interests of the people who suffered as a consequence of the cyclone and in accordance with the wishes of donors. He said that there was no reflection whatever on the probity of the Trust members, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> who moved the motion for terminating the Trust Fund at its final meeting held on 30 September 1976. </para>

		<para>The Lebanon Crisis- Humanitarian Aspects</para>
        <para class="block">In May this year the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence decided to investigate the significance of the Lebanon crises. The Lebanon crisis- a civil war- has an international outreach because the Middle East is a region of ideological, religious and strategic concern to great powers, to the Jewish communities throughout the world and to Arab peoples and governments. There is a natural concern among Australia's Lebanese community. The Committee has taken voluminous evidence and held informal discussions with people who have first hand knowledge of the Lebanon crisis. A comprehensive report to the Parliament will be presented during the Autumn session covering all aspects of our terms of reference. In the meantime the Committee has found it necessary to make an interim report on what are mainly the humanitarian aspects of the crisis, Lebanon needs help. This interim report comes at a time when the possibilities for helping victims of the civil conflict in Lebanon are better than they have been over the last 18 months because the latest cease fire seems to be holding well, notwithstanding that frequent failures of previous efforts at armistice have dashed hopes for peace and sanity. </para>
        <para>The traditional 'national pact' between fairly equally balanced communities of Christians, Muslims and Druzes has disintegrated. Under the impact of eighteen months of violence, vendetta and retribution, Lebanon's consensus has broken down. Factionalism, fears of genocide, and economic and social status disparities will make the reconciliation process very difficult, lt is probable that disinterested care for the people of Lebanon by powers like Australia could heal a situation aggravated by powers which fish in troubled waters with the ultimate aim of territorial expansion or ideological influence. </para>
        <para>The human tragedy and devastation resulting from the Lebanon crisis is so immense that they create claims of great moral weight on other nations to take action to alleviate suffering. The number of dead may be as high as 60 000 with a further 200 000 wounded. These are casualties in a population of 3 million. Compare these figures with the 46 000 U.S. servicemen killed in Vietnam over 12 years and the disastrous impact of the war on a small state like Lebanon can be realised. </para>
        <para>Possibly a third of Lebanon's three million people have fled the country and there are many more homeless, wounded, sick and destitute within Lebanon. The Lebanese people are critically in need of assistance but aid programs have faced deliberate obstruction, corruption and immense physical difficulties including the chronic state of insecurity due to indiscriminate killing, and the complete breakdown of Lebanon's economy, communications, and service infrastructures. </para>
        <para>A necessary rendition for the healing process in Lebanon is the cessation of all outside interference in a country which for many years has managed to live a much more prosperous existence than the non oil producing Arab states. This outside intervention is initially and tragically attributable to the Palestinians. They came to Lebanon as refugees but have since adopted a disruptive role in Lebanon's internal affairs. Their interference in Lebanese politics, possibly at foreign behest and certainly with foreign support, constitutes abuse of Lebanese hospitality. </para>
        <para>Syria, Iraq, Libya and several other countries have intervened. Syria's intervention has been overt. Iraq's and Libya's intervention has been mainly through influence on the Palestinians, propaganda of intransigence, as well as money and 'volunteers'. Lebanon's Government may benefit from Syrian intervention, whatever Syria's motives. Iraq and Libya have tended to frustrate a solution to the Lebanon crisis. </para>
        <para>The existence of a recognised government authority in Lebanon, however disintegrated and impotent that government's administrative structure may be, has contributed to a great reluctance by Australia as well as many other nations, to raise this issue of the tragedy of Lebanon, including foreign intervention in Lebanon, in international forums, such as the United Nations. This is despite the fact that there has been a clear breach of the United Nation's charter, and despite a manifest threat to peace in the Middle East. This is not simply due to the apparent futility of taking such matters to the United Nations, but also in deference to the fact that world discussion and United Nations action would not be welcomed by some Arab States. </para>
        <para>Aid for the Lebanese people has been totally inadequate. This is in part because of an atmosphere of deceit surrounding the crisis. Leaders of the various participants, including those Arab States actively involved, want the United Nations to keep out. Therefore appeals for aid are minimal and people in flight have not been declared refugees by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. The United Nations definition of what constitutes a refugee clearly applies to many uprooted from Lebanon and within Lebanon. </para>
        <para>The Committee does not believe that Australia has so far been particularly generous in the unhappy predicament of the Lebanese people. In the nine months ending 30 September 1 976 only 1,835 Lebanese arrived in Australia. They were mostly close relatives of Australian resident Lebanese. We have sent no medical teams there, despite the fact that the International Red Cross have had only 16 doctors and nurses in Lebanon. The lack of adequate reaction by the International Committee of the Red Cross is one of the most depressing aspects of the crisis. There may be reasons for this, but the contrast with previous International Red Cross action seems marked. </para>
        <para>The Committee has carefully considered the prospect of helping more Lebanese refugees into Australia and has made a number of recommendations in this regard. It has been particularly concerned that there should be a compassionate, effective and clear-cut refugee policy in Australia. The committee believes that there will continue to be refugee situations in years to come and that Australia needs to develop an enlightened policy which would command the support of all political parties and the assent of enlightened opinion. </para>
        <para>In its consideration of the likely impact upon Australia of an increased number of Lebanese migrants, the Committee looked for any signs that the destructive factionalism of the Lebanon situation and the antagonism rampant in the Middle East generally were reflected to any extent in Australia- particularly in the media used by ethnic communities. The Committee was particularly concerned at the allegations against two Melbourne radio stations- 3CR and 3 Double Zit would appear that at times these stations have been guilty of incitement to hatred and gross misrepresentation without always granting an opportunity for reply. Although the Committee has received some evidence in this regard its work was hampered by an apparent lack of monitoring of both the English broadcasts of 3CR and the Arabic broadcasts of 3 Double Z. </para>
        <para>The Committee has recommended that the proposed Australian Broadcasting Tribunal hold an inquiry into both ethnic and community access radio stations and that the Australian Broadcasting Commission take an active interest in the selection of qualified and responsible organising committees for ethnic radio stations. While the Committee does not wish to curtail the right of 'normal' free speech it condemns the use of radio stations or ethnic newspapers and periodicals for creating hostility and inciting race, religious and ideological hatred between communities in this country. Australia should welcome refugees but not the importation of their quarrels. The Committee appreciates that when such incitement to conflict and contempt occurs it is invariably generated by a faction not representative of the ethnic community as a whole. </para>
        <para>The Committee has made 18 recommendations in its report Many of these require urgent action such as A. The sending of medical teams to Lebanon, B. Government support for appeals by the International Red Cross and the World Food and Agricultural Organisations for urgent relief to Lebanon, C. The efficient and humane handling of applications from genuine refugees, D. The establishment of a diplomatic post including a migration team in Syria. </para>
        <para>Syria has enhanced its national influence, through its intervention in Lebanon, and has the bulk of Lebanese refugees within its borders and has increased in diplomatic significance. The Soviet Union sent its top leaders there recently. Australia is unrepresented. </para>
        <para>Before the Committee reports again to the Parliament on this reference early next year, the Committee hopes that significant progress will have been made towards the implementation of the recommendations in its interim report. They seem to be recommendations of logic and good will. I take this opportunity of thanking the large number of very good witnesses who have made this report possible. 2 December 1 976 Magnus Cormack, Senator Chairman</para>

            <para>- When the debate was interrupted last night I was discussing briefly what would flow and what has flowed on to the States from the coal industry, especially in my State of Queensland. I mentioned that royalties were playing a major part and that when new production was commenced increased royalties would assist our economy. I say here and now that I believe that royalties are a natural thing which should flow to the people of Australia; but when governments impose royalties they should take into consideration the profitability or otherwise of the mines concerned so that royalties do not have a detrimental effect, as this coal export levy did. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I mentioned also the profits from the rail freight. I touched briefly on the fact that the railway built in Queensland to carry the coal from the Utah Development Co. mines of Peak Downs, Safari and Go on yell a to Hay Point was unique in that the mining company paid for the railway line and the rolling stock. We have a magnificent railway which was built at a cost of not one cent to the taxpayer and which eventually will revert to the Government and people of Queensland and will be a common earner. It will not belong to the mines; it will belong to the people of Queensland. Already cattle yards have been built along that line to tap the fattening areas in the Nebo district. So these benefits have flowed to the State. Another benefit, of course, is the increased payroll tax revenue. The coal exporting companies are paying 70 per cent or more of their gross profits to the State and Federal governments. These imposts currently include income tax, coal export duty, royalties, coal freights, payroll tax and sales tax. So they are playing a vital part in the economy of our country at a time when we need all that we can get. </para>
          <para>The abolition of the coal export duty will remove that discriminatory barrier to the flow of funds into the coal mining industry. As I mentioned or alluded to previously, it also will give confidence to other people who want to set up what could become quite feasible and profitable industries. Undoubtedly there is a question in people's minds in that where a government would impose a levy on something that is seen to be profitable they will be loth to invest risk capital. So the abolition of this levy undoubtedly will help to build up confidence in this sector once again. The Industries Assistance Commission, in its draft report on the petroleum and mining inquiry, stated that it 'accepts the proposition that the mining sector in Australia is efficient and low cost in comparison with other sectors'. I think this has been borne out. The mining companies employ a large number of people and make an important contribution to Australian export income. That is proved by the figures I quoted. The industry has proved its ability to open new mines in order to meet growth in world markets. The industry sees a potential for further export, building up to an extra 22 million tonnes with an ultimate increase in sales earnings of $ 1, 000m as a contribution to the Australian economy. </para>
          <para>The removal of the duty will result in the development of new mines in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Major positive</inline> results will accrue to the national economy, as desired by the Australian Government. Therefore I have no apprehension at all in supporting this measure which is designed eventually to abolish this iniquitous levy. </para>
          <para>It has had a very detrimental effect. There are mines which were not profitable because of this levy. The mining industry has brought into Australia expertise and technology and nsk capital which we just did not have in Australia. The point must be made that Australian workmen are now operating all those mines and ancillary industries. They helped to construct the massive drag lines and the unique unloading operation at Hay Point. We could probably count on the fingers of one hand the number of people outside Australia at present who have anything to do with the operation and management of these coal mines. The industry has been of tremendous benefit and it should not be hit hard because it has been so successful. That success has flowed through all sections of the Australian community by way of jobs and taxes and other things which have been mentioned in the debate. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank the Senate for its support of this measure. I was particularly pleased to find that the Opposition had changed its attitude to this measure during its passage through the Parliament. In the debate in the other place the Opposition opposed the Bill and apparently wanted to retain the levy which the Opposition in the debate here and also in the debate in the other place recognised was an inequitable and discriminatory tax. Nevertheless, it was prepared to continue it despite the criticisms of it which the Opposition recognised. However, wisdom seems to have prevailed even in the Opposition ranks following reflection on this matter and I am pleased to find that in this chamber the Opposition is not opposing the measure. Obviously I am grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> for giving the Opposition some sense of reality in regard to this tax. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government's proposal is that this tax should be phased out over 3 years. This Bill is the first stage in the phasing out operation and makes significant reductions in the levy. However, the Bill points the way and gives the coal mining companies a clear indication of the policy of the Government. They know where they stand in relation to this levy and they know where the Government stands. It is most important for investors and existing producers to know exactly where they will stand in the future. One of the matters which bedevilled the development of the mining industry generally in Australia during the years of the Labor Government was the air of uncertainty which was created by that Government about its policy on the mining industry. Therefore by the step we are taking here this </para>
          <para class="block">Government is making it clear where it stands on one matter in particular which has had serious effects not only on new investment in the coal mining industry but also on those producers who already have invested in the industry. </para>
          <para>The Bill does one other thing which I do not think has been fully adverted to. Apart from reducing the levy on the two different rates- the rate on high quality coking coal being reduced from $6 to $4.50 and the rate on other coal from $2 to $1.50- the Bill widens the exemption from the levy. It also makes perfectly clear that in future the levy will not apply to non co king coals. The exemption provided in the existing Act, which was passed last year, was drafted in such a way as to include some coal which could not come within the actual intention of the exemption to ensure that non co king coal was not the subject of a levy. However, the new definition which has been adopted in this Bill should make it clear in future that the levy will not apply to non co king coal. That significant improvement is being achieved by this measure. </para>
          <para>The debate that we have heard in the Senate on this Bill has covered all the ground which needed to be covered and I do not think that there is much more I should say in reply. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> covered very fully and effectively the question of the importance of new coal mining investment and production in Queensland in particular. They pointed out the great importance of these large investments to trie Queensland economy and welcomed the investment that has been made. I do not think I can add anything further to what they have said, except to emphasise on behalf of the Government the importance which the Government attaches to these large-scale investments in the mineral industry generally. Certainly, investment in the coal mining industry in Queensland in recent years has been a notable example of the type of development which the Government favours and encourages. Investments and developments of the same nature and terms have occurred in Western Australia in the iron ore developments in the Pilbara. The developments in the Bowen Basin in Queensland on the east coast of Australia and the iron ore developments in the Pilbara on the west coast of Australia are two of the major new developments in the mining industry which have occurred in recent years. </para>
          <para>The only problem which the Government has seen in any of these developments is that perhaps there has not been the level of Australian equity investment in some of the projects which we hoped would have been achieved. That is a matter which the Government has taken into account in its guidelines for foreign investment. In relation to new investments in this area in Queensland, the Government has already cleared them through negotiations which have taken place between the Government and the companies which propose to engage in new investments in the coal mining industry in Queensland. I understand that they have been fully cleared in terms of the level of Australian equity in new projects. However, the fact is that investments which were made in Queensland were made under different attitudes and policies in relation to foreign investment. Utah, the company which has been particularly criticised in this debate by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> was prepared to come in at a time when other companies were not interested in investment in this area, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> said. The company took the risk and it has made very great profits from that risk. </para>
          <para>The mere fact that a company has been successful and is making a profit is certainly not a reason, in the view of this Government, why the company should then be beaten about the head with high taxes. Indeed, that was one of the major criticisms that we made last year when in Opposition of the measure introduced by the Labor Government. We emphasised that it was a tax on success, and we do not accept for one minute the criticisms implied in the words 'windfall gains' or 'windfall profits'. The fact is that these happened to be successful investments. There are many other investments, particularly in such a risky venture as mining, which are not successful. Very large sums of money are spent on exploration and on the development of projects which for the very many reasons that affect the mining industry are not successful or profitable. When such a venture is profitable, it is a most dangerous and improper course for government then to step in and tax it simply because it happens to be making high profits. </para>
          <para>As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collard</inline> has pointed out, government revenues are replenished in a very notable way by the various forms of tax paid by the mining companies. Not only are they paying company tax at a rate which makes the Federal Government virtually an equal partner with the companies in their profits but they are paying other taxes as well. They are paying State royalties, and indeed this was another objection which we had previously. The levy was a similar type of tax to State royalties, which hitherto had been the States' share of the benefits that accrue from the mining industry. Apart from the 2 traditional taxes in the form of State royalties and Federal company tax, there are many other taxes. Payroll tax is now payable to the States, and there is also the benefit of income tax which accrues to the Government from the employment generated by these industries. Another major benefit which the community derives from these industries is the infrastructure provided by the companies in the form of towns, railways and ports. </para>

              <para>-Yes, I did read the Fitzgerald report and I was not impressed by it.

          <para>The big developments in the mining industry in Western Australia and Queensland have provided enormous direct community benefits in the infrastructures- that is, the towns- that they have built, apart altogether from the direct mining development and the ports and railways. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> gave figures in relation to the Queensland projects showing that, I think, 75 per cent of the capital investment is in fact investment in the infrastructure itself and only 25 per cent of it is actually direct expenditure on the creation of mines themselves. </para>
          <para>I do not propose to go in great detail into the statements that were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh.</inline> He made some reference to an article in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review.</inline> In fact, he seemed to take some joy from the report that the Japanese iron and steel industry is not to take as much iron ore and coal from Australia next year as it has been taking. Somehow or other <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> seemed to derive satisfaction from that. </para>

              <para>- But you said it in a way which I think we all recognised as indicating a matter of some concern. Certainly it is a matter of concern that the Japanese economy is not picking up as quickly as we would like. Naturally that is a matter of great concern. But it is certainly not a matter which should give any satisfaction. The fact of the matter is that the report to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> referred did not bear out the total gloom from which he seemed to be getting quite a good deal of satisfaction. He mentioned it in relation to the confidence that was expressed by, I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin,</inline> in relation to new developments in the coal mining industry in Queensland- the Hail Creek, Norwich Park and Nebo projects-and said that there was little likelihood of their continuation because of the problems with the Japanese economy. However, having looked at the article, I think I should refer to some aspects of it which do not bear out the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> gave to the Senate last night. I shall quote some passages from the article: </para>

            <para>But the effect of a Japanese cutback on Australian producers may not be as severe as feared. </para>
            <para>A cutback could mean exercise of 'down options' in contracts rather than reduction of basic volumes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Another interesting point in the article, and one to which I think the Labor Opposition ought to be giving more attention in relation to these matters than it is giving, is that Australian producers recently have failed to meet even reduced shipment targets, largely because of industrial trouble. The final part of the article is also of interest: </para>

            <para>The industry is expecting an increased demand in the coming fiscal year - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise the words 'increased demand '- but as a spokesman for a major coal producer said yesterday, Whether it will be 2 per cent or 10 per cent we just know'. </para>
          <para class="block">I think it should read 'we just do not know' instead of 'we just know'. But the fact of the matter is that, despite the rather sluggish state of recovery in the Japanese economy, new contracts for iron ore have been entered into by major Western Australian producers- Hamersley Iron, Mount Newman and Cliffs Western Australian Mining Co.- which it has been forecast will involve new investments of about $600m over the next couple of years involving the creation of about 3000 new jobs. So although there may be some doubts about when completely new projects will get off the ground, the fact of the matter is that there are to be major extensions to existing mining operations among the iron ore producers. I think that it is wrong to say, simply because there are no new producers coming into the field, that there are in fact no new projects going forward, particularly when there are extensions of existing projects to the tune of that magnitude. </para>
          <para>I believe that the Government's stand in relation to the coal export duty which was levied by its predecessor- the Labor Government- is one which will give relief of a major kind to producers who were suffering from what everyone agrees was an inequitable and discriminatory tax. This is a measure which will relieve the industry of the uncertainty that had been created. Once one starts to introduce new taxation of this kind- particularly taxation on success, as this was- one inevitably creates an air of uncertainty. I believe that this measure will also give a boost to new investment in the coal mining industry. I thank the Senate for its support of the Bill. </para>

            <para>-The Senate has before it 2 Bills- the Asian Development Fund Bill and the Asian Development Bank (Special Funds Contributions) Amendment Bill. The intent of the legislation is to authorise a contribution by Australia of just over $30m towards the first replenishment of the Asian Development Fund, which has been established within the Asian Development Bank. These Bills are similar to many Bills which we have seen go through the Parliament over the years. I think it can be said generally that both sides recognise the involvement of Australia in the work of the various international bodies such as the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I have indicated, the Opposition is not opposing the Bills. However, they invite comment on the attitudes not only of our own country but also of others and of political parties within our own country towards this general question. It is unnecessary for me to emphasise the magnitude of the problem that faces so many of the developing countries at present. The problem is not new, but it appears that it is being aggravated. For many years there has been an increasing disparity in wealth and economic growth between developing countries and developed countries. This trend has not been so apparent in the last couple of years because of the decline in the economic activity of the developed countries. In fact, the World Bank shows that overall those developing countries which qualify for assistance under the International Development Agency program have seen a growth rate of around 4½ per cent in recent years. That is not a bad rate of development in countries, many of which are not in what is often termed the take-off position. It is a matter of encouragement to all of us that progress is being made, but that progress obviously is not rapid enough. If we are to avoid the much greater problems which will arise in the years ahead, it is necessary that we continue our involvement in the general aid programs around the world. Organisations such as the Asian Development Bank give us that opportunity. </para>
          <para>It should be said that Australia, if not officially then in spirit and certainly by statements made not only by the previous Government but also by this Government, subscribes to the United Nations goal of making available for overseas aid purposes 0.7 per cent of our gross domestic product. As a nation we have not achieved that. The maximum that we reached was in the area of 0.55 per cent of our GDP under Labor Government. In the last year of that Government our contribution did slip marginally, but under the program of this Government, is has slipped below 0.5 per cent. That was admitted recently by the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock).</inline> In other words, it appears that a decline has set in in our general preparedness to devote a proportion of our national income to this purpose. This is something which must be resisted. I do not think that any responsible party in this country would wish to see that decline continue. There has to be a realisation by the Parliament that we must strive to get back to the position we were in, of gradually increasing the proportion of our gross domestic product going into overseas aid. </para>
          <para>As politicians we all are aware that there is very little political mileage in this matter. It is not a subject that is popular in the electorate. I suppose that many of us in this Parliament, on both sides, who have taken an interest in this matter over the years have been told on many occasions: You would do better if you concerned yourself with problems in Australia rather than with what might be going on in India or somewhere else'. That is the old 'charity begins at home' argument. The response to that, of course, is that charity begins where there is the greatest need. Obviously the needs of other countries in that context are infinitely greater than the needs that exist in this country, despite the fact that there are many Australians for whom much more should be done. We as a nation have the wealth to do those things for our own people, if we were perhaps to be more equitable in the distribution of income in this country. But that does not overcome the fact that there are enormous problems for developing countries. Those problems will continue to be with us for the foreseeable future. </para>
          <para>We as a nation have to accept the responsibility, which we have accepted in the past, to ensure that we do the maximum we possibly can. We might even have to have a bipartisan approach to this matter between the major parties in Australia and agree on a certain percentage build-up to reach 0.7 per cent. Maybe that is the only way we will be able to do it. It is quite evident that we are starting to slip from the maximum figure that we achieved two or three years ago. With those few comments, I think that the Bills should pass the Parliament without undue delay. The Opposition does not oppose them. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition does not oppose this legislation. The Bill essentially liberalised the estate duty assessment for which the Commonwealth legislates or is responsible, in line with the recommendations of the As prey Committee. I daresay that this issue would be one of the most contentious which we have experienced in this country in recent years. There as been an increasing opposition to the imposition of estate duty. Not only in this legislation is there a recognition that liberalisation should take place; in the States, particularly New South Wales and South Australia, similar sentiments are being expressed by State governments. We find a more extreme position being taken by the Queensland Government as the indications are that it is the intention of that Government to abolish estate duties entirely; and that of course is not in line with the recommendations of the As prey Committee because for obvious reasons it would create difficulties between the States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The legislation itself is quite straightforward. The only matter to which I would draw attention is the need, as the Committee itself indicated in its report, for much more thought to be given on the different approaches which have been taken by successive Federal governments and State governments. If we want to remove the anomalies and inequities in the estate duty laws there has to be greater consultation and indeed agreement between the Federal Government and State governments. Again this was a recommendation of the As prey Committee. There is no doubt that on so many occasions estate duty has created hardship for surviving spouses, particularly women. I think it is evident that throughout the nation there is a very strong feeling that these impositions, where they are impositions, ought to be removed even though this can be done only gradually. </para>
          <para>I understand that this legislation involves an amount of $ 14m in revenue which will be foregone by the Federal Treasury as a result, but it is probably $14m well spent by the Government because of the much greater chance now that widows particularly are not likely to suffer the same difficulties as have many others over the years. An estate valued at $90,000 will presumably soon be depleted by the inflation rate in this country which almost certainly will increase in the ensuing year or two at least, and the duty exemption level naturally will need to be considered again as time goes by. On behalf of the Opposition I indicate that we do not oppose the legislation. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the Bill. It does give further relief in the Federal estate duty field in respect of property passing to a surviving spouse. As the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> has said, the value of the spouse's interest to a maximum of $50,000 will be excluded from liability for duty irrespective of the total value of the estate or the nature of the assets included in it. So there is an absolute exemption from liability for duty on an estate of $50,000. The Minister also referred to another aspect of this legislation which removes from the Estate Duty Assessment Act the exemption which applied in relation to the matrimonial home. This will provide greater flexibility because under this legislation exemption from duty applies irrespective of the nature of the assets included in the estate whereas previously the matrimonial home exemption was restrictive. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Under this legislation in the case of an estate passing to a spouse the effective exemption from duty applies where the value of an estate does not exceed $90,000 because estates up to the value of $40,000 are exempt from duty in the existing legislation which remains unaltered in that respect. Once the value of an estate hits $90,000 the allowable exemption of $40,000 disappears at the rate of $2 for every $8 by which the total value of the estate exceeds the figure of $90,000. So in effect under this legislation an estate gets some exemption until a figure of $250,000 is reached. This is a very valuable step forward. It is pleasing to note that the Government has continued the recognition of the additional problems faced in respect of primary producer estates by reason of the fact that very often a major part of the asset is a freehold property and indeed in many cases that is the only asset held apart from livestock and plant. It has been a principle recognised over the years that an estate used for primary production should bear a lesser rate of duty. Primary producer estates up to a value of $98,000 will be exempt from duty. There is of course the benefit given of a reduction in duty in respect of primary production estates valued above that figure. That provision is in the existing legislation and remains unaltered. </para>
          <para>I think it is worth looking at the burden of Federal estate duty. I do not want to delay the Senate long on this matter but I do want to make a few observations. The payment of estate duty strikes at the middle and small operators in primary, secondary and commercial enterprises. In certain cases where there is a heavy hand by the estate duty commissioner these economic units become dismembered and in some cases the expertise of several generations is lost simply because the vicious impact of the scales of duty means that the assets which have produced income over the years have to be sold to satisfy the heavy assessment of duty. I think this is a situation which governments ought to avoid because, as I have already mentioned, liquidity problems face primary producer estates in respect of having to find large sums of money to pay duty when there are no capital funds available. The capital which has to be used to pay duty means that investment capital is lost to the nation. Thus national productivity opportunities are lost. </para>
          <para>I just want to cite a few figures in relation to the cost of the collection of Federal taxes and the percentage of total revenue derived from Federal estate duty. Firstly I will deal with the revenue derived from the imposition of Federal estate duty which comprises a very insignificant proportion of total Federal revenue. I have here a table which sets out the details of the total Federal revenue. I will seek leave to have it incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> but before doing so I will explain it. It covers the 3 years 1973-74, 1974-75 and 1975-76. For 1975-76 of a total tax revenue of $ 16,843m estate duty revenue amounted to $76.4m or 0.45 per cent. As a percentage of total revenue collected by the Government, which was $ 18,274.8m, estate duty represented 0.42 per cent. As a proportion of the total tax revenue and as a proportion of total revenue, in both cases that figure is receding. In 1973-74 estate duty represented 0.61 per cent of total tax revenue, and in 1975-76 it represented only 0.45 per cent. That is a significant drop, a drop of 25 per cent. A similar situation applies in relation to estate duty as a proportion of total revenue. That figure dropped from 0.55 per cent in 1973-74 to 0.42 per cent in 1975-76. I seek leave to have that table incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

              <para>- The second set of figures relates to the cost of collection of estate duty. It shows that the cost of collecting federal estate duty, calculated as a proportion of the net cost of total collections, is 2.69 per cent, compared with the cost of collecting income tax of 1.052 per cent. So it is costing 2V4 times as much to collect estate duty as it costs to collect income tax. </para>

In other words, the total collections of federal estate duties in 1973-74 amounted to $65.9m and the net cash cost of collecting that amount was $1.8m. that means that the net cost of collection expressed as a percentage was 2.69 per cent. A similar situation applies in relation to the collection of income tax. The net percentage cost of collecting sales tax is even less, of course. The comparison I make, however, is between the net cost of collecting income tax and the net cost of collecting estate duty. I seek leave to have that table also incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

              <para>- I want to make a brief reference now to the situation which has arisen in relation to the abolition of probate duty in the State of Queensland. Of course, in New South Wales and Victoria steps are being taken in that direction by abolition of death duty between spouses. In the case of Victoria I think legislation has already been passed by the Parliament, and in the case of New South Wales a Bill is at present before the Parliament. The effect of the New South Wales and Victorian legislation is to abolish completely duty on an estate which passes to a surviving spouse. I understand that it is proposed to introduce partial abolition of probate duty in Tasmania from 1 January next. I think that South Australia also has legislation on the way which will do what is being done in New South Wales and Victoria. So we find that the majority of the States are taking action to abolish completely the payment of duty on an estate passing to a surviving spouse. </para>

              <para>-Senator Wriedt mentioned $14m. My impression was that the figure might not be that high. I do not have the figure. The Minister may be able to help. I may have misheard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> but I think $ 14m was the figure he gave. That could be checked, however. I want to say something about the New South Wales legislation because it is a small part of a package deal with regard to a proposed Bill on stamp duties. This Bill establishes the most destructive levels of death duties in Australia. I suppose it could be said that it is the old thimble and pea trick. A great deal has been said about the abolition of death duties as between husband and wife. The tail of the tiger is that this Bill introduces very vicious provisions which will have the effect of increasing the duty in a great number of cases. Since the Bill has been introduced the people of New South Wales have had the opportunity to study it, and they realise the duplicity of the Premier m offering rebates as between spouse and spouse but at the same time imposing vicious duties in other areas. I refer to that legislation in that context to show the difficulties of the dual system which is in operation in the State and Federal sphere in this area. I put it as another argument to the Government that it may well be a telling case for the ultimate abolition of duty in this field. The matter could be returned to the States, but what the States do about it, of course, is their business. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>One side effect which I want to mention in relation to the legislation is, of course, that under the existing Federal Act duty paid in a State is deductible from the duty payable to the Federal Government. Duty is paid to the Federal Government on the balance of the estate after the amount of State duty has been deducted. The effect of that is that when the State duty is completely abolished, the Federal Government will impose the duty which would have been paid under the existing State legislation. That, I suggest, will deprive the dependants of the deceased from making what has been a legitimate deduction in that the full effect of the State legislation cannot be obtained. Because of the operation of the State legislation and the existing Federal legislation these people will actually be paying more in Federal duties, because the State legislation has been liberalised. That is the sort of anomaly which I think requires urgent attention. I am aware, of course, of the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations which investigated this matter and which reported in December 1973. 1 am also aware of the findings of the As prey Committee. </para>
          <para>The abolition of estate duty in Queensland occurred only this year. The other States have taken steps in this area only this year. I suggest that those steps make a radical alteration in the overall picture of the imposition of death duties throughout the States and the Commonwealth. For that reason I take the opportunity of speaking in this debate to bring this anomaly to the notice of the Government so that some steps might be taken to rectify it and to enable the dependants of deceased people in the various States where substantial relief has been given in the imposition of duties as between spouses to obtain the full benefit of the exemptions provided by the State legislation. I commend the Bill to the Senate as a first instalment in the total abolition of estate duty. I trust that the Government will look at the matters I have raised, particularly the recent amelioration by the States in this field, so that the anomalies to which I have alluded can be rectified. </para>

            <para>- As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has stated, the Australian Labor Party is not opposing the Estate Duty Assessment Amendment Bill. Some other minor alterations are provided for in the Bill but its main purpose is to provide substantial exemption from estate duty on an estate passing to a surviving spouse. My own view is that the Government might well have gone further in that respect by abolishing entirely the duty payable on an estate passing to a surviving spouse. I say that not because I disapprove of inheritance taxes- in fact, quite the contrary is the case- but because in fact the levying of duty on an estate passing between spouses is a tax overwhelmingly upon widows. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The arguments that have been advanced on this issue by the Women's Electoral Lobby, amongst other organisations, I have found to be sound and convincing. I hope that in the not too distant future the Government will legislate to grant complete exemption of duty on estates passing between spouses. </para>
          <para>The broader question of estate duty in general, in my view, is a very different matter. To argue for the abolition of duty on estates passing between spouses when in most cases the spouses have jointly contributed to the accumulation of the estate is very different from arguing for the abolition of tax on inherited wealth between generations. A great deal of attention has been paid recently by vested interest groups to this matter. A lot of emotive propaganda has been poured out in an attempt to justify the total abolition of inheritance tax. I note with great regret that in the State of Queensland, which politically is the most reactionary State in Australia- and in that circumstance this is not surprising- that campaign has succeeded. </para>
          <para>In support of this spurious campaign a number of false assertions are either made explicitly or implied. The first is that people should not be taxed when they are dead. The simple and undeniable fact is that probate is not paid by the deceased: Probate is paid by the beneficiaries from the deceased's estate. It is a tax on windfall gains. It would indeed be a curious value judgment or combination of value judgments which argued that taxes ought to be levied on income which is earned but that no tax should be levied on income which accrues from windfall gains from ancestors or some other philanthropic benefactor. Yet that case, although not put in those words but put in spurious and deceptive terms, has been argued successfully and accepted in the State of Queensland. The people who argue for the abolition of probate- the entire abolition of inheritance tax- ought to be forced at all times to stipulate what other taxes they would increase to cover the revenue foregone or what government services they would cancel to offset the loss in revenue pursuant to the abolition of probate. </para>
          <para>In 1974-75 the total collection from inheritance taxes at both the State and Federal levels amounted to $248m. </para>

          <para>What is really needed in the area of inheritance taxes is partly what the Government is doing- a partial abolition of inheritance tax on estates passing between spouses, which I believe should be extended fully to a total abolition; periodic reviews of the rates which are levied, particularly to keep up with changes in general price levels; and reviews in the case of rural properties, or special provision for time to pay, because it is a fact that probate duties can make it extremely difficult to maintain the liquidity of an operating farm. Those things are needed. Apart from those things, what is needed is not the abolition of inheritance taxes or the massive increase in railway freights, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> suggests, or something else that would offset the loss to revenue, but a tightening of the net or a closing of the loopholes which at present allow so many very large estates to evade completely the payment of duty. </para>

              <para>- He has made special arrangements for himself and all his other friends. He has abolished probate duty in Queensland. What we do not need in particular are the sorts of loopholes deliberately reinserted into the law of Western Australia by the Court Government shortly after its election. This was a provision which related to a governing director's share in a company. It was some bogus provision designed to evade probate in particular and possibly also income tax. It enabled a person to hold a nominal $2 share in a company. </para>

          <para>In one particularly interesting case I think 25 002 $2 shares were held. One of those shares was, ironically and oddly enough, held by the Premier of Western Australia in his family company. Yet with that $2 share he was able to exercise complete control over the assets and income of that family company and to appropriate, if he chose to do so, the entire assets and income of that company for himself. Yet, because he had only a $2 share, on his death his beneficiaries would pay probate only on something less than one-thousandth of the assessed value of the assets of that company. The amendments to enable that to be done were deliberately re-inserted in the probate laws of Western Australia 2 years ago by the Court Government. I imagine it is purely coincidental that this provision happens to provide precisely for the sort of business arrangement which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> has worked out for his own family company and, no doubt, for many of his friends. I refer now to the statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> with respect to farming property that investment capital was lost- I think this was the way the argument went- if taxes were levied on the windfall gains accruing from inherited wealth. </para>

              <para>- No, the honourable senator preferred to use some euphemism. I recognise that the people who sit on my left prefer to use some euphemism to describe what are, in fact, windfall gains. I think he said that investment capital was lost in this way. It is a curious argument to put forward. It reminds me of the arguments I once saw put forward in textbooks inflicted upon students of economic history at the University of Western Australia, written by apologists for the crimes, past and present, of the English dominant classes who were trying to justify the Corn Laws. They said that no responsible government in mid-nineteenth century England could have done other than maintain the Corn Laws because half the nation's capital was tied up in land. The really outrageous proposition given that this was written by people who were supposed to be technically competent in this area- was that the capital, the land itself, remained whether the Corn Laws remained or not. The capital was immovable. It could not even be moved out of England. The Corn Laws did not affect the nation's capital; they affected the distribution of wealth in England. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> seems to be endorsing the same sort of patent rubbish this afternoon. He thinks that somehow or other the nation's real productive wealth will be dissipated if the distribution of wealth within a society is changed. The land itself is not destroyed when taxes are imposed on the transfer of ownership between one generation and another. The land is immovable. </para>

          <para>I do not know whether any honourable senator on the other side will speak on this subject. If one does, I dare say we will hear the customary arguments that honourable senators opposite put forward for the abolition of probate or inheritance taxes. If honourable senators on the other side of the chamber do speak, I particularly appeal to them to provide an ethical rationale for imposing taxes upon income which is earned and for not imposing taxes upon windfall capital gains that may be picked up from an ancestor of some other benefactor. Secondly, if they are to put a case for the reduction or abolition of inheritance taxes I ask them to state precisely what other taxes they would increase or introduce, or. what other government services they would curtail, consequential upon the abolition of inheritance taxes for which they may argue. </para>

            <para>- I do not intend to answer any of the points raised by the previous  speaker  because most of them are identifiable as absolute rubbish. I should like to refer to several matters in the Bill and bring them to the attention of the Senate. Firstly, I will add to the general thrust of the remarks of my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan,</inline> and point out that the impact of Federal estate duty laws affects only 1216 per cent of people who die in Australia. I think that firmly reinforces the argument that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> proposed that the position of the Federal Government in exacting this form of taxation ought to be reconsidered. He referred to a Senate committee report in 1973. Some dissenters from the opinion expressed in that report recommended that the Federal Government should vacate the whole field. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish to refer particularly to clause 5 (3) of the Bill which sets out the various exemption levels. The level is $90,000 in the case of an estate passing to a widow or widower. The exemption is reduced where the estate passes to a widow, widower, children or grandchildren of the deceased person. The exemption level in any other case is reduced to $20,000. A situation which may arise in this regard has been raised with me by professional practitioners in this area. It is possible that if a person seeks to provide a small legacy of, say, $500 or $1,000 to a person who is not in the category of a widow or widower his estate might very well be subject to a reduction in the exemption level from $90,000 to $40,000, due to the fact that the whole of the estate is not passing to the widow or widower. I have referred this matter to the Treasury and I am advised that sub-clause (4) will take care of that situation and that the Commissioner has a discretion to relieve that particular problem. This is another example of putting discretion in the hands of officers or public servants rather than setting out the principles in the law. The Department has been kind enough to provide me with a copy of calculations on 3 levels of estate where this situation may arise- estates of $60,000, $ 1 00,000 and $ 1 50,000, where in each case there is a gift of $5,000 to a person who is not regarded as a widow or a widower. Those calculations show that I have no real reason for fear but I seek leave to have them incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

          <para>The only point to which I wish to refer is the general principle of valuation of estates for estate duty purposes. Of course, this also applies to State succession duty. This is a problem that occurs in a great number of cases when estates are artificially valued at particular levels because of the price of shares, for instance, on the stock exchange on a particular day or when valuation of land might be affected by events before the time when payment of the duty becomes due. As is known, in a number of cases there is a great period between the time of actual death and the time at which the assessments are actually issued by the authorities. During that time it is possible that there could be major downward fluctuations in the values of assets but the estate is levied at a rate of duty applicable to the higher value of those assets. This imposes a great deal of hardship in a surprising number of cases. It is something which I believe should be examined, since there is a very real argument that there ought to be some alleviation of duties in cases where this occurs. It has particular relevance where there are small businesses, or businesses of any size for that matter, which include amongst their assets the sorts of liquid items or near liquid items which fluctuate violently in accordance with the known market. Since the Whip has granted me only 5 minutes in this debate, I conclude by saying that I have great pleasure in supporting the Bill. </para>

            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> has already expressed the views of the Opposition on this matter. We do not intend to oppose the amendments. I want to make a couple of points that I think are highly relevant in this day and age. I think we all recall those days when legislation in this area contained terms such as 'husbands', 'estate', 'wives' and responsibility'. I am pleased to see that these amendments refer only to 'spouses'. It was always the situation, by tradition and by statistics, that wives outlived their husbands by something like 6.68 years. They were the ones who had to pay the estate duty on their husband's properties. This sometimes meant that they had to reduce their standard of living purely to accommodate both State and Federal governments in the area of estate and probate duties. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is still some legislation which does not take into consideration the fact that a wife in a marriage is a partner in that marriage. I think immediately of the Commonwealth Superannuation Act which provides that a wife is able to receive only about 75 per cent of the total amount that her husband receives if he is not inconsiderate enough to die before she does. I think the Government would do well to look at that area also. We also have to take into consideration the fact that a great number of people in the community these days do not believe that they have to be married to live in a marriage partnership. Nothing in these amendments caters for the common law spouse. I should like to hear the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton),</inline> in his reply to this debate, state the intention of the Government with respect to common law spouses, whether they be wives or husbands. These people contribute to what they believe is a marriage partnership; they live as married people; and they are entitled to be treated as married people. I think that is a great consideration that has to be taken now; it should not wait until such time as more people are disadvantaged throughout our community. </para>
          <para>I believe that the figure mentioned in the amendments is not realistic. It does not take into consideration the general appreciation of properties over the years to come. The figure will need constant review or there will need to be total abolition of estate duties on properties passing between spouses. The situation at the moment is that there will be relief or exclusion from liability for duty only up to a maximum of $50,000, or in the case of a matrimonial home, as I am given to understand, up to $90,000. This will not always meet the circumstances. One can find a property appreciating very rapidly these days. It is not the fault of the people who purchased that property, quite often at low prices and perhaps in outdated areas. They suddenly find that the whole area in which they live is to be pulled down and new buildings are to be built. They realise that their properties have appreciated suddenly to a much greater value. The other consideration that I think has to be given in relation to these amendments is to those completely dependent children- I talk of them as children only in the sense that they are born to a particular marriage- whom we find frequently in our society, such as a man or a woman, sometimes in middle age, who has devoted his or her entire life to looking after aged and infirm parents. These people suddenly find themselves in middle age with no skills at all. They have to sell the family home to pay probate, estate or succession duties, call them what you will. They suddenly find that they are without a job, without the security of being able to live in the property that was owned by their parents- sometimes the only property that they have ever known- and without the familiar things around them, just to satisfy a government. I should like the Minister's comments on those matters. We support the Bill. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I note that the Opposition does not oppose the measure. I remember an earlier occasion on which I was involved with a group of senators in looking at the whole question of probate and estate duties on a committee headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> We spent some time on this matter. The invest i gat on exposed many of the problems which were referred to here in a very interesting debate. At that time we made a minority report recommending that death duties be abolished in the Commonwealth area. The Government of the day was unable to do that. In Australia there is a general move towards trying to reduce this burden so far as the Commonwealth is concerned. But if all that happens in that process is that the States change their duties so as to gather an increased amount of revenue by default, that will not help the people greatly. There is a great case within the federal system of government for trying to get some rationalisation between governments as to their overall intentions towards people who in effect are dispossessed by death. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I listened with great interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> stating his views on inherited wealth. I could not help thinking about the time when I was very young and talking to my father about this problem of inherited wealth. I said to him: 'Dad, I want to have a serious talk to you. I want you to understand that I am a total disbeliever in inherited wealth; so in no circumstances are you to do anything about leaving me any money'. He said: 'That is a most interesting view, and I am glad to hear it. But you do not have a problem; I do not have any money'. In Australian society there are people who get great benefit out of inherited wealth and there are people who do not get any benefit at all and who start life with nothing and proceed to do their own thing. </para>
          <para>Australia has been characterised by people who began life without very much and have made their own way. One would like to feel that it is what one can do in Australia and, generally and philosophically, that people who have done those sorts of things have some chance to pass the benefits on to those to whom they wish to give them in their own way and without governments unduly complicating the situation. </para>
          <para>A number of points were raised in the debate that I shall endeavour to answer. It may not be possible to cover them all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> said that it was anomalous that State exemptions should result in increased Federal duties. That is the sort of point I was mentioning on my own broad understanding of this matter. The new exemption of $50,000 for estates passing to the surviving spouse, which we are now considering, comes at a time when the States are providing exemptions for estates so passing. The value of the new Federal exemptions to most estates will be greater than the additional Federal duty resulting from the reductions in State duty. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> in interjecting, asked whether many estates of more than $50,000 passed wholly to surviving spouses, in view of the fact that an estate may be subjected to duty a second time within a few years. I am having trouble reading the writing of my adviser. This is interesting. I used to reckon that I was the worst writer in the world, but he is very close to me. Honourable senators will appreciate the problem here: He has to write fast to keep up with everybody. I might say just in passing that there are notable occasions on which I have been asked to read my own writing and I have not been able to read it myself. My staff have asked: 'What are we supposed to do?' This Bill enables estates of up to $90,000 to be left wholly to surviving spouses without fear of estates being taxed twice. The cost of exemptions in a full year will be $ 14m. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline>proposed that the Government should go further and give complete exemption on property passing to the spouse. He also proposed periodic reviews of rates and the provision of time to pay, particularly in the case of rural estates. In this area the Commissioner of Taxation has authority under the existing law to extend the time of payment in any case in which he considers the circumstances warrant it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> referred to the need to counter avoidance of duty by loopholes and company arrangements. I do not think anybody would quarrel with the suggestion that in what has been a highly inflationary society there has been a need to examine this continuously. So much of the problem has been the high inflation rate which in effect changes the situation so fast and so dramatically. Every government, of whatever political flavour, is charged with raising revenues for the purposes of the people. In those areas it is always hoped that we get it as evenly and fairly distributed as possible and those who by one means or another evade the process of paying their share of revenue for the overall purpose are in effect defrauding their fellow citizens. No one quarrels with the view that the Commissioner has a hard job. There ought to be equity and people try to achieve it. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline>spoke about clause 5 dealing with the lodgment of returns for small legacies of $500 of $1,000, not to widows or widowers. Clause 5 relates only to the lodgment of returns, not an entitlement for exemption. This is not a matter for the Commissioner's discretion. All he may do is dispense with the lodgment of returns if he is satisfied that no duty would be payable. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> also referred to problems which arise when the value of assets decline between the date of death and the date of assessment. That certainly is a problem. It is equally true that the reverse applies and that the value of an estate may be greatly enhanced after the time of death. It is a difficult matter on which to get a balanced position. We always hear about the people who are dispossessed but never about the people who are greatly advantaged. This is particularly true at times of share market change. It is a problem of achieving equity between one group and another. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline>talked about the common law spouse. I take her point. I do not think that anything in this legislation has brought this matter forward in any way and the advisers have been asked by me to take it into account when they go back and talk to their department. Estate duty has never recognised anything other than the legal spouse. This is consistent with general taxation law which does not recognise de facto relationships except to the extent that a housekeeper rebate may be allowed for a person having the care of a taxpayer's child under 16. 1 listened carefully to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> and every honourable senator who spoke and I thought that it was a debate of great use and represented the Senate seriously examining problems. In these situations in a world like this there always will be inflationary problems-if we get them fixed it will make life much simpler- and complexities coming out of social relationship changes and they will have to be considered when updating legislation like this. </para>
          <para>I note in closing the debate that the legislation is not opposed. It represents an improvement on the past and one should always seek to achieve this result. The advisers always take into account the comments made in the Senate and these comments are extremely useful when preparing new positions because without doubt the time will come when this law will have to be revised again. I hope very much that it will be in the direction of further relief to taxpayers. </para>

            <para>-This legislation is a further amendment to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation legislation, the Corporation having been constituted in 1974 out of the Export Payments Insurance Corporation. The purpose of that change was to enable the Corporation to engage in the actual financing of overseas transactions which the private sector was not prepared to engage in or which the government of the day felt it was in the national interest to support. The Opposition has some reservations about the legislation because there are some significant changes. In his second reading speech the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> claimed that one of the major reasons for Australian companies being unable to compete overseas was a lack of competitiveness. He alleged that our costs had risen at a greater rate than those of our competitors. That may or may not be the case, and I shall come back to it in a moment, but I want to refer initially to one aspect of his second reading speech where the Minister stated: </para>

            <para>The new arrangements, which the Government announced in July, transfer to the trading banks the responsibility of providing funds for the facility. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The idea of the trading banks financing the operations of the Corporation- that is, its overseas arrangements and not the financing of the Corporation itself- is not new. It has been considered in the past, and I think it is fair to say that some very good advice was given at least to the previous Government that it was not a proper course to follow, that difficulties would arise from the trading banks providing the facility entirely, particularly when it came to the question of interest rates and also what might constitute the national interest, even though I assume- and I am not clear whether the Bill does provide this-that the banks will need to consult with the Government on what constitutes any assistance under the national interest clauses. The Minister went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>They are consistent with our intention of ensuring that initiative and responsibility are, in appropriate cases, restored to the private sector. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">We hear many times in this place about the paranoia of the Opposition in relation to the public sector. That sentence in the Minister's speech illustrates the paranoia of the Government about the private sector. I should have thought, and I am quite certain that I am safe in saying this, that when the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation legislation was enacted in 1974 there was nothing in the legislation which remotely adverted to whether the public sector was better at doing this work than the private sector. If I am wrong I invite the Minister to indicate where I am wrong. At that time, and I assume again this time, negotiations were held with the Bankers' Association. No doubt it put forward proposals on this occasion which the Government may or may not have accepted. I do not know because I do not know what the proposals might have been. Certainly in the time of the Labor Government there were full negotiations with the Bankers' Association on the advantages of alternative methods of financing the Corporation's work. But at no time was there any suggestion that appropriations to finance the Corporation's activity had to come out of the Budget simply because that was the public sector. That would have been a rather dog in the manger attitude to take. The Labor Government did not close the door to the possibility of using finance through the trading banks for the operations of EFIC, but basically the appropriation came from the Budget. In this case we find this paranoia on the part of the Government in saying that we must restore these activities to the private sector as an article of faith. In a moment I shall consider what the effects of that decision might be. The Minister continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government's overriding objective is to attack inflation by substantially reducing the rate of growth of Government spending. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One wonders what is the intention of the Government in transferring this financing over to the trading banks. Is it because it has this paranoia about the public sector or is it because the Government is reducing expenditure in its alleged attack on inflation? Perhaps the Minister could clarify for the Senate what in fact is the intention of the Government. The speech continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Under the new arrangements, the banks will provide loan funds to EFIC at the commercial rates of interest applicable to this category of business. The Government, for us part, will provide an interest rate subsidy which will enable EFIC to on-lend these funds on internationally competitive terms. The savings in the 1976-77 Budget are estimated at some $20m. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That gets to the heart of what the Government is doing and we must consider how it will affect the competitive position of Australia in certain parts of the world. It is quite true that other countries operate a similar sort of assistance scheme for export credits. In fact, virtually all the major exporting countries do this. In a moment, I shall seek to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table on the current costs of funds to buyers for long term export credits in a number of countries. We have to be sure that under this new arrangement the Government will not reduce the competitive position of Australia. To claim that our competitive position has been eroded simply because of increases in costs and inflation in this country does not sound a very convincing argument when one considers that a country like Britain, which has had a higher inflation rate than ours and has a cost structure which is increasing as quickly as ours, is still more competitive in certain parts of the world than we are. The reason, of course, is that the British Government has a similar body to the Australian corporation which makes it more attractive for export payments to be made. We ought to consider that this applies particularly in the Middle East and in other areas where we would normally expect to be able to hold a market. </para>
          <para>Under the old arrangements the Corporation obtained long term funds from the Government at <inline font-style="italic">7lA</inline> per cent and these were blended with trading bank finance. As I mentioned earlier, the previous legislation was designed not to rely entirely on the trading banks but to minimise reliance on the trading banks. The rates of interest which applied then as a result of what is known as the blend to the 2 rates, which is referred to in the Minister's second reading speech, meant that the on-lending rate would have been somewhere between <inline font-style="italic">9Vt</inline> per cent and 10 per cent, which to some extent depended on individual cases. Under the present arrangements, the Government is to make available a certain sum of money only for the purpose of subsidising the interest rate. The actual amount of the subsidy to which the Government commits itself under the legislation is not apparent to me. It may be con tamed in the Bill but I understand it is in the area of $500,000. That presumably, would be about right because the Minister said in his second reading speech that the saving to revenue this year would be of the order of $20m. That means- I ask the Minister to give some thought to this matter and to guide me on it when he replies- that the subsidy must be sufficient to enable our competitiveness to be maintained against that of these other countries. </para>
          <para>The current overdraft ra'es for sums over $100,000 are about 1 It per cent. The long term bond rate is around 9.8 per cent. So, presumably, the Corporation could not obtain funds through the private banks at a rate less than 9.8 per cent. Even though it is a statutory authority, I would assume that to be the case. Therefore it would seem that the lowest rate at which these funds could be on-lent by the Corporation would be somewhere in the area of 10 1/2 per cent to 1 1 per cent. We also know that the statutory reserve deposits have been held fairly tightly by the Reserve Bank. This must affect the liquidity of those banks. I ask the Minister to state to what extent the Government believes that the private banking sector will be able to maintain the flow of money which the Corporation will need for what will be very large sums involving, I would assume, an amount in excess of $ 100m over 12 months. </para>
          <para>The key point is that if my assumptions are correct the rate at which the Corporation now will be able to compete on the world market will be, as I have indicated, in the area of <inline font-style="italic">\Wi</inline> per cent to 1 1 per cent I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table which is headed 'Cost of funds to buyer for long term export credits', and which shows the percentage rate per annum.

              <para>- The document shows the rates being charged for December 1975 and June 1976 in several countries, namely, Canada, France Germany, Italy, Japan, the United Kingdom and the United States. In all cases except for Italy the rates at June 1976 are lower- in some cases by up to 2 per cent- than the rate which I have indicated seems to be the minimum rate at which moneys will be available to the Corporation. I ask the Minister. Can he confirm or indicate that the Government either is happy that the private banks will be able to make loan moneys available at a competitive interest rate or, alternatively, that the Government will undertake to subsidise those interest rates so that they will not be greater than the interest rates being charged by the other major exporting nations? If the Government cannot give that undertaking, obviously our competitive position will be worse than that of the other nations, and as far as I know, would be worse for the first time in the operations of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation. So it has become very important that we understand the implications of the legislation. In determining a position of opposition to or support of the legislation it is extremely difficult for an Opposition party, not having this information from the Treasury and the Reserve Bank available to it, to make a fully informed judgment. I have raised these matters in order that the Minister can give us some precise answers. </para>

            <para>Our talks with the banks were both positive and constructive. They resulted in their agreement to provide up to $100m to support new export finance business undertaken by EFIC, in addition to financing some $50m of existing EFIC commitments. </para>

            <para>Indeed, since their implementation, EFIC has been able to offer financial support in respect of tender bids amounting to some $ 120m. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I ask the Minister to indicate, if he can, the date from which he is referring when he speaks of bids amounting to some $120m because his second reading speech does not make that clear. I realise that these matters cannot be shown to be exactly watertight. Nevertheless the Government ought to be able to give us something fairly definitive as to how these rates finally will finish up in comparison with those of our major competitors. Looking at a difference in the interest rate of only 2 per cent on a loan of $lm there is an additional cost involved to the exporter of around $20,000 a year, which is a very significant amount and which the exporter obviously would have to weigh heavily in his competition with any other overseas country. </para>
          <para>That largely covers the points that I wish to make, which I believe are central to the legislation. I do, however, refer to one other matter which I raise at this stage rather than in the Committee stage in order to allow the Minister time to consider it. It is on the competitive position. I ask the Minister Is it envisaged that the funds which will be provided for the Corporation's work will come wholly from the trading bank sector? What will be the position if the Corporation comes to the Government in relation to, for example, the establishment of or the giving of assistance to a particular project in a developing country, which is the normal case, and says: 'Here is a matter which involves the national interest and the private banks are saying that, despite the guarantee arrangements that the Government might provide, it is not in their interest to provide money for this project'? If that is the case, is the Government going to forgo what it believes to be a project in the national interest or is it going to come good with the money from its own appropriation in order to ensure that the project goes ahead? </para>

            <para>- in reply- I have noted from reading <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that the Opposition did not oppose the measure in the House of Representatives; indeed, it supported its passage. The purpose of the Bill is to give legislative effect to the Government's decision to alter the funding arrangements applicable to the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation's export financing facility and to transfer the source of those funds from the Budget to the trading banks. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline>made some comments about this matter. I think I should reply to those comments by saying that one thing that characterised the period in office of his Government was the immense and excessive strain that was placed upon the available resources as against the capacity to supply those resources. I believe that the progressive increase in the demand position and the progressive concentration of that demand in the public sector contributed markedly to throwing the Australian economy well off balance. There seemed to us to be no sense in continuing that approach. Accordingly, one of the things that we set out to do when we returned to office was to restore the traditional balance between the demand positions in both the public and the private sector and, at the same time, to try to bring the total resource demand back into balance with the availability of the Australian position to supply that demand. That is the question of resource reallocation which, in our view, restores a better and more sensible balance. </para>
          <para>Under these new arrangements the trading banks will lend to EFIC, over the next two to three years, up to $150m on the commercial terms normally applicable to this type of business. EFIC in turn will on-lend those funds in support of Australian capital goods exports on internationally competitive terms. The Government will provide an interest rate subsidy to make up the difference between EFIC's borrowing rate of 1 1 to 11 /2 per cent and the rate at which it will on-lend the funds, namely, <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> to 9 per cent. As I said, the measure was taken as part of our overall effort to restrain the growth in public sector expenditures and to return to the private sector those functions which we believe are better carried out there. </para>
          <para>The adoption of the new arrangements followed detailed discussion with the trading banks. They were positive, constructive and helpful in the consideration of the whole matter. The new arrangements have led to a sizable growth in the level of funds available to support capital goods exports. At the same time they have achieved significant Budget savings, which will amount to some $20m in 1976-77. Consistent with the arrangements, the Government also has decided to amend the national interest provisions of the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation Act to enable the Minister to guarantee the repayment of loan moneys advanced by EFIC in certain high risk transactions when that is judged to be in the national interest This replaces the previous arrangement, which required the Government actually to advance the necessary funds to EFIC from the Budget. To us, the new arrangement seems more sensible. The opportunity also has been taken to make several amendments to the Act in regard to superannuation and terms and conditions of employment of EFIC staff. </para>
          <para>I think it is worth commenting that February 1973 saw the legislation introduced by the previous Government, which I think at the time received my commendation. Great interest has been shown in it by Australian capital goods exporters. Up to 20 October 1976 EFIC has been able to offer financial support in respect of tenders amounting to $232m and involving loans of $187m. </para>

Verbal acceptance has been received of further tenders amounting to some $45m and involving loans of $34m. There are still tenders outstanding amounting to $140m. The government control over the commitments into which EFIC may enter is exercised by way of subsidy commitment authority which limits the total amount of interest rate subsidy that may be committed in any one year. The interest rate subsidy commitment has been set at $ 15m for 1976-77, which will enable EFIC to sign up loans of approximately $75m during that period. </para>

            <item label=".">
              <para>. we cannot lose sight of the fact that the success of our exporters in this field will depend very much on basic competitiveness as regards price, quality and delivery. The facility will certainly enable our exporters to match the credit terms being offered by their competitors.

            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">One might say once again that at the root of this whole problem is the overall position of costs. Any student of this matter can compare Australia's relative cost position at the end of 1975 with what it was at the end of 1970 and 1972. There has been a severe deterioration. It is hoped that some part of that will be restored by devaluation. Over 5 years there has been a rapid change in our competitive cost situation. This has had a marked effect on our ability to gain business overseas. Nonetheless, I am quite sure that when this measure was introduced it would have been welcomed. It was a useful expansion of our ability to help exporters, particularly in the capital goods area. We thought at the time that it had merit. I think the legislation with which we are now dealing has equal merit. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline>referred to various items. I will answer his queries, but first let me make one other comment. Very long lead times are involved, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> I am quite sure knows very well, in negotiations on capital goods transactions. Such negotiations sometimes take a very long time to come to fruition. That is something which, with his experience, he would understand. He referred to the second reading speech and mentioned that the reason for the export finance facility being established was to overcome the problem of Australian exporters' costs being cut out of line with those of overseas competitors. I do not really think that was the reason for establishing the facility. Maybe exporters' financing costs were a consideration, but their basic costs were not. </para>
          <para>The Corporation's finance facility is designed to produce export finance which is competitive with finance available to overseas competitors. The competitiveness of the tenders in respect of particular contracts is a responsibility of the exporter, not of EFIC. Of course there is an overall responsibility on a nation of people, who are large traders, who live in a world that is competitive and who have to continue to live in that world, to look increasingly to exporting many of their products and increasingly to exporting capital goods that they have a particular facility in manufacturing. There is an overall problem of the basic cost to make and sell. That contains a great number of factors. We are dealing here with the competitive position only in regard to the finance capacity offered by government and public underwriting in the total government and banking situation. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline>also referred to the transfer of the source of funds to the private sector. I mentioned some part of that. I now make some extra comments regarding it. Prior to the establishment of the export finance facility all export finance for this area, of course, was drawn from the trading banks anyway, because nothing like this capital goods facility existed. Whilst originally the export finance facility drew its funds from the Budget, the banks always indicated a willingness to provide these funds. This is something that I know because I was contacted about it when we were in Opposition. Given the Government's desire to get a proper allocation of resources and to get the Budget deficit back into balance, the Government felt it appropriate, and it was part of its overall strategy, to allow the banks, the market place financial no uses, to take over this function. The saving in the 1976-77 Budget is $20m, as I have mentioned. </para>
          <para>We talk about the cost of finance. Interest rates offered by EFIC range between  8W  per cent and 9 per cent. That compares favourably, I am informed, with the international rates quoted for this type of business. As to the cost of funds borrowed by EFIC from the banks, EFIC borrows at between 11 per cent and lite per cent. The difference between EFIC's borrowing rate and its lending rate is made up by way of subsidy payable from the Budget. It is not really a question of domestic rates charged to normal borrowers; rather the banks have agreed to make funds available at special rates which reflect the A rate standing of EFIC as an institution. EFIC's lending rate is designed to match but not to lead overseas countries' rates. The amount committed by the banks to EFIC is $150m for the time being. The banks will review their position, as the amount becomes committed, in the light of the overall position. As discussions have taken place to establish this, discussions will continue on the basis of any necessary extra demand or change. </para>
          <para>As to the volume of business done by EFIC under the new arrangements, since July 1976 EFIC has offered financial support for tenders amounting to $120m. Success in tenders supported amounts to some $ 150m. We are optimistic of obtaining, on the figures for projects still offered on tender, another $20m. So it has been a substantially useful exercise. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> spoke of the source of national interest funds. This is again the trading banks, but with a government guarantee that the advances or funds will be repaid. It is fair to observe that, should the banks' commitment of $150m become exhausted and the banks be unable to inject additional funds, and should additional funds be clearly shown to be sensibly and usefully required, it is still open to the Government to inject additional funds should it feel this to be desirable and appropriate or equally to engage in discussions with the trading banks and the Reserve Bank in an endeavour to solve the problem. </para>
          <para>The reality is that this is a good facility. It is sensibly being expanded. If the demand for it continues to exist, it is to Australia 's advantage to support that demand because it adds to our capacity to export products, particularly in areas where we are developing special skills in the way of selling manufactured goods. There have been some notable examples of Australian success in this field, and I hope that we will see more and more of them. The sugar cane harvester of Toft Brothers Industries Ltd is one case in point. I have the view, and this relates particularly to my own area, that Australia ought to be looking more and more to becoming an exporter of machinery that is manufactured in Australia for special purpose Australian needs and demands such as agricultural machinery and specialist mining machinery. In the areas in which we have immense raw materials to convert, the specialist application, the machinery technology to that, ought to have a world market as well as an Australian market and in that area I think this facility is useful. I am glad it has been started and I commend to the Senate its continuation in the form proposed. </para>

            <para>- I wish to pursue with the Minister the question of interest rates. I indicated when I spoke earlier that there is a significant shift now in the approach of this Government towards the previous legislation. Notwithstanding the fact, as the Minister has said, that in the event of the banks finding after some time that they have insufficient money to provide to the Corporation the position could be reviewed. Obviously it would be. But I notice there is no commitment of course at this stage for the Government to find any additional finance that might be needed. As I said earlier, we might be talking about very large sums of money. It is said- and I repeat- in the second reading speech: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government's overriding objective is to attack inflation by substantially reducing the rate of growth of Government spending. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This Government is holding rigidly to that position. That is its business. I am not going to argue about that in this debate, but it is obviously committed not to spend any more money, not a cent more than it can absolutely avoid. This is the sort of bind into which the Government could well get itself because of the changes that are being made in this legislation. </para>
          <para>I am not clear as to the amounts to which EFIC is committed. The Minister gave a lot of information but I could not get it all down. As the second reading speech says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Indeed, since their implementation, EFIC has been able to offer financial support in respect of tender bids amounting to some $ 120m. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let us assume that there could be a commitment I think the Minister mentioned this figure- of $ 150m over an 18-month period. How do we compensate or subsidise as interest rates for a figure of $500,000? It would seem to me that the Government is talking in terms of a differential of about 3 per cent. Obviously on a figure of $150m it is dealing with a figure of about $4.5m. There is an alternative to that. This is where the Minister's figures interest me. The Minister referred to the interest rates of banks being 8 1/4 per cent to 9 per cent. I ask the Minister: Is that some special arrangement that has been entered into between the banks and the Corporation? If those figures are correct they are obviously well below the normal commercial lending rates at the present time. If they are, there should be an explanation because I am sure that there is a host of other organisations in Australia both in the public and private sectors that would like to know why the private banks would be prepared to make loans available at a concessional interest rate. There may be some special provision in the Act of which I am not aware which justifies that, but I would certainly like the Minister to give me a clear answer to it. </para>

            <para>- Perhaps it would be helpful if I reiterated what I said. With regard to the cost of finance, interest rates offered by EFIC to the borrowers from EFIC range between  8%  per cent and 9 per cent. Those rates compare favourably with the international rates that are quoted for that type of business. On the other hand, as to the cost of funds borrowed by EFIC from the banks, EFIC borrows as a borrower in its own house at between 1 1 per cent and 1 1.5 per cent. There is of course a difference between EFIC's borrowing rate and its lending rate. This is made up by way of subsidy payable from the Budget and of course clearly identified and examinable in the Senate at the time of Estimates Committee examinations. That is the differential and that I think explains to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> what is the matter of his concern which I, of course, understand. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Equally <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> made some comments about the Government's pre-occupation with attacking inflation but I think he did not draw the logical conclusion from that, that if the Government succeeds with the help of the community in attacking inflation and bringing it down, correspondingly interest rates will decline with it and there is a compensating obvious balance. Equally if the community and the Government between them and the Parliament are not successful in attacking inflation and inflation continues to go up, the interest rate pressures will continue to be in the system and that will be very disadvantageous to Australia and all Australians but none more so than to those trying to export. Probably amongst the worst off will be the exporters of capital goods. </para>

              <para>asked: Should the banks have no further funds available for EFIC, will the Government commit itself to inject new funds? That is clearly a matter for consideration at the time. The party which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> supports began this measure. This Government is carrying it on. The only basic difference is that we believe the market ought to provide the funds rather than the Budget and the difference between the costs of the market and the actual situation of on lending should be a subsidy identifiable in terms of the Budget as an overall community disadvantage paid for by the whole community. The banks on the other hand have clearly indicated that they will look again at the figures and we certainly will as a government. The Senate may be sure of that. It is to our natural advantage and to the advantage of everybody that if this business of capital exports can grow it is to Australia's advantage and to the Government's advantage to continue to finance it sensibly. </para>

          <para>On offerings by EFIC the figures quoted in the second reading speech related up to 20 October. The later figures relate to the present only. Here is an area of some interest, I think. When I read out the figures from the general briefing notes and other figures that were available in the second reading speech I thought this was an area where it might be useful to have the thing clearly defined by letter later on just to bring it more up to date. I undertake to do that. </para>
          <para>I think the Department of Overseas Trade would be equally happy to make further information available and anybody in the department would be happy to come and talk to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> or any group of his colleagues, or indeed supporters on our side, and to provide further information they may like to have. I think one ought to look at the basic situation which is a change in the method of the same thing and the logical national interest in continuing to support a facility which can add to Australia's export income particularly in the capital goods area, and the willingness as a community to pick up the burden of the difference in cost for the Australian people who have to get that finance as against the price they can in effect get for then finance in world competitive situations for the finance facility. </para>

            <para>- I thank the Minister for that clarification. I will not delay the Senate. I just point out to him that I have now got those figures clearly. The rates offered by the Export Finance and Insurance Corporation as I understand it are now  8V4  per cent to 9 per cent and the rates charged by the banks to EFIC would be 1 1 per cent to lite per cent. So we have a differential of about 3 per cent. In the reply that the Minister intends to give me by letter to some of the other points I ask him to consider that differential on the total sums to which he has referred. I just cannot see arithmetically where the Government could possibly anticipate a commitment of $500,000 in a full financial year. It would just have to be more than that and I suggest very much more. So I believe that point ought to be explained and I would appreciate it if he could do that by letter if need be. </para>

I think what is necessary is to run the figures out perhaps a bit more precisely over a longer period of time, take them back a little and try to get some clear definition in it because I move to the position that a Senate will in due course through a Senate Committee be looking at a sum of money which is a subsidy in the Budget for interest rate differential. The members of that Committee will be wanting to know how it is made up and therefore anything that we can do to clear their minds and all of our minds in that regard would be useful, and that will be done. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition does not intend to oppose the States Grants (Fruit-growing Reconstruction) Bill 1976 which is before the Senate. The Bill seeks to extend the fruit growing reconstruction scheme until 31 December. So those fruit growers who wish to take advantage of the scheme have 29 days in which to lodge their applications for the consideration of the authorities. Payments will be made to 30 June 1977. The legislation arises as a result of specific applications made by the governments of Victoria and South Australia for additional funds. The purpose of the legislation is to provide an additional $ 1 m to assist in the removal of canning fruit trees in those 2 States. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in discussions with the Premiers of those 2 States accepted the proposal because he became aware of the very severe over supply position that exists in the canning fruit industry in those States. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition wants to draw the attention of the Senate to the very parlous state and the very difficult conditions that the industry continues to face. In terms of the overall agricultural scene in Australia the industry is regarded, I suppose, as one of the smaller areas. Nevertheless, there are some 37 000 horticulturists involved in the fruit and vegetable industry in this country, and they do contribute something like $500m annually to the nation's income. So the need to maintain this industry does not need to be stressed either by the Opposition or by the Government. It has become apparent for quite some time that the industry has reached a certain critical point. In fact, the Australian Canning Fruit Growers Association held its 51st annual conference just a month ago in Shepparton, Victoria. The report of that conference sets out the extent to which canning fruit tree removals have taken place since 1971. It is quite revealing to find that, on the basis of 250 trees to the hectare, some 7702 hectares of peach trees have been pulled, for which assistance has been granted under the scheme. Some 5696 hectares of pear trees and 1889 hectares of apricot trees have also been removed. So obviously the scheme has been operating for a considerable period. Despite that fact we are still in an over supply situation, which arises primarily because of the collapse of overseas markets in an industry which is geared now, I suppose, primarily for the domestic market. </para>
          <para>In those circumstances, we support the Bill because we believe it is correct that the Australian Government, being responsible for exports, should take financial responsibility for its constitutional responsibility in relation to this matter. For that matter, any collapse of markets which would affect the economic wellbeing of people is the responsibility of the Government in the social security area. </para>
          <para>The rural reconstruction schemes are designed to attempt to align Australian rural industries and Australian rural production with the markets available. As most of the crises in agricultural industries arise from loss of export markets, it has become more and more imperative that the Australian Government give financial support to the States in meeting that responsibility. I think we are entitled to say that the new federalism policy must not be used as a means of passing on increased financial responsibility to the States for rural reconstruction. That point has been made not only by State government Ministers of my political persuasion but also by all of the Premiers at various meetings of the Australian Agricultural Council. They have said that the export component is now the critical part of agricultural production. In those circumstances it should not be the financial responsibility of the States to finance rural reconstruction, because the export component is a national component and a national responsibility. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government has not provided for the fruit growing industry any sort of long term plan for recovery. As one reads reports from the various sectors of our fruit growing industry it becomes clear that there are a lot of misgivings about the future of the industry. When one reads the Industries Assistance Commission report one can understand the reasons why there is growing concern about the future of the industry, having regard to the international market position. It is regretted therefore- I think we are entitled to make this comment- that the interim initiatives which the Labor Government began and which this Government has continued are to be regarded only as interim in it at ives. The direction of the industry after the expiration of the 1976 scheme which we are discussing has not yet been determined. Surely we are entitled to say to the Government that it has had a year in which to look at the nature of the problem and to accept the IAC recommendations, or amend them or reject them; but certainly it should come up with a plan for some stability m this important industry. </para>
          <para>The extent of the contraction of the industry which this legislation is designed to accommodate will be determined at a later date. There is no certainty that the market conditions for fruit will improve next year. If we could be assured that the market position internationally would improve then we could probably regard this as an interim measure. However, all of the forecasts, all of the estimates, indicate that we have reached that point in the fruit growing industry in Australia where the overseas position does not look as though it is going to afford any relief to the industry. It may well be that further funds will be necessary to accelerate reconstruction under this scheme next year. Members of the Government parties who have had any connection with the industry must surely agree with me when I say that a very critical situation exists in some of our fruit growing regions in Australia. </para>
          <para>Tasmania, for example,, which is export oriented, receives 40 per cent to 60 per cent of its annual income, depending upon the income for a particular year, from agriculture. So that sector of agriculture contributes almost half of the </para>
          <para class="block">State's income. A similar situation applies in Western Australia and Victoria where the export component is a very important part of the industry's survival syndrome. There is no certainty that the market situation can be expected to improve, notwithstanding the mammoth devaluation of <inline font-style="italic">\1Vi</inline> per cent. Those in the rural community who believe that devaluation is the panacea, that it will be the miracle that will bring about stability in agriculture, look for simple solutions and seek to ignore the principal factor so far as this sector of agriculture is concerned. It is not the price of the article but the access to the markets that represents the threat to the industry. In fact, if we were to give the fruit away we would not solve the problem because it is the trade barriers and the protection policies that are being pursued in our former markets overseas that are denying us access. It is not the cost of the article. So I am afraid that little relief for this industry will arise out of devaluation. </para>
          <para>I think, though, that there might be a glimmer of hope for the canning industry if the Government exercises its powers to restrict imports from overseas countries. There is no doubt that imports will now rise as a result of devaluation. I have asked the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> on several occasions, as he well knows- I have had such a request from Western Australia in the last few days- that the Government take some steps to restrict the import of canned fruit and vegetables from overseas. It may well be that the mechanism can now be applied more judiciously and expeditiously in order to give a little bit of relief to our own canned fruit industry. </para>
          <para>Additional freight charges have to be considered. It seems to me that they would operate to reduce the benefits that the reduction in the value of the Australian dollar achieves in spite of the price of our exports and in addition to the access of the markets to which I was referring. Clearly overseas markets are closed or restricted for reasons other than the price of the goods. As we have said so many times, the European Common Market has had a tremendous effect upon many sectors of our agricultural economy. The restriction of access of our beef, for example, to the United States, Japan, Taiwan, the Philippines and Canada is a more recent example of the fact that it is not so much the price factor that affects us as the decision made domestically within other countries to protect their own domestic production. I digress for a moment to refer to beef. We have had questions and discussion and public comment about the dumping of beef on the United States market. I think that indicates to us that it has not been the price that has been the consideration. </para>
          <para>The tragedy of our rural reconstruction scheme which we are considering is that whilst it adequately rationalises the market forces operating and logically comes to the conclusion that there must be a tailoring of production to stabilise markets, it does not provide many options for fruit growers who decide to avail themselves of the scheme. It is incumbent, I believe, therefore that any scheme of this sort which is put into operation be oriented more towards people. By this I mean more than the distinction often applied by the Industries Assistance Commission between 'product oriented ' and 'people oriented '. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to ally myself with the general criticism that has been applied to the IAC, but I believe it ought to put a little more stress on the needs of people. I am obliged to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> for the interjection he made when we were debating some of these matters in the autumn session. He said that we have to have some regard for the local people involved in a particular industry. The more I have looked at this, the more I have come to the conclusion that we have to look at the social consequences as well as the economic consequences in rural reconstruction. If we apply only the criterion of efficiency, we will do so at the expense of the human factor. Whilst it cannot be denied that the IAC is correct in condemning product-based assistance in a situation where over-production is the problem, this should not be interpreted as being against product-based assistance where lack of production is the problem. It is also true that schemes designed to assist people, such as the tree pull scheme, are infinitely better than product-based assistance and are to be applauded. Those Government members who from time to time have criticised the Labor Government's initiative in this area ought to reexamine their attitude as to whether we were more concerned with taking away the bounties and subsidies that were related to the product and to production. </para>
          <para>However, criticism of the latter approach is not in regard to the direction it took but that it did not go far enough. If there is to be people oriented assistance- I am sure all honourable senators would agree with that emphasis- I believe the options made available to people who decide to leave the industry should be made clear and, where possible, increased. We must seek, therefore, to pay greater regard to the human factor in our consideration of these matters. Quite plainly, if people are to be restructured out of this industry, they want to know where to go, what is to be their future, what their opportunities are and what options are available to them. I would not like to be in a position of trying to advise fruit growers where their economic future is in this country. I certainly would not want to put them into the boot industry, or the textile industry or the shipbuilding industry, or the motor car industry. I certainly would not want to put any of them into the beef industry. It seems to me that a lot more thought needs to be given to those people who will be seeking to leave the industry, so that they will have some meaningful part to play in the whole of the social and economic life of our country. So for the assistance to be truly people oriented, it must continue to the point where people are placed in a viable alternative means of earning a living, and earning a living that has some purpose for them. </para>
          <para>The acute problems of certain fruit growing areas highlight the need to tailor assistance programs to prevent the very social fabric of those areas from collapsing. That is happening in some of our fruit growing regions. The social fabric, the rural infrastructure, is at risk. These are matters which surely must concern not only those of us in the Parliament but the community generally. Certainly those in the rural communities who see families leaving districts and who see families leaving a particular industry must be concerned with the effects that that decline has upon the hopes and aspirations of the people within that particular region. On 12 August a sub-committee of Government members dealt with horticultural matters. Growers representatives attended that meeting here in Parliament House at the beginning of this session, and it was clear that there was a need for a greater understanding and for more initiatives to be taken by the authorities. Growers representatives made the point on that occasion that, from the canning point of view, they needed some government assistance in regard to imports coming to Australia. </para>
          <para>To rely solely on the market place as a means of determining whether an industry is to be viable in a certain area is to sign a death warrant for certain rural districts. I think the IAC has expressed this concept in a somewhat different way. In its examination of rural problems, it stated: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">More and more producers, as well as consumers, are totally disenchanted with the operation of the market system, or with the market place for that matter, which neither gives an adequate return to producers nor distributes at a reasonable price to consumers. It is crazy that growers are being subsidised to pull out fruit growing trees; yet simultaneously because of high prices fruit is not available to those very sectors of the Australian community most in need. I refer to those on lower incomes, pensioners, large families and others who are not able to buy the quantity of fruit that otherwise would be available. I believe that domestic sales are sluggish around the 3 million basic carton level, partly because there is a consumer resistance to the price tag on apples and pears. I remember, when returning from a visit to some of the fruit growing areas during the last winter recess, drawing my family's attention to the fact that farmers were not even bothering to remove the fruit from the trees when families were paying 10c, 12c or 14c each for apples and pears. It is crazy that it does not pay the grower to pick his apples; yet in the market place there is a buyer resistance based on the price. I am sure that if fruit were cheaper there would be at least some benefit to the producer because there would be more consumption in the Australian community. </para>
          <para>The Opposition supports the Bill but cannot ignore the fact that it runs contrary to the apple and pear stabilisation scheme which is production based and therefore encourages production by guaranteeing a payment of $2 a bushel. It is interesting to see in one of the reports that in the last year there was a drop of approximately 30 per cent in the number of cases of apples and pears exported. We require an integrated strategy and a policy which does not contradict itself. Unfortunately, there is no such co-ordinated policy in the fruit growing industry. The Government has made no effort to initiate a co-ordinated policy for the fruit growing industry which will place the industry on the road to a stable recovery. The lack of co-ordination at the national level is illustrated by the Government's contradictory policy thrusts. </para>
          <para>We should be examining the distribution and transportation costs in respect of the fruit growing industry. I have been able to see only one set of figures that would help us in this direction. I have no criticism to make of the Government's freight equalisation scheme which is being applied to Tasmania and which undoubtedly will assist Tasmanian fruit growers in gaining competitive access to the mainland domestic market. This has been introduced to help the Tasmanian fruit industry. If one listens to the comments being made by the fruit growers and fruit grower organisations in Queensland, Victoria and New South Wales, particularly in Queensland and </para>
          <para class="block">New South Wales, one can appreciate the concern that is being expressed by these organisations. If there is to be a utilisation of this subsidy scheme, it will affect the domestic marketing of those who hitherto have had complete access to the domestic market for their products. I am advised that growers in Tasmania are taking advantage of the freight equalisation scheme in order to sell their products on the mainland market. I will make no comment upon their desirability to do so. </para>

              <para>- It may well wreck the mainland market, as the honourable senator said. I am sure that as a Queensland senator he probably has received representations, as I have, about this very problem. In the northern and southern parts of Tasmania there is a substantial degree of subsidisation. On fruit carried in refrigerated containers the subsidy is $20 per cubic metre for fruit to go to Victoria, $25 for fruit to go to South Australia and Western Australia, and $28 for fruit to go to all the other States. For refrigerated containers the subsidy is $ 1 4 per cubic metre for fruit going to Victoria, $20 for fruit going to South Australia and Western Australia, and $24 for fruit going to the other States. I think this highlights the need for a rational policy. Whilst we should not be seeking to deny the Tasmanian growers some stability in their production and distribution, it must not be done in a way which completely destroys the marketing ability and stability of the growers in the mainland areas. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator says that it is nonsense. It is a question of how the scheme is applied. If it means an unlimited dumping of fruit, then of course problems will be created. If a rational approach is made so that both sectors- the domestic market and the export oriented market- are given access to the markets in the mainland States, there may be a share for all. I am referring to the representations made to me by the mainland fruit growers. If honourable senators opposite say that that is nonsense, I will let the fruit growers know that that is the way they approach the problem. It is the responsibility of the organisations and the Government to find an equitable alternative solution which will not entail the setting of one sector of the industry against another. That is what is developing. Uniform State legislation, particularly in the area of marketing, could prevent the conflicts between States which will take place if there is no understanding. </para>

          <para>This applies even to the dairy industry. If the Victorian milk producers gain access to the market in New South Wales or Queensland, I can assure the Senate that the New South Wales Government will show that it is able to talk just as loudly as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> talks about protecting his domestic situation. It is a matter of rationalising the distribution in such a way that nobody has absolute access and an advantage over anybody else. I am assured that movements are taking place which affect the particular areas to which I have referred. This legislation specifically seeks to give assistance to the Victorian and South Australian governments on the basis of the problem that exists in those States. </para>

            <para>- It is to be hoped that the Government will endeavour to plan on a national basis and on a constructive basis, and not take the easy way out by adopting <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc,</inline> piecemeal, social welfare measures which only facilitate fruit growers leaving the industry after they have lost their war against poverty without offering them an alternative other than to join the ranks of the unemployed in the outer metropolitan areas of our capital cities. The continued loss of people from rural districts and towns has been occurring for more than a quarter of a century. When the Labor Government was in office it identified the problem and attempted, through its decentralisation and regional development programs, to prevent this from happening. We believe that is a matter which would devalue the quality of life and is against the best interests of both the rural folk and the urban folk. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have indicated that the very fabric of society in many fruit growing districts is now threatened by depressed market situations and by adoption of a tree pull scheme without assessment, and ultimately determination, of what happens to the people forced to leave the area and the effects, other than economic, on those remaining. That has to be taken into consideration in reconstruction schemes. The Industries Assistance Commission has recommended the setting up of area redevelopment authorities in apple and pear growing regions of the south-west of Western Australia, southern Tasmania and the Stanthorpe region of Queensland, and that feasibility studies be carried out to determine the nature and extent of these authorities. It is clear that special problems of certain areas need specialised solutions. This Government's whole philosophical position is to allow the market place to determine the demise of these districts and largely to ignore the poverty problems involved. For many fruit-growers in these districts there is no payment for an honest day's work for reasons which are totally outside of their control. Of course, the Henderson poverty report refers to the fact that it is in the fruit growing areas where the greatest poverty exists in the non-urban regions of Australia. It is unconscionable for governments to stand by and take the easy way out by giving piecemeal assistance from time to time. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the States Grants (Fruit-growing Reconstruction) Bill which extends the existing scheme of assistance to fruit-growers which commenced in July 1972. The scheme is now extended by the terms of this Bill to the end of December 1976 and provides a further sum of $lm to assist in further tree removal. Before proceeding to deal with the real purpose of the Bill I want to deal briefly with a couple of points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> who spoke before me. I think he had been speaking for 25 minutes before he came to the real purpose of this Bill. He stated that the purpose of it was to assist the canning fruit-growers, as distinct from fresh fruit-growers, in Victoria. That is the prime purpose of the Bill. </para>

          <para>The legislation provides 2 forms of assistance. One is the clear fell, an agricultural term which means that the whole of a grower's orchard is removed and he can then retire from the industry. The second is a partial tree pull where part only of the orchard is removed and what is left will allow the farmer, the orchardist, to have the capacity to produce his share of what is now a very reduced market. I think it is worth stating that to qualify for the assistance, the recipient is required, whether it be partial or full tree pull, to enter into a mortgage agreement with the appropriate authority- in Victoria, the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission- that he will not replant the particular variety of fruit tree for a period of 5 years after the trees have been removed. Of course this ensures observance of the covenant. In practice, this creates no real difficulty because if the property is sold usually a personal covenant from the vendor is accepted, or alternatively the purchaser allows the mortgage to remain on title but gives priority to other borrowings by the purchaser. </para>
          <para>I think I should also mention that earlier this year the guidelines were liberalised to enable a greater percentage of growers to qualify for assistance. I think it is fair to say that the original guidelines for obtaining tree pull money were too restrictive. Through the State of Victoria, the Commonwealth Government doubled the asset entitlement to enable a greater number of growers to come into the field. This, coupled with the depressed land values by reason of the depressed state of the industry, has had a cumulative effect. The applicants have more than doubled since this new liberalisation of guidelines was introduced earlier this year. It is interesting to note that in 1972 and later when the scheme was introduced, dairying was then a reasonably thriving industry and there was a ready demand from dairy farmers for the land from which trees had been removed. But now of course, with the depressed state of the dairying industry, there are great problems about the use to which land from which trees have been removed is to be put. There are very grave limitations on the re-use of this land at present. Some of it can be put to vegetable growing but in the present depressed state of primary industry this is one of the additional problems which the orchardist has to face. </para>
          <para>In speaking on this Bill in the other place the honourable member for Murray made a plea for some amelioration of the conditions for partial tree-pull because the scheme is not achieving the purpose for which it was designed, that is, to reduce the acreage of trees- pear trees in particular to a level which will enable the crop to be sold. There are still some 2000 acres of excess pears for which there is no market and this is largely because under the restrictions in the partial tree-pull scheme growers are unable to get compensation for pulling out their trees. Some of these trees have not been sprayed and pruned, simply because the orchardist does not have the capital for that purpose. It is a fairly expensive operation.  "prose  who have been able to raise the capital have in some cases been cautious in their outlook because of the uncertainty of the prevailing markets, and uncertainty about whether the canneries will be able to take the fruit and whether a viable price will be paid for the fruit </para>
          <para>Another matter I would like to mention in relation to this problem is that the Fruit Industry Sugar Concession Committee which is charged with the duty of fixing the price to be paid has not as yet announced prices for the coming year although apricots will be started to be picked in about a fortnight's time and peaches and pears will be picked shortly after. This creates greater uncertainty in the industry and now that devaluation has been announced the price should be set at the earliest possible moment to allow fruit growers a final opportunity before 3 1 December to exercise judgment in relation to further tree-pull. Obviously if they know the price they are going to get for their product they will be in a far better position to make a judgment on whether it is worth paying the high labour cost involved in getting their fruit to the canneries. There would be no more unfortunate plight for the grower than to be unable to make a reasoned and calculated decision about the area of trees he should take out because he has no information on the price of the product or the quantity of fruit that the canneries will take. In this regard I share some of the concern which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> expressed but I remind him that the Government's announcement on devaluation is the first real ray of sunshine to appear on the horizon of the fruit industry after several dark, dismal and gloomy years. It is a major ray of sunshine not only for the canning fruit industry but also for our other great primary industries which still provide the major part of the export income of this nation. </para>
          <para>The Government's decision to devalue can only mean better times ahead for the industry. Of course, the amount of canned fruit sold on the export market has declined over recent years due to competition from South Africa, the European Common Market and America. I can recall that after World War II for a number of years the whole of the canned fruit pack was sold to Britain before it was off the tree under the Food for Britain scheme. There was a preferred market Now we have a changed situation and there is a tariff against the entry of our fruit into Britain, so there has been a dramatic change which has compounded the difficulties of the industry. When we consider the unfavourable exchange rate and the high labour cost across the board from the time the fruit is taken from the tree until it reaches the supermarket shelf in Australia or in the country to which it is exported we realise the problems which the industry faces. Despite the competition in the export field there is still a significant amount of total production which is exported and it is estimated that the devaluation decision will be worth between $65 and $80 per tonne to growers in respect of their canned fruit for export. I am certain that the industry in general and the growers in particular will welcome the Government 's decision. </para>
          <para>It is also fair to say that this will give a fillip to the industry. The canneries will be able to take more fruit than was at first thought necessary and markets overseas which were doubtful will be consolidated. Fruit that is sold on consignment in Australia will get the benefit also. Generally it is a brighter picture. If we couple with that decision the initiatives which have been taken by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in a Bill of this type the sole purpose and design of which is to reduce the amount of raw product to meet the available market and remove the excess raw product, we can see better days ahead for the industry. </para>
          <para>I would like to refer briefly in conclusion to the canning side of the industry in Victoria. There is a rationalisation proposal in relation to the 3 Victorian canneries in which 70 per cent of Australia's canned fruit is processed. I trust that this proposal will come to fruition as rationalisation is essential to the future of the industry. However, there are problems. The Shepparton Preserving Company Ltd is the biggest cannery in the Southern Hemisphere. The Kyabram Preserving Company Ltd is the second biggest and Ard mona Co-operative Fruit Products Co. Ltd is very high up the line. They are extensive commercial operations with a large share capital. In the case of the Kyabram and Ard mona companies a large proportion of the shares is held by the growers. In a situation where there are 3 commercial institutions there is great concern about which one ought to close. Because of the practical problems associated with this decision I commend the action taken by the Victorian </para>
          <para class="block">Government in asking <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ian</inline> Moreton, the  Chairman  of the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission, to make an in-depth investigation of the 3 canneries and make recommendations to the State Government on initiatives it might take to assist this rationalisation proposal. Of course, it recognises that the final decision on whether a cannery closes must always rest with the shareholders of the company. The report of the  Chairman  of the Commission is now with the Victorian Government and all I wish to do at this stage is to stress to the people in the industry in Victoria the necessity for getting together and rationalising the production side of the industry. If that is done, with devaluation and the trimming of production to the available market, I can see better days ahead for this industry. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>-The Senate is debating the States Grants (Fruit Growing Reconstruction) Bill and, as outlined in the second reading speech, the purpose of the Bill is to extend the fruit growing reconstruction scheme to the end of this year and to provide up to a further $lm to assist in the removal of canning fruit trees in South Australia and Victoria. The limit on assistance will now be $5. 6m, and although the closing date for applications will be 3 1 December of this year the closing date for the removal of trees will be 30 June next year. I imagine that there will be a number of precautionary applications for tree-pull. </para>

          <para>Notice of this Bill was given in the Budget. It is worth noting in passing that, despite all its promises when in Opposition, the present Government's Budget was a disaster for farmers. I wish to quote some statements from the policy speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> and also some statements made by the present Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair. Senator Tehan</inline> stated that devaluation will be of tremendous help to the canned fruit industry. He went on to say that a very small portion of the crop was exported. He did not tell us how devaluation will assist the industry when such a small portion of the crop is exported. The home market is the best market for the canned fruit produced in Australia. I would go so far as to say that we could have the reverse effect as a result of the massive devaluation announced by this Government last Sunday night- a devaluation which all the economists tell us will reduce the spending power of the wage earner. It is the wage earner who consumes most of the canned fruit produced. If the wage earner has not the money in his pocket to buy canned fruit, how will devaluation assist the canned fruit industry? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> says that it will. </para>
          <para>I wish to quote some statements made some years ago by National Country Party Ministers, who blamed the Labor Government for bringing disaster on the industry when that Government devalued the currency. On the one hand we have National Country Party Ministers saying that devaluation had some adverse effect on the industry, and on the other hand we have <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan,</inline> a National Country Party senator, saying that devaluation will help the industry. Who is right- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> or the Country Party Ministers, his own colleagues? We will see when the time comes. Time will tell whether devaluation has helped the industry or has had an adverse effect on it. Repeated irresponsible statements have been made by members of the Government Parties, in particular Country Party Ministers, in endeavouring to lay the blame for the rural industries' problems at the feet of the Labor Government. I wish to quote a few extracts from the policy speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> at the Festival Hall in Brisbane on 26 November 197S. I will quote only a few extracts because there were far too many promises which have not been honoured to quote them chapter and verse. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> opened his famous speech by saying: </para>

I am happy to say that if it cannot do it in the next 18 months the Opposition in this chamber will have the numbers and the Government will be then made to toe the line. We will make the Government honour its promises. Of course, if we come back to this chamber with the numbers by 30 June 1978, it is almost certain that we will then come back with the numbers in the other place. The people of Australia, having experienced a Labor Government which has been accused of crippling the rural industries in 3 years and having then experienced a government which made promises that it would assist them in the next 3 years, will be in a position to make a choice of their own and I am sure that they will make that choice wisely because there will be no such nonsense to cloud the issue as we had on 13 December of last year. </para>

          <para class="block">We have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> interjecting and writing a big no across the chamber that we will not get to government. That is what a member of the Government of which he is a supporter said a few months ago in relation to the election in New South Wales, but the Labor Party did win office in that State. The Labor Party did so because it did not take the people long- less than 6 months -to get a stomach full of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has been dishing out to them. </para>

              <para>- Tasmania is next. We are waiting for that. Let us look at the Budget. The total outlays for net direct assistance to the agricultural and pastoral industries was estimated at a negative $25.3m for 1976-77. That represents a massive decline of $ 189.7m on Labor's last Budget. Most of the decrease is explained by the $2 14m decrease in the provision for wool marketing assistance. But in 1974-75 the estimates showed a Government outlay of $447.1 min 1975-76 it declined to $ 163.4m. If the Liberal and Country Parties had been serious about their promises to the rural sector, which is what I have been talking about, they could have used the repayments by the Australian Wool Corporation to assist the rural sector generally and still have made Budget savings, instead of slashing expenditure to the bone. For example, no direct assistance was specified for the canned fruits industry in the Budget, despite the fact that there is abundant hard evidence on which to base policy. </para>

          <para>The Prime Minister has made one or two speeches on rural policy. It is evident from them that the Government still has a few policies in many areas- I stress the word 'few'- but we have yet to hear them. The only policies that the Government have put into effect have been to downgrade the working class of this nation and crush it into the ground. I asked a question today about the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation but I could not get an answer to it The Government is even co-opting the assistance of ASIO now to spy on trade union officials and to break the trade union movement. Yet we have had <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> saying that devaluation is going to help the canned fruit industry. If the wage earners of this country are suppressed to such an extent that they do not have any extra money to spend they will do without fruit They will eat spuds and onions, as had to be done during the depression. They can do without those luxuries of life. But if they are forced into that situation the canned fruit industry will suffer even more than it has suffered over the last decade. </para>

          <para>The Liberal and Country Parties said in then policy speech that in the process of the readjustment of market opportunities the industry could be assured of sympathetic co-operation.

          <para class="block">That was in 1972 under the McMahon Government. When the Australian Labor Party came into government, what did we do? There was $1.5m currency realignment assistance provided by way of grants to all canneries exporting canned deciduous fruit. These grants of $1.5m resulted in a reduction of the 1972 loans by $838,000. This is what I am trying to persuade <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> to do with the present loan. He will not do it. Out of the $205,000 loan that we converted to a grant, the Riverland cannery got approximately $196,000 and Jon Preserving Co-op Ltd got about $56,000 of a loan of $178,000.

          <para class="block">The Labor Party recognises them too. It is not only people who grow the fruit who are assisted when a subsidy is provided or a loan is converted to a grant.

              <para>- What is the date of this Press release? It is dated 23 October 1972. It relates to a speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> to the Australian Canning Fruitgrowers Association at the Berri Hotel at Berri in South Australia. He admitted then, before Labor came into government, that inflation was having its effect on the fruit canning industry. We are told every day in this place that it was the Labor Government's inflation that crippled the industry. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is on record in the document from which I have quoted as saying that inflation under the government before the Whitlam Government was having its effect on the industry. So <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> cannot have it both ways. He forgets that when these Press releases are put out some of us chaps on the Opposition side put them away because we take great notice of them. We get them out later and we read them. I know it hurts <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> to have to sit there and listen to words of his own Minister being thrown back at him. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Tehan</inline>can natter away, but the proof of the pudding is in the eating. In the document from which I have quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> stated that inflation was crippling the industry when the Liberal and Country parties were in government. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> was not in government, but his party was in government. It is not sufficient for the Government simply to blame the Labor Party for every rural problem. It is not a rural policy for the Government to say: 'Whitlam was anti-rural' or to refer to Labor's stand on any policy question. The Labor Party set up the Industries Assistance Commission and asked for a series of reports on the horticultural fruit industries. These were delivered on 16 January this year. Since then we have heard nothing. Labor would have acted on the IAC reports. I am sure that the people in the horticultural regions expected action on them by any responsible government. Of course there was one IAC report that the ink was hardly dry on when this Government put it into effect, and that was the report on the restoration of the superphosphate bounty. The ink was not dry when the Government made a decision to restore the bounty because the IAC recommended it. But what about the IAC recommendations on the canned fruit industry? Why has the Government allowed the reports to moulder away in the pigeonholes and has done nothing about them? I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> to answer that. She cannot answer it. The Government thought that the whole problem that existed in the rural industries was that the Labor Government failed to reenact the legislation- it was a wise decision- for the superphosphate bounty. The Government thought that reintroduction of the bounty would solve all the problems. It told the people that it would, and the people in the country towns thought it would. But their position is getting worse and worse every day, and they have got the bounty back. The Government is not helping them. They are fast learning to believe what I have said in this Parliament on many occasions that that subsidy helps only the wealthy producers. </para>

          <para>I am not making a simple debating point by saying that more should have been done in the past and that more should be done now. Anyone can say that. I know the situation in the irrigation areas in the country, particularly in the Riverland, because I live there. I know the disillusionment of the farmers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> was confronted by angry fruit growers at Berri some months back and Federal politicians were also confronted by angry fruit growers at Mooroopna. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> referred to the Labor Government's mismanagement, but he conveniently forgot to tell us- he mentioned Mooroopna too- about the massive demonstration that took place in Mooroopna.

          <para class="block">I am afraid from the replies I have received that he is not showing that he has a better understanding, because he has not given us some action. It will be recalled that, as I have said, the South Labor Government through its Premier <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> and the very able South Australian Minister of Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brian</inline> Chatterton, have gone out of their way to help the canneries. Not only has the Government given them a $500,000 loan to tide the citrus industry over a very flat period but also there is the South Australian Government offer- I have mentioned it previously; it is in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> if people would like to read it- to the tune of $272,000 to convert our portion of the loan to a grant, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has refused to do that. It might be opportune now for me to read a letter which I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> dated 9 November: </para>

            <para class="block">Dear Senator McLaren, </para>
            <para>In the Senate on 4 November 1976, during the Adjournment Debate, you asked my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> Minister for Industry and Commerce, to take up with me the question of converting the Commonwealth Government's snare of the 1976 loan to Riverland Fruit Cannery to a grant and to advise the  Chairman  of the Co-operative prior to the meeting of the Cannery's shareholders on Friday 12 November 1976. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>I have already informed the South Australian Minister of Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chatterton,</inline> that whilst I am examining the question of repayment arrangements covering the loan monies provided to the several States, including South Australia, might be extended I am not prepared to support the Commonwealth agreeing to convert its loan monies to a grant as is proposed in the case of Riverland. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What happened after that? I received that letter on 9 November. I had raised the matter in the Parliament on several occasions. I had raised it in a speech on one of the Appropriation Bills prior to raising it in an adjournment debate when I brought it to the notice of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton-</inline> and I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> for his prompt action. We find <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles,</inline> the  chairman  of the backbench rural committee of the coalition parties, coming out with a statement that offended many many people in the Riverland district.

          <para class="block">I I November- 2 days after the Minister's letter to me. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles</inline> used similar terms to the terms used in the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> This heading is 'Misleading'. It reads: </para>

            <para>The member for Angus, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles,</inline> said there appeared to have been a deliberate attempt to mislead Riverland canning fruit growers. </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">He was referring to the Premier's saying that he was going to make available to the cannery the South Australian Government's portion of the loan as a direct grant. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles</inline> said this was deliberately misleading. I put out a Press release in which I reminded the people that it was not the first time that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles</inline> had himself misled the people in the Riverland. I shall not read all of the Press release. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles</inline> is at all concerned, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan-</inline> who said that this cannot be done under the legislation- is at all concerned, and if Government supporters generally are concerned, they can do as I said in my Press release: </para>

            <para>There is nothing to stop the Government amending their legislation . . . - </para>

          <para class="block">To convert the loan to a grant- </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In fact, I can give the Government an assurance that the Labor Party will support any action that is taken to have the loan converted to a grant. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So I put it to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> fairly and squarely, that if he and the people who sit with him, including <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> are fair dinkum in wanting to help the fruit canning industry they should bring in an amendment to the States Grants (Fruit Canneries) Act 1976. Bring in an amendment to it tomorrow or next week and we will support it. They cannot run away and hide by saying that they cannot do it under the legislation because this Government brought in an urgent Bill on the Thursday night before the week's recess and in a matter of minutes it was debated and passed in this place before one could say Jack Robinson. This matter is just as urgent for the canning fruit growers of South Australia, in my view, as was that matter which was to protect some uranium producers. I inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> that this can be done. The honourable senator will not give any promise. Of course he will not. He will not promise to make some move in his Party room to amend the legislation. So I challenge him: In view of what he has said and the criticism he has made of the Labor Government I challenge him to come in here with an amendment for which there will be support from this side. If the National Country Party senators want to bring in an amendment themselves they will have it passed, because together we can beat the Liberal Party if it does not want to help. It is obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles</inline> does not want to help. </para>
          <para>The fact is that the Government has done little or nothing on the specific IAC horticultural reports and has failed to implement key sections of the IAC report on rural reconstruction. After haggling with the States on the percentage amounts to be paid and on interest rates, the Government is to allocate some $20m for the period from January to June 1977. I have the IAC reports with me and I will quote from them in a moment. I will not do so just at present. The IAC recommended the payment of $50m for a full year. However, the Government did not agree to the formation of an area redevelopment authority or to the proposal for a national authority to co-ordinate, monitor and evaluate rural adjustment policy and initiatives. This is of particular relevance to reconstruction in the horticultural industries, where industry is specifically regional and where there is little other choice of enterprise. I will come back to that point in a moment. </para>
          <para>It will be recalled that I said a while ago that in helping the canned fruit industry by way of subsidy a government is helping not only the canned fruit industry but also all the ancillary and supporting industries to be found in the irrigation areas. However, not only has the Minister failed to implement the recommendation that would have shown fruit growers that the Government is really interested in the industry but also he has completely wiped his hands of the proposition put to him by expert bodies to adjust the fruit canning industry. The IAC has said that the Government should participate in this rationalisation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> says that it is a cannery problem. That is an incredible position. The LiberalNational Country Party Government some years ago poured money into Victorian canneries without any direction or control. Now it wipes its hands of the problem. This is where the truth comes home. We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> say that we have about 2000 acres of pear trees in excess of market requirements. As I point out, that situation could well have been brought about by the Liberal-National Country Party Government pouring money into the canned fruit industry at that time without any survey being made of the market potential. </para>
          <para>When growers have not been paid for their 1975 or 1976 crop, when growers are going to the wall, when growers are not investing in essential inputs into their farms and when incomes are negative, I say that it is the Government's problem and that to wipe its hands of the cannery problem is downright irresponsible. Since July 1974 is a long time for the growers to wait for their money for canned pears, peaches and apricots, To sum up the cynicism of the Minister, one needs only to quote his statement, which was that the Government 'may have been retarding import industry initiatives' by involving itself in the industry's problems. The Government talks about free enterprise, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> is a great advocate of free enterprise. The Government tries to get itself off the hook by saying that it should not interfere. Yet who in this chamber speaks more than anybody else on rural problems? It is the senators from Tasmania, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> He has done that for years. He did it when were were in Opposition and his Party was in Government previously and then when my Party was in Government, and now he is doing it when again my Party is in Opposition. He has been practically crying for assistance for Tasmania, which is quite the opposite to what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> says. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> says that if the Government interferes it might be involving itself in the problems of the industry. Should not governments involve themselves in all of the problems of industry? Industry is the lifeblood of this nation, whether it be primary industry or secondary industry. </para>
          <para>I come back to the specific IAC reports which the Government so far has chosen to ignore. References to the IAC were made as far back as 11 March 1974. More than 200 witnesses gave evidence to the IAC on the fruit industries. After a long and careful analysis, recommendations were delivered at the beginning of this year and, as I have said, nothing has been done other than to introduce this minor Bill which partially implements the recommendations of fruit growing reconstruction in Part A of the report. The other fruit growing reconstruction measures which the IAC recommended and on which the Government has not acted appear on pages 23 and 24 of the IAC report. Under the heading Other Fruit Growing Reconstruction Measures' we find the following: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Commission also recommends that: </para>
            <para>Area Redevelopment Authorities be established in designated areas to co-ordinate and guide the changes taking place and to influence the rate at which they occur, for specified fruit or for horticultural production generally in areas subject to Area Redevelopment Authorities: a fruit growing adjustment counselling service be established to work intensively with individual farmers and their families: concessional adjustment finance be provided to help farmers redevelop within agriculture or, where appropriate, to establish themselves outside it, on the following terms and conditions: finance from commercial sources is unavailable but the loan could be serviced; for the first three years of a concessional loan the rate of interest be 50 per cent of the long term bond rate; during these three years there will be capitalisation of interest at the concessional rate and a repayment holiday for at least that period; the upper limit for concessional loans be $20,000; and the viability of adjustment be demonstrable given those loan terms; assistance be provided for the removal of trees and vines which, if not properly maintained, could harbour diseases and pests. </para>

          <para class="block">How many of those recommendations have been acted upon by the Government? Very few of them have been acted upon. As I said in answer to an interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters,</inline> the Government acted on the IAC report dealing with the superphosphate bounty before the ink was even dry on the paper. The recommendation which I have just read was of particular significance to the South Australian Riverland and coincides with the analysis and conclusions of the IAC on that most important region. The pivotal element of the Commission's strategy for the rehabilitation of the region was the establishment of an area regional authority. But what action has the Government taken? It has done nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> pages 1 1, 12 and 13 of Part D of the IAC report which deals with the South Australian Riverland. </para>

The studies undertaken by the Commission suggest that about one third of the 2400 fruit-growers in the Riverland have sufficient resources, equity and managerial ability to earn from full time fruit growing what might currently be considered acceptable levels of income. Relatively few growers in this category have large incomes by Australian standards, but with access to credit under commercial terms these growers should be able to develop at a fast enough rate to generate adequate income for their business and household needs. </para>
          <para>Approximately one sixth of the growers earn the major part of their income on* their farms. The average level of household income of these 'part de growers is comparable with that of the full time growers in the previous category. Though off-farm employment opportunities are limited, part time growing appears to be viable for those who are so engaged and it represents an efficient use of physical and human resources in the region. </para>
          <para>Another one third of the growers have low to very low levels of income but appear to have the potential to develop viable units capable of providing modest incomes from full time fruit growing. These growers may need some assistance in debt refinancing, property build-up and redevelopment, or development of managerial skills. For the purpose of the Commission's study, a viable farm was assumed to be capable of providing an income of approximately $6,000 per annum in real terms. </para>
          <para>The remaining one sixth of the growers have little prospect of viability as full time fruit-growers. Their household incomes are low, and their resource base, equity and managerial skills are so inadequate that their farms would not be viable even with refinancing and managerial assistance. </para>
          <para>The Commission considers that the foregoing estimates may prove to be optimistic. They are based on existing real income levels in the Australian community, and an assumption that prices received for farm produce will increase at the same rate as all farm costs. Yet, notwithstanding this optimistic basis for the assessments, approximately half of the fruit-growers in the Riverland are in the latter two categories. The assessments hence establish a need for a major redevelopment and adjustment initiative if growers are to reestablish their standard of living at acceptable levels, either as growers or in other occupations. </para>
          <para>The Commission's recommendations for the Riverland are covered in the separate reports on Rural Reconstruction and Fruit growing Reconstruction. They constitute an integrated strategy designed to encourage efficient change and to minimise the personal problems associated with change. If changes are not anticipated they will involve substantially greater individual and national costs when they subsequently occur. </para>
          <para>The major emphasis of assistance for fruit growing in the Riverland should be focussed as far as possible on eligible growers who could redevelop their properties into viable farms if they received financial assistance to do so, and on growers who have little prospect of long term viability. For the latter group, assistance would be for re-establishment off the farm. These two categories would encompass some SO per cent of Riverland growers. However the characteristics of growers in these categories are diverse. For example, the Commission's survey found that older growers tend to have incomes lower than average. Assistance for a major change of occupation or lifestyle is clearly inappropriate for most older growers. Counselling on problems of adjustment would be a major form of assistance for most growers in these circumstances. </para>
          <para>A pivotal element of the Commission's strategy is the establishment of an ARA to encourage the co-ordination of adjustment within national guidelines established for the fruit growing industries and to plan and guide the redevelopment of area infrastructures which efficient farm adjustment would require. The strategy also includes an adjustment counselling service to help growers anticipate and deal with the adjustment problems they face before they are 'forced' to do so and to ensure that they and their families have access to generally available assistance measures. Another important part of the 'package' is the provision of concessional finance and a repayment holiday for at least the first three years to enable growers to redevelop their farms within fruit growing or to re-establish themselves in alternative livelihoods. </para>
          <para>These are the elements of the integrated strategy recommended by the Commission for fruit growing reconstruction generally and the Commission emphasizes the need for its assistance 'package ' to be applied as a whole. A partial or piecemeal approach is considered unlikely to succeed in solving the problems of the area. The package is designed to supplement the general provisions recommended in the Commission's report on Rural Reconstruction and the specific recommendations of the Commission's report on Dried Vine Fruit. </para>
          <para>Evidence presented to the Commission and the Commission's own study have shown that a large amount of resource adjustment, both on and off the farm, is needed in the Riverland. The Commission considers that the extent and diversity of such adjustment, together with the integrated nature of the region, is sufficient to warrant the establishment of the ARA for the Riverland. The efficient operation of this ARA would require effective co-ordination between the Australian and State Governments and the local community. </para>
          <para>With respect to the executive members of the ARA, consideration could be given to seconding an officer of the independent NRAB recommended in the separate report on </para>
          <para class="block">Rural Reconstruction, as the representative of the Australian Government. This would facilitate communication and coordination with this Authority. For similar reasons, one member could be an officer seconded by, or a person acceptable to, the State Rural Reconstruction Authority which is already working closely with the State departments. This would also provide access to other important services provided by State departments. Local participants should be appointed primarily on the basis of their ability, rather than as representatives of particular interests. The Commission recognises, however, that some representation may be required from those organisations most directly concerned with the activities of the ARA. The Commission would see a membership of greater than five as being unwieldly, but stresses the importance of having the ARA as a local organisation. The composition of its membership should reflect this. </para>
          <para>The number of growers who can be supported within the Riverland at acceptable levels of income is limited. If too many redevelop larger, more productive farms, the extra amount of production will depress fruit prices and jeopardise further the viability and well-being of all growers. In addition, cost reduction may be difficult, especially in multi crop activities where the introduction of mechanisation may be less applicable. The optimum number of growers for the Riverland cannot be assessed without substantial and continuing research. It is suggested that this research could be undertaken by the Aram the context of national guidelines established for the fruit growing industries, and the technical and economic opportunities for redeveloping the Riverland 's irrigation and drainage systems (see Supplement 6.5). Infrastructure redevelopment would also need to be integrated with an overall farm redevelopment strategy which recognises the problems caused by past land and irrigation policies, and which may require the Authority to oversee the resumption of land during a transitional period. Provision should also be made to allow for possible future changes in technology; continuing adjustment being a likely requirement of production units capable of providing levels of income comparable with those in the rest of the community. In particular, care is necessary to avoid past mistakes which placed unnecessary inhibitions on farm development and expansion. </para>

            <para>-Other parts of the IAC reports on fruit growing were concerned with apples and pears and dried vine fruits. I understand that some legislation dealing with apples and pears will be coming from the other place, so I will not speak on that industry at the present time. I will confine myself to the dried vine fruits industry which is of great importance to the Riverland and Sunraysia regions. Despite difficulties, there has been little pay-in by government to the stabilisation of the dried vine fruits industry, although domestic consumption prices provide a hidden subsidy. That is to say, the price of the fruit is at such a high level that the subsidy is hidden in the domestic price. Again, if the Government is successful with its devaluation policy, fewer and fewer people in the industrial areas of this nation will be able to spend money on dried vine fruits which, in my opinion, are a must on any person 's table. </para>
          </talk.start></continue><para>Many dried vine fruits grapes are now sold for wine making, and the climatic problems in the northern hemisphere have meant that Australian producers face a good overseas market in the coming year, provided that our own weather causes no problems. That is a hazard which every primary producer faces, no matter what he is producing. If there is to be a short breathing period for this industry, it is essential that the industry redevelop its stabilisation scheme and that the Government take the lead in the formulation of policy on the basis laid down by the IAC. I have quoted some of that policy, and I have been granted leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> those recommendations of the IAC which are related to the Riverland of South Australia. We will not get any informed, constructive debate in this chamber until the Government takes the initiative and puts up policies or papers for discussion. </para><para>It is not good enough for situations to be allowed to get so bad that a no-option policy is put up as a desperate last measure when the industry is in agreement due to its near destruction. The present Minister seems to want to see as many people as possible go to the wall, before he will act. I hope that he will change his mind in that regard and give some assistance. The IAC recommendations on the dried vine fruits industry included a plea for the creation of area redevelopment authorities. The dried vine fruits industry is concentrated in 3 regions in Australia because of the defined regional extent of this industry and other horticultural industries. I must emphasise that I believe that that recommendation must be acted upon or at least tried on an experimental basis. </para><para>Time will not permit me to mention other matters which I wanted to mention. Politics is being played in relation to the measures which the South Australian Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> and the South Australian Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chatterton,</inline> have adopted to help the canned fruit industry in South Australia. Recorded in the South Australian <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 1 8 November is a question asked of the Premier by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin,</inline> which makes inferences on lines similar to those made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Giles</inline> that the Premier was misleading the canned fruit industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arnold</inline> expected- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> is on record in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as saying this-that action would have been taken by the Government the day after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chatterton</inline> made their announcement that they were prepared to convert the loan to a direct grant. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> said that if action was not taken the Premier was welching on his promise. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> in his usual capable manner, was able to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Tonkin</inline> that he was only playing politics and trying to make an issue out of nothing. The South Australian </para><para class="block">Government stands by its promise to help the canned fruit industry in South Australia. Once again, I make a plea to the Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> to come to the party with his share of the loan and convert it into a grant to help these growers. Not only the growers in the Riverland of South Australia will benefit; also those people who depend on the incomes that the growers spend on entertainment, motor cars, furniture, electrical appliances and so forth will benefit. These are the things that the present Government is going to help the people in the canned fruit areas to be deprived of. </para><para>The canned fruit industry is at a low ebb as far as the marketing of its products is concerned. It could well be that growers will find themselves in very serious trouble in having to pay the portion of the loan which is going to be left over. Of course the States are responsible. It may well be that the South Australian Government will have to come to the party and meet the whole commitment because of the inability of the canned fruit growers in South Australia to repay to the South Australian Government the portion of the loan which will remain after we have paid out what we intend to pay. I hope that does not take place. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan,</inline> in his wisdom, would not see the growers in really desperate trouble because they had to find that money. He would find some measures by which to help them as he has done with regard to the repayment of our portion of the loan. I again make a plea to the Minister that some effort be made as quickly as possible to assist these people in the Riverland. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> has said- and he is criticising his own Government- that some price should be announced before 31 December so that the people who are intending to apply for grants under the tree pull scheme will know where they are going. This is important also to the Government of South Australia. </para><interjection>

            <para>- in reply- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> said that he regretted that there was not more time for him to do some more talking. I took a rough count of the time that the debate has taken so far on the Bill which is not opposed but is supported. The debate has taken about 100 minutes and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has spoken for more than half that time; so he has not done too badly. I endeavoured to listen to him with the greatest of care. All I can really undertake to do is to read the relevant <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and commend it to the appropriate Minister, who is not myself, and at the same time raise, as I have done on 2 occasions or possibly three, the problem of the capital moneys that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has talked about. I shall be as brief as I can because I think all of my colleagues on both sides of the chamber are conscious of the program of work we have and have some anxiety, as I have, not to eat their Christmas dinner in Parliament House. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Briefly, the history of the scheme is that it was introduced in 1972, and $4.6m was provided under a special appropriation. The scheme has been extended twice up to 31 December 1975. This is the first occasion on which extra funds are being provided. Progress of the scheme was such that as at 31 August 1976 $3. 9m had been approved. Over 1250 growers have been assisted. Removals approved account for over 10 000 acres of fresh apples, 1000 acres of fresh pears, 3000 acres of canning peaches, 1000 acres of canning pears and 400 acres of canning apricots. Three hundred and twenty five applications are being processed at the present time, of which 140 are from Victoria and 130 are from South Australia. The purpose of the Bill is to ratify an exchange of letters extending the scheme until 3 1 December 1976, and to authorise the provision of an additional sum of $lm to assist the removal of canning fruit trees in Victoria and South Australia. </para>
          <para>Various comments have been made about the industry's problems and the difficulties that it has, all of which are freely acknowledged and understood. Attempts to solve them have been made by governments which have come from both sides of this Parliament. As I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          <para class="block">Gietzelt said, the problem is very much one of access to markets. That is, without any doubt, a substantial part of the industry's problems. All of us should have some regard to that when we think about Australia's total position. We are consistently advised by people to lower our tariffs to nil, to import everybody else 's products, and at the same time cheerfully to buy and have our own products denied access to world markets. I think that as a Senate we ought to be quite bipartisan about this. What is fair for one should be fair for another. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> in making that comment, was accurate. </para>
          <para>The devaluation of our currency should assist the industry. As best we can judge, it will take some time for that particular area of assistance to be developed. As to the fresh fruit aspect and the canned fruit aspect, it is too early yet to judge the final result. If we accept this proposition that some people are putting, our country will be much more open to the imports of canned products from other people's orchards. So honourable senators might think a little about that. There is also the problem of paying subsidies to growers to remove trees and consumers then having to pay higher prices. Only time will illustrate whether the policy to rectify the problem of this horticultural industry by the tree-pull method is a good or bad policy. Governments of both parties have taken part in that scheme and have supported it. The scheme has been extended. Indeed, this particular scheme is being supported. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline>spoke about the industry with very considerable understanding. I think he was fairly well placed as to what might happen, and as to the problem areas. Without any doubt, at the moment a lot of the industry is in substantial difficulty. Some part of it may yet be better off. We will have to wait and see. It may still stand in need of assistance in the years to come; we do not yet know. It always seems a tragedy that in a world where people are hungry you have fruit which could be produced but which is not produced. All honourable senators know this problem. It is a problem of access and of price. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator discussed a question of rationalisation of canneries in Victoria. This is a matter really for Victoria and those people concerned in the industry. In our own Department of Industry and Commerce we do have some interest in this matter because once fruit moves to a processing stage it tends to become an industry. We have been helping and watching this very carefully. We believe that basically Australia ought to be in a situation of basing a lot of its manufacture on adding value to its own raw materials, of which fruit is a notable case. This has become very difficult in recent years because of the substantial increase in the cost of making and selling Australian goods. They are problems we all know. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline>made some comments about inflation. Let us bear in mind that when his Government began to operate on the Australian economy the rate of inflation was about 4 per cent. However, when that Government left office, the rate of inflation was running close to 20 per cent. So there is some margin for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> to take some blame upon himself, smart though he is. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline>as I said, spoke at considerable length. It is impossible for me to follow the ramifications of his mind through the points he made. But those matters will be taken into consideration. To the extent that he has raised new material, it will be dealt with. To the extent that I can help in the situation of once again talking to the Minister about the money that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> wants converted into a grant, I will certainly do what I can to help South Australia- not any particular person. If the matter can be taken further, I shall try to do so. The Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has replied to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and he knows that. He has quoted the reply. We understand the problem is one of examining the situation with a view to seeing whether or not it is possible at least to extend the time of the loan. It will be useful if that progress can be made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> spoke at great length about the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on fruit growing. I am unable to tell him why the report has not yet been dealt with in detail by the Minister but since it was brought down it has been studied with great care. I understand that many of the problems are moving towards resolution. I cannot be fairer or say any more than that. I undertake to obtain information from the responsible Minister in relation to the matters which need further clarification. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is considering a very important piece of legislation, the States Grants (Beef Industry) Amendment Bill. The Opposition will not oppose this legislation. The purpose of the Bill is to provide continued short term assistance for beef cattle producers. However, before I refer to the Bill itself I should like to make some brief comments. I will exempt from my remarks the Minister in charge of the Bills that the Senate is debating this afternoon, the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton.</inline> It seems to me that he has attempted to come to grips with the problem to some extent and with the manner in which the Opposition is endeavouring to approach the serious problems which are the subject of the Bills being debated in the Senate. I hope I am wrong in coming to this conclusion but it seems to me that there is a tendency to believe that the Opposition is involved in some sort of time wasting exercise. It is accused of procrastinating and engaging in some sort of humbug in respect to legislation before the Parliament. I detect a certain frivolity and arrogance in some honourable senators opposite who appear to take the view that the task of the Senate is to pass Bills without any critical comment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that the Opposition in supporting the great majority of the Bills before the Parliament relating to agriculture understands the problems facing the rural sector. It ill behoves those who believe that because we want to exercise our rightful and constitutional prerogative of adequately debating Bills and drawing attention to what we consider to be the deficiencies of the Government and its inability to comprehend the total picture. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> made a bipartisan reference to this when summing up the second reading debate on the previous Bill- the role of the Opposition should be to follow meekly in the wake of the Government. When we do not oppose legislation this does not mean that we should not exercise our right to examine it and give the ideological or philosophical reasons why we criticise the Government's approach to it. When the Labor Government was in office for 3 years- it was 3 years in the period from 1949 to 1975- honourable senators opposite who were then in Opposition, such as the tate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> would speak on legislation six and eight times a day for half an hour or an hour at a time. I exempt some of the newer senators from this criticism because they probably do not know of the tortures and ordeals to which we were subjected. Yet when we wish to exercise legitimately the role of examining government legislation we are regarded as being time wasting and involved in the exercise of humbug. It is thought that we should pack up and go home. That is just not what we are about. </para>
          <para>We believe- I am speaking on behalf of a considerable number of members of my Party- that we have a role to play in the Parliament. It is one of the few forums available to us in order to criticise what we consider to be the inept way in which government legislation is being placed before the Parliament. I refer specifically to agriculture. We are now past the half-century mark in respect to agricultural Bills. This applies to me personally as shadow Minister for Agriculture. In the great majority of cases the Government's agricultural policies are the continuation of initiatives taken by previous governments or the Labor Government. By 'previous governments' I refer to previous conservative governments. Agricultural problems today are manifestly stronger and greater than they were when those interim measures were taken in the 1960s and 1 970s by the respective governments. I assure the Senate that we are not here for the purpose of wasting time. We are here because it affords us an opportunity to draw attention, as we have an obligation to do, to what we consider to be deficiencies in legislation. </para>
          <para>This piece of legislation enables the Australian Government to provide $1 5m on a $1 for $1 basis with State funds approved for lending in the next financial year under the beef carry-on loans scheme, a scheme which has been extended from year to year. Beef producers have indicated to me their utter dismay that there has been a cutback in funds allocated to assist their industry in the first Lynch Budget. From discussions I am having with farmer leaders, it is clear that they are looking for more fundamental legislation and a more fundamental examination of the problems than a continuation of initiatives of the past. Last year the Labor Budget provided $ 19.6m under this very scheme. Yet only $ 12.3m was taken up. It should be borne in mind that our Budget which was presented in August of last year did not receive the assent of this place of humbug until 11 November. Therefore the responsibility for allocating and spending the $ 19.6m which the Labor Government made available in the 1975-76 Budget rested with this Government. During the period from 1 1 November when Australia had an interim government, through the period of the elections, to 30 June 1976 this Government which claims to speak on behalf of agriculture and on behalf of beef producers did not spend the total allocation of money available to it in the Budget. It applied its philosophical dogma that there should be a cutback in public funds. </para>
          <para>This Bill permits the allocation to beef producers of the balance of that sum plus $15m. It might be said that in the long term the beef producers will not lose very much- they will receive, in money terms, only $4.6m less than the amount we allocated in the last Whitlam Budget. Of course, the seasonally adjusted figure would be something more than that. In other words, the Government has decided to continue the previous Labor Government's short-term assistance to the beef industry. Surely it cannot be argued that during those tempestuous years when we were in office we could have carried out the fundamental examination that was needed in the beef industry as, indeed, is needed in all the other crisis industries of Australian agriculture. I am sure that the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> will agree with me that we are in an impossible position in respect of the dairy, beef and fruit industries. It may be that the beef industry is better placed than the other 2 industries. If only those industries could be as optimistic about the future and as buoyant as the wheat, wool and sugar industries are! </para>
          <para>I think that at least some credit ought to be given to the previous Labor Government of the time. We very rarely receive any credit for the fact that we set in motion the Industries Assistance Commission, which examines the various sectors of the Australian economy that were and are sick. Do not let any honourable senator tell me that a chronic sickness is not facing the rural and manufacturing industries. One only has to read the Jackson report, the reports of the Industries Assistance Commission in respect of different sectors of manufacturing industry and the voluminous reports that are now available in respect of agriculture to appreciate the very grave structural problems that exist in those industries. </para>
          <para>I agree entirely with the comments made by the Minister for Industry and Commerce in winding up the debate on the States Grant (Fruit-growing Reconstruction) Bill, that only with an understanding by the Australian community and an acceptance by all political parties will we be able to tackle these fundamental problems that are facing sectors of industry and to restructure industries where necessary. Great changes have come across the horizon as far as our industries are concerned. The evolution has reached a point where an epoch has come to an end and we must adopt a whole new approach if these industries are to survive and have any hope in the present and in the future. </para>
          <para>The Minister said in the other place, in summing up the debate on the Bill- I find it incomprehensible that a Minister of the Crown could make such a statement: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>More money is being allocated to the beef industry than has been allocated by any previous government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This claim is false; it is wrong; and it is a lie. It certainly is not fooling the beef producers or the farmers. I ask honourable senators to examine what the Minister said in the other place and to consider what was said in the Budget Speech, particularly what is recorded on page 80 of the Budget Speech. The Minister can use all the rhetoric he likes when he addresses farmers but I think that when he presents the Parliament with a responsible document he ought to be factual and correct. At page 80 of the Budget Speech, under the heading of 'Cattle, Sheep and Pig Meat Industry', the following is stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In 1975-76 the Commonwealth undertook to provide up to $ 19.6m under the <inline font-style="italic">States Grams (Beef Industry) Act</inline> to match State contributions for a joint scheme to provide carry-on finance at concessional rates of interest to specialist beet producers who, while judged to be viable under normal market conditions, lacked finance and were unable to obtain carry-on funds from normal sources. The actual amount provided in 1975-76 was $ 11.3m. The scheme has been extended and the Commonwealth has agreed to provide up to $ 1 5m for the scheme in 1 976-77. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">But the fact is that in the 1975-76 Estimates and the Budget which was approved $ 19.6m was allocated. What was spent was the responsibility of the Treasurer or of the Minister for Primary Industry- certainly it was the responsibility of the Government. Last year when in opposition <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> claimed that the $39.6m that was allocated by the Labor Government, comprising the $ 19.6m under the scheme to which I have just referred and $20m made available to producers at commercial rates of interest through the Commonwealth Development Bank, was inadequate. </para>
          <para>Let us consider the irresponsible attitude of the Minister for Primary Industry. I bear no personal malice in these matters because the Minister for Primary Industry has made available to me the full resources of his Department and I am grateful for this co-operation. But I am concerned about the way in which he publicly presents the position of himself, his Party and, subsequently, his Government. I shall read from a copy of a Press statement by the Minister, a copy of which was made available to all honourable senators. It is headed 'Beef Crisis is a Social and Economic Crisis (Extracts from a speech given by the  Deputy  Leader National Country Party, Ian Sinclair, at a public meeting, Wangaratta, 5th September, 1975)' and states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The time is rapidly passing for the Australian Government to take action to relieve the position of the beef industry', the  Deputy  Leader of the National Country Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> said today. </para>
            <para>Speaking to a public meeting at Wangaratta <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> said: </para>
            <para>The economic problems facing the beef industry are generating grave social problems for the families of beef producers and their employees. </para>
            <para>These social problems will become more pronounced as long as the Government fails to act to assist the industry. </para>
            <para>The total failure to act will bring down on Australia not only an economic tragedy but also a widespread, lingering social tragedy. </para>
            <para class="block">The basic fact needs to be recognised by the Government </para>

          <para class="block">Of course, he was referring to the Labor Government. The Press statement continues: </para>
          <quote>

            <para>The Government must reverse its attitude of doing as little as possible to assist the beef industry.' </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Surely honourable senators cannot accept that those sorts of statements represent anything more than rhetoric, humbug and misrepresentation when this legislation which is before us and which we support will, in fact, reduce the Government's allocation of funds from $ 19.6m, which was criticised when we were in government as not being enough, to $15m. It is a year since this Government came to office. That year has been one of the worst years for Australian agriculture since the Liberal Party and National Country Party were previously in office during the rural recession of the 1 960s and early 1 970s. </para>
          <para>If the forecast of the Bureau of Agricultural Economics proves accurate, next year we will see a major drop in real farm incomes. The Bureau projected before devaluation a drop of 36 per cent in incomes in the rural sector of industry. It has now adjusted that figure to take into account the devaluation and projects a drop of 2 1 per cent. Certainly beef producers are entitled to be concerned about their problem when the income of a very large section of the Australian rural scene is dropping alarmingly as a result of the problems of export markets. The Government's response to this is to give reduced short term assistance to producers, to adopt an interim measure, and to carry on that which had been begun and which, if it is to be carried on, in no way represents a tackling of the basic problems facing the industry. Unfortunately, more producers will be requiring assistance but less assistance will be available. In the words of the Minister for Primary Industry, 'the Government's continued acts of attrition against rural industry, cloaked this time', in that great illogically that we have, 'as an attempt to control inflation', more than anything else and to cut back public spending more than anything else, 'erode the ability of many rural areas to survive; adding to this problem is the fact that unemployment is highest in rural areas '. I do not think any honourable senator can be but concerned at that situation. </para>
          <para>The Minister was then adequately expressing his Government's policy towards rural Australia, although at the time the words to which I have referred were used they were directed against the Labor Government. Those words will be remembered for a long time to come. They were words which attempted to suggest that it was as a result of a deficiency on the part of the Labor Government that export markets had changed and that there was a continuing decline in the beef industry. Now, one year after this Government came to office, instead of living up to its promises to the electorate it has failed miserably. There is no revival, more unemployment, a larger deficit and more overseas borrowing, and inflation is substantially the same and may well increase despite the steps taken on the devaluation front. So I am suggesting to the Government that in using plain rhetoric to fight inflation it will not make any headway and that in the process of cutting back public spending it is slashing financial assistance to the rural sector to such a degree that the rural sector is receiving less funds from government than ever before. In fact $25m comes in from the rural sector to the national income. </para>
          <para>The failure of the Government in the international market place has been disastrous for our export-oriented beef industry. The problem is in the way our industry has developed and this is why structural problems have to be faced by governments, Opposition parties and communities alike. There are sectors of our beef industry which are totally dependent upon export markets and if those markets change or are denied completely to us those sectors have very little chance of adjusting to the new circumstances. So the failure of the Government in the international market place is disastrous. Yet when they were in Opposition the Liberal and National Country Parties, against the national interest I believe, torpedoed the tactics of the Hayden Budget and hypocritically tried to maintain the general thrust of that strategy after the damage had been done. The Lynch Budget and the miserable efforts of this Government to maintain our overseas beef export markets have torpedoed the beef industry in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> and the gang of four who have been running the economic affairs of our country have claimed that this Liberal-National Country Party Government enjoys a special relationship with our major trading partners. In the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> of 26 September last year <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is reported as saying that the then Opposition 'could find better government to government accord than Labor has done in the agricultural marketing area'. They are pious words. Now that it is in government its performance speaks for itself. </para>
          <para>Without notification we learn by listening to the news in the morning or by picking up a newspaper that government after government is concerning itself with its internal domestic situation. Firstly, there was the United States, then Canada, then the Philippines and then Japan. They arbitrarily placed restrictions on our beef entering their domestic markets. When Japan made its announcement, we know what the response was from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> I know that he said it for National Country Party propaganda purposes when he made the statement that it would be difficult for the Government not to take into account Japan's decision to cut beef imports from Australia when considering an extension of the fisheries agreement between the 2 countries. Are we in a position to wield the big stick at our major trading country? Is that the way to conduct trade negotiations or to solve the problems facing the beef producers? If one is to take this statement seriously, it could have serious repercussions on our trading relationship with that country. I remind the Senate that in dollar terms we export almost twice as much to Japan as we import from Japan. So how are we in a position to start making threats. </para>
          <para>We have to recognise the limitations that governments have in these areas of trade relationships when governments overseas want to make decisions. If we accept that as a principle, we should cut out all this nonsensical propaganda from National Country Party leaders suggesting that everything that happened in the decline of agriculture in the post-war years- the ups and downs; the slumps and the good times; the general decline in agriculture, whether it be in terms of beef, fruit or dairy products- was the result of just a measly 3 years of Labor Government. Who are they trying to fool? Are they not men and women who understand and comprehend, or will they always resort to petty party political jibes to try to fool all the people all the time? This Government is threatening a disruption of trade relations with Japan. We ought to have a senior Minister in Japan if we want to do something about the beef industry, rather than standing in far off Australia waving a finger and threatening to do something retaliatory against Japan. </para>
          <para>These bravado tactics do not work. If they do, why did the Government not use them against the United States? Its decision was even more disastrous than the Japanese decision. After all, the United States is supposed to be the country with which this Government has philosophical, ideological and close working relationships. However, it did not make any threats against the United States, although trade between the United States and Australia is 2 times in its favour. If we want to use the big stick we should use it against big brother. That is a fairer way to fight. Of course, this Government does not do that, which shows the hypocrisy and the illogically of the Minister and this Government. More than 52 per cent of our beef exports is destined for the United States. Maybe that is why it does not do it. Despite this, our trade relationships in this area have deteriorated so much that we were not even consulted when the arbitrary decision was made at the height of a big election campaign. True, there was election fever and the decision was made for pragmatic reasons; but, if that is the way friends behave, who needs enemies? </para>

Stable international trade agreements are arrived at not by threatening action after the damage is done but by negotiation to prevent the damage from being done. It is obvious that this Government did not see what clearly was the writing on the wall. It has so little intelligence information from the United States, Japan, the Philippines and other countries that we were not able to 'guestimate' what was to happen; we were not able to understand the pressures under which the Government would be placed. Had we been, we would have been over there to see that the American Government did not bow to the demands of the American cattlemen in the first instance and later of the Japanese cattle industry. </para>

          <para>So the Federal Government has failed, if any government has failed, to maintain existing export contracts and therefore should bear the increasing financial responsibility for programs of assistance to beef producers who have been affected by the Government's failure. As I said in the previous debate on the fruit industry legislation, if it is the export component which is the failure section of our industry the Australian Government should pick up the total tab. It should not be endeavouring to use its federalist policy to put the States on the receiving end of the financial responsibility. It is time the Federal Government took up its responsibility in relation to the marketing of beef, and indeed all meat. The Government has fiddled with the establishment of an Australian meat and livestock corporation. Rather than establish and man a corporation with the best possible people to represent the industry in these highly competitive days, the Minister has split the meat industry with his assertion that the composition of the corporation will follow the plans and form recommended to him by one section, the livestock producers. </para>
          <para>The major section of the meat industry is pressing for the establishment of a public corporation to acquire, classify, market and promote the sale of meat in this country. Is it impossible for the Minister to consider that as a reasonable proposition? He has had it before him for a considerable period of time. I can tell the Minister now that if he is prepared to move in this area of the Government acquiring the meat industry and establishing a proper marketing authority, he will have the full support of the Labor movement. Such action would bring about a great degree of stability, and was one of the problems discussed when we considered the price of meat back in 1973 and 1974. While we might not have made that specific recommendation, those members of this Government who were members of that Committee will recall that the problems of the industry were to some extent associated with a lack of central control, co-ordination and classification. I am not asserting and would be the last to assert that livestock producers should have no say on such a corporation or livestock authority, but to assert that the other half of the industry, with its multi-million dollar investment, is not to be adequately represented is equally unacceptable. Clearly, what is required is a corporation which will be able to take up the challenges confronting the industry, and they are very sizeable challenges. </para>
          <para>As I have said, these 3 sectors of agriculture today have their backs to the wall. It seems to me that in 1976 the challenge comes more from the marketing side than from the production side, and I hope that I will have the nodding support of Government supporters on the other side of the chamber for that statement. It is no longer a question of production with which we are concerned but the problem of distribution. By and large, beef producers in Australia are able adequately, and efficiently to keep their end of the bargain so far as production is concerned. What we require is marketing skills to be able to penetrate new markets, maintain old ones and improve domestic consumption. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is required to establish a corporation which is not only representative but also satisfies the needs of the industry. I believe that the performance of a statutory corporation should be subject to constant public review. I would not want to support the mere establishment of a public corporation for the meat industry. We need a review apparatus and process upon which its performance from season to season and from day to day could be monitored, not in the way in which we see the voluminous annual reports coming to the Parliament which very few people read but in a way in which the industry, the employees and the consumers would have an opportunity to monitor the progress and the performance of the corporation. </para>
          <para>The recent decision of the Minister on the way in which the export quota to the United States of America is to be allocated may seriously disadvantage the industry in Tasmania and Northern Queensland, where the killing is seasonal. I raise that point only to indicate the need for this coordinated and central influence. I think it highlights the need for establishing a plan or a mechanism by which no sector of the industry is disadvantaged because of seasonal difficulties. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> will recall that in the earlier part of this year questions were asked of the industry itself about how some sectors were taking advantage of quotas in order to disadvantage others. There was a need for this central direction and co-ordination so that all sectors would have equal opportunity and access to the available markets. It seems to me that the Government has not adequately carried out its duty nor has it provided such a plan. All I can do is ask Government senators to start to bring pressure, to get committees in the Government working, to examine the ways in which a mechanism can be established which will do more to stabilise the industry and the income of the rural sector. </para>
          <para>I believe that it is in the area of distribution of agricultural products that this Government has to pay more attention. No longer is the market place providing adequate returns to producers at reasonable prices to consumers. The price to consumers moves almost regardless of the prices paid to producers. I have some figures from the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, and I think it is worth drawing to the attention of the Senate and of the community at large the variations which are taking place in relation to the beef producer, the beef industry, the returns available and the state of the industry. These figures relate to the share of the consumer dollar on a monthly basis, and they range from 1971 to 1975. 1 also have some late figures which came to me only today from the Legislative and Research Section of the Parliament which bring the information up to October 1976. The figures show an alarming state of affairs. In 1971 the average return to the beef producer, to the farmer, was 61c in the dollar, to the wholesaler 7c in the dollar, and to the retailer 32c in the dollar. In my view, that was a fairly equitable distribution of financial responsibility, having regard to the person who produces the article. In the following year there was not a great variation, although the farmer dropped down to 59c, the wholesaler to 5c and the retailer to 37c. When we come to the following year, 1 973- which was a Labor year so perhaps we ought to refer to it, because according to the conservatives of this country everything went bad- the farmer received 64c in the dollar, the wholesaler 7c and the retailer 30c. The position at the end of 1975 was that the farmer's share had dropped to 30c in the dollar, the wholesaler's share to 24c and the retailer's share to 46c. The latest figures show that those amounts have changed only marginally, although the return to the producer has improved. The percentage for beef and lamb is just a fraction over 40 per cent to the producer, with 25 per cent going to the wholesaler and approximately 34 per cent to the retailer. </para>

              <para>- I thank the Senate. What I find interesting is the way in which the white meat industry- and the only figures that I have are for pork- has maintained a general degree of stability. In the period from 1971 to October 1976 the producer received 63 per cent, in round figures, the wholesaler IS per cent and the retailer 2 1 per cent. I am sure my National Country Party colleagues would agree that if the beef producers were receiving 60 per cent of the consumer dollar they would probably not be very concerned about the success or otherwise of this legislation. I think it is correct that the Opposition should be examining the problems of distribution. The tendency of rural newspapers, the National Country Party and the conservatives generally is always to talk about wages as being the principal factor in this area. They have never given very much attention to the problems of costs involved in distribution, and I think it would be desirable if the Government parties or even the Senate itself were to put some of its time into an examination of those problems. I believe that it is in the field of distribution that the producer in so many areas of agricultural products requires a great deal of examination, change, and I imagine assistance. </para>

          <para>The market place is no longer providing adequate returns to producers at reasonable prices to consumers. We all remember what happened when the beef industry was having its heyday in 1973-74 and the price to the consumer was not a satisfactory one. The amount of red meat being consumed dropped quite considerably, to the advantage of the white meat industry. So the price to the consumer is an important factor. But the Government prefers to allow beef producers to be subjected to reconstruction examinations and maybe even bankruptcy rather than change its false dogma and blind acceptance of the market place as being the one and only arbiter in this area of agriculture- in fact, in the whole area of production. It seems to me that the stage has been reached in the Western world where production is not the problem that it was. It is now a question of being more able adequately to distribute the goods. I referred in a previous speech today to the fact that the Industries Assistance Commission has said that market forces themselves cannot solve these problems. </para>
          <para>If the beef industry is to obtain stability, which I am sure is the objective of honourable senators, and there are to be adequate returns for producers at reasonable cost to consumers there is a need . for planning. I know that planning is regarded as a naughty, dirty word, but I am afraid that if there is to be any stability in agriculture we have to have a real examination of the need for planning. There is a need for efficiency in the domestic and overseas distribution processes. There is a need for a uniform national plan which will not disadvantage one section of the industry merely because of its geographic location. It struck me as being rather unusual that when I was referring in the previous debate to the influence that the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme was having and to what it would mean in respect to the domestic markets on the mainland someone wanted to take it down in evidence and use it against me in the Tasmanian elections. That is a petty way in which to deal with these matters. I was referring to the fact that that change in one piece of government assistance has other influences which can be disastrous. I was not advocating it. I was drawing attention to the influence that it has, which is influence that could cause hardship to greater numbers of people. </para>
          <para>The industry can no longer afford the exorbitant profit margins to which I have referred in relation to the consumer dollar. One of my colleagues in the other place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry,</inline> has provided some figures on this subject. I will not quote the figures, but I suggest to honourable senators opposite that they look at the profitability of the meat processing companies, which must be making exorbitant profits, which is the only way in which they can be described, at the expense of the producer. The initiative must come from the Government. We cannot do very much in Opposition, except to use the forms of the Parliament that are available to us. The responsibility rests with the Government. It can commence by instituting a uniform classification system for all meat. It can continue with the establishment of a meat corporation which will unite- not divide- the industry and which, above all, will be capable and efficient. The Government has to get out of its thinking and its decision-making the concern it has about giving handouts by way of tax incentives and concessions. I do not believe from my discussions with the rural sector leaders that that is what they are after. They are looking for a fundamental approach. </para>
          <para>After one year in office the Government has made no significant reduction in the rate of inflation. The deficit is greater. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> has borrowed a considerable sum of money overseas- in excess of $1 billion- to prop up our reserves. There has been a big reduction in our reserves. There has been a reduction of $189m in the allocations to the rural sector from last year's Budget and almost all the specific promises to the rural sector have yet to materialise. I think it would make for a useful weekend's reading if we were to produce for honourable senators a catalogue showing all of the promises and statements in the speeches of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> in 1975. It would make for very good comic capers for honourable senators to see the way in which they made numerous promises and set out to apportion all blame to the Labor Government. None of their specific promises has materialised. I do not think the Government can afford to blame the Whitlam Government, the trade union movement or certain governments overseas for its own failures to accept its responsibilities. Unless the Government adopts a much more reasoned approach to these problems, I believe that the ballot box might produce some interesting results in a couple of year's time. In the meantime the Opposition supports this legislation. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the States Grants (Beef Industry) Amendment Bill, which is before the Senate. I am glad that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> has indicated that the Opposition also supports this measure. Any measures that are referable to the beef industry in this country are extraordinarily important. Let me say very briefly of the Bill itself that it is in some measure an expansion of the capacity of the legislation that previously has been before us. It enables an amount of some $ 15m to be available as carry-on finance to the Australian beef industry up to the end of June 1977. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There are one or two significant recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission that have been accepted and built into this legislation. They comprise, briefly, the fact that the limit of $15,000 which was previously available for only a year and which previously applied only to Queensland is now to be available over a period of 2 years and is now to apply to the entire pastoral zone in Australia. The other amount that is to be available- a limit of $10,000 per annum per <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> beef producer- is to be available within any zone in the Australian beef producing area. Again it is to be available over 2 years instead of only one. It is important that we recognise that in this legislation the States have already in almost total measure agreed to comply with the dollar for dollar basis and with reference to the amounts involved. </para>
          <para>Before I proceed very briefly to mention something of the industry itself, I make mention of one or two matters to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> referred. He said that the great objective should be to find new markets and to increase old ones. No one on earth- certainly no one in Australia is going to object to that suggestion. Of course that is the objective that is fundamentally the real way of escape, the real manner in which success can be achieved in this great industry. But there are other matters. There are questions relative to cost and to matters within the marketing field that are not just as simple as it is to say that all one has to do is seek more markets. There are great problems relative to the final establishment of a livestock and meat marketing corporation. Virtually everybody in the industry would agree that classification is a desirable circumstance, but there are enormous problems in implementing it as a measure of the marketing system. The Government has this matter under close scrutiny, as has every organisation that has relevance to the beef producing industry in </para>
          <para class="block">Australia. We certainly recognise these matters of marketing as being fundamental. </para>
          <para>Classification and the establishment of a meat marketing corporation are matters which are receiving the absolute maximum of attention. So they should. It is only with a proper consensus of the whole industry that we can hope to achieve any form of real success in this area. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> mentioned a public corporation having powers of classification and acquisition. Of course, that is getting into pretty deep water, because one of the problems with meat, as with any product that is not easily kept is being able to stockpile it realistically and in a form in which it retains its attractiveness to the markets around the world. This is an obvious and extraordinary problem. If we can grapple with it and solve it, then the problems that confront the Australian beef industry are relatively small. </para>
          <para>I noted also that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> mentioned the suggestion that the Minister for Primary Industry make reference to the Japanese of Australian fishing rights in the context of Japan's withdrawal from the importation of a significant amount of beef. He said that that was wielding a big stick and we should not be wielding a big stick because we are a relatively small nation, whether from the point of view of population, consumption or whatever. Of course that is very true. Nevertheless, the approach was reasonable to make. It was reasonable to make that point. If you accept the view that negotiation is a proper thing and then say it is no good negotiating because someone is bigger than you are, you are in a cleft stick and there will be no negotiation at all. So it is quite proper that we should use what significant forces we can muster in negotiating with the Japanese over this problem. The further approaches of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> to the Japanese have made it fairly evident that there is a strong possibility of Japan reassessing and perhaps amending its beef imports in early 1977. So the approach and the negotiations have not by any means been a worthless exercise. </para>
          <para>It is true that 4 per cent- a low rate of interest, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> described it- was the rate of interest on the carry-on finance that was available during the Australian Labor Party's term of Government, as it continues to be under the present Government. That 4 per cent for carry-on finance for the beef industry is a relatively, and properly, low interest rate. It is interesting to remember also that the Labor Government offered to the beef industry through the Commonwealth Development Bank an amount of $28m in additional aid which was taken up at a very slow rate, if in fact it was taken up in total. That amount of money was offered at a commercial rate of interest to an industry that was in pretty dire straits. </para>
          <para>When this legislation becomes law it will mean that up to the end of June 1977 there will be available to the Australian beef industry in carry-on finance at 4 per cent interest about $27.3m to be matched by the States. The terms and conditions of the money have been considerably liberalised in this legislation. If a producer is outside the zone or is in some way outside the context of the legislation he still has an opportunity to apply to the loan administering authority for special conditions and special consideration. </para>
          <para>I do not want to say more than that about the Bill itself. It is significant. It gives an industry that is in dire straits some sort of solid background and some hope for the months ahead. It has recently been assessed that of the 50 000 <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> beef producers in Australia only some 1 8 000 are viable in that they earn in the vicinity of $5,000 a year or more. Some 1 1 500 earn between no income and $5,000. A further 13 000 are losing up to $5,000 annually and 7500 are losing more than $5,000 annually. So there is a crisis in this industry, and it is due to several things. Many of them are largely outside the control of governments. I do not want it to be imagined that the difficulties of the beef producing industry in Australia are such that it should be suggested that this is an untenable enterprise or that it has no real significance in the future of this country. The beef industry has a great potential for employment and for earning overseas credits. It is an industry which is significant in the employment of men on the producing properties, in the transport system, the meat works, the processing works, the wholesale business, the retail business, and so on. </para>
          <para>It has great significance in that area and it has a significance in earning overseas credits which, even at their lowest point, amounted to some $500m. In their heyday these earnings were in excess of $1 billion. The industry is certainly a tenable industry. It is going through very difficult times and it has had a sad recent history. In very recent times it has seen the impossibility of getting through tariff barriers into the European Economic Community. It has seen its market in Japan fall in a year from 100 000 tonnes to 8000 tonnes. That is the sort of problem that has confronted the industry. The industry itself had no answer to that sort of situation. It has had quota problems relative to political situations and lobbying in the United States of America, Canada and other parts of the world. It seeks new markets. It must find new markets, but it must re-establish basic traditional markets if it is to survive and grow as it should. </para>
          <para>It would be wrong of me if, besides highlighting market problems, I did not mention the cost situation in the Australian beef cattle industry. We have seen an extraordinary escalation of costs in this industry of which all the people involved, particularly the workers in transport, the processing industry and the meatworks should be aware. In a single year, 1974-75, the cost of processing meat in Australia increased by some 81 per cent. In the previous 3 years, it had increased significantly by 74 per cent, but in one year the increase was 81 per cent as against an average over the previous 3 years of about 25 per cent. That is the sort of escalation that no industry can stand and that certainly the people who work in the industry at every point cannot stand. Their capacity to survive is virtually being destroyed. On both sides of this Parliament and through the integrated beef cattle industry in Australia there is recognition of the disastrous situation that that cost structure is producing. It is producing a situation in which producers are tending to become bankrupt and in which the consumers are paying infinitely more for meat than they should be paying. </para>
          <para>We must seek to reduce the gap that exists between the price that is paid on the farm and the price that is paid at the retail outlet. To do this we have to recognise the importance of bringing into the industry all those technological advantages that can make it a more productive industry and indeed a cheaper and more effective industry. </para>
          <para>We, as a government, have implemented the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations by suspending the export levy on beef and by increasing the money to be spent on the eradication of brucellosis and tuberculosis. We are seeking desperately to establish new markets. We are seeking desperately to increase our traditional markets. In some real measure the problems which confront this industry stem from, among other things, a measure of overconfidence that was born of the 1973-74 period when beef prices in this country reached an all time high. That circumstance was contributed to probably by practically everybody involved, politically or economically, in the industry. It was not an unreal consideration that the industry did have a buoyant future at that time. No one was to foresee the energy crisis, for instance, and the effect that it would have on the demand for Australian beef in some of our most important traditional markets; nevertheless, that overconfidence did tend to bring a measure of overproduction and it did tend to bring about the use in the beef cattle producing industry in this country of areas of land which basically were not suited to the industry. So there has to be, and I believe there is coming about, something of a rationalisation at the producer level. </para>
          <para>Having made those few reflections on this industry and having reiterated once again the immense importance of it from the point of view of employment, from the point of view of overseas credits and from the mere point of view that Australia produces some of the finest beef herds in the world, has some of the finest cattle producing country in the world and is a relatively economic producer at the producer level, I submit that it is absolutely imperative that we as a government do everything in our power to maintain and develop this industry and to see it ride out the rough passage that it is certainly in. This legislation is part of the process of riding out that rough passage. </para>

            <para>-The Bill before us enables the Commonwealth Government to provide up to $ 15m on a dollar for dollar matching basis with the States for beef carry-on loans in the current year. Quite frankly, it is a somewhat miserly sum compared with what the beef industry received over the last full year in which the Labor Party was in office. The Labor Government in its last year in office provided to the beef industry $2 8m by way of Commonwealth Bank funds- that was granted in December 1974- $ 19.6m from Government funds in April 1 975, and $ 1 .2m to Northern Territory producers, making a grand total of $48.8m. That is why I believe that the present Government has been somewhat tardy in that it has had 12 months in office and at this point in time the beef producers are to receive a miserly $ 1 5m. This is $ 1 5m from a Government that pretends to be the farmers ' friend. I say 'pretends ' in the light of statements which were made by the present Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> during the last 12 months in which the Labor Party was in office. I will give a couple of examples. A statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> to the Queanbeyan-Canberra branch of the Graziers Association of New South Wales in October last year was reported as follows: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">We all have a pretty fair idea of what has happened to that prophecy when we talk about beef and particularly the American market. </para>
          <para class="block">Somewhat unscrupulous exporters, who no doubt were in league with their counterpart importers in America, were caught sending meat into the United States against the law, resulting of course in cuts in Australia's export quota to America- a country which traditionally has taken more than SO per cent of our meat exports. </para>
          <para>Speaking of exports brings me to another point. Whilst Australian meat producers have been pushed into a corner over the last couple of years, to a stage where, because of low prices giveaway prices- third grade beef cattle have been shot and buried, both on and off the farm; where the prices for cattle have been so low that farmers have shot or allowed to die cattle which were in any way ill rather than send for the veterinary surgeon, because of the expense involved; and where saleyards throughout the country were inundated with livestock which were given away from almost daylight until after dark. The farming community, the producers of those animals, have gone from relative affluence to abject poverty. At the same time there has been one other section of the industry that has gone from strength to strength. That section of course is the meat exporting section. This matter was highlighted in another place by the honourable member for Fraser, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry.</inline> I do not intend to §o into any great detail about it. Anyone who is interested in it can read the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 9 November. In that speech <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry</inline> produced figures which he obtained from the Research Service of the Parliamentary Library and which showed that in 1975-76 exporting companies had increased profits by anything from 60 per cent to 400 per cent. </para>
          <para>I feel that this proves that those farmers who stood and watched their cattle being shot or given away at the saleyards and who had that gut feeling at the time that they were being ripped off were right. They were being ripped off, and I believe that they were being ripped off basically because the Australian meat industry is not organised. In fact, it is totally disorganised. Totally disorganised is the way many people engaged in the beef industry have wanted it to be, do want it to be and will want it to be, because whilst the industry itself is disorganised powerful sections in the industry are able, because they themselves are organised, to rip off the producer and to make profits for themselves. In effect, they rip off the great bulk of any money that is to be made in the industry and throw the crumbs to the producer. </para>
          <para>Such organisations as the National Country Party and stock and station agents scream socialism if beef producers, or any other farmers for that matter, dare to question the auction system or any other facet of the industry which has been and is considered traditional. Of course, even the farmers at times are victims of this system of total free enterprise and of disorganisation within their own industry. I think that is quite common knowledge amongst meat exporting firms. Because of that disorganisation they at times can be the victims of exploitation through our <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> approach to overseas marketing of our meat. Because we have a multiplicity of exporting firms selling overseas, importing firms in other countries are able to pick off one firm and play it against the others. That is quite a common practice in the meat industry, as an honest manager of any exporting firm will tell you. </para>
          <para>The same sort of situation prevails in the meat industry today as prevailed for some years prior to 1947 when the Australian wheat industry was organised and when the Australian Wheat Board became the body totally responsible for exporting and selling our wheat on overseas markets. Those people who had previously exploited the farmer were pushed aside. They were certainly pushed aside from the wheat industry. Of course, they still continued to rip-off the producers in other areas of primary industry. </para>
          <para>Quite frankly, I remain totally convinced that one answer to the problem facing the Australian beef industry today is to establish a statutory body- the Meat Board could perform this function to utilise the present powers to sell on the overseas markets to the exclusion of private enterprise so that any private meat marketing firm overseas which wants to import into its country Australian beef, or Australian meat for that matter, will have to do so through the authority and pay the going rate. In that way it would not be able to telephone Thomas Borthwick and Sons (Australasia) Limited at 4 o'clock in the afternoon and ask at what price it could purchase blade-bone steak or something else to send to America. Then the Australian firm would ring back the American firm to say: 'Yes, we have got X amount of meat here which you can have at X cents per lb'. It could be told by the overseas company: 'I am sorry, we have been to another company which can do it for 32c per lb'. That is the way in which those firms traditionally have beaten down the price around the Australian countryside. Of course, it is the Australian producer who finishes up with the backside out of his trousers. </para>
          <para>The  chairman  of the pastoral division of the Victorian Farmers Union raised this matter in an article in the magazine <inline font-style="italic">Victorian Farmer</inline> of October last. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crowe</inline> said: </para>

              <para>- Prior to the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I was quoting from a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Des</inline> Crowe, the  chairman  of the meat committee of the Victorian Farmers Union. I was only half way through the article in question, so I shall now continue. It states: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The licensed exporters to this point of time seem to be unaware of the disruption that can be caused to the Australian meat industry should they overstep the mark in any export area relevant to the U.S. quota. </para>
            <para>The recent action by meat exporters only serves to highlight the urgent need expressed by the VFU- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the Victorian Farmers Union- and AWMPF- </para>
          <para class="block">That is the Australian Wool and Meat Producers Federation- for the establishment of a new Meat and Livestock Corporation with producer membership majority as soon as possible in order to organise the livestock and meat industry. </para>
          <para>The livestock producer pays for the running of the Australian Meat Board and should have a major say in the destiny of his product, which he takes from one to three years to produce, ' <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crowe</inline> said. </para>
          <para>The VFU is anxious that the Federal Government establish a meat industry conference consisting of representatives of the producer organisations and with a similar structure to the Australian Wool Industry Conference. </para>
          <para class="block">I do not necessarily go along with everything that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crowe</inline> has to say in that statement, particularly when he calls for a majority of producers on any statutory body, but I believe he has put his finger on the pulse of one of the biggest problems currently besetting the beef industry. </para>
          <para>Finally I come to marketing generally, I suppose in relation to primary products overall, but in this instance in relation to the meat industry in particular. In 1960 the Australian Cattle and Beef Research Committee was established. In 1966 its charter was extended to include sheep meats also. Last year that body spent over $4.5m of producers' and taxpayers' funds on a great range of research projects some of which, in my opinion, in the current over-supply situation could only be described as way out. Whilst one realises that research cannot be turned on and off like a tap, I believe that in some areas some of the research that is being paid for by producers and the taxpayer could well be phased out and the question of marketing could take a higher priority. </para>

              <para>-Well, I have been through the research committee's more recent report, and, as I say, it would be hard to pick out some of the things that could be phased out. Quite frankly, when one looks at the problems that the industry currently has and has had in the past and will continue to have in relation to marketing, I do not believe that enough stress has been given to this area of the industry over the years. I hold the opinion that, unless something is done and more stress is placed on marketing, the meat industry will be in the doldrums for a long time or will suffer severe ups and downs, troughs and peaks. I simply suggest to the Meat Industry Research Committee that they should look very hard at this money that is being spent. It is a lot of money- $4.5m in one year. I suggest to them that some of that money may be better expended on some research on meat marketing. Honourable senators know as well as I know that it is from the time that the produce leaves the farm gate and arrives on the consumer's table that the great profits are made. Regrettably, the farmer does not partake of those profits. As we all know, over the years he has been content, like every other producer, to be finished with the produce when it goes out of the farm gate. He allows other people to rip him off. The consumer is in the same position. I believe that some solution to this problem will only be brought about by a lot more money being expended in that marketing area. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>All of us who have been involved in the meat industry know that despite the problems that the meat producer is confronted with and despite all the diseases, etc., with which the industry is fraught, the Australian farmer, because of his approach to the industry, because of his efficiency, wins out. That has been proved by the massive increase in our herd numbers over the more recent years. I think, from memory, the figure has risen from 24 million to 32 million or 33 million head of cattle. That surely indicates that at this point in time research has done a very good job. The farmer, as a beneficiary of that research, has also been able to do a very good job. But as I said earlier, once the produce goes out through the farm gate the farmer is no longer in control, and that is when he is ripped off. I finish on that point- that that is an area where the farmer may well put a little bit more pressure on his industry generally to have, as I have said two or three times, more work done in the area of marketing. </para>

            <para>- I also rise to support the Bill. I look optimistically to the results of the expenditure of the $15m for which the Bill provides. A week or so ago I think I would have had grave doubts as to whether increasing the debt was the right thing to do at this time. However, I now believe that with the slight changes that have occurred we have to look ahead with more optimism. We have to try to make sure that the money is spent in a manner that will provide results for the people who are spending it. </para>

          <para>I should like to add to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> said earlier about the survey that was carried out. An article in <inline font-style="italic">Stock and Land</inline> of 1 8 November under the heading 'Beef survey shows situation' states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If beef prices doubled tomorrow, a quarter of Australia's specialist beef producers would still be going broke. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>A sum of $ 15m is certainly not going to assist a very large percentage of that number. The article continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>With prices at current levels, two-thirds of producers relying mainly on beef for their livelihood are unviable. </para>

            <para class="block">Beef survey shows situation </para>
            <para>If beef prices doubled tomorrow, a quarter of Australia's specialist beef producers would still be going broke. </para>
            <para>With prices at current levels, two-thirds of producers relying mainly on beef for their livelihood are unviable. </para>
            <para>The full scale of the disaster confronting the Australian beef industry is highlighted in an internal report prepared for the Australian National Cattlemen's Council by some of the country's top rural economists. </para>
            <para>The report focuses on the prospects and fates of the 50 383 producers in Australia who rely on beef for more than half their annual income. </para>
            <para>It looks at all producers in this category who run more than 50 head. It defines a viable producer as one whose net cash income (before tax) is $5,000 or more. </para>
            <para>These 50000 odd producers own 23 million cattle between them- more than two-thirds of the total bovine population. </para>
            <para>Thirty-two thousand of these beef producers are not viable at the present prices of around 45c a kg. </para>
            <para>The Acc survey looks at the situation of beef producers in four separate categories. Preliminary figures show: 1 8 300 producers are viable, and earn more than $5,000 a year. They run 10 million cattle with an average debt a beast of $25, and have an average herd size of 566 head. 1 1 000 producers, representing three million head and averaging 276 a heard, are earning between $0 and $5,000 a year. Their debt a beast is $23. 13 500 producers are losing between $0 and $5,000 a year. They represent three million head of cattle and have an average heard size of 210. Their average debt a beast is $43. 7600 producers are losing more than $5,000 a year. They represent seven million cattle and have an average heard of 905 head. Their debt a beast of $39.70. </para>
            <para>Thus it can be seen that it is the smallest and the largest scale beef producers, the latter concentrated chiefly in the pastoral zones, who are facing the gravest threat. </para>
            <para>ANCC took the survey a step further by projecting how many producers would be viable if beef prices lifted to 96c a kg; the answer was 28 700 of the 50 000. </para>
            <para>At 96c a kg, there would still be at least 12 000 beef producers who would be losing money. </para>
            <para>The message here is clear,' says Acc executive officer Baden Cameron. 'Many producers are pinning their hopes on some great marketing scheme to lift returns and ensure the survival of the industry. </para>
            <para>But while we desperately need a good marketing scheme, the unfortunate truth is that it still would not guarantee the survival of a very large part of our specialist and beef dominant producers. ' </para>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cameron</inline>said for these producers the only possible solution would be the implementation of household support and other reconstruction schemes aimed at helping them to recover financial equilibrium. </para>
            <para>He expressed optimism that the Federal Government's new rural reconstruction proposals, currently before the States, would contain some help. </para>
            <para>It is understood that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics is currently holding a crash investigation into the plight of enviable beef producers, and should produce further statistics in the near future. </para>
            <para>There are estimated to be 130000 individual rural producers in Australia who run cattle in one form or another but the SO 000 covered by the Acc investigation clearly represent the concentration of expertise and specialisation in the industry. </para>
            <para>According to the Bureau of Statistics, there are 33 032 rural holdings in Australia devoted mainly to beef production. </para>

              <para>- In the main, I think that urban dwellers generally have come to regard farmers as being wealthy, that farmers usually think the processors are wealthy, and that usually the housewife thinks that everybody else is wealthy or is making too much profit. To show what the position is in Tasmania I sought costs from a retail butcher and an export abattoir. I found that an ordinary retail butcher running an average establishment spends 31.56c per lb on the meat between the time he buys it and the time it goes out of his shop. This represents $ 146.24 per beast on an average sized beast, plus the price of the beast. At present, those cattle are costing, say, $80 and it is costing $146.24 from the time he buys the beast until the time he sells it.

			<para>The retail meat industry suffers the same cost factors as other sections of the total industry. High capital investment, labour intensive, low profit level. </para>
			<para class="block">What is an average retail butchering outlet </para>
			<para>This is and will continue to be a hotly debated subject. Two years ago the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian Countryman</inline> published a productivity level of 750 lb meat per butcher per week. The <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> newspaper later published a productivity level of 850 lb meat per man. In the demonstration carried out at the Elliott Research Farm on 2 April 1975 a productivity level of 1000 lb per man per week was put forward. </para>
			<para>For the purpose of this exercise we are going to consider the average retail outlet at 1200 lb per man per week with the assistance of a cashier, wrapper, bookkeeper. This poundage of meat per man would allow some quantity of home freezer bulk meat. </para>
			<para>The first known cost to the retail butcher is the cost of livestock. </para>
			<para>In productivity analysis, costing and pricing consideration must be given to the recovery level of beef which is 66 per cent average saleable meat from a good quality carcase. This demonstrates that small yield percentages of carcase weight cuts must be higher priced than larger yield percentages, e.g. fillet steak 1 per cent yield, rump 4 per cent yield of carcase weight. </para>

            <para>- The same situation applies to the export abattoirs. It costs $4 1 .90 per head to have the beast slaughtered. It costs $27.24 in fixed overheads, making a total average processing cost of $69.14. These figures apply to export meat. The figures I have obtained indicate that on an average cost of $70, the cost per head was $ 1 39.90 for export meat on which, at present, the return is $87.12 and on which the average operator in Tasmania is currently losing $42.78 per beast. If the farmers were being paid what the exporters can get they would currently be paying $17.98 per head or 4.64c per lb. Converting this into overhead costs, the wages for export cattle are running at 17.52c per lb on meat produced with an overhead of 1 1.03c per lb or 28.55c per lb on meat produced. With cattle on the boned-out quantity of 28.64c per lb, it means that the cost of the meat at the exporter's door is 57.19c per lb. I seek leave to incorporate these figures also in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>- I seek to have these documents incorporated as a means of saving time. I thought this would be preferable to reading them at great length. In spite of these costs it has been generally considered that the exporters are making huge profits. In another place an honourable member, whose name I will not recall, made substantial charges about rip-offs and named several firms which he accused of making unfair or undue profits. He did not, of course, at any stage indicate what he considered to be a reasonable profit or what he thought a reasonable return should be. Nor did he mention the amount of capital involved in securing the return. The first firm he named was F. J. Walker Ltd. He made various remarks about that company. He said that over the 8-year period he nominated that firm had a turnover of $584.7m in sales which produced a gross profit of $3. 82m, representing 0.67c in the dollar on turnover. I do not really believe it is reasonable that a firm operating on that volume of turnover could operate on a much finer margin than that and still stay in business. </para>

              <para>- The next firm which the honourable member made various remarks about was Tancred Bros, which, over the same 8-year period, showed an average profit of 1.2c in the dollar. I did not work the rest of the figures out. I just worked out those two sets of figures to see whether the claims that were made were correct. I consider the returns to the farmer but there will be no return to the farmer if we continue to lose the processors at the rate we have been losing them through bankruptcy. The success of the farmer is entirely dependent upon the success of the exporter. Without the exporter the farmer will make nothing. </para>

          <para>Australians are eating the cheapest meat in the world. In fact, they are eating the cheapest food in the world. Practically nowhere else is as little of the income dollar spent on food. Food producers generally are subsidising consumers generally and it is not the processors or the butchers in the meat industry who are making all the money. The loans provided in this Bill will help in the cash flow situation and in the carry-on situation. Costs have increased by 34.5 per cent over the last 3 years coupled with an income loss of 61.4 per cent over the same period. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics records this as a loss of $1,8 16m. Devaluation is certain to help a little but it will not turn the corner. It may help to restore a little confidence but the marketing of the meat generally is still not good enough. </para>
          <para>The Australian Meat Board has failed to give producers or exporters the confidence necessary to go ahead and plan in the long term. On many occasions there have been changes which were very hard to follow, with little explanation as to why they were made. Producers and processors alike find it difficult to engage in long term planning when they are provided with only short term measures. In that regard I welcome the changes that were made today allowing greater equity for the seasonal works and the re inclusion of Japan, Okinawa and Sweden in the income entitlement earning countries. The Meat Board has been giving a lot of verbal encouragement to exporters to engage in the risk markets but they are entering the risk markets without sufficient protection. If the risk markets are to perform the function we should like them to perform, I do not think it is unreasonable that the Meat Board should provide greater protection. </para>
          <para>This year we have seen what happened to the Canadian market and the Puerto Rican market. In these instances it is my interpretation that basically the exporters were left virtually high and dry by the Meat Board when the crunch came. In the Primary Industry newsletter of 10 November the  Chairman  of the Australian Meat Board,  Colonel Malcolm  McArthur, said that he was right behind private enterprise in the meat trade and would be ready to stand by to help if needed. If they happen to get into a hole we will help them, that's the Board's role . . . and if there is any price cutting we will step in . . . </para>
          <para class="block">That is what he said, but my interpretation of the situation as I have seen it is that it has not really worked out that way. I think we have to look at what we can do to make the role of the Board much more satisfactory. We have to try to see what we can do to get the growers and the Board to have greater understanding with the exporters. The way it stands at the moment, every time there is uncertainty, every time there are any risks to run or every time questions are asked to which answers are not available, it is reflected immediately in the price of the beast in the saleyard. I believe that this is where the greatest loss to the farmer exists. If we can get a little continuity, confidence and regular trading, that situation will be improved. With this last flicker, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> said recently, it cost him $50 a head in the saleyards at Wodonga the next day. </para>

              <para>-He was selling. This is the way the market reacts. We have to try to ensure that at least we take out some of the bumps. At present all sorts of manoeuvres are being worked upon. With the restructuring of the Board and the greater market control that we are looking for, plus, I hope, the introduction of some reasonable measure of classification, I think we will be able to do more not only for the 34 million cattle that are involved but also for the 130000 people who run cattle for either their whole livelihood or their main livelihood and for the 300-odd meat processors who are involved, all of whom are the basis of what is one of Australia's largest industries. Until we can get this little bit of solidity and understanding, the industry will continue to flounder along from highs to lows, without the people in the industry really knowing what they are looking for. In the meantime 1 look for the result that the $15m, coupled with a similar amount from the States, may provide. I support the BUI. </para>

            <para>- As other speakers on this Bill have indicated, the purpose of the Bill is to amend legislation enacted under the Labor Government to provide $15m to match the States dollar for dollar in approved lending in 1976-77 under the beef carry-on finance scheme. I would call this a scheme to provide low interest finance to specialist beef producers who would be viable in normal market conditions. I find the amount of $15m very interesting. It has been indicated earlier that in August 1975 the present Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> when talking about the Labor Bill, said that $39.6m was not enough and that the National Country Party suggested that $100m was necessary. Now that that Party has the opportunity to provide funds, we find that it is suggesting that $15m will be sufficient. I think it would be agreed by all honourable senators that the situation in Australia is much worse now than it was in August 1975. This deterioration has been brought about to a degree by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair's</inline> action in Canada earlier this year and by actions of the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, in Washington.

I think it is fair to say that the Northern Territory is different from the rest of Australia for a number of reasons. Perhaps we can look at the reasons why the Territory is different and why it needs different treatment. The first is that the Territory beef producer is basically in a monoculture situation. The majority of beef producers in Australia, as honourable senators would know, have either mixed or alternative properties either cattle running with wheat, sheep, dairy cows, dealers and so on, or cattle running in conjunction with cropping, such as sorghum in Queensland. Where there is this sort of diversification the producer does not have all his eggs in the one basket, as one might say, and he is not as hard hit when the industry collapses. In the Territory producers produce beef or nothing. When beef fails the people are really in trouble. </para>
          <para>The second problem- I call it a problem because I think it is a problem- is the dependence on the United States market. In the Territory 95 per cent of the industry is concerned with export marketing and the bulk of the exports go to the </para>
          <para class="block">United States, mainly in what is called the 'certain class' of beef which is desired by the United States. Of course, that is a very fickle market. If that particular market for that certain class of beef goes, the industry is in trouble. The second reason why I think it is a problem that we are related so much to the United States is that United States standards of slaughtering are very high. I am not critical of this; but, as I shall explain later, this has an effect within the industry. </para>
          <para>Another problem for the Northern Territory is that the beef industry is seasonal. That means that there is a cash flow only during the dry season. The cost of slaughtering in the Northern Territory is much higher. Figures given to me by one of the producers indicate that in 1975 slaughtering cost $83.60 in the slaughter house or the abattoirs. There are problems associated with seasonal workers. These people have to be accommodated, have to be brought in from interstate and have to have particular conditions negotiated for them. This all adds to the problems in the Northern Territory. It is not a stable situation. Of course, as the industry is seasonal, it cannot take advantage of market fluctuations. There are vast distances to be covered in the Northern Territory. I know that this problem is shared by Queensland and Western Australia, but only to a degree. I think it would be agreed that the majority of producers in Queensland would be nearer the abattoirs than are most of the producers in the Territory. Certainly, there are vast distances to be covered, compared with those in the southern States. </para>
          <para>I should like to commend the Government for the fact that the Minister for Primary Industry did make available to the producers in the Northern Territory 25 per cent of the freight costs, which is a great help to the producers. I think that that figure might rise in some areas to 50 per cent. As I said before, different conditions exist in the Northern Territory; therefore the problems require different treatment. I shall come back to that a little later. Let us look at the situation today. We have had 2 good seasons in the Northern Territory, yet we have declining markets. I should like to read a telegram which is a little abrupt but which gives the story. The following is taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory Rural News Magazine:</inline></para>
          <quote>
            <para>The economist for the Northern Territory Primary Producers Board says that it can be seen that there have been dramatic increases in labour costs, freight charges and fixed costs, that is, administration and finance, overhead, depreciation, maintenance, stores, selling expenses and katherine freezing storage. While these cost factors soared the price paid for beef on the U.S. market has risen only IS cents per kg since 1969, from 89 cents in 1969 to 104 cents a kilo in 197$. The result has been that while producers received 62.08 per cent of the price paid for their beef in 1 969, in 1 975 they scored only 1 8.77 per cent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So not only have the markets deteriorated but also there has been a decline in the return. This decline in markets has led to a serious situation, which would be known to many honourable senators here, of too many cattle in the Territory. Most of the properties have too many cattle, are overstocked and have all the problems which go with overstocking. It was mentioned by one of the honourable senators who spoke this afternoon that there was encouragement given by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> a few years ago for people to build up the cattle numbers on their properties. At the moment, since we cannot sell these cattle, we have all the problems that go with overstocking- destruction of pastures, erosion and se on. So I repeat that not only have the markets not improved, they have declined, but also the return to the producer is much less than it was 6 years ago. So it is not surprising to learn that most of the pastoralists in the North era Territory are in a debt situation. They need cash flow at present and I will come to that in a moment. </para>
          <para>The degree of the problem in the Territory might be assessed more easily if we note that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics has revealed that there was a loss of $ 1 3m in the industry in 1975-76. Unfortunately the result of this is that management on properties is being wound down. Fences that ought to be repaired are not being repaired. Pasture that ought to be looked after and improved is not being looked after let alone being improved, and there is no attempt at stock improvement. The situation is so drastic that one of the senior officers of the department said to me that there is a possibility of returning to an almost no management situation with no fences and the stock running wild. Men all over the Territory are leaving their stations to the bank and walking off. I had another letter today from one of the leading pastoralists in the Territory indicating that yet another group of men had been forced to walk off their properties and leave them to the bank. This means a loss of skills to the Territory. People who have worked in the Territory for years and have built up great expertise in the beef industry are walking off and it is very unlikely that they will be coming back. So we have a situation today where there is a general feeling of lack of confidence and this is not surprising. </para>
          <para>Let me sum up briefly the reasons for this lack of confidence. Firstly, access to markets is being restricted despite devaluation. Secondly, shipping freights are continually rising. It has been indicated that most freights to the United States will rise by 22 per cent on top of the 12 per cent announced in October. This will make it almost impossible for producers in the Territory to ship out to the United States. The cost of food, fertilisers, veterinary supplies and so on are all increasing at present and despite the fact that people involved in the industry are Country Party people there is a lack of confidence in the current Government's handling of the economy. My feeling is that in the Territory, and this has been put to me by a number of people, there is a lack of confidence in long range planning. We must plan at least two or three years ahead when running a station and when we have a limited killing season we can have no confidence in the Government. </para>
          <para>Most people would sum up the major problem in the Northern Territory in one word- 'markets ' -and this was suggested on both sides of the House during the debate. But it is not only that. I want to make the point quite strongly that responsibility for finding markets lies with the Department of the Northern Territory or the Government, because the Government is the Department of the Northern Territory. The department has to admit that over the years very Little, if anything, has been done by it to find markets and the reason for this of course is that it does not have the staff to do the job. It is no criticism of the department if it does not have the staff. Let us look at some of the possibilities that could be investigated in the Northern Territory. In 1974 an Egyptian living in Katherine, who is known to a number of Territory people and is now an Australian citizen, went home to Egypt for a holiday. When he came back he made the suggestion to the cattle producers around the Katherine area that they should sell to Egypt and that they should kill the cattle according to the religious traditions of the Islamic faith- because there was a good market in Egypt. Unfortunately, for some reason the Katherine meat works was not interested. The Cattlemen's Association went cold and Western Australia got the market, not that I deny it to Western Australia. It went out and looked for it. </para>
          <para>The Northern Territory needed this market and could have done a lot with it. Unfortunately, producers in the Territory got the feeling from this exercise that the public servants were not really interested in the industry and this feeling pervades a number of associations in the Territory. It is a great pity that this opportunity was lost. Surely it is an indication that the Department of the Northern Territory and the pastoralists should work together to look for markets. Obviously it is not enough for just the department to do it. The pastoralists are the ones who are particularly interested. Let them get together and go looking for markets. We are very close to Asia. Surely we could send a small team to look at the possibility of markets over there. The information that has been given to me is that there is a possibility of 7500 tonnes being sold on the Asian market. This would be basically in small lots but 7500 tonnes is quite an amount and would help the industry in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>I now come back to the problem I hinted at before, the high cost of killing. The figure given to me was $83.60 and this was based on United States standards. The Katherine meatworks did not have an automatic plant. Perhaps we could look at the possibility of killing by Australian standards. If these are acceptable to Australia they should be acceptable to Asia. There is one pastoralist in the Northern Territory who is selling buffalo on the South Australian market at 23.5c a pound and making a profit. Perhaps we could look at the technique that he is using to see whether it could be transferred to the other areas of the beef industry. So let us look into the possibility of selling beef to Asia. </para>
          <para>Another area which certainly could be investigated is the possibility of live exports. I attended a meeting two or three weeks ago which was called at the insistence of the Australian Meat Industry Employees Union to have a look at the possibility of selling livestock overseas. The department was represented, the buyers were represented, there was one pastoralist and one member of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I was there representing the Australian Labor Party. It seemed to me to be an excellent way for the industry to have a look at itself for the buyers, the producers and the unions to get together to see what could be done. The information given to us there was that there is a potential market for 25 000 beasts a year. Certainly there would have to be some assistance given by the Government. The excellent wharf which used to be at Darwin was pulled down a few years ago. To replace it would cost $100,000 including providing permanent races and yard facilities. Portable facilities could be set up for $50,000. It seems to me that the Government might look into that matter as an excellent investment and as a way of getting some of the cattle moving out of the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>Another suggestion which was made to me by one pastoralist in the Northern Territory, and it might make some people smile, is flying out the surplus young cattle. Apparently the possibility is there. For about $100 a head we could send the young stock overseas. This would of course include some breeding stock. </para>

              <para>- It was Prendiville in this case. This is something that might be worthwhile looking at. I move now to one of the problems in the industry and that is the meatworks or abattoirs. I will look basically at the Northmead works near Katherine which, as most honourable senators will know, is 46 per cent owned by the Hooker Corporation and at the present time is run by the Wyndham group. The meatworks at Katherine has been a problem for some years. The previous owners claimed that they did not make a profit at any time. Certainly last year they had some trouble opening and honourable senators might recall that the Labor Government lent it $1.4m on very favourable terms to get the meatworks operating. This year they opened late, and I think the basic problem was industrial trouble caused by certain unusual conditions of wages which had been set by the former operator. However, I do not want to go into that. As I mentioned previously, the equipment is not up to date, the plant is labour intensive, and the method of handling damages the carcass and reduces its value. I am advised by the people there that the abattoir needs to handle 30 000 carcasses a year to be reasonably efficient. This year it handled 13 500, with a return to the grower of $300,000. There is a need for automation; there is no doubt about that. It has been said for years, and I hope that the new owners of the plant will look at that. There is also a need for better communications between management and the workers. Seasonal workers or itinerant workers present something of a problem and require a different handling situation. Certainly, it is my observation that there is a need for better communication than exists at the present time. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>At one stage <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> said 'a beef crisis was a social and economic crisis'. May I briefly look at the social and economic crisis in the Northern Territory. I shall deal firstly with the families who live on the stations. Mostly they are people who have lived there all their lives. Many of them were born and grew up on the stations and are second generation families. They have problems in educating their children and providing opportunities for them. I will not elaborate on this, but I bring it to the attention of the Senate. I draw attention also to the problems of the Aboriginal stockmen. I have raised this matter before in the chamber without getting an answer. I suggested then that unemployed stockmen should be kept on the station and that preferably employment should be found for them but certainly they should be given social security benefits and not forced to gravitate to the smaller towns to live on the fringes. </para>
          <para>Those are the 2 main points I wanted to deal with. May I suggest very briefly, because I know we want to move on, what the Government might do about the situation in the Territory at the present time. The first thing is obvious, and that is to assist with finance, to accept the Industries Assistance Commission recommendations and look at debt reconstruction, either by extending the payment time for loans or preferably by making a grant. There is no reason why we cannot write off some of these debts. I think that is the advice which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has given and which was referred to earlier today. No State-type situation exists in the Territory and it is therefore the responsibility of the Federal Government to look at the problem. </para>
          <para>We need household support for the people living there so that they will have a reasonable standards of living. We need farm build-up to make sure that properties are not only kept in order but also improved so that when the market improves they will again be viable. As well, they need carry-on finance but, as has been suggested by one of the speakers on the other side, we have to be careful that we do not impose too great a debt. There needs to be an equitable share of the reconstruction. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacFarlane,</inline> to whom I referred earlier, had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Territory fared very badly when compared with other States which received State assistance matched by the Federal Government. For instance, last year Canberra had matched the $ 10m loan granted by the Queensland Government to the beef industry. But the Territory got only $600,000- </para>
          </quote>
          <para>That is the same figure as for this year- about one-third of its due on cattle population. </para>
          <para>The Government can also assist with advice to the people in the industry at the present time. Perhaps there should be some lease aggregation. That is something which most of us would fight. We do not like to see a man lose his property but it is fairly obvious that in some areas, particularly in the Centre, some properties will have to combine so that one family can have a decent living and others can be given assistance with retraining and support to help them move elsewhere. Since the people in the Territory in the industry need a cash flow, we must actively seek markets and I have suggested earlier that this should be done in co-operation with the growers. </para>
          <para>One point raised by the honourable member for Fraser <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fry)</inline> in another place and by an honourable senator here today was that there must be a greater return to growers than they are getting at present. I quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> said at Roma, Queensland, on 20 November this year: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whilst returns to beef producers have been entirely unsatsifactory, the same cannot be said for the balance sheets of most meat exporters in 1975-76. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He went on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But any suggestion that there is a confrontation with the exporters is not the wish of the Government. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">While there might not be a confrontation, it is fairly obvious that something needs to be done and some firm action taken. To assist the industry in the Territory, the Government could provide staff for market research, again in cooperation with the growers. It could provide staff for research into management and productivity, the two areas of the industry in the Territory which have a definite need. I will not dwell on that; I think it is well understood. The last point I want to make in relation to Government assistance is to suggest that sympathetic consideration be given to those who have borrowed, either by reconstructing the loans, extending the time or by giving holiday periods for repayment. Alternatively, as I suggested earlier, the loan could be converted into a grant, as has been done in some States. </para>
          <para>What is the effect of devaluation? In the Territory, where the industry is well established, one would have hoped that devaluation would assist the industry. One of the reasons put forward for devaluation was that it would help the mining industry and the primary producers. Unfortunately, as far as the Territory is concerned, the season is closed and there will be no help there. By the time the season opens again the cost of equipment will be higher, the cost of labour will be higher, the cost of veterinary supplies will be higher, and so on. One wonders whether there will be any assistance at all to the industry. When considering the United States markets and some of the Territory's other markets, one wonders whether the devaluation will be of any help at all. The mining industry in the Territory will profit, but one wonders whether any of the other industries will. Let me refer again to a statement by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair.</inline> On 5 September 1975, he said. </para>
          <para>The economic problems facing the beef industry are generating grave social problems for the families of beef producers and their employees. These social problems will become more pronounced as long as the Government fails to act to assist the industry. The total failure to act will bring down on Australia not only an economic tragedy but also a widespread, lingering social tragedy. </para>
          <para class="block">I plead with the Government not to see the future of the Territory solely in terms of mining. Beef production has been the biggest employer of labour and has given good returns to the Territory. Perhaps we could latch on to one of the catch-cries of the recent election and call on the Government to put the industry in the Territory back on its feet. I support the Bill. </para>

            <para>- in reply- A lot of comments have been made about this legislation, which is not opposed by the Opposition. Indeed, it is supported, and Opposition speakers naturally have taken the opportunity to ventilate their apprehension, their concern, and their solutions to the problem. Those of us who have been involved in the industry- and some of us have been involved in it personally for quite a while- understand its difficulties and its problems and have lived with them for quite a few years. At the present time, the problem is not funny for those in the industry anywhere. We acknowledge that as a fact of life. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> talked about the view of the Meat Board. He made a claim that the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> is tending to divide the industry. The Minister has consulted all interested parties and recently met representatives of all parties to consider their diverse views. Consultations are continuing with a view to early introduction of legislation. Those who have been involved in primary industries, both as producers and as members of an industry organisation, are not unfamiliar with the problem of divided views and divided solutions in industry associations. It is the job of some person, usually a State or Federal Minister, to try to reconcile those views. That is what is happening now. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline>talked about the United States beef market and the 1976 quotas. He claimed that the Government should have avoided the quotas. That is the sort of general proposition to which I referred in a different context this afternoon. How does a seller tell the buyer what the buyer is to do? It is a terrific proposition if it can be achieved, but that is one of the difficulties. I understand the theory; its application is what concerns me. In effect, quotas were set by the United States Government at the level of voluntary restraint quotas under which Australia was already exporting to the United States. While the Government does not favour quotas for many reasons and fought them very hard at the highest level, the fact remains that our exports to the United States in 1976 will be similar to the levels of last year. Our shipping program to the United States was almost complete when the quotas were announced by  President  Ford. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> and I had a quite amicable chat across the chamber about this when I observed that I thought part of the problem at the moment with Japan and the United States was the fact that they were involved in election situations. The new year will show whether that is true or false. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline>spoke about the Australian Meat Board's new export scheme for the United States of America in 1977. He said that he thought that it could result in inequities and that he had a genuine concern about it. The Meat Board has carefully considered any possible inequities- for example, for Tasmania or north Queensland- and yesterday met with the Australian Meat Exporters Federal Council to review its findings. Consultations are still proceeding. The aim of the Meat Board is to avoid or minimise any possible inequities in whatever scheme is agreed to. </para>
          <para>I should say in regard to the Meat Board that I have been involved in the industry in one way or another since 1948 and I have been involved a lot in the consideration of its marketing and at no time have I found any producer group in favour of the Meat Board. It is difficult for the Meat Board. But I have always found it to be one of the great Aunt Sallys of the business. I do not know whether somebody else can do better, but it has run for a fair period of time, it has gained a fair amount of experience, it has a fair amount of talent and there are many people involved in it. It has tended to become an almost permanent target for the abuse of one section or another in the business. In fact, if somebody were to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> or me: 'How would you like to be a member of the Meat Board? , I would recommend him very strongly. No, I would not really do that. Perhaps I would recommend him as  President  of the Sutherland Shire but not as a member of the Meat Board. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline>spoke about there being a rather miserly approach. I invite him to refer to the tables that are available on this subject. I can have them sent to him. I would not want to incorporate any more of them in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> If I were to do so the reporters might strike. The amount of $ 19.6m was allocated but producers did not take up all of that amount. They took up $ 12.3m, which was committed to 30 June 1976. The $15m now being provided by the Commonwealth for 1976-77 is sufficient to meet the estimated requests from the States on behalf of the producers. All States were asked for estimates. The basis for arriving at the $ 1 5m was the State estimations. The Labor Government had various alternatives. It provided $28m to the Commonwealth Development Bank to enable it to expand its lending program to beef producers, but at commercial rates of interest. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline>was concerned about the high profits of meat exporters. That is something about which most of us in the industry have been anxious. He referred to big increases in the profits of major exporters in the past year and said that he thought that they might have been achieved by paying low prices to producers. The best information that I have been able to get some of it has come out of my head- is that most companies have had a record through-put in the past year. The economy of scale to some extent has led to reduced unit costs and thus given them a good return. I have also seen some pretty lousy results for meat exporters in past years. Large cattle numbers have led to a big supply. It certainly has been a buyer's market. The Meat Board's export control scheme of 1977 is aimed at the problem. It aims to increase the demand for cattle and, accordingly, to try to improve the price situation. </para>
          <para>I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> spoke with a lot of feeling and concern when he spoke about the particular problem of the Northern Territory, which is really not within the general ambit of this Bill and which is really a separate responsibility situation. I listened to his remarks with considerable care, as did the advisers. It is a problem that I find very hard to solve on the input that he gave to us within the ambit of this legislation in the Commonwealth Parliament. It seemed to me to be a problem more to be solved by application in the Northern Territory itself. Once again, nobody in this chamber is unconscious of the overall Australian problem. The overall Australian problem is simply one in relation to which cattle numbers expanded rather massively and our market shrunk quite heavily. Somebody gave me the relative figures in relation to Japan. They were, I think, 100 000 tonnes to 8000 tonnes. In that context- with the United States levelling itself off, with our numbers expanding and with our being denied access to the European Economic Community market- a very difficult position arose. </para>
          <para>I think the debate has been very useful. I listened to it very carefully. It has brought to my attention some new material for examination. But it has not produced a situation in which the Senate finds itself in conflict over the measure or in opposition to the measure. The measure is agreed to. So I suggest to the Senate that the matter should be disposed of and that the advisers should take the points that have been raised further into consideration. The Senate reflects a very wide range of views. Sometimes its range of views is wider than that of the House of Representatives. That is said with the greatest respect, but I think that it is perhaps true in this case that the Senate's view is a wider and broader view. I do not think that I can say anything more that will be of value to my colleagues. Accordingly, I think that the Senate should proceed to the further stages of the consideration of this Bill. </para>

            <para>-The Senate is now debating the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill, which, in the words of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> in his second reading speech, has as its prime purpose the reconstitution of the Australian Housing Corporation in accordance with the Government's announced policy to change its name, nature and function so that its sole responsibility will be the administration of the Defence Service Homes Scheme. The title of the Bill is therefore rather deceptive. The Bill has the positive function of re-establishing the Defence Service Homes Scheme in the Department of Veterans' Affairs, but it also has the negative function of destroying the Australian Housing </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Corporation. It is for the second reason- the destruction of the Australian Housing Corporation that the Opposition opposes this Bill. </para>
          <para>We support the retention of the Defence Service Homes Scheme. Under this Bill, the functions of that scheme in fact will remain unchanged. The ex-servicemen and eligible people still will be entitled to defence service homes at the same interest rate and under the same conditions as they have in the past. I do not wish to dwell on this aspect of the Bill. I merely ask the Minister whether he can tell us what is happening concerning the situation under the Defence Service Homes Scheme of <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> widows of deceased eligible ex-servicemen. I understand that provision is made under the Repatriation Act for whatever reason for the <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> wives of ex-servicemen. Consistency would seem to me to mean that under this sort of legislation the same sort of provision would apply, but it does not seem to do so. I understand that the Minister before last was having discussions with the Returned Services League. We have been advocating this change and we are wondering when it will come about. </para>
          <para>As I have said before, this legislation to all intents and purposes destroys the Australian Housing Corporation. The Corporation was set up in 1975 by the Labor Government. It was designed to assist low income families to purchase homes. The main plan it had in hand was to supply second mortgage loans for home purchase and for building, with a deferred repayment formula to ease the burden in the earlier years of the loan. First mortgages also were to be available on specific housing developments on a joint venture basis. The aims of the Corporation in general were to help one income, one parent families, poor families, those establishing first homes on a limited budget. It also was designed to provide information and advice on home purchases, titles, tax deductions and other things that are so important in the purchase of homes. </para>
          <para>Housing remains a very serious problem in this country. We have in excess of 100 000 people on waiting lists for public housing. As has been demonstrated by the various housing surveys, large numbers of people live in inadequate housing and housing which is far too expensive. There is an inequitable distribution of welfare housing to the underprivileged, as the Henderson report and others have pointed out. More poor people live in privately rented houses and pay too much rent than live in public housing, and too many people in public housing have no real need for the concessions and benefits which that sort of housing provides. It is now 12 months since this Government came into power. Although the Housing Corporation, which had not been in existence for very long, was only just getting off the ground and had not been able to establish its functions properly, of course it has not been functioning at all this year because of the Government's reluctance to support that sort of scheme. </para>
          <para>What has happened in the 12 months since the Government came to power? We all know that housing is in short supply in this country. Housing is of an inadequate standard in many places. Housing is the major expenditure of families. Its cost is escalating. The Government has appointed a Minister for Housing who has other responsibilities, particularly for the environment and community development, which at the moment are very onerous. He has some very difficult problems. Inflation continues, and therefore cost increases in the housing field continue. The Government now has increased interest rates again. It has introduced a homes savings grant scheme. The grant, which has a maximum of $2,000, is for those who can afford to save sufficient money to qualify. This scheme is regressive. It favours those more affluent people who are able to save, more than it favours the poor. There is further legislation coming up next week dealing with that subject. I will not go into it now, but I am sure that at that time we will be able to demonstrate that the main function of the homes saving grant will be to add $2,000 to the cost of houses. The Government has introduced a housing allowance voucher experiment. It is on this subject that I wish to expand later. The main purpose of this experiment would seem to be to demonstrate that the Government has a concern for social reform. But the Government also has cut funds for public housing; it has sabotaged the land commissions scheme which was designed to reduce land costs; it has reduced assistance available under the mortgage interest payment tax deductibility scheme; it has reduced funds for Aboriginal housing; and now it abolishes the Australian Housing Corporation. </para>
          <para>The main initiatives of which the Government seems to be most proud are in fact the homes savings grant scheme and the housing allowance voucher experiment. The housing allowance voucher experiment was announced by the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> soon after he' took over the portfolio. An amount of $75,000 has been allocated in the present Budget for the introduction of this experiment. There has been no debate in this Parliament; in fact until recently there has been very little public debate on the introduction of this scheme. The housing allowance voucher experiment has been introduced with very little publicity, as I said, and very little public discussion. This scheme is worth looking at. It is worth looking at all the more because the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> said last week in Tasmania that the housing allowance voucher scheme would increase the availability of adequate housing in this country. He spoke as though it was not an experiment but an established scheme that would continue. In answer to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> in this chamber on 2 November, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> said that the Government's housing allowance voucher scheme would make a great difference to the housing available for aged persons in Tasmania, particularly those in rural areas. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development has talked about the housing allowance voucher scheme as being the brave new world, the great new initiative in housing. I question this. I question whether the Government is really introducing an experiment or whether those Ministers who have spoken on this subject believe that it is an experiment and not an on-going plan. We know that the Government is planning this as an experiment, and it is this very experiment that I want to question. We know from discussion papers of the Department and discussion papers of those who are talking about this scheme that the proposed housing allowance is described as being part of an income support program. The allowance is described as a series of regular, periodic payments made directly to a family or eligible individual unable to afford a decent home in a suitable living environment. The allowance must be used to pay rent. The amount which will be paid will be determined on family need- I assume that that is family size and family income- in relation to the cost of a standard existing house or flat in a modest neighbourhood. The professed aim of the scheme is for the family to be allowed to choose its house or flat, for the family to be given assistance by the Government and for the Government to have a secondary or what is called an enabling role. </para>
          <para>The definitions that I used before and the definitions that are used in other places involve the use of terms such as 'decent homes', 'suitable environment', 'need' and 'modest neighbourhood'. The legislation talks about fair market rents and minimum standards of housing. It talks about a community wide housing code enforcement program, whatever that is. All the factors in this experiment will require terms such as 'decent houses', 'standard houses', 'modest neighbourhoods' and 'community- wide housing code enforcement programs' to be defined and will require these terms to be supervised. They will require inspectors to decide what is a decent home, what is a standard home and what is a modest neighbourhood. They will necessitate the determination of a fair market rent. Minimum standards of housing will have to be determined. We already have, in the group of definitions to which I have referred and in other definitions, the start of a burgeoning inspectorate or a burgeoning bureaucracy just to supervise this experiment. </para>
          <para>When we consider that it is in fact an experiment, that people are to be experimented on, that their behaviour is to be watched and that their reactions to the housing voucher scheme are to be watched carefully, we can see that a large number of people will be involved just in the experimental stage. But that is not going to be all because there is going to be non-monetary assistance given under this housing voucher experiment. This sort of assistance will help people in how to spot a good buy in terms of structural adequacy and financial soundness of the house or the deal. It will provide information on discrimination of a social or ethnic origin. It will require all sorts of non-monetary assistance to help these people involved in what, I repeat, is an experiment. It will involve them in getting help of this type. It will mean that this whole scheme will have to be carefully supervised. </para>
          <para>If we take the Government's intention seriously what we are looking at in this scheme is certainly the biggest- probably the only- real social experiment in this country's history, an experiment for which $75,000 has so far been allocated for the design stage but it will certainly need very much more than $75,000 to establish. What we are looking at is a scheme which is going to be conducted in the cities of Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart over 3 years and is going to involve the expenditure of many millions of dollars in those years. I believe this Parliament and this community should question this experiment. The first question I ask is: Should such an experiment, an experiment on such a scale, be commenced at all? Should it be commenced without more parliamentary, more public and more expert discussion? Should such an experiment be conducted without a clear statement of termination procedures- the procedures to terminate the experiment in case it is not seen to be successful or in case the economic conditions provide that the experiment cannot be continued or that the whole scheme cannot be continued? If we do not know what the termination procedures are we do not know how it will affect the behaviour of the renters or the builders who will take advantage of the vouchers available under this scheme. </para>
          <para>The more serious question, I believe, is what validity such an experiment will have when those who are involved in it know that they are part of an experiment and part of an experiment which may be terminated after 3 years. How will this affect their behaviour- their behaviour in renting houses or flats? How a social experiment of this type can be conducted when the people who are part of the experiment know they are part of it is beyond me. The experiment is going to involve controls. How will those people who are controlled and who are getting no assistance behave? </para>

              <para>- We do this in our medical practice. This is a social experiment. I am very surprised that the honourable senator would agree with such a social experiment. Indeed, if the Labor Party had suggested such a social experiment I can imagine the speech the honourable senator would make about it. I ask: What sort of validity will an experiment conducted in urban areas in Sydney, Melbourne and Hobart have in the consideration of future rural housing policies? We have no idea how much this experiment will cost. We have no idea what housing authorities, housing experts- public or private will be needed to judge such things as minimum housing standards, modest neighbourhoods or the establishment of a community-wide housing code enforcement program, whatever that is. We have no idea how migrants, the Aborigines and the aged will enter that experiment especially in view of the minimum housing standards. </para>
            </talk.start>

          <para>This has been a great problem in America in the housing voucher experiments which were started there and which, despite the claims of the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and the department, are still continuing and have not been evaluated. But we do know from the preliminary evaluation that the take-up in the American experiment- and American conditions are very different from ours- has been very low. The main reason for this low take-up has been the minimal housing standards that were set and the great difficulty for ethnic groups and other under-privileged groups to get into the experiment even if they desired to go into better housing standards. A serious question in a country that has a shortage of dwellings and a shortage of units available for people to live in is what sort of effect on rents will a housing voucher experiment have in areas where there is such a shortage? One would suggest that a very likely result and an almost inevitable result will be the bidding up of rents, an increase in rents in those areas, as has been predicted in articles on this subject. </para>
          <para>The big problem we have in this country is to increase the number of houses and flats available in Australia and to increase the standard of those houses and flats and to make them accessible to the low income groups in this country, particularly in a period of high inflation. The Australian Housing Corporation, although it did not get off the ground, had positive schemes involving second mortgages, varying the repayment rates on first mortgages under certain conditions, to make some positive effort but that has been abandoned in favour of what is a 3-year experiment, an experiment which will not start till next year, an experiment which is very doubtful will increase the number of houses available in this country and the number of flats available. That is the problem that is facing us in housing. </para>
          <para>I question the validity of social experiments of this type at all. I question the timing of this sort of social experiment if that is what is to be done. At a time of increasing inflation, at a time of housing shortages we are going to sit back for 3 years and conduct an experiment of doubtful validity to see just what will happen at the end of that time. I question whether some influential Ministers in fact consider it an experiment at all. They are talking as though this is the future in this country. They are talking in their Friedmanite way as though this is the way to do things, to give people money and they will somehow magically be able to acquire the services, even the services do not now exist. Already articles have appeared on this subject such as that by Patricia Apps in the <inline font-style="italic">National Times</inline> of 2 weeks ago which nave pointed out very seriously doubts about how any possible successful outcome can come from this experiment, an experiment conducted in 2 large cities- and 1 moderate sized city- in this country; an experiment which has no reference to rural areas; an experiment which has no reference to the large country towns which also have housing problems; an experiment which will have no effect on the appalling state of housing for aged persons in this country as demonstrated in the aged persons housing survey which was produced last year but done in 1974. </para>
          <para>It is time this Parliament and the public had more information about this experiment which is going to be conducted, this experiment which is going to eat up a lot of money. It is time we in this Parliament, those in the community who have more expert knowledge of this area, those in universities and those in the building industry had a serious look at just what methods are going to be used in this experiment, and at its aims. We should not blindly translate into this country an experiment which is still being conducted in America. We should not blindly conduct social experiments in our community unless we have a much greater idea of what is going to happen at the end of them and unless the people in this country know exactly what is going on. </para>
          <para>The Australian Housing Corporation had positive aims but never had the chance to start to achieve those aims. For that reason we believe that the Government, even though it is philosophically opposed to things like the Australian Housing Corporation, even though it philosophically has great difficulty in accepting such concepts, has not adequately substituted any other scheme to replace it; and it should have, because, as I have said before, we have a great shortage of housing and we have a great problem with regard to inadequate housing in this country. Because the Government is dismantling a scheme which started to show signs and had promise of helping to alleviate the problems of housing in this country we oppose this legislation. We have further questions to ask when the Bill is considered at the Committee stage. We shall ask how this Bill is going to affect defence service homes and how it is going to carry out the functions for which it provides. Our prime reason for opposing it is the fact that it destroys the Australian Housing Corporation. </para>

            <para>- I am in total agreement with what the Labor Party shadow Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes,</inline> has had to say in regard to the Defence Service Homes Amendment Bill. I want to raise in my speech tonight a specific area. This is the second time today that I have had to rise to express my concern on behalf of the women in the Australian community. I cannot allow this opportunity to pass without once again pointing out just how discriminatory is some of the legislation that comes before this chamber and the other place. In his second reading speech the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> said: </para>

            <para>This Bill therefore provides for the establishment of a Defence Service Homes Corporation, the affairs of which will be conducted within the departmental framework by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The very recent establishment of the Department is evidence of the Government 's interest in the welfare of those - </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I stress the word 'those '- who have served this country in the armed Services. </para>
          <para>I presume that the word 'those' includes exservicewomen, because at the moment there is no provision in most of the previous Acts, including the War Service Homes Act, for a great number of ex-servicemen who were in the Services during the war but who did not serve overseas. It was not their fault that they did not serve overseas, because only women who had specific skills were able to serve overseas. However, they did contribute a great deal to the welfare of the people of Australia. </para>
          <para>I want to quote from a letter written by the former Minister for Urban and Regional Development to my colleague from Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer. Senator Melzer</inline> was most anxious to participate in this debate but unfortunately had to meet a most important electoral commitment away from Parliament House at a time which conflicted with the bringing on of the debate. She has given me a copy of the letter so that it may be recorded. The letter is dated 13 October 1975. The former Minister wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>When the Defence Service Homes legislation was originally enacted to provide homes for members of the Forces who served in the 1914-18 War, the principle adopted was that benefits would be limited to persons who were enlisted for service in Forces raised for active service overseas. The same principle was followed when the legislation was extended to cover service in the 1939-43 War and eligibility was limited to persons who were enlisted or appointed for or employed on active service outside Australia or on a ship of war. Therefore, members of those Forces raised for active service abroad, the AIF, the RAAF and the RAN, some members of the Nursing Service and persons enlisted for service in the Australian Army Medical Women's Service (AIF), are eligible for benefits. On the other hand, persons who were enlisted in the Citizen Military Force, the Australian Army Medical Women's Service (CMF) and the Women's Auxiliary Forces, which were raised primarily for home service, are not eligible unless they actually served outside Australia. There is, therefore, no distinction, in this regard, between men and women. </para>

          <para class="block">To my mind, there is a very great distinction between the men and women who can be covered. </para>

Ex-servicemen enlisted voluntarily for service but, as I mentioned, they could not, even if they wanted to, enlist for service overseas unless they were skilled in particular areas. They could not do so simply because they were women. However, they were actively engaged here in Australia and their lives were just as much at risk here as were the lives of some of those who were serving overseas. </para>

              <para>- And keep them barefoot and pregnant, too, I suppose. That is the attitude of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack to women. The work that those women performed freed a lot of men and enabled them to go overseas. Those men are eligible for housing benefits and the women who replaced them are not. Those women worked hard and they worked long. They worked extremely well and they deserve the same form of compensation as that of which the men are able to take advantage. I have already explained the reasons why they did not go overseas. I want the Government to explain to me why it does not have the guts in this day and age, when it is abolishing the Australian Housing Corporation and replacing it with the Defence Service Homes Corporation, to cater for those women. </para>

          <para>Honourable senators will know that in December 1972 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and the then Minister for Defence put forward a number of amendments. Some of those amendments were passed. One of them had the effect of extending the scheme to include all persons serving in the defence forces after 7 December 1972 with 3 years continuous service. So we are now talking about women as well as men who have served in the defence forces in peacetime as being eligible for a benefit which is not available to women who served in wartime. They are the women about whom I am talking; they are the ones for whom I am seeking the benefit. </para>
          <para>At the same time, I am given to understand, consideration was given to extending the scheme to cover those women, but it was considered that the cost would be too high. I ask: The cost of what? Are we talking about thousands of women who will suddenly apply for this benefit, or are we talking about a few hundred women who are at an age- the war finished 30-odd years ago- at which they need security and the advantage of knowing that they have decent, comfortable accommodation for which they can afford to pay and which will be provided for them in their old age. We are talking about a few hundred people and possibly a few thousand dollars. The amount involved would be only a few thousand dollars. The flood gates will not suddenly be opened for hundreds of thousands of people. Perhaps a few hundred women find themselves in those circumstances. </para>
          <para>For the benefit of those honourable senators who happen to be of the opposite sex to me, let me assure them that it is not easy at any time, under any circumstances, for a woman to have a loan made available to her. The lending institutions and the banks look rather unkindly upon women, especially if they happen to be single women. They do not see that women contribute a great deal to the running of Australia, any more than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack recognises that women in the Parliament play a great role. </para>

              <para>- We play a most important role, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. One</inline> of these days you may be able to find out just how important that role is. Those women have the same difficulties as men in saving for a reasonable deposit on a home in an endeavour to keep monthly repayments at a minimum. I am talking about women who are no longer young. I am talking about women who are now in their fifties and who may find that it is not possible to commit themselves for a great amount of money at widely varying monthly repayments which they may not be able to afford. </para>

          <para>I spoke a little earlier about the qualifying period which now applies for ex-service women. Women who have served continuously for 3 years in the defence Services can at this point in time have a loan made available to them if they are married or are about to marry or have dependants. I have been informed that a number of single ex-service women have applied for and received loans and have their dependent parents living with them. Single ex-servicemen get loans for homes and nobody begrudges the widows of ex-servicemen the benefits that they receive; but I am talking about the women, particularly those women who were quite prepared to sacrifice themselves if necessary, who sacrificed their time and their human resources in wartime service. </para>
          <para>The excuse that the claims of these women could not be considered unless the claims of the men who served in the Citizen Military Forces could be considered is, to my mind, quite spurious. I am not saying that the CMF men are not entitled to have consideration given to them. I think the claims of the CMF men are very real ones. But I wish to make the simple point that the women to whom I am referring volunteered; the men of the CMF were conscripted. To me, that makes quite a big difference. The women voluntarily enlisted out of a desire to serve their country. May I say, for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, that in 1944 women comprised two-thirds of the defence forces serving in Australia. Men could not have gone overseas unless the women were prepared to step in and do the messy work that the men had left behind here. At this point of time, those women want an assurance of proper, permanent, decent accommodation for the rest of their lives. I hope that the Defence Service Homes Corporation will bring before this Parliament in the very near future a Bill for an allocation of land so that a housing project, a block of units perhaps, could be established for the aged amongst those ex-service women and, if necessary, for their husbands who may not necessarily have contributed in the war effort. </para>
          <para>As I have already stated, I do not believe that the extension of this scheme to wartime ex-service women would commit this Government or any other government to a great deal of money. I do not think we should be endeavouring to put a cost on the services of those women between 1939 and 1945. 1 think it is disgraceful that 30 years after the war has finished they are still having these rights denied them. I hope this will be one of the first areas to come before the Parliament from the Defence Service Homes Corporation. </para>

            <para>-in reply Perhaps that I should remind the Senate that we are debating a Bill to amend the Australian Housing Corporation Act. This legislation seeks to abolish the Australian Housing Corporation as set up by the Labor Government last year and to replace it with a corporation to be known as the Defence Service Homes Corporation to continue the administration of the defence service homes scheme under the old Act. The Australian Housing Corporation, for most of its life, has simply administered the defence service homes scheme. When the Corporation was set up by the Labor Government, it was given the responsibility of administering the defence service homes scheme. It was also allocated, I think, $25m in Labor's last Budget for other purposes but that money was not made available to it. As I say, for most of its life, its sole responsibility has been the administration of the defence service homes scheme. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill simply seeks to amend that Act in such a way as to bring it into accord with the actual situation and to have the defence service homes scheme become the dominant feature of this legislation. The Bill is not one which alters in any way the terms and conditions of the defence service homes scheme. Therefore I think that most of the comment that has been made in relation to the defence service homes scheme in this debate has been quite irrelevant. </para>
          <para>This particular legislation before the Senate this evening is hardly a suitable vehicle by which to debate the Government's housing policy. That seemed to be the main concern of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> I can appreciate that he may have wished to express views that he holds or that the Opposition holds in relation to the Government's housing policy but, as he recognises, there will be a further and better opportunity to debate that subject next week when the Government's home savings grant legislation will no doubt come before the Senate.  lit  will be much more appropriate to debate the subject then. That Bill is in the hands of the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> and it will be his representative in this chamber who will be piloting that Bill through the Senate. I would think that that would be a much more suitable occasion for a general debate on the Government's housing policy. </para>
          <para>I should also like to say in very broad answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> that the Government's housing policy is by no means confined to the voucher scheme which he spent most of his speech discussing. The Government's housing policy covers a variety of matters. Of course the dominant one is the Commonwealth and State Housing Agreement. That is the major contribution of the Commonwealth Government to housing in Australia. But the Government has also announced some major policies through the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> in relation to aged persons' housing. As I said, the Government is to introduce into the Parliament this session the new home savings grant scheme. So there are many other aspects of the Government's housing policy. Apart from stating the policy in those broad terms, in my reply I do not intend to deal with it. </para>
          <para>As I have said, this Bill is not concerned with the terms and conditions of the defence services homes scheme; it is simply concerned with the administration of that scheme. I have explained in my second reading speech the way in which that scheme will be administered in the future. The general policy is that that scheme should be administered through and under the general control of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. The nature of the scheme is such that it is required to be conducted by a corporation, for obvious legal reasons. It has always had that legal structure, and that will be preserved by this legislation in that the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs will constitute the corporate structure in his own person. </para>
          <para>The Government's reasons for abolishing the Housing Corporation were very forcibly stated in this chamber about 18 months ago by the then shadow Minister for Housing, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> When we were in Opposition we made it perfectly clear that we were entirely opposed to the concept of an Australian Housing Corporation. Soon after this Government was formed the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> announced that it was the Government's intention to abolish that Corporation. I think that was in early February of this year. This Bill simply gives effect to a long-standing policy of the Parties which now comprise the Government in relation to this concept. Broadly, the reasons for our opposition to it are that we believe that the proper method of providing housing is through the Commonwealth-State housing agreement and its administration by various State government agencies. All States have, and have had for many years, housing commissions or housing trusts to administer the necessary and proper government assistance for the housing needs of the lower income earners in the community. We as a government believe that that is the proper way in which this assistance should be administered. We have supplemented this assistance by several schemes. When we were in government previously we had various supplementary schemes for housing assistance. We do not see the role of the Commonwealth Government as a dominant one in the administration of the housing needs of the community. The actual administration would be more properly and better carried out by State governments. The other problem with the Housing Corporation is the constitutional limitations of this Parliament in relation to housing. </para>
          <para class="block">The way in which the functions of the Corporation are set out in the Australian Housing Corporation Act reveals the very clear constitutional limitations of this Parliament in relation to housing. Efforts by a national administration to provide housing schemes are inevitably discriminatory. That is clear from the legislation. For instance, the Corporation may provide for the housing needs of Commonwealth public servants but not of State public servants. It may provide for the housing needs of members of the defence Services, but not, for instance, of members of the police forces. It may provide for the needs of migrant Australians, but not for the needs of Australians generally. This is quite clear from section 6 of the Act which sets out the functions of the Corporation. It arises from the limitations of the power of this Parliament in relation to housing. Many other objections were stated to the Commonwealth Government participating in housing policies and administration through a body such as the Australian Housing Corporation. I have indicated the 2 broad objections which we had when we were in Opposition and which we have now when we are in government. Those are the reasons why the Government is now proceeding to disband that Corporation and to replace it with the Defence Service Homes Corporation which, of course, has been a longstanding responsibility of the Parliament and the national government and which the Government certainly will continue to maintain. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline>raised a matter concerning discrimination against women in relation to the defence service homes scheme. I point out that there is no question of discrimination against women because the defence service homes scheme always has been confined to persons who have served on active service outside Australia or on a ship at war. That applies to both men and <inline font-style="italic">women.</inline> Therefore, there is no discrimination against women. The only discrimination that could arise would be discrimination between those who served overseas and those who did not. That is a basic feature of the defence service homes scheme. </para>

            <para>-This clause provides that members of the Corporation shall cease to hold office on the date of commencement of the Act. The Corporation originally consisted of 8 members, including the Secretary of the Department of Housing and Construction, the General Manager and others. Under section 13 of the Australian Housing Corporation Act part time members were appointed for 3 years and it was provided that they be paid such remuneration as would be determined by the Remuneration Tribunal. I wonder whether there will be any compensation for the early termination of these appointments. Also, has the Governor-General been consulted about abolishing the appointments made by him? </para>

            <para>-I would like some explanation of this clause. Subclause ( 1 ) repeals Parts II, III, IV and V of the original Australian Housing Corporation Act which dealt with the functions and powers of the Corporation, the composition of the Corporation, the General Manager and the provision of finance for housing. Clause 8 ( 1) of the Bill substitutes a new Part II, which includes section 5 (2), which states that the Corporation included in the repealed section will continue in existence under a new name. But this Bill makes it clear that the nature, functions and powers of the new corporation are fundamentally different. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We are wondering why this has been done this way. The question seems to be: What is the nature of the body referred to in that clause that is to continue in existence? For instance, who will be the members of the new Corporation? Will the Corporation continue to have functions and powers? If so, specifically, what will they be? If the Corporation will have no members, what in fact constitutes the Corporation? Why was this done in this way? One wonders why the whole Act was not repealed and a new Act introduced. </para>

            <para>- I think that is a very fair question. It has been done this way for the convenience and speed of drafting and passage through the Parliament. The Senate would appreciate that the Government has had a very heavy legislative program this session and a large number of Bills still require to be passed this session. In the opinion of Parliamentary Counsel this was the quickest and most convenient way of actually effecting the Government's purpose. I appreciate that to some extent the Bill is a misnomer in that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> said, one would probably expect to find one Bill abolishing the Housing Corporation and another Bill setting up the new Corporation, to be known as the Defence Service Homes Corporation. Clause 8 does that. Honourable senators will see that it provides in a new Part II the following: </para>

            <para>- Until the establishment of the Australian Housing Corporation the defence service homes scheme had always been conducted by a person known as the Director of Defence Service Homes or Director of War Service Homes. That person constituted the Corporation. It has always been conducted by what is in law known as the 'coroporation sole'. Really we shall only be going back to the traditional way of administering the scheme by a person. The actual corporation is set up by statute. It is a creation of statute the same as I understand are a number of corporations, such as the Commonwealth Bank. A group of people is not needed to constitute a corporation. The Bill simply provides that the affairs of the Corporation are going to be conducted and controlled by the Secretary of the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </para>

It would seem to me that the Defence Service Homes Act, the parent Act, confers certain powers on the Corporation. The Corporation has functions. What are the functions conferred on the Corporation by the Defence Service Homes Act? Are the functions substituted for functions contained in the repealed Part II of the Housing Corporation Act? This Bill does not seem to contain any mention of the powers of the Corporation. We assume that the Corporation has only whatever powers are conferred by the Defence Service Homes Act. </para>

            <para>- I think that the answer to the honourable senator's question is to be found in clauses 13 to 16 under the heading: 'Part Ill-Amendments of the Defence Service Homes Act'. It will be found that this provides a tie-in between the creation of a new corporation and the existing Defence Service Homes Act. That Act outlines the powers, functions and policies of the defence service homes scheme which in future will be conducted by the Defence Service Homes Corporation created by clause 8 of the Bill that we are now considering. So the answer is that one has to look at the Defence Service Homes Act to find all the powers, functions, policies and so on which are going to be administered by the new Corporation. </para>

To answer this question I have to give a little history of the way in which the scheme has been conducted by the Australian Housing Corporation. When the Corporation was set up the existing staff of the defence service homes scheme, I think I am right in saying, were all employed under the Commonwealth Public Service Act and, at that time, were under the Department of Housing and Construction. But, whichever department they have been working under, they have always been a separate group. </para>

              <para>-They were all public servants. They were lent to the Australian Housing Corporation. The vast majority of them are still under the Public Service Act. However, the Corporation has recruited about 30 new staff who are not under the Public Service Act because they have been recruited by the Corporation. We have preserved the legal situation that the staff is in at the moment because this Bill does not alter the existing sections of the Housing Corporation Act in relation to staff. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>What has to be done- and this will take some time- is to achieve the transfer back from the Corporation of the staff and their reabsorption into the Public Service. Although they still remain public servants they are on loan to the Corporation and in many cases they are employed on slightly different terms and with different status from that under which if they had been employed under the Public Service Act and there will be a fairly lengthy period of dealing with the final transfer of staff in which consideration will have to be given to every public servant employed by the Corporation. Probably there will have to be some further amendment to the legislation to cope with that problem but at this stage negotiations are taking place between my Department and the Public Service unions who are concerned with the staff. The negotiations are proceeding amicably and assurances have been given to the staff that every consideration will be given to their position. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition enthusiastically supports this Bill, which is quite a simple Bill. The Republic of Nauru, a small island with some 7000 people in the Pacific Ocean, was originally a mandated territory which gained its independence in 1968. Prior to that there was provision in its legal structure for appeals to our High Court and this, of course, lapsed on the Republic gaining its independence. The Bill gives effect to an agreement which has been made between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Republic of Nauru relating to appeals to the High Court of Australia. It is quite a tribute from the people of Nauru that they desire to have the benefit of our highest and most prestigious court. There is no question of Australia trying to maintain any neo-colonial domination over Nauru or anything like that. One of the articles of the Agreement provides that it comes into force on the date on which the 2 governments exchange notes notifying each other that their respective constitutional and other requirements necessary to give effect to this </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Agreement have been complied with- that is, when this Bill passes through the Australian Parliament and the Nauru Parliament- and there is a safeguard that the Agreement shall continue in force until the expiration of the ninetieth day after the day on which either government has given to the other government notice in writing of its desire to terminate the Agreement. So there is no suggestion of Australia wishing to retain any influence if the Nauru Government gives some indication that it wishes to sever the tie. Therefore, there is no attempt by the Australian Government to maintain any domination. On the contrary, this is a fraternal gesture to a Pacific neighbour and we support the Bill. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I rarely enter debate on a Bill which is related to matters dealt with by the Attorney-General or matters relating to legal or court affairs and I enter this debate with some degree of apology because I realise that I am taking some time at a period of the Senate's operations when the Senate wishes to draw its activities to a conclusion. I feel constrained to enter the debate because I am interested in Nauru in my capacity as representing the Australian Parliament and a group of parliaments within the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. The point of interest in this measure to me is that the Republic of Nauru and the Commonwealth of Australia are both members of the Commonwealth of Nations. They both have parliaments within an organisation known as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association, they both are part of the Pacific region and there are very close relations between the Australian Parliament and the legislature of Nauru. After all, Nauru, was a trust territory administered by Australia for many years until 1968 when it gained its independence and this Parliament was involved by the Nauru Independence Act 1967 which made provision for the Nauru people to adopt their own constitution. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In adopting their own constitution they established their own courts of law and their own legal and judicial procedures. In this case, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland mentioned a few moments ago, the Nauru Government took the initiative in seeking to have the High Court serve as the final appeals court of Nauru and this indicates a degree of confidence in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland called the most prestigious court in Australia. Within the constitution of Nauru there is provision for a Supreme Court and in the section of the constitution relating to the judiciary there are references to the relationship between the Legislative Assembly of Nauru and the Supreme Court of that Republic. The legislature of Nauru and the legislature of Australia therefore have this close and interesting connection. I seem to recall from the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> that it was something of a novel and interesting process whereby this step was taken and that for the first time the High Court will function as final court of appeal from the supreme court of another independent sovereign country. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators here may know that within the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association I have the privilege of being what is called an Australasian regional councillor. The Commonwealth Parliamentary Association operates through an executive of some 14 members, two from each of the 7 regions throughout the world, and one of these regions is the Australasian region. I am one of the councillors from the Australasian region. Plans are now made for my visit in my official capacity within the next few weeks to the legislature of Nauru and without doubt I can say that the people I will meet there will be interested in the progress of this Bill which is before the Senate tonight. Nauru is within the Australasian region and this legislation provides an opportunity for an association between the legislature there and the legislature here. I do not go so far as to make claims for the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association beyond the areas which it is designed to serve; but, because it is an organisation which provides for the conferring together of parliament and for negotiations between one parliament and another and one legislature and another, without any doubt there is an area in which the kind of material that is within the substance and body of this Bill has some relationship with the organisation which I represent. If I may claim so, I think it has some connection with my duties as a regional councillor. </para>
          <para>The legislatures in the Pacific- that of Nauru is one of those- have maintained a strong and useful connection with the Australian Parliament, the Australian Government and the Australian system. The legislatures within the Pacific and Australasian area have sought advice and assistance from the Australian Parliament and have continued what I would call the political and parliamentary fellowship. A great deal of this has been fostered and sponsored by the organisation that we know as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. Indeed, at this moment one of the parliaments within the Pacific area has sought a degree of assistance and guidance through the Commonwealth of Australia </para>
          <para class="block">Branch of the CPA. This Bill relates to the courts. It is a matter relating to the legal and judicial processes and does not have any relationship to the economic or social circumstances of either Nauru or Australia; but it is very much involved with the development of governmental processes in one of the Commonwealth countries with which Australia has a very strong, intimate and continuing connection. </para>
          <para>Nauru achieved its independence in 1968. Until about mid- 1965 all powers of government were vested in the Admin str at or, who was appointed by the Australian Government. These powers were not only administrative and legislative but also judicial. There was a local government council and, following the talks with the then Australian Minister for Territories, a Legislative Council was established. As honourable senators probably are very well aware, there was a series of developments following that and Nauru moved steadily towards independence, which took place in 1968. Nauru is now an independent republic within the Commonwealth of Nations, to which it has been admitted as an associate member. Nauru is also a full member of the South Pacific Commission. In 1971 a series of 3 courts were established within Nauru. These have been reviewed and the review has led to the Bill which is before the Senate and to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland referred as being a very important step in judicial and court relationships between the Republic of Nauru and the Commonwealth of Australia. Nauru has only a small parliament of about 18 members, I believe. I it is based on the Westminster system, with a number of amendments, alterations and modifications which suit the local circumstances. The terms of this Bill undoubtedly have received the attention of someone who is described as the Minister for Justice within the Nauru legislature. He was one of the members returned at the election of 1974. The Republic of Nauru is developing a strong tradition in the British Westminster system. </para>
          <para>For those reasons, I take some strong interest in this Bill, which is perhaps a little unusual from my point of view. In Nauru there is what is called a main branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association which sends delegates to conferences. It sent a delegate to the recent conference in Mauritius and to the recent conference in this country, and it is proposed to send delegates to the regional conference which is to take place in Adelaide early next year. That background means that the Commonwealth parliamentary system and the branch of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association will have had some connection with the terms, styles and titles of the measure that is before the Senate tonight. Because it is my privilege to serve as an executive member of the organisation and to serve as one of the representatives of the area of the world which includes both Nauru and Australia, I thought I should make these few comments and this contribution to this debate in order to indicate that in the interparliamentary scheme of things there is a place for an organisation such as the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association and that in a measure of this quite unique and interesting kind the organisation on whose behalf I am speaking has played a very material part. I lend my support to the measure and will be pleased to report on its progress when I visit the people of Nauru in January. </para>

            <para>- In relation to the first of these Bills, namely the Federal Court of Australia Bill, I move: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>At end of motion, add-', but the Senate is of opinion that the Federal Court of Australia Bill 1976 should provide a Federal court with original jurisdiction in all matters refereed to in section 75 of the Constitution and laws made by the Parliament'. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>Although the Opposition does not oppose this or any of the other Bills being dealt with in this cognate debate, I point to what I see as a basic illogically in the reasons given by the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> in his second reading speech for limiting the field of the exercise of original jurisdiction in the proposed Federal Court. To illustrate my point, I wish to quote a few passages from the Minister's speech. These are not exactly in order, but I will refer to them in the order which makes my point. After dealing with the differences between this Bill and the proposal to set up a Superior Court which was introduced into the last Parliament by the Labor Government, the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The present Bill therefore differs from previous Bills relating to a Commonwealth Superior Court in that the original jurisdiction that is to be exercised by the proposed Federal Court of Australia will be limited initially to that now exercised by the Industrial Court and the Bankruptcy Court . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In another part of his second reading speech he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government believes that only where there are special policy or perhaps historical reasons for doing so should original federal jurisdiction be vested in a federal court. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In another part of his second reading speech he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Court now proposed will not, as would previous Bills to establish a Superior Court that have been introduced into the Parliament, perform judicial functions that can better be performed by State courts or create jurisdictional problems of a kind that might delight constitutional lawyers but only add to the hazards of litigation for the parties concerned. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">It will be observed that the statements that I have read from the Minister's second reading speech are merely bald, unsupported assertions- not arguments- in favour of the limitation of the original jurisdiction of the proposed Federal Court and we have been asked to accept it merely on the say so of the Minister that there is ample justification for this limitation of the original jurisdiction to be exercised by this Court. Let us set those statement against another statement in the Minister's second reading speech, that is, the statement which reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As conceived by the Labor Government, it- </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the conception which the Minister admits has a very august parent in the person of the former Attorney-General and present Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick-  would have removed from State courts the bulk of the federal jurisdiction exercised by those courts and greatly weakened the status of those courts and the quality of the work dealt with by them. </para>
          <para class="block">To summarise, the argumentation behind this limitation of the original jurisdiction of the Federal Court seems to be that, out of deference to the preservation of the status of the State courts, much original federal jurisdiction which properly belongs to it will be withheld from the Federal Court. I cannot see how it is that this limitation does not strike some sort of blow at the status of the new Federal Court. </para>
          <para>I do not know whether this is just an illustration of the hold which the mystique of federalism has on this Government. There might be another reason. It is almost impossible for the Government to explain why the Australian Labor Party's proposal for a Superior Court was rejected. As I have pointed out, the Minister said that the concept of a Superior Court was developed by the Labor Government from the original proposal by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick. The Government is stuck with considerable difficulty in explaining why a measure which the Labor Party introduced and which was rejected by the Senate now has been introduced by it, unless of course it has changed the concept in some way to make it look as though it is a totally different concept. It bears some sort of relationship to its conduct in respect of Medibank. When we proposed a levy to finance Medibank- presumably because we proposed it- the proposition was thrown out in this chamber. But when the Liberal and National Country Parties gained office they introduced a levy to finance Medibank. </para>
          <para>It was suggested that the reason or perhaps a subsidiary reason why the Liberal-National Country Party forces did not like the idea of our introducing a Superior Court measure and perhaps wanted to defer it until they could introduce a measure of their own was that they might have some regard to the appointment of the judges of this Federal Court. I will not impute any such unworthy motives to them. I merely point out the illogically of a Federal Parliament being so tender to the status of State courts, and, in doing so, depriving a federal court of what would seem to me to be its logical ambit of jurisdiction, which should be to cover the whole field of federal jurisdiction not already covered by another federal court. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is not opposing these Bills. The others, which I will not deal with, merely confer jurisdiction which now belongs to other courts onto this Federal Court and relate to other subsidiary matters, such as the remuneration of judges. They are matters which do not really call for any disputation. I should like to say in conclusion and merely in passing that I happen to know a fair bit about the history of proposals for the establishment of a Superior Court. For example, I happen to know that a prominent Sydney barrister accepted a judgeship on the Commonwealth Industrial Court, whose jurisdiction is now to be absorbed in this Federal Court, on a promise that he would soon be elevated to the chief judgeship of the Superior Court which was then in the pipeline. This proposition has had a very chequered career. As is pointed out in the Minister's second reading speech, it was first spawned by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick and then spurned by him. A Bill was introduced in 1968 by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Bowen, as he now is, but it was not proceeded with and then, as I have said, the proposal introduced by the Labor Government was thrown out by the Senate. I cannot help reflecting upon how much better off the country would be if the Superior Court had been established at the time <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick was talking about it and the promise had been kept to a man who later became Governor-General of Australia. </para>

            <para>-in reply- I am pleased that the Opposition, although moving an amendment to the Federal Court of Australia Bill, is in fact supporting the measures, and even more so because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland has referred to the august progenitor of this whole concept, namely, the present Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick. In fact, the original proposal that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick put forward for a new Federal Court, Superior Court or whatever it might be called would have had jurisdiction only in special federal matters. The Federal Court of Australia Bill and the related Bills that are before the Senate this evening are much more similar to the original proposal of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick than the subsequent Superior Court proposal which became a matter of such great policy by the former Labor Government, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland was a distinguished member. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I well remember the debates we have had in this chamber on the Superior Court Bill. I have just asked my advisers whether this debate is the third, fourth or fifth debate that we have had in this chamber on the subject. If we take <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland 's amendment as raising the issue of the Labor Government's Superior Court proposal, and I think that it must be taken in that way, this debate will be in fact the fifth debate that we have had in the Senate on this matter in recent years. All of us- even the lay members of the Senate, if they are not utterly bored with the tedium of the debate- probably could take part in a debate on this subject in our sleep. </para>
          <para>Acceptance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland 's amendment, which proposes that the jurisdiction of this Court should be extended to cover all original jurisdiction arising under the Constitution or under the laws made by this Parliament, would in fact completely alter the concept of this Bill. I was rather surprised to find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, having put forward that proposal, then criticise the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> and the Government for introducing the Bill and then say it is very hard to explain the difference between our proposal and that of the Superior Court when in fact his amendment to the Bill highlights the distinction very clearly. The reasons for this Bill that I gave on behalf of the Attorney in the second reading speech that I presented to the Senate were quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Bill is to create a Federal court with jurisdiction limited to areas that have developed as special areas of federal judicial interest and expertise. No doubt those areas will be developed in the years ahead. There will be new Acts, new initiatives and no doubt there will be new areas of jurisdiction for this court. But the idea of the proposal of setting up a Federal court is to absorb that rather disparate group of jurisdictions and courts into the one Federal Court of Australia. It is in many ways largely a tidying-up operation. The establishment of a new court to cover all the areas which have been traditionally areas of federal jurisdiction no doubt will have some benefits in future developments. They will come from the individual Acts passed by this Parliament in future years. </para>
          <para>We are most concerned, as the Attorney has indicated, that we should not develop in </para>
          <para>Australia 2 parallel legal systems and jurisdictions a federal jurisdiction and a State jurisdiction. We are concerned to preserve the status and prestige of the State Supreme Courts. We do not want to introduce a new Federal court which will denude them of a great deal of their work and thereby go a long way towards creating a system such as has developed under the federal system in the United States of America where there are parallel court systems. There is a federal court system and a federal jurisdiction, and there is a state court system and state jurisdictions. The object of this Bill is a limited one. The proposal put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland on behalf of the Opposition, if adopted, would greatly widen the whole concept contained in the Bill. For that reason the Government will oppose the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I rise for the purpose merely of recording a few comments on the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill 1976. As my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland indicated when he spoke on the second reading of all these cognate Bills, and there is quite a number of them, the Opposition does not oppose this Bill. As was stated in the second reading speech of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> when the Bill was introduced in August or September, the purpose of the Bill is to give effect to the report on remuneration payable to judges as made by the Remuneration Tribunal to the Government on 21 June and to a subsequent report to the Government on remuneration payable to the  President  of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. </para>

          <para class="block">Appeals Tribunal under this Bill are to be made retrospective to 1 June. </para>
          <para>I place on record that it was the Whitlam Labor Government that established the Remuneration Tribunal, and the recommendations of that independent tribunal are made by it after detailed inquiry by it. These increases are the first that have been awarded since March 1975 to the people occupying the positions mentioned. I also want it recorded that the Tribunal 's report has not been made on the principle of indexation. Clearly the Tribunal has based its findings on a number of principles. Firstly, the High Court is the pre-eminent Court in Australia. Secondly, the salaries and allowances of High Court judges should have a suitable margin above those paid to federal and State judges. Since March 1975, the last time an increase was granted to federal judges, salaries and allowances of State judges have risen substantially. Thirdly, there is no basis for formal links between judicial salaries and those paid to Ministers of the Crown or to First Division officers of the Australian Public Service. Fourthly, the Tribunal does not suggest that the rates proposed for federal judges establish margins which the Tribunal necessarily considers appropriate on relation to other judicial offices or salaries in the public sector of the economy. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable senator wants to speak on that he can do so, but I am just setting down these things that have been enumerated because members of the Government have been talking about wage indexation and pressures by the trade union movement for a long time. I am just having these things recorded for future reference. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack wants to go through the Tribunal's determination and make other references to it he may do so and this Committee debate may go on for some time. All I want to say is that the increased amounts that are payable under this legislation on a percentage basis are very much higher than the increases that were recently awarded by the Tribunal to Ministers of the Crown and to members of the Australian Parliament. For instance, the percentage increase in salary for the Chief Justice of the High Court is 16.7 per cent. The percentage increase for other High Court judges is 15.9 per cent. The percentage increase for other federal judges, who are the subject of the Tribunal's findings, is 12.9 per cent. But so far as the increase for members of Parliament was concerned and members of Parliament had not received an increase in salary since March 1975- the percentage in the determination for them on a salary basis was a mere 6.3 per cent. That is what I was trying to say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack earlier. </para>

We accept the fact that it was established by a Labor Government and we are prepared to abide by its findings. After all, it took evidence in public. It reached its conclusions based on the evidence and after informing itself, so we are told in its findings, on all aspects. We believe it is proper to preserve the independence of the Tribunal. We do not oppose the provisions set out in the Bill. I have taken advantage of the Committee stage to indicate that the Tribunal, in bringing down its findings so far as the salaries of judges of federal courts are concerned, on a percentage basis granted a much larger increase to judicial office holders than it did to members of this Parliament. </para>

The Remuneration and Allowances Amendment (No. 2) Bill is a Bill to put remuneration allowances for justices of the High Court- I am referring to Schedule 3 so I am within the ambit of your observations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairmanin</inline> a preferred position above and beyond all other people in the community. I acknowledge and direct the attention of honourable senators to the fact that the Remuneration and Allowances Tribunal is, of course, presided over by a judge. When I go through Schedule 3 I do not mind seeing that the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia is acknowledged and recognised as the chief of one of the arms of government and receives a salary of $52,000 per annum. But when I look at some of the other eminent adornments of the bench in the Commonwealth jurisdiction I find all sorts of odd characters- if I may use that derogatory term in this sense- who are given special remuneration. </para>

          </interjection>
          <para>By interruption I addressed myself to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, saying that the Presiding Officers of this Parliament who occupy a semi judicial position and who, in the Table of Precedence are put far above and beyond some of the lesser lights of the Commonwealth jurisdiction, are treated with less than consideration because in fact they do occupy a semi-judicial position. </para>
          <para>I content myself merely at this stage by directing the attention of honourable senators to the fact that I do not accept that the  Chairman  of the Remuneration and Allowances Tribunal occupies a position of immutable distinction as was accorded once to the Medes and the Persians. At some stage we have to look at the Tribunal and offer criticisms of its findings. Simply because the Tribunal was appointed, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland said, by a Government which he once adorned- I say this without any contempt at all; he was a man of quite singular distinction in the Ministry of the Government which he supported- I do not accept that any comment upon the Tribunal is beyond the ambit of this chamber. I well remember that one of the present justices of the High Court was one of the first honourable senators of that time to make the observation and draw the distinction as to what is happening in the context of this Tribunal. I hope that the next time a recommendation comes down from the Tribunal and is embedded either in regulation or in statute some more stringent observations will be made by honourable senators on the preoccupation of the Tribunal with members of the bench. </para>

            <para>- In relation to the comments by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, I do not propose to discuss in any way, certainly not critically, the recommendations of the Remuneration and Allowances Tribunal to which we are giving effect in this legislation. But I thought I might make some comment by way of explanation on the salaries of federal judges. I do not know whether there has been an increase of 16 per cent on their previous salary. I have not worked out the mathematics but I think it is important to compare the salaries which have been recommended and which we are approving in this legislation with the salaries of judges of supreme courts because I am sure that that comparison would be one which would have been very clear to members of the Tribunal in recommending the salaries provided for in this Bill. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The salary for the Chief Justice of the New South Wales Supreme Court is $50,660. The salary for judges of the New South Wales Supreme Court is $46,350 compared with the salary of a judge of the Federal Court of Australia of only $42,000 even with this new recommendation. Judges of the Queensland Supreme Court receive $42,940. Judges of the Tasmanian Supreme Court receive $39,735. Judges of the Supreme Court of Victoria receive $43,290 1 do not propose to read out any more of these figures. I think that gives some indication of the comparison. </para>

              <para>-Thank you. I think those comparisons explain the level of the recommendations. These new salary scales for judges of federal courts compare somewhat unfavourably with the salaries for judges of supreme courts by and large throughout Australia. Indeed, it is rather significant that the new salary of the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia at $52,500 is less than $2,000 more than the salary of the Chief Justice of New South Wales. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- It is useful to move out of the judicial area and back into the fresh air of our rural countryside. Of course, this Bill will not give rise to quite the emotive response that occurred on the last occasion on which the Parliament was dealing with the question of fertilisers. At that time, of course, we were dealing with the superphosphate bounty. We are dealing this evening with the Nitrogenous Fertilizers Subsidy Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976. Once again, on behalf of the Opposition, I indicate that we do not intend to oppose the Bill, although we believe that some comments ought to be made in respect of the Bill because it is another piecemeal measure. It is another piece of legislation that deals with the effects of the crisis that faces agriculture and does not in any way deal with the causes of the problem besetting so many thousands of our farmers today. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition does not oppose the amendments to the nitrogenous subsidy, because they are in keeping with the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission. However, we condemn the Government for not instituting programs envisaged by the IAC in its very fundamental examination of rural industry and such recommendations as are designed to alleviate the hardship that currently is being experienced by farmers. The Bill seeks to extend the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy scheme for a further year until 31 December 1977. I suppose it reflects something of the way in which the Government regards the rural sector that in the twilight of this <inline font-style="italic">session we</inline> are dealing with a number of Bills concerned with agriculture. Many of those Bills should have been on the business paper earlier this year, if we are to believe the rhetoric and the propaganda upon which the Government based its campaign against the Whitlam Government in 1 975 and its subsequent election campaign of November-December last year. </para>
          <para>The Bill seeks to reduce the subsidy from $78.74 per tonne of nitrogen content to $60 per tonne of such content. It proposes that the 1977 calendar year subsidy be payable at the reduced rate. Of course, it leaves in abeyance the future of the subsidy, because the suggestion was made by the Industries Assistance Commission that the nitrogenous fertiliser subsidy should be phased out over a 3-year period. The Government has taken the initial step, in its first year of office, of reducing the subsidy. Perhaps one can read into that that ultimately it intends to adopt the total recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission in relation to the fertiliser subsidy. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party consistently has held the view that the rural producer most requiring assistance and support does not receive such assistance and support with across-the-board subsidies of this nature. They do not take into account the degree of hardship which is faced by the small farmer. In fact, they give the larger farmer the greater subsidy. Because the Labor Party has expressed that view, it has been misinterpreted to mean that the Labor Party is against all forms of subsidy assistance or assistance to the rural community. I hope that our performance during the 3 years for we were in government and certainly our attitude to legislation which has been passed by the Parliament this year have shown that that does not accurately reflect the Labor Party's attitude. What the Labor Party Opposition is against is the manner in which subsidies such as those based on tonnage use of fertilisers, or those based on volume of production, which purportedly assist the genuine, needy farmer, in fact give only a nominal assistance to him because of the amount of fertiliser that he uses. </para>
          <para>We look forward to the day when the Government will introduce legislation- it did not come in the first <inline font-style="italic">session, and</inline> obviously it will not come in this session of Parliament- that recognises the plight or the need of the small farmer. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and all of the spokesmen for the Government have expressed the view that something like half the farmers in this country today are earning less than $5,000 a year, which is considerably less than average weekly earnings and which places them even further down the income scale than those in the 70 per cent of the Australian work force who receives less than average weekly earnings. </para>
          <para>It has been established that the bulk of the assistance from product-based subsidies is obtained by farmers who do not require as much assistance as those lower down the scale. The Government claims that it will consider the level of subsidy to apply after 13 December 1977. So we have a year to wait before we can see whether the Government implements the second recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission. I have no doubt that it will do so. I have little doubt that the Government intends to follow the balance of the IAC recommendations which are related to the subsidy. That is to say, in the second year the subsidy will be reduced to $40 per tonne of nitrogen content and in the third year the subsidy will be reduced to $20 per tonne of nitrogen content before the Government phases out the bounty completely. When one considers that it is intended to phase out this subsidy, it is amazing how little reaction there has been from the farming community, especially when we consider the hullabaloo, the outcry, the protest meetings and the rhetoric that was expressed when the Labor Government took the step 2 years ago of phasing out the superphosphate bounty. </para>
          <para>The decision to phase out this bounty will, in certain instances, in the absence of alternative schemes, exacerbate the hardship already experienced by those recipients who ought to be considered for some form of government assistance. So the Government has failed to produce simultaneously a viable income support scheme designed to assist those farmers experiencing severe downturn in their real income. I do not think any honourable senators needs any advice about the very serious plight that is facing so many sections of Australia's rural industries today. </para>
          <para>The Labor Party does not oppose the reduction of the amount of the nitrogenous bounty but it does oppose the failure of the Government to introduce legislation which would give assistance to those farmers in need. We always have been critical of product-based subsidies, but we never have been critical of subsidies designed to assist people in need. In fact, the hub of all of the legislative programs of the Labor Government between 1972 and 1975 was identification, recognition and legislation, taking into account the question of need. What we are opposed to is the indifference that the present Government is displaying in relation to people in need in Australia. It has to be stated in this year, 1976, that we can look at 2 areas of need- a large section of the rural community and the unemployed. Both of these sections are being ignored by a Government which seems to be more keen to promote the foreign mining interests than to subsidise commercial and other concessions such as tax allowances for the Australian worker, whether he be a farmer in the rural sector or a labourer in the city. </para>

          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline></para>
          <para>When replying to your Question- Without-Notice of 21 October 1976, 1 promised to make enquiries with regard to the possibility of providing a facility by which deductions could be made from Social Security pensions to meet private Health Insurance contributions. I have attached a copy of the Hansard record of your question and my reply for your convenience. </para>
          <para>As you know, arrangements are made to deduct the standard Medibank levy from pension on request. This facility is in line with arrangements commenced when pension first become taxable. Since that de pensioners have always been offered the facility to have tax deductions made from their pension. These arrangements help pensioners to meet their taxation liability where their other income, plus their pension, requires them to pay tax and they are unable to make any other arrangements for periodic deductions. As the Medibank levy is payable with tax to the Commissioner for Taxation, the above arrangements ensure that pensioners, who have no other ready means of paying the levy by deduction, are relieved of the burden of making lump sum tax payments at the end of the financial year. </para>
          <para>As you are aware, for those pensioners who choose to take cover beyond basic Medibank, extensive facilities already exist through Medibank and private fund organisations for payment of any extra insurance which pensioners may take. </para>
          <para>I am advised that it would be very costly to set up facilities within the Department of Social Security for the payment of private fund insurance. The provision of such facilities would require extensive changes to the computer systems in use and would make further demands on staff resources which currently are heavily strained to provide the basic services for which the Department is responsible. </para>
          <para>As such a service would, in equity, have to be offered to all private funds, I think you will understand that it would be beyond the present resources of my Department to provide it. </para>
          <para>Yours sincerely, (MARGARET GUILFOYLE) </para>

        <para class="block">I want to say to the Minister that in view of the fact that it was this Government that inter fer red with the Medibank system which was operating quite successfully under the previous Government and brought about the system under which pensioners are under some considerable inconvenience I see no reason why this Government cannot make some provision for pensioners if they want to enter into a section of Medibank Private which would mean that they would share a room in hospital. I do not see why the Department of Social Security cannot make provision to have the necessary amount deducted from their pension. This would save the pensioner inconvenience. Although the Minister has said in this letter that such a service would be beyond the resources of the Department to provide, surely in the interests of elderly citizens of this nation, the Department with all the resources at its disposal could make some provision to alleviate the unnecessary worry and the trouble that these people have to go to if they want to insure under the Medibank standard scheme or to take out extra cover with Medibank Private. </para>
        <para>It is argued that Medibank Private is on the same level as private health insurance but, of course, we are all aware that Medibank Private was a company that was set up in the premises which were operated by the Whitlam Government under the previous Medibank scheme. The Government is using all the facilities that previously were used and calling it Medibank Private. In effect, it was a Government instrumentality and all the Government has done is to change the name. I make a plea again to the Government and ask it to do something to help pensioners and elderly citizens to take out extra cover if they so wish. It may be that not many of them will require that extra cover. </para>
        <para>Another matter I wish to raise which causes me great concern is a letter dated 18 November which, no doubt, would have been sent to all members of Parliament from the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt).</inline> I will read the letter to the Senate in order to get it in its proper context. It states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>In order to clarify the position in regard to Commonwealth grants under the Community Health Program, I am writing to notify you that, in the current financial year, the Government proposes an appropriation of $8 1 million for community health services and facilities. This includes $70 million for the Community Health Program specifically. By comparison, estimated expenditure under the Community Health Program in 1975-76 was $54.3 million. </para>
          <para>The proposed appropriation of $70 million this financial year includes an allocation of $5. 1 million for your State. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Of course, this letter from which I am quoting no doubt was sent to South Australian members of the House of Representatives and South Australian senators. It continues:   . . covering both State-conducted projects and projects conducted by non-governmental organisations. </para>
        <para>Since the Community Health Program commenced in 1973-74, Commonwealth financial assistance has been made available for a total of over 700 individual projects, ranging from small to relatively large and covering a wide variety of project categories to meet the varying needs of particular areas or groups. The $70 million to be appropriated for the Community Health Program this financial year will not provide for growth in the Program at this stage- </para>
        <para>That, in effect, means that the program has stagnated-  but it is intended to maintain previously approved projects at a viable level of activity. During the current financial year the Government will have the opportunity of evaluating the success of the Program. </para>
        <para>Consistent with our federalism policies, Commonwealth financial assistance under the Community Health Program now takes the form of annual block grants to the States, and it is primarily the responsibility of each State to determine the allocations to individual projects from within its block grant. This will provide the States with the flexibility necessary for efficient administration but, of course, there will also be a process of Joint Commonwealth/State review of the implementation of each annual program with a view to ensuring that its essential characteristics are maintained. </para>
        <para>Attached to this letter is a list of the projects in your State which have been approved for Commonwealth purposes in relation to the $5. 1 million block grant to your State. My Department will be seeking details of the allocations decided upon by the States for individual projects. When these details are received- probably over the next four to six weeks- my Department will advise you of the allocations applicable to the projects in this list. </para>
        <para class="block">What disturbs me greatly is that when I examined the list of projects that was attached to this letter, under the name and location of the project and the description of the project as approved for new health program funding in 1976-77 I immediately looked at the electoral divisions of Angas and Barker. I live in Angas and I live on the border of Barker and I endeavour to service those electorates as a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator from</inline> South Australia </para>
        <para>Under the heading 'Name and Location of Project' is the Murray Bridge Community Health Centre- Development of a Minor Community Health Service project. That rang a bell with me. I immediately rang my secretary and asked him to go through my file. I found out that I was advised by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham,</inline> the Minister for Health in the Labor Government, of allocations for certain projects. I made a statement in the provincial Press dated 1 November 1974 that $16,050 had been allocated for a paramedical centre and nursing personnel at Murray Bridge. No money is mentioned under the heading for this project for 1976-77 by this Government. There is just a description of the project as approved for community health program funding in this financial year; that is, the development of a minor community health service project for the Murray Bridge Community Health Centre. </para>
        <para>I am at a loss to know what the Government is doing. I do not know whether it is now saying that it funded this centre for this financial year or whether, in effect, it is repeating an announcement of the funding which the Labor Government made and which I had the privilege of announcing some 2 years ago. A little further on the Riverland Health Advisory Services Committee is described as an advisory committee for coordination of health services in the area. In my Press statement of 1 November 1974 I announced that an amount of $23,475 had been allocated for the Riverland Community Health Centre to co-ordinate health services in the area, namely, Renmark, Berri, Barmera, Loxton and Waikerie. </para>

            <para>- It was announced 2 years ago. I now refer to the electorate of Barker. There was a project for the Coonalpyn Community Health Centre, a community practice nurse for the area. An amount of $9,000 was allocated, which I announced on 1 November 1 974, for the provision of a community nurse to serve the area. A little further on in the statement by the Minister under the heading 'Name and Location of Project' is the Christie's Beach/ Noarlunga Community Health Centre construction and operation of a temporary community health centre providing primary care and a range of community health services. An announcement was made in 1974 of an amount of $ 1 87,200 to establish and operate a community health centre. The money was appropriated 2 years ago by the Labor Government. </para>

          <para>My question is addressed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> in his capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I refer to the report of the special youth unemployment working party which was recently handed to the South Australian Government. Is the Minister aware that the report states that the image of the Commonwealth Employment Service is not high amongst young people in South Australia? Further, has the Minister considered the fact that the report makes strong criticism of the CES for being unable to match young people to jobs and for placing too heavy an emphasis upon rigid work tests for young people? As the report rightfully recognises the skills and concern of the officers of the CES in their endeavours to find employment for young people, could it be that the officers are having to shoulder blame which rightly rests with the Australian Government because of its budgetary restraints? Finally, in view of the tragic numbers of young people unemployed and the expected spiral in these figures in January 1977 due to the numbers of school leavers seeking employment, can the Minister provide the Senate with a clear undertaking that significant Government initiatives to eliminate this problem will be taken in the immediate future? </para>

          <para class="block">Dear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline></para>
          <para>I refer to your Question Without Notice asked in the Senate on 6.10.76, concerning the Report of the Youth Unemployment Working Party to the Premier of South Australia, the  Hond. A. Dunstan, Q.C., M.H.A., in May of this year. </para>
          <para>I understand that the Youth Unemployment Working Party was set up at the direction of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dunstan</inline> following representations to his Government by the Unemployment Youth Action Committee. This committee comprises a group of youth workers and social workers from a variety of Government and non-governmental agencies concerned about youth unemployment. The terms of reference of the Working Party were, in summary, to coordinate State Government Department and other programs for unemployed youth; examine the long-term aspects of the problem and make recommendations on State Government action; and consult, where appropriate, with a broad range of State and Commonwealth Departments, voluntary agencies, employers and trade unions. </para>
          <para>The South Australian Regional Office of my Department cooperated and assisted the Working Party in its enquiries. In particular a special survey of unemployed youth was conducted by three officers of my Department in Adelaide. The Working Party's Report notes, in its conclusions, a number of comments arising from the special survey concerning the operations of the Commonwealth Employment Service and, in particular, the difficulties being faced by the staff of the Service. My Government is aware that the Commonwealth Employment Service is under pressure at the present time and has recently announced that it will be the subject of a major review. </para>
          <para>The criticism of the CES contained in the report is based mainly on interviews held with young people who have been unable to find employment. Unfortunately the report did not seek to balance the views of these people with those of the very large number of young people who had been successfully placed in employment by CES. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>The report concluded that there should be a wide variety of approaches to the problems of youth unemployment. You will of course be aware that the Government has recently taken some significant initiatives with regard to unemployed youth. </para>
        <para>Firstly, a special youth employment training program has been set up under NEAT. Its purpose is to provide the opportunity for six months' on-the-job training to young people who face being severely disadvantaged in the labour market. A special subsidy was introduced to the NEAT System for the program. In three working weeks some 1 100 young people have been placed in training under this program and 2500 employers have come forward with vacancies. Training placements have been effected across the spectrum of industry and with a geographical distribution which has by no means been limited to metropolitan areas. </para>
        <para>Secondly, programs sponsored by community groups and aimed at providing support for young unemployed persons and improving their personal capacity to find employment while facing a period of unemployment, can now be assisted under the recently announced Community Youth Support Scheme. The Scheme seeks to help young people maintain a positive orientation to employment and job finding and to provide them with opportunities to undertake voluntary community service activities, whilst unable to find regular employment. </para>
        <para>Thirdly, the Government has instituted an inquiry into the relationship between education and the labour market. It is hoped that this enquiry will enable the Government to focus on some of the longer-term issues affecting difficulties school leavers experience in gaining satisfactory initial acceptance into the work force. </para>
        <para>Fourthly, the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet is conducting a comprehensive investigation into the various services provided by government agencies to youth. It is expected that this investigation will explore the need for the establishment of a Youth Bureau to coordinate and provide a focus for action in the area of youth affairs. Finally, officers of my Department have been working with officers of the State Departments of Labour and Technical Education on a review of aspects of apprenticeship in an attempt to develop initiatives aimed at improving the effectiveness of the Government's incentives to employers in relation to the employment and training of apprentices. The Government already provides substantial assistance to employers of apprentices under the National Apprenticeship Advisory Scheme and further development of that initiative will not only enhance opportunities for employment and training available to young people but also assist in ensuring a ready supply of skilled tradesmen to the workforce. </para>
        <para>I am sure you will agree that the initiatives I have referred to indicate quite clearly that the Government is well aware of the seriousness of the youth employment situation and has taken appropriate action. I can assure you that my Department is keeping the matter under close review, particularly as to the need for any further action. </para>

In conclusion, as I said earlier about the other 2 matters, I hope the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> can do something to assist those few pensioners who require the Department of Social Security to make the necessary deductions from their pensions to cover any extra medical coverage they may require under Medibank. I am making this request not on behalf of the other private health funds but only on behalf of the one set up by the Government because I recognise it as having been set up by the Government and not as one of the multitude of private enterprise health funds endeavoured to be sold to the public. On the other matter I raised, I hope that the Minister will be able to obtain from the Minister for Health, some clarification of the document which he circulated to members in South Australia and no doubt to members in every other State. </para>

          <para>- On 3 November I asked a question of the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> in regard to a promise she made when she appeared on a telethon program on television Channel 7 in Perth. I asked her whether it was a fact that the film had been destroyed so that no record of the Minister's promise was available. On 9 November I received a letter from TVW Channel 7 which stated that the company's attention had been drawn to an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> on 6 November which referred to my question. The company felt from the terms of the article that I had posed a question which reflected upon its integrity. I was assured that the videotape of the interview was completely intact and I was invited personally to view the videotape. I accepted this offer. So that the record may be put straight, I wish it to be recorded that the tape and all that it contains are intact. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator McLaren</inline>raised first a matter that related to a letter which he had received from me in answer to a question. The letter, as read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> is self explanatory. I did investigate the possibility of deducting from pensions the amount that would be appropriate for private insurance if a pensioner required this. As I stated in the letter, it is a matter which is unable to be handled. I state again that Medibank Private is in the same category as any other private insurer and it is not possible for us to make this service available to pensioners. I have nothing that I can add to the letter which was read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> which was my response to the investigation that was made on this matter. It should be pointed out that it is not new for pensioners to make their own private insurance arrangements. Under the previous Medibank they were still required privately to insure for those services outside standard Medibank. I believe that they are able to do this if they require that additional service. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The second matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> with regard to the community health program is one to which I shall make a more general comment than the one that would cover the specific item that he mentioned as being one in which he was interested. To put the record right, let me say that in the 3 years 1973-74 to 1975-76 the Commonwealth made a total of $ 125m available for community health projects. Much of this assistance was at 100 per cent rate and the rest was at the high rates of 90 per cent of operating costs and 75 per cent of capital costs. As the community health program expenditure in 1975-76 was $54.3m and having regard to the absolute necessity to reduce Commonwealth expenditure, the 1976-77 allocation of $70m represents a very substantial contribution to the continuation of this program at a viable level of activity. </para>
        <para>As a matter of background I should like to state on behalf of the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> that the States submitted programs totalling $95. 5m to cover their estimated requirements for the continuation in 1976-77 of existing community health projects. After critical examination and detailed discussions with the States by the Hospitals and Health Services Commission, the total estimated requirement for this purpose emerged as $85.9m. This was the estimated requirement for the continuation of already approved projects at a level of activity previously proposed by the States and accepted for the purposes of Commonwealth funding. In May 1976 the Treasury announced that $81 m would be available in 1 976-77 for the continuation of community health services and facilities. This includes $70m for the community health program. Deducting $5. lm which is required for the continuation of national projects leaves $64.9m available for State projects. That is $2 lm less than the estimated total requirement of $85.9m. It appears that overall the States will find it necessary to apply some restraints on expenditure in 1976-77, although, if past years' failures to achieve expenditure targets continue in 1976-77, the actual degree of restraint required should be less significant than the States contend. </para>
        <para>I will refer to the Minister for Health the specific matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and obtain an answer to clarify his mind on that subject. I will refer the matter raised about the Commonwealth Employment Service to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> to obtain a response for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline> I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mcintosh</inline> for his comments. I believe that any misunderstanding which may have arisen out of the telethon appearance has been satisfactorily dealt with in Western Australia following the meeting of the community organisations with Federal and State government authorities to plan the priorities of projects which can be undertaken in our 3-year program. </para>

              <para>I am aware of the statement referred to by the honourable senator. It is correct that there is no legislative restriction on Queenslanders joining private health funds in other States. Under the National Health Act, funds must have separate State registration and funds (other than restricted membership funds) are not permitted to carry on business outside the State of registration. For the purposes of the Act the term 'carry on business' means to use premises or the services of a servant or agent in a State or Territory for enrolment of contributors or the payment of benefits. In the circumstances the enrolment of interstate members is not prohibited. However, funds have the right to refuse members, except on the grounds of state of health, which they could exercise for interstate persons if they so choose. </para>

            <para>The installation of these machines has been undertaken by the Department of Transport primarily to raise airport revenue. </para>
            <para>However, the units also appear to reduce the incidence of vandalism in the terminals and provide amusement for not only children but other travellers required to pass time in the terminal. </para>
            <para>The units have been installed by concessionaires in most major terminals and the Department has had no complaints from either tenants or persons using the terminals. On the contrary they would appear a welcome addition to the existing amenities. </para>
