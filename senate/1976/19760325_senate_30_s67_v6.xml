            <para>-I have no difficulty at all over the statements which I have made and those made by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> I reiterate that we believe that the Australian Broadcasting Commission must be independent, and it must report fairly and accurately. It is always somewhat interesting to me that the Opposition appears so touchy about the ABC. If ever there was a government that leant on the ABC it was the previous Government, and it was notorious for doing so. Our aim is to make the Australian Broadcasting Commission free and independent of pressures both from Governments and from Oppositions. That is our aim and that is what we intend to do. Over the last 3 years we saw enough of the manipulations, the attempted manipulations and the waste of taxpayers' money in trying to prop up the worst government in the history of Australia. </para>

Following the recent announcement by General-Motors Holden 's Pty Ltd that it is also to produce a 4-cylinder car engine, can the Minister say what effect this latest decision will have on the proposed Australian- Japanese consortium to produce 4-cylinder car engines in Australia and also on the Australian content in locally produced cars, particularly in relation to suggestions that it be reduced to 85 per cent? </para>

            <para>-Yes, I did see the reference to this matter in the Press and I was surprised that yesterday nobody raised the matter with me. I would like to say one or two things. First of all, Chrysler Australia Ltd is an excellent company with which I have very good relationships and with which I have had a lot of very useful discussions. The company representatives paid me the courtesy of sending the whole of the detail through before they held their Press conference. The Press conference was held substantially to protect their own position against people who are trying by innuendo to create false positions. Therefore I think they are entitled to at least some defence from me. A report appeared in one newspaper which indicated that the company was perhaps having problems. The announcement we believe was mis-described as a last minute attempt to convince the Government that the company's facilities should be used to produce 4-cylinder engines. It was nothing of the kind. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Senior executives of Chrysler visited the Department which I currently look after on the day before this announcement and they told me as well as the Department of the terms of their announcement and the reasons why it was wise to take this course of action. They explained that the company wished to counter damaging and incorrect speculation that if the Adelaide engine consortium does not eventuate the company will have no alternative means of obtaining a locally made 4-cylinder engine. Some ill-informed people have gone so far as to suggest that </para>
          <para class="block">Chrysler's future as a manufacturer depends on the formation of an engine consortium. On earlier occasions similar speculation has apparently had an adverse effect on the company's sales. In making its present announcement, the Chrysler company merely wishes to re-assure its dealers and the public in general that, while the proposed consortium is its first preference as a source of 4-cylinder engines, it does have well developed alternative plans to manufacture its own engines. It has many other options also available to it. As the Senate knows, the Government is in the process of reaching a total position on the motor vehicle industry and it is hoped that, in the process of doing that, there will bc proper room for everybody, including manufacturers, and that due regard will be had to the consumer interests in this country. </para>

By way of explanation, 1 ask him whether he has seen a tantalising news item in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> this morning which states that the Russian Embassy has been attempting to buy a house and land next to the telephone exchange at Deakin which handles switching station operations for information for the outer space communication system? My question therefore is: Will the Minister make an explanation to the Senate as to the truth or otherwise of this report? Secondly, will he inform the Senate whether there are methods of electronic surveillance over switching stations which arc available to any technologically advanced power? Thirdly, would a system of induction make available signals to anyone who desired to receive those signals? </para>

Expenditure in the current financial year is $6m less than would have occurred if no civil works had been deferred and is, in fact, Sim higher than the amount provided for in the Budget. This has to be seen in the context of a total publicly funded program for Australia of $2,000m. </para>
            <para>The Government, in addition to its commitments and expenditure on the Civil Works Programme throughout Australia earlier this month, approved an additional $ 1 2.5 mas a special allocation for works for the Darwin Reconstruction Commission in the Darwin area for the remainder of this financial year.

Some of them provide almost a full range of services, while others supply somewhat limited services. It has been brought to my attention that there are some difficulties with regard to staff restrictions. For instance, it is understood that in a regional office which had 3 typists, two of whom have left, there would be difficulties. State directors are overcoming whatever difficulties they are facing. If there is any information which will give more details, on which I can report after I have examined the question from the honourable senator, I shall do so. All officers of the Department are maintaining the services as required. They are making whatever adjustments are necessary within the Government's decision with regard to reduction of staff. </para>

            <para>-Yes, I have. The area about which the honourable senator is asking is of interest in the Australian society. People who retire and who have immense skill and ability very seldom use that in any way on advisory or consultancy bases. I have felt for quite a long time that in Australia there is a solid case for making much better use of the ability of people who have retired at a reasonable age, or a little earlier than they might otherwise have wished, in the decision making and advisory processes. One of the things we are looking at in this area of small business counselling is access to this sort of ability. Another is a concerted program of consultation between ourselves and the States to make sure that we work closely together in the area of trying to assist small business. </para>

By way of preface I point out that honourable senators will recall the great headlines in the Press and the mock consternation of honourable senators opposite regarding the activities of the Commonwealth Police in tracking down a dangerous group of neo-fascist guerillas operating in and out of Australia and Yugoslavia in the past. Will the Minister inform the Senate why the Commonwealth Police raided the office and seized the books of a Melbourne insurance group last Friday? Is this the start of an Australia-wide investigation into the insurance industry? If this information, as reported in last Saturday's edition of the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> is correct, did the instructions to raid the insurance office come from the Minister in charge of the Commonwealth Police or the Attorney-General?

He will bc aware of the difficult position in which the ball bearing factory of SKF Australia (Sales) Pty Ltd in Echuca in Victoria has been placed by the Cabinet's acceptance of the Industries Assistance Commission's recommendation that quotas be lifted on the importation of Echuca type ball bearings. This factory is the only complete manufacturer of ball bearings in Australia. The company is concerned that the collection and publication of import statistics is very slow and that there could be a flood of ball bearings, similar to that which occurred in 1974 and early 1975, without the Government or the industry being aware of it for some months. Can the Minister take some action to improve the position regarding the collection and publication of these statistics? </para>

            <para>- I know something of this matter and I may be able to help the honourable senator. One of the problems we always have in Australia in the decision making process is that we rely upon statistics which tend to be published rather late. The latest figures available on import clearances for ball bearings are those for the September quarter of 1975. Normally, further information becomes available within six weeks to eight weeks of the publication of the previous figures. It is not as easy to speed up these statistical processes as honourable senators might imagine. It is desirable to do so, but for a long time there have been problems in Australia in reducing the time lag in regard to the publication of official statistics. I think last year or the year before a proposal was put forward by the then Government to speed up the collection of statistics and to bring the process into a more modern era. The then Opposition- I think I led for the Opposition in the debate- supported that proposal very warmly, and we still support it. My Department, on the other hand, carries out its own continuous check process in an effort to monitor the situations which appear to present some problems. Therefore, in that context, I am able to make some comments. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the IAC report to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> referred the Commission stated that it had no evidence to support the view that imports would increase significantly in the short term. As I have mentioned, the Government is watching this area closely. If the demand were to rise very quickly, we would take whatever action we considered necessary, consistent with our attitude to try to help the industry. When the Government receives the further detailed report on long term measures for the ball bearing industry from the IAC some time later this year, it will consider the question of full long term assistance. </para>

          <para class="block">Whilst some people could be offended by that term, other people like myself who are professing Christians would be offended if they were asked to use the term 'given name' rather that Christian name'. Therefore I ask the Minister whether she will have a look at the proposition that on cards or forms that have to be filled in the term 'Christian names/given names' is used so that no one will be offended. </para>

We were welcomed and received nothing but kindness from the people on the island covering a wide political spectrum. I deliberately requested my Press secretary to go to Norfolk Island because I thought that it was important that he also should understand the views of the community, their wants and their needs. After all, there is a media system on the island which is struggling to remain in existence. He was able to talk to the local journalists and to the people running the local radio station. Norfolk Island is almost 1000 miles away from the Australian mainland. It is a magnificent community. I make no apology at all for taking my Press secretary with me. </para>

We would not have been able to achieve a production standard at night that would have been in the best interests of either the ABC or the Tattoo organisers. These technical difficulties have been frequently pointed out to the organisers since the project was first mooted in February last year. The ABC has consistently pointed out the technical problems to the organisers and rejects suggestions of a 'lastminute ' withdrawal. In fact, we are disappointed that technical considerations make a coverage of the Tattoo at night impractical. </para>
            <para>However, since <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters'</inline> question in the Senate, the organisers of the Tattoo have announced a special daytime performance for children on Friday, 26 March. We are most interested in this and have re-opened negotiations with the organisers with a view to producing a thirty minute television program from the afternoon presentation (when there should be no lighting problems) for later transmission. </para>

As far as any announcement with regard to radio and television advertising of cigarettes and tobacco is concerned, the Minister for Health has made his statements. The reference to the proposed legislation relates to the fact that the State Ministers for Health at their meeting in 1975 agreed to work towards some uniformity of legislation in this matter. I am unable to justify or to reconcile the 2 matters which have been referred to by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I am not one to quarrel with the eminence of the Jess ops, wherever one may find them. A very interesting report on the abolition of death duties was produced by a Senate Committee a couple of years ago in which the revenue derived from death duties and the cost of collecting death duties was fairly well tabulated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> was the  Chairman  of that Committee. It may be recalled by those who followed the work of the Committee that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lawrie</inline> and myself made a minority report in which we said that we thought it would be worth while for the Commonwealth to abdicate the field. As far as I remember, the revenue yield from the tax is about $70m to $75m in a year, depending on who dies or the level of estates in that year. As to the question of whether the Commonwealth will abdicate the field and if it did so, what its consequential action might be, I cannot answer that. This is really a policy question. It is also a Budget question and one cannot answer questions in those areas. I understand the concern of the honourable senator and, indeed, of a great many Australians. I think that the matter is still worth looking into. </para>

            <para>-I have a general base paper from the Treasury on the question of the Provident Account contributors. I will endeavour to extract from that paper sufficient material to answer the honourable senator's question. If it is not sufficient, the question will have been monitored in my office and we will supply data from the Treasury to back up the information that is provided here. I understand that there will be no provident account under the new superannuation arrangements that will come into effect on 1 July and that all the present Provident Fund contributors will transfer to the new scheme. As announced on 25 February 1976, these contributors will qualify for the full government financed pension of 50 per cent of final salary on retirement at age 65 years after 20 years contributory service and will be eligible for the additional pension for more than 30 years contributory service in the same way as other contributors. The advantages to Provident Account contributors, as they are listed here, are: Firstly, access to pension benefits, the government element of which will be updated; secondly, very much better benefits on age or invalidity retirement or death; thirdly, full benefit on retirement after 20 years contributory service; and, fourthly, retention of the right to take a full lump sum benefit on the present basis. If the honourable senator would like additional information, we can check it out after question time and get more detail from the Treasury. </para>

            <para>-My question is directed to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. The Minister will appreciate that parents and teachers are concerned about the fate of the commissions set up by the Labor Government, particularly the Schools Commission. It is understood that the operation of these commissions is being investigated by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Harry</inline> Bland. Will the Minister indicate whether, as part of the system of open government favoured by the present Government, the findings of the Bland Committee will be made public and subjected to public debate before being implemented? </para>

            <para>-My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Has the Minister seen comments by the  chairman  of the Australian Telecommunications Commission that it is hoped that by the year 2000 every home will have a telephone and that the invention of the telephone has brought a new dimension to business and social life in the 20th century? Do such comments apply to the rural areas of Australia? Will country people have to wait until the year 2000 before their applications for telephones are serviced without long waiting periods before installation? When can it be expected that some relief will be given to country applicants who presently are required to pay many hundreds of dollars, and in some cases thousands of dollars, in installation charges? </para>

            <para>- I did note the statement which arose out of a publication called <inline font-style="italic">Telecom 2000,</inline> a planning report issued by Telecom Australia. I am delighted to tell the honourable senator that my understanding is that the report says that it does apply to the rural areas. So that answers the first part of his question. In the second part of his question the honourable senator asked whether people in rural areas will have to wait until the year 2000 before their applications for telephones are serviced without long waiting periods before installation. As I understand the situation and am advised, Telecom is making strong efforts to reduce the waiting time on installations and that in the current financial year -1975-76- Telecom has the specific aim of reducing by 10 per cent the average delay in installations. I am informed that it has been able to achieve this substantially. As to the third part of the question, the installation charges will bc considered, of course, in the Budget context when the Australian Telecommunications Commission presents its business plan to the Government. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question which can be fielded by either the Minister representing the Attorney-General or the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. By way of preface, I refer to a deputation from the Sydney Yugoslav community which I introduced to the Attorney-General several weeks ago and which expressed concern about certain rising pressures developing from the actions of a small right wing group from the Croatian section of the Yugoslav community at large, which was epitomised by certain incidents at the Olympic Park in Melbourne and at the Sydney Sports Ground. It is in that context that I ask: When can we have an indication as to the Government's determination to curb such lawlessness? I refer to the case of a man named Suljak, who is serving a non-parole period of a sentence for violence. The judge, when sentencing Suljak, indicated that he should be dispatched from Australia at the end of his sentence because he neither sought nor possesses Australian citizenship? </para>

The work of the Department in this area was completed by late February or early March. It involved consultation by the Department with practically everybody in the industry and in many cases with some of the unions. That would therefore then go into the process of Government consideration, which is where it is now. I expect the timetable of the end of March to be very close to being fulfilled. </para>

            <para>- My question follows the earlier questions concerning the manufacture in Australia of a 4-cylinder engine and also the point made in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson's</inline> question. Can the Minister for Industry and Commerce say whether the announcement yesterday by the managing director of Chrysler Australia Ltd has in fact created a new situation? He is reported to have said that if necessary Chrysler will go it alone and manufacture its own engine requirements irrespective of what General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd does. Can I take it from what the Minister has stated that this is in no way likely to impede his report to the Government? I also ask, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> asked, whether the Minister can in fact say that the decision will now be made about 3 1 March. </para>

I do not think that the Chrysler announcement has altered the scene in any way. What it has done is put some clarity into the position, as against all kinds of conjectures and rumours from other people misconstruing Chryslers' position and, indeed, trying to misconstrue the Government's position. I have said before and I say it again that the Chrysler organisation is a very worthwhile organisation and it has done a damned good job in this country. I hope to obtain from all this a situation which will be satisfactory for everybody concerned. The basic overall problem is that the motor vehicle industry in Australia has been suffering from fairly slack total growth. But that is not a problem of the motor vehicle industry alone. It is a problem of a country that has been going backwards economically. </para>

            <para>- I did notice a comment which appeared in one of the newspapers indicating that the Prices Justification Tribunal had announced that there was to be a reduction in the price of petrol in New South Wales. I am not sure how it is that the Prices Justification Tribunal announces reductions but I suppose it is an indication of the pervasive influence of one of those creations of the former Government that not only is the Tribunal concerned with price increases and their justification but also it is concerned with price reductions. I am quite sure that the people of New South Wales will welcome the price reduction which, I think, is of approximately 10c a gallon in the major city areas. I understand that the reduction is due to the fact that a petrol tax which was imposed by the New South Wales Government because of the financial restraints and stringencies imposed upon it by the previous Labor Government has now been lifted. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Eric</inline> Willis said that he had been looking forward to the time when he could lift the tax. I imagine that he lifted it because he looks forward with optimism and expectation to the continuance in office of a government which is more conscious of its responsibilities to all the people of Australia, particularly those of New South Wales, than the previous Government. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. 1 refer to the Prime Minister's electoral broadcast of 21 March in which he stated that the Government was studying a system for personal tax indexation. He went on to say that this would stop a government raising its revenue without telling the people what it was doing and so would make governments honest again. He said that if governments want to raise taxation they will have to say so. I ask: Is it not a very simple exercise to adjust a taxation schedule to offset any rate of inflation? If so, will the Government fully index personal taxation in the 1 976 Budget? If not, why not? </para>

            <para>- I direct my question to the Minister for Social Security, but it might be better directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I preface it by saying that no doubt the Minister is aware that some invalids are debarred from receiving an invalid pension due to the income of their spouse and because the invalid, who might be very badly incapacitated, does not receive the invalid pension the invalid 's spouse cannot claim a housekeeper as a taxation deduction. Will the Minister examine the taxation legislation and see whether it can be amended so that a housekeeper can be claimed as a tax deduction in cases such as I have mentioned? </para>

            <para>- I think this question would be more directly related to the Minister representing the Treasurer. It is a fact that my Department applies a means test to determine whether a person receives a pension, but the taxation deductibility of a housekeeper or spouse for that matter is a matter for the Treasurer. Perhaps my colleague, the Minister representing the Treasurer, may wish to comment. </para>

            <para>-I  would like to join forces with my attractive colleague and help the honourable senator. Yes, it is principally a Treasury matter. All these areas are matters for consideration in the context of the total expenditure and the revenue patterns that have to be considered in a Budget situation. It is not possible to pre-empt those considerations by making decisions ahead of that time, but it is possible to put the honourable senator's viewpoint and the problem that he raises to the Treasurer and to the Taxation Office for consideration at the time, and that will be done. </para>

              <para>-Senator Gietzelt says that we have learnt from the Labor Party. Wc could learn nothing from the Labor Party. Wc have been running committees like these for years, and years and years- and very successfully, too. That is why we stay in government for so long. It was from the committee of private members that the suggestion came that the chairmen of the various committees ought to meet occasionally to swap ideas and to co-ordinate their activities. The honourable senator perhaps sees something sinister in that. But I recall- I think it was under the presidency of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack- that the  chairman  of various Senate Committees used to meet occasionally on an informal basis in the President's office, again to have an exchange of information. I understand that it has been the situation for a long time that the Senate secretariat staff meet on some sort of regular basis, again for the exchange of information. Why the honourable senator should think that there is something unusual about the chairmen of the various Government Parties' committees getting together and having an exchange of views on an informal basis be wilders me. All I can suggest is that she might put the proposition to Caucus, and perhaps it will start acting like a Party instead of a rabble. </para>

            <para>- I think that this matter should be placed in proper perspective by referring to what the Attorney-General himself said and not what some newspaper report interprets him as saying or alleges he said. The Attorney-General has indicated quite clearly that he did not receive any advice from any senior officer of his Department, or from the Secretary of his Department or from the Solicitor-General suggesting that the magistrate had erred in this case; indeed, he had spoken to one of the counsel who had prosecuted the case, and that counsel had said that the magistrate had acted consistently with section 9 1 of the ordinance. In those circumstances, I find the honourable senator's persistence in trying to hound a man who has been discharged quite remarkable. It indicates, if I might say so, that what the Labor Party once valued as one of its great attributes- a degree of mateship and not dobbing another fellow in- is completely absent from this Labor Party. </para>

If the Minister has been reported correctly, does not the Government find itself in conflict with the New South Wales and Victorian Governments, both of which have expressed a desire to see a continued Federal involvement in growth centres? Does not this new attitude show that the Government's so-called federalism policy is now being developed in conflict with State interests and wishes? </para>

The fact is that the Government is considering the whole matter of decentralised development, which includes growth centres. This is not a study upon which I can give a finite answer readily. We are determined that in this area we will make an exhaustive examination of the whole matter. When that examination is finished, we will be able to make a specific statement.

            <para>- Does the Minister for Social Security accept that in the community there are many women who are bringing up children on their own and who, at the moment, arc struggling to make ends meet on the supporting mother's benefit? Does she accept that many of these women have no current qualifications which would lead to constant employment at a wage which would enable them to bring up their children in a life-style similar to that of the majority of the rest of the community? Does the Minister accept that there are many women who are not receiving supporting mother's benefit but whose domestic circumstances are such that they also need qualifications to enable them to earn a living that will cover the responsibilities, which they have taken on, of raising a family? Does she agree that, for the greater good of the community and for the good of the persons involved, it is better for people to be independent than to be receiving frugal handouts from governments? If the Minister agrees with all or part of these propositions will she endeavour to have her Government design a scheme of training which is not tied to the normal pros and cons of assets owned, pensions received or domestic arrangements, but is based on personal circumstances, so that the community at large may benefit from the greater harmony in so many homes in the community, from the greater dignity of the individual and from the expertise which would then be made available to the community? </para>

What has been suggested with regard to training programs for supporting mothers or for other women who have family responsibilities is also consistent with our attitude towards the personal development of the individual with the opportunity to take part in the mainstream of activity in our community. I shall examine the suggestion which has been made by the honourable senator. It is quite consistent with the philosophy of the Liberal Party. </para>

Despite what the Prime Minister said today in another place, do inquiries by him reveal the article is totally false? Do further inquiries reveal that the agreement was based on the catch-up provisions which were within the wage indexation guidelines, that the agreement was made to rectify a situation in which all employees in the whole motor vehicle industry, except those at GMH were receiving the increased rates, and, that the increases will have no effect within the industry or on the wage policy generally?

            <para>COMMISSION OF INQUIRY INTO TRANSPORT TO AND FROM TASMANIA </para>
            <para>SUMMARY OF PRINCIPAL FINDINGS AND THE RECOMMENDATIONS </para>
            <para>The Commission's recommendations are brought together in this Chapter. They are preceded by a summary of the principal findings on which many of the recommendations have been based. </para>
            <list type="decimal-dotted">
              <item label="2.">
                <para>1 Summary of Principal Findings </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>The Commission's Advisers, Canadian Pacific Consulting Services, commented favourably on the efficiency of the organisation and operations of the freight forwarders who arrange the door-to-door movement, and frequently the consolidation, of non-bulk goods between Tasmania and the mainland. This is a very competitive business, and mainland-based freight forwarders told the Commission that profits on their Tasmanian operations are relatively low. It was found that efficiency could be improved by reducing the variety of cargo units in use, and by speeding up the turn round of these units. </para>
            <para>Road transport in Tasmania is efficiently organised to carry the goods moving interstate. </para>
            <para>The efficiency of aspects of the administration and operation of some shipping and stevedoring services could be improved. Industrial stoppages have increased ship operating costs. It was widely accepted that Tasmanians suffer no appreciable financial disadvantage from the movement of goods in bulk by sea. The economic viability of privately owned shipping lines is being threatened by the subsidies being paid to the ANL and the TTC. The costs of operating the ANL's passenger vessel the 'Empress of Australia' and the TTC's 'Straitsman' are so high as to suggest that these vessels are inefficient for the purposes for which they are being used. The shortest practicable sea route for moving persons between Victoria and northern Tasmania was found to be Westernport-Burnie. For goods, the shortest practicable route would seem to be Westernport-Devonport. </para>
            <para>There has been some over-investment in berths and other facilities at some ports in Tasmania relative to the volume of non-bulk cargo expected to bc moving through the ports for some years to come. Some berths have a very low utilisation. This has caused wharfage rates and other port charges in Tasmania to be amongst the highest in Australia. There has been a failure to co-ordinate the new investment proposals of the Tasmanian Marine Boards. </para>
            <para>With existing vessels, and vessels on order, the most economic means of moving goods by sea between the mainland and places in northern and north-western Tasmania will be by the continued use of the ports of Bell Bay, Devonport and Burnie. The port of Hob an also has an essential role to play in the interstate movement of general cargo. </para>
            <para>The services provided by the Tasmanian Railways to carry goods moving interstate were found to be less than efficient, due to the rundown state of the track, the continuing use of obsolete equipment and a failure to rationalise freight operations. </para>
            <para>The Commission gained the impression that Tasmanian exporters who moved their goods by air pay charges that are no higher, and probably lower, than the charges for moving similar goods by air over comparable distances on the mainland. </para>
            <para>Investigation of the comparative economic cost of moving goods over various routes and by alternative transport modes between Hobart and Melbourne revealed that the direct sea movement was cheaper and more efficient than by a combined sea-road or sea-rail movement. </para>
            <para>The Commission found that the average door-to-door charge in the March quarter 1975 for the surface movement, north and south, of almost every non-bulk good between places in Tasmania and places on the mainland was higher than the charge for moving similar goods over comparable distances by road and rail on the mainland. Largely due to the freezing of ANL's charges for moving most general cargo northbound from Tasmania, the excess transport charges on imports were found to be higher than on exports. The excess transport charges for moving refrigerated cargoes from Tasmania were found to be significantly higher than the excess charges for moving most dry cargoes. </para>
            <para>Some of the reasons why the charges for moving most goods between Tasmania and the mainland are higher than the comparable mainland charges were found to bc: included in the charge for moving goods by sea are the costs of two inter modal transfers at sea terminals which do not form part of the direct road or rail line haul on the mainland; the need for more consolidation when goods were moved by sea; the greater emphasis placed on the space occupied by low density cargo moved by sea in setting sea freight rates than in determining charges for the movement of similar goods by road or rail; and costs for the sea line haul have been rising more rapidly than the costs for road and rail line haul on the mainland. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Commission found that many Tasmanian firms producing for export to the mainland were more concerned by the unreliability of the shipping services than by having to meet excess transport charges. However, it was only rarely that a Tasmanian firm said that transport charges were not a matter of concern. </para>
          <para>The main advantages of locating in Tasmania mentioned by Tasmanian exporters were: a more stable workforce; relatively cheaper hydro-electric power; cheaper land for industrial and commercial purposes; an abundant supply of fresh water; and a very fertile soil with a more assured rainfall than on the mainland. </para>
          <para class="block">Disadvantages in relation to transport from locating in Tasmania were stated to include: the inherent unreliability of the shipping services due primarily to industrial stoppages, and the threat of industrial stoppages; the time taken to transport goods to the mainland, resulting in some loss of sales and reduced profits; excess transport charges for moving goods to the mainland and on imported raw materials; more damage to goods in transit when moved by sea than when moved by road or rail; and higher inventory costs in respect of both imported materials and finished products. </para>
          <para>Firms, mainly subsidiaries of mainland producers, who had recently ceased producing in Tasmania and other firms who had been seriously considering producing in Tasmania, but had decided not to proceed, were almost unanimous in saying that the uncertainty of transport and excess transport charges were not the main reason for their decisions to withdraw or not to proceed. </para>
          <para>Average retail prices in Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie are a few per cent higher than in Melbourne and Sydney. </para>
          <para>Investigations carried out by the Commission brought to light that Tasmanian consumers and users of a wide range of items imported from the mainland, including most consumer goods, building materials and equipment, the smaller varieties of agricultural equipment, motor cars and some raw materials used in production obtained considerable relief from excess transport charges through the practice of most national manufacturers and distributors on the Mainland of equalising the prices they charge for their goods delivered to Australian capital cities. </para>
          <para>The Commission found widespread concern in Tasmania at the relatively high cost of sea and air passenger fares between Tasmania and the mainland. These fares are consistently higher than the fares for travelling over similar distances by road and rail on the mainland. 2.2 The Recommendations </para>
          <para>The Recommendations made in the Report are set out below. Reference to detailed discussion in subsequent chapters is indicated in brackets. 2.2.1 Shipping </para>
          <para>That ANL be asked to carry out as expeditiously as possible a study of- the cost of moving general cargo between a port in Westernport Bay and a wharf in Devonport in a Pure Retro vessel that completes the round trip in 24 hours as compared with the cost of moving the same cargo between </para>
          <para>Webb Dock and Devonport in a Searoader or the Melbourne Trader. </para>
          <para>That, if the study reveals that a Pure Retro service between Westernport Bay and Devonport should be more efficient and cheaper, the Ministry of Transport be asked to carry out a study of relative cost of door-to-door movement of goods between places in Victoria and places in Northern Tasmania over this route on its own wheels as compared with cargo boxes or on flats in Retro vessels from Webb Dock. </para>
          <para>That, if the foregoing studies show that it would be more efficient and cheaper to move cargo by Pure Retro from Westernport than Retro from Webb Dock, consideration be given to the design, speed and capacity of a Pure Retro vessel suited to trans-Bass operations. (Chapter 6, Section 6.10.1) </para>
          <para>That, if a fast cargo Pure Retro service is introduced between Melbourne and Northern Tasmania, the Tasmanian terminal be located at Devonport. (Chapter 7, Section 7.9.4. ) </para>
          <para>That an in-depth investigation be carried out into all aspects of the provision of a rail ferry service for the carriage of goods and livestock on Tasmanian rail wagons between Westernport Bay and Devonport. (Chapter 6, Section 6.10.3) </para>
          <para>That, if it is decided to introduce a rail ferry service between Westernport Bay and Northern Tasmania, the Tasmanian terminal be located at Devonport. (Chapter 7. Section 7.9.4.) </para>
          <para>That the future sea passenger service between Tasmania and the mainland be provided by two vessels operating between Westernport Bay and Burnie. Features of the service would be: return crossing in 24 hours; daylight passenger service; and express cargo service by night. (Chapter 6, Section 6.10.4) </para>
          <para>That, if a fast daylight passenger service and return cargo service by night is to be introduced between Westernport Bay and Burnie, consideration be given as to whether the Ocean Wharf at Burnie be upgraded. (Chapter 7, Section 7.9.4) </para>
          <para>That ANL be permitted to undertake the booking of cargo carried in its vessels in the coastal shipping services, and he encouraged to do so. (Chapter 6, Section 6. 1 1 . 2 ) </para>
          <para>That all replacement pallets for use in the Tasmanian trades be constructed on the 1100mm x 1100mm basis. (Chapter 4, Section 4.4) </para>
          <para>That a meeting be convened of all interested parties to consider the practicability of establishing a pool of cargo units of standard size, and its contribution to improved efficiency. (Chapter 4, Section 4.7) 2.2.2 Ports </para>
          <para>That the Tasmanian Government be requested to consider setting up a central port authority to co-ordinate future port development. (Chapter 7, Section 7. 10.3 ) </para>
          <para>That the Tasmanian Government be requested to- consider, in regard to the port of Stanley: that the Marine Boards of Burnie and Circular Head he amalgamated; and that the port of Stanley be closed to Retro vessels. (Chapter 7, Section 7.11) 2.2.3 Government Owned Services </para>
          <para>That operators of Government owned services be required as quickly as practicable to charge economic freight rates. (Chapter 11, Section 11.4) </para>
          <para>That the level of charges for the rail movement in Tasmania of all goods moving interstate be increased to, at least, double its present level; or as an alternative </para>
          <para>That interstate goods moved by rail between places south of parallel of latitude 42 degrees south, and Northern Tasmanian ports be made ineligible for the direct transport assistance propose in Chapter 15. (Chapter 8, Section 8.7.3) </para>
          <para>That, until such time as a mere efficient sea/passenger service is introduced for the Bass Strait crossing, the Commonwealth Government increase its subsidy to $2 million per annum on condition that: the Empress of Australia makes three return trips per week; and </para>
          <para>A.N.L. increase fares and charges to rates, which when account is taken of the subsidy, are economic. (Chapter 16, Section 16.12) 2.2.4 Transport Assistance Schemes </para>
          <para>That the Commonwealth Government offer direct financial assistance to Tasmanian consignors of most goods bought for use or exported for sale on the mainland. The assistance would be confined to merchandise moving interstate from Tasmania by sea in Retro or conventional vessels or by air (i.e. it would not apply to the interstate movement of goods in bulk ships). </para>
          <para>That the date of effect of the new scheme be in mid- 1976. (Chapter 15, Section 15.8) </para>
          <para>That the level of rates be reviewed either annually or biennially, possibly by the Interstate Commission. (Chapter 15, Section 15.14) </para>
          <para>That the Commonwealth Government consider whether an offer of direct assistance should be made to Tasmanian consignors who ship their goods from Stanley to Melbourne if both the port of Stanley and the existing shipping service continue to be subsidised by the Tasmanian Government. (Chapter 7, Section 7. 1 1 ) </para>
          <para class="block">That the Commonwealth Government offer assistance: in the case of air travel between Melbourne and Flinders Island- of the order of $10 on the single fare for an adult; in the case of air travel between Melbourne and King Island- of the order of $7.50 on the single fare for an adult, on condition that air fares to and from the Islands charged by licensed operators be approved by the Commonwealth Government. (Chapter 17, Section 17.6.2) </para>
          <para>That investigations be pursued forthwith, with a view to offering financial assistance to producers who use imported materials and equipment which are not price equalised by mainland distributors. (Chapter 15, Section 15.8) </para>

              <para>-Probably no report has been awaited with greater expectation in Tasmania than the report which has just been tabled by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> This is not the appropriate time to enter into a lengthy debate on it, primarily because we have not had time to study the full report. In fact the documents which have been tabled and which were made available to honourable senators, I understand, some time before the Senate met this morning are a very brief precis of the report, and much of what is contained in them is difficult to assess because of its brevity. But I wish to say on behalf of the Opposition that, on a very brief look at what wc have, there appear to be some aspects which give rise for concern immediately. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Commission of Inquiry into Transport to and from Tasmania was appointed by the previous Government. It is one of many which have been appointed over the years to inquire into this seemingly never ending problem of Tasmania's transport disabilities. Once again we appear to have- I stress that we appear to have- a report which is somewhat loose, as I read it. A comprehensive approach, which I hoped the Commission would take, has not been taken. We find recommendations made in isolation from other factors. I suppose that one should not be more critical than that until such time as one has had an opportunity to study it in greater depth. One thing is fairly apparent immediately. On the first page of the ministerial statement we find the following: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Government owned and operated services should raise their charges as quickly as possible to an economic level. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That immediately suggests that the Australian National Line will be required to conduct its services on a commercially economic basis. As I read it at this stage, that recommendation without qualification means that Tasmania can look forward to quite a dramatic increase in freight charges in the foreseeable future. I also assume that it implies at least that the present subsidy, which was instituted by the Australian Labor Party Government, on north bound traffic from Tasmania is to be removed progessively. If that is the case and if the Government is going to act on that assumption, obviously Tasmania will gain very little from the findings of the Commission. </para>
          <para>Let me say only one other thing as it is not proper to debate this matter at length. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and the Government to bring this matter on for debate as quickly as possible if possible, next week. It is a matter of very great concern to a State which suffers a very great disability. It is only fair that this matter bc allowed to be debated at length as soon as possible. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has pointed out to me, it could be debated in general business next week. I think that, in view of its importance to one of the States of Australia, the Government might consider a particular period outside of general business when this matter could be debated properly. I ask leave to continue my remarks. </para>

I have caused investigations to be made about this matter and have discovered that this release was distributed by the Government Publications and Inquiries Centre in Brisbane. I am informed that this action resulted from a sequence of errors by officers in the central office of the Publications and Inquiries Centre in Canberra and the Publications and Inquiries Centre in Brisbane. It came about through a collection of Press releases, including releases of the Liberal Party secretariat, being sent by error by the </para>

Acting on her own initiative, an officer of the Brisbane centre copied these releases and distributed them to Commonwealth parliamentary offices in Brisbane, including that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston.</inline> The action was completely outside the system of distribution established for the ministerial documents service which does not and should not include a release such as that of the Liberal Party secretariat in its distribution service. The investigation by the Department shows that the errors were honest in intent and in the case of the officer in Brisbane were the result of an excess of enthusiasm to implement the distribution process for parliamentary offices. I have taken the necessary action to ensure even stricter control of the operation of the ministerial document service through the Publications and Inquiries Centre. I hope such a mistake does not occur again. </para>

              <para>- This report is the result of an inquiry into the needs of manpower in the welfare field. It was prepared by a working party headed by the Professor of Social Work at the University of Queensland, Professor Edna Chamberlain. The working party also comprised representatives of State and Federal government departments, voluntary welfare agencies and professional and educational bodies. The working party was established by the Commission in November 1973 and the report now being presented incorporates its findings together with the comments of the Social Welfare Commission on issues in social welfare manpower planning. </para>

            <para>-I am rather disturbed at the problem that has been presented to the Senate by these notices of motion and references to standing or general purpose committees of the Senate. In 1970 I made what I thought was a substantial speech, in terms of length and substance anyway, on the whole question of committees. One of the matters to which I addressed myself with, I thought, great clarity and cogency was the Senate referring to these committees matters which tended to be open-ended, which were not precise in their terms and which would lead to the Senate committees finding themselves involved in matters that would get out of control. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Everett,</inline> who lost his seat at the last election, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> would agree with me that one committee was totally incompetent to manage the reference that was given to it. Therefore, I beg the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> to see that terms of references are precise and are within the capacity and ambit of committees to examine. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>The second matter is even more important than that. I notice that there is no time stated by which the committee should report back to the Senate. These committees are the children of the Senate and the Senate should never allow them to escape without some sort of control over them. The most effective control is to put a time limit on the work of the committee so that it is under a discipline imposed by the parent, the Senate. It is open to the committee to come back and ask for an extension of time. This has always been granted in the past. I suggest that in future references to these committees should have a time limit placed on them. </para><para>I add a further matter which, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,I</inline> hope you will take into consideration in your office as  President.  In 1970 I made the forecast that eventually the Standing Orders Committee of the Senate would have to turn its attention to the question of Senate committees. I suggest that the time has now arrived when the  President  of the Senate, in his normal role as  Chairman  of the Standing Orders Committee, might consider in discussion with the Leader of the Government in the Senate and the Leader of the Opposition, who sit on that Committee anyway, that the Standing Orders Committee review the whole question of the Standing Orders as they relate to committees of the Senate. </para></speech>

          <para>The primary purpose of this Bill is to include an allowance for the labour of owner-operators of wheat farms in the specified cost items used to determine annual movements in the home consumption price of wheat under the current sixth Wheat Industry Stabilization Plan. Honourable senators will recall that this legislation reached the second reading stage in the other chamber last November but lapsed when Parliament was dissolved. An owner-operator allowance has been included in home consumption price adjustment procedures in previous wheat stabilisation plans although the basis of calculating this allowance and the method of inclusion has varied. In the first four plans it was adjusted annually along with all items in the index to determine movements in the home consumption price. In the fifth plan it was one of a collection of items which were held constant in the index for the duration of the plan. </para>
          <para>One of the changes at the commencement of the sixth plan was the exclusion of those cost items which had been held constant during the previous plan from the index structure used to calculate movements in the home consumption price. The owner-operator allowance was one of those items. However, at the same time the then Government gave an undertaking that the decision with respect to that allowance would be reviewed prior to the second year of the plan. 1975-76. As a result of this review it was decided to include in the cost items used to adjust the home consumption price of wheat an item representing the cost of the owner-operator labour input into the wheat enterprise. The decision gained the acceptance of the Australian Wheatgrowers Federation and was endorsed by all State governments as parties to the complementary legislative arrangements supporting the orderly marketing and stabilisation scheme for wheat. Information collected by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in its wheat industry survey will be used to ascertain the owner operator physical labour input into the wheat enterprise. This will then be costed using appropriate rural wage awards and the annual movements in this item included with the movements in cash costs and rail freight and handling charges that are taken into account in the annual review of the home consumption price of wheat. </para>
          <para>The Bill before the Senate is virtually identical with that previously introduced except in one respect. If the original legislative proposals had been passed in the normal course the determination which has since been made of the home consumption price of wheat for the year commencing 1 December would have included an amount of 62 cents per tonne- being the amount calculated by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics and accepted by the Wheat Index Committee as the labour allowance for owner-operators of wheat farm enterprises. Since it is impracticable to provide for retroactive application of such allowance in the purchase price of wheat it is now proposed under the provisions of clause 4 of the Bill that the home consumption price will be increased by 62 cents per tonne effective from the day following the date of receipt of the royal assent. </para>
          <para>Concurrent with the introduction of amending legislation for the purpose described above, opportunity is being taken by the accompanying Wheat Export Charge Amendment Bill to effect a machinery amendment to the definition of wheat products' at present in section 4 of the Wheat Industry Stabilization Act. The opinion of the First Parliamentary Counsel is that this definition should reside in the Wheat Export Charge Act. Clause 3 of the Bill effects this transfer. I commend the Bill. </para>

          <para>The purpose of the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill is to authorise the Treasurer ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch)</inline> to advance to the States this financial year the sum of $364.6 million for welfare housing in accordance with the provisions of the 1973-1974 Housing Agreement. This amount will be distributed among the States as follows: </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="067232197603255_18_0.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">The level of advances for 1975-76 is as determined by the previous Government and this amount has been provided in the 1975-76 Budget. We are maintaining this level of spending for welfare housing despite our overall policy of stringent restraint on public sector spending. Advances for 1975-76 will be somewhat less in real terms than the record level set in 1974-75-$385.4m-but still high compared with earlier years. </para>
          <para>Some States are currently experiencing difficulties in maintaining their welfare housing programs- difficulties I might add that are a direct legacy of the previous Government. Let me explain this. Funds available to the States for welfare housing increased from $ 169.8m in 1972-73 to $2 18.7m in 1973-74. The funds made available for welfare housing escalated even further in 1974-75. When the initial allocation of $235m was made, the States were informed that further funds would be provided if they could demonstrate that they had the capacity to spend more. This encouraged the States to accelerate their programs and the advances actually made in 1974-75 rose sharply to $385.4m, an increase of about 60 per cent over the original allocation. Then, in the 1975-76 Budget, the inevitable happened. The enormous expansion in advances to the States was brought to an abrupt halt and total advances in 1975-76 were held at about their 1974-75 level. </para>
          <para>Because of the earlier rapid expansion of their programs, most States have had to curtail commencements sharply in 1975-76 to permit the completion of houses already under construction. As a result, the level of government building activity has declined. Nevertheless, Housing Agreement commencements which constitute the bulk of State government housing activity will probably exceed 7000 in 1975-76. Although this figure is significantly less than the 1 1 463 Housing Agreement commencements in 1974- 75, completions in 1975-76 are expected to reach a record level of 13 800. Overall, therefore, the public housing programs in the States in 1 975- 76 will still be substantial. </para>
          <para>Meanwhile, signs of recovery in the private sector emerged around the middle of 1975 and a continued high level of activity in most States can be expected. Loan approvals for housing, local government approvals and commencements have all been expanding strongly since mid-1975 and point to further expansion in private commencements during the coming year. In the December quarter, dwelling approvals were running at the rate, seasonally adjusted, of 1 37 800 private and 7900 government, totalling 145 700, compared with 90 800 private and 20 900 government, a total of 1 1 1 700 in the December quarter of 1974. Commencements for the 1975 December quarter were running at the annual rate, seasonally adjusted, of 125 400 private and 132 400 total. Comparable figures for the same quarter in 1 974 were 96 300 private and 1 1 3 900 total commencements. The expected continued high level of activity in the private sector should go some of the way towards taking up the slack emerging in the government sector. </para>
          <para>The Bill also authorises the Treasurer to pay to the States in the first 6 months of 1976-77 the sum of $ 182.3m which is half the allocation for 1975-76. This amount will be distributed on the same basis as the advances for the current year. In other words, the Treasurer will be authorised to continue payments to the States for welfare housing in the period from 1 July 1976, until an appropriation measure for 1976-77 is passed by the Parliament. As well, the Bill recognises that, in exceptional circumstances as occurred this year when passage of the authorising legislation was delayed, it may be necessary to continue payments beyond the 6-month period for which specific financial provision is made. The Bill provides that interim payments made for welfare housing under the authority of section 5 of the Financial Agreement Act 1928 as advances supplementary to the advances under the approved Loan Council program will be deemed to be made under that Act. </para>
          <para>The advances to be authorised by the States Grants (Housing Assistance) Bill are repayable over a period of 53 years. The rate of interest payable on advances during the full 5-year term of the Agreement is fixed at 4 per cent per annum in respect of advances allocated to the State housing authorities and 4½ per cent per annum in respect of advances allocated to the home builders' accounts of the States. The apportionment of the allocations between the State housing authority and the home builders' account for each State was determined by consultation between the Minister for Housing and Construction in the previous Government and the Housing Minister of the State concerned. The repayable interest-bearing advances will, as circumstances dictate, be made either from the Consolidated Revenue Fund or the Loan Fund and will be on the terms and conditions set out in the 1 973- 1 974 Housing Agreement. Provision is made for any payments out of the Consolidated Revenue Fund for this purpose to be reimbursed in due course from the Loan Fund, when the Treasurer considers this appropriate. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill provides for the payment of grants to the States for universities in 1976. The Bill is associated with the States Grants (Universities) Amendment Bill 1976, the States Grants (Advanced Education) Bill 1976, the States Grants (Advanced Education) Amendment Bill 1976 and the States Grants (Technical and Further Education) Amendment Bill 1976, all of which I intend to introduce presently. Rather than take up the time of the Senate unnecessarily I propose to speak on the common aspects of all 5 Bills in this statement. </para>
          <para>The previous Government decided that the year 1976 should be treated outside the normal triennial progression and asked the 4 education Commissions to recommend separate programs of funding for 1976 within certain guidelines. This Bill and the related ones represent the implementation of the announced decision of the Government in its caretaker capacity in November last that the programs for 1976 approved by the previous Government for universities, colleges of advanced education and technical and further education should proceed on the basis announced by the previous Government. This undertaking assured the States and the educational institutions concerned of the level of financial support they could expect in 1976 even though the prorogation of the Parliament in November 1975 made it impossible until now to enact legislation appropriating funds for the 1 976 programs. I shall be introducing later in this session a Bill to provide for the announced 1976 program for schools which the Government also undertook to implement. To enable the programs under this Bill and the associated ones to proceed, with effect from the commencement of 1976, the caretaker Government made special interim financial arrangements with the States pending the passing of these Bills early in 1 976. The Bills in respect of universities and colleges of advanced education provide for reimbursement of the States where they have made payments under the special interim financial arrangements. This provision was not necessary in the case of technical and further education where existing legislation provides financial assistance to the States until 30 June 1976. </para>
          <para>One change from the usual form of legislation of this kind is that the funds provided under this and the associated Bills generally are appropriated from the Consolidated Revenue Fund but in the case of grants for building programs and equipment purchases, provision has been made for the alternative use of the Loan Fund. The grants approved for these programs by the previous Government were expressed in June 1975 price levels and were on the basis that further grants would be provided to make allowance for subsequent movements in costs. Returning to the States Grants (Universities) Bill 1976, a total or $498m is available to the States for university purposes in respect of the year 1976, of .which $447m is for recurrent costs and equipment purchases and $51m for building programs. These amounts make allowance for known movements in costs since June 1975. Further adjustments for cost movements to the end of the year 1976 will be required. I commend this Bill to the Senate. </para>

Further adjustments for cost movements to the end of this triennial period will be required as statistical data becomes available. The Bill also gives effect to a decision of the previous Government not to proceed with projects for which contractual commitments had not been made, by deleting certain building projects and reducing the grants available to others. The Bill compensates the State of Queensland for fire damage to teaching hospital facilities of the University of Queensland at the Royal Brisbane Hospital.

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to provide for programs of financial assistance to the States for the funding of advanced education in respect of the year 1976. The Bill provides for grants totalling $296m for expenditure under the recurrent program and $5 6m for expenditure under the capital program. The recurrent program includes an allowance to cover cost increases since the June quarter 1975. In addition the Bill provides for recurrent grants on a formula basis to assist in meeting the administrative costs of student residences and affiliated residential colleges of advanced education. The estimated expenditure on these grants in respect of 1976 is $lm. Both the recurrent and capital programs will continue to be supplemented until the end of 1976 in accordance with the established procedures to maintain their values against cost increases. In summary the total program for 1976 amounts to $353m. In the intervening period since the 1976 program was approved by the previous Government, a committee on post-secondary education in Western Australia, headed by Professor P. H. Paltridge, has made a report to the State Government recommending that the School of Mines at Kalgoorlie should not continue at the tertiary level and that consequently the Kalgoorlie capital projects listed in Schedule 2 to this Bill under the heading of the Western Australian Institute of Technology ought not to proceed. We will therefore review the future of the projects following consideration by the State Government of the report of this committee. </para>
          <para>I refer honourable senators to my second reading speech on the States Grants (Universities) Bill 1976. My remarks there on the background to the funding arrangements for tertiary and technical and further education in 1976 apply to this Bill as do my remarks there on interim financial arrangements.

          <para>The purpose of the Bill is to amend the States Grants (Technical and Further Education) Act 1974 so as to extend its period of operation from the present termination date of 30 June 1976, to 31 December 1976, and to provide additional funds to the States for the extended period. There have been some adjustments made to the grants to 30 June 1976 under existing legislation, involving an increase of $1.9m for recurrent expenditure and the deferment of $8.3m for capital expenditure. For the period 1 July 1 976 to 31 December 1976, $ 12.5m is available for recurrent expenditure and $ 17m is available for capital expenditure. The net effect of these measures is to vary the total funds available to the States from $ 107.8m over 2 years to $ 131m over <inline font-style="italic">2Vt</inline> years. I incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a table summarising the various grants which are payable over the 2!6-year period to the end of 1976, as set out in the Schedules to the Bill and, in relation to unallocated grants, in the principal Act: </para>

I table a copy of the rules breached by the photographer. Accuracy and standards of reporting are not dealt with in those particular rules.

            </talker>
            <para>-When this debate was interrupted last night I was discussing the confrontation which exists between the Third World and the First World and the change which has taken place in that confrontation over the last 6 months. I was discussing the nature of the confrontation, its origins and its development. I pointed out to honourable senators the cruel clowning of Id i Amin, the  President  of Uganda, at the United Nations 6 months ago. I drew attention to the repeated insults which he made to Great Britain and Israel, to such an extent that the ambassadors of those countries left the General Assembly. I mention that there was a difference this time because after that speech a spokesman for the West, for the first time, spoke out in defence of the achievements of the West. I pointed out to honourable senators that the United Nations consists of 142 members of which only 24 are democracies. I mentioned that the rest are either totalitarian states- communist or socialist- or ancient or modern despotisms. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I said that I thought it was no accident that Id i Amin is the leader of the Organisation of African Unity, because that Organisation represents by far the greatest proportion of the less developed countries. I pointed out that the First World consists of the industrialised and developed West: the Second World represents the Soviet bloc; and the Third World represents the newly emerging, under and less developed countries. 1 stated that China, for ideological more than economic reasons, sought to lead the Third World. I went through portion of the history of events in the United Nations since 1960 when the problems of these less developed countries were realised. In 1960 the United Nations started its first decade of development with the object of raising the gross national product of these unfortunate nations to 5 per cent a year. But this scheme did not get off the ground. So in 1970 a second decade of development was started. But even by 1975 the best rate these countries could achieve was still less than 3 per cent. In the meantime the populations of these countries had rocketed and inflation and runaway oil prices had compounded the problem. </para>
          <para>I pointed out that all these programs had failed, as had similar programs in both Russia and China- indicating the futility of legislation in trying to fix these problems and showing the dangers of government interference with the economy. There are 4 billion people on the earth. Of that number, 2 billion subsist on an annual income of less than $200. Of that 2 billion, hundreds of millions are incomparably worse off. There are 900 million people who live on an annual income of less than $75. They live in an atmosphere of squalor, hunger and hopelessness. They are the absolute poor. They live in conditions which are below any rational standard of human decency. Their plight is manifest. The fact that their leaders should come together to try to improve their lot is understandable. But, the way they have chosen, confrontation with the First World has proceeded over the years from irrationality at the beginning to what is now tragic farce. </para>
          <para>I gave honourable senators some recent examples of the macabre burlesque which is going on. In 1972 the United Nations Conference on the Human Environment was called in Stockholm. The United States and its co-sponsors expected that they had found a field for fertile cooperation; but immediately, the conference was turned into a bitter political conflict. The Brazilians considered that it was a conspiracy between the haves and the have-nots. They said that the rich had got rich by polluting their environment and that those countries were trying to stop the poorer nations from getting rich by polluting their environments. They said that the conference was nothing but a plot to perpetuate the monopoly of the rich nations over the poor nations. The Brazilians said that the First World did not want to help the Third World but merely wished to exploit it. I mentioned Prime Minister Indira Gandhi, who was shortly to turn her nation into a naked despotism. She asked: 'Are not poverty and need the greatest polluters?' She said that the problems of ecology were distracting India from the problems of war and poverty. At the conference even apartheid was brought in, which elevated the discussion from garbage removal and the problems of the disposal of in disposable industrial waste to the rarified level of political ethics. </para>
          <para>The conference declared as its first principle that man had the fundamental right to freedom, equality and adequate conditions of life in an environment of quality, permitting a life of dignity and wellbeing with a solemn responsibility to protect and improve the environment for present and future generations. The declaration went on to state: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In this respect policies promoting or perpetuating apartheid, racial segregation, discrimination, colonial and other forms of oppression and foreign domination stand condemned and must be eliminated. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In 1974 the United Nations called another conference the World Population Conference in </para>
          <para class="block">Bucharest. This was because of the rocketing populations of these less developed countries. China, with its 800 million people, had tried to limit its population. It was unsuccessful, but nevertheless it tried. But India was having far more problems because although its population was only 550 million- if one can use the word only' in relation to a figure like that- its area is one-third the area of China. The conference was regarded as a substantial advance. Guidelines were established beforehand, and a plan of action was drafted. The idea was to reduce the birthrates in these countries from 34 per 1000 of population to 30 per 1000 of population by the year 1985. This all seemed reasonable enough and moderate enough- but not for the less developed countries and the communists. </para>
          <para>President Ceausescu of Romania, who opened that conference, declared that the division of the world into developed and under-developed nations is a result of historical evolution and is a direct consequence of capitalist, imperialist and neo-colonialism policies of exploitation of many people. He called for a new economic order and rejected a pessimistic outlook on population growth. The Indian representative denounced the colonial denudation of the East and the vulgar affluence of the West. The Chinese saw population control as fundamentally subversive to the Third World and said that the bright future of the Third World could be spoilt only by the imperialists- that is the West- and the hegemonists, the Soviets. They declared that population control was their wrecking device. The upshot of this conference was a demand that economic development in the West cease and that the wealth of the world be redistributed. Through all this, and over the years, the Third World had the support of the West's massive guilt complex. After Bucharest, a United Nations publication called the <inline font-style="italic">Development Forum</inline> was put out. In a section of that publication entitled Eating Little Children', it was maintained that we in the West, by our huge consumption of meat, were depriving the children of the poorer countries of the cereals that would save them from dying of malnutrition. It said that we were cannibals, albeit indirectly. </para>
          <para>When the World Food Conference was called in 1973 the Indian spokesman declared that the developed nations could be held responsible for the plight of the less developed countries and, therefore, the developed countries had a duty to help them. This help was not to be regarded as charity but as deferred compensation. In 1974 the United Nations approved a charter of the economic rights and duties of states. It provided for 5 things: First, the right to nationalise foreign property; second, the payment of compensation according to national law and not international law; third, the formation of producer cartels, similar to the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries cartel; fourth, the faster distribution of wealth from the rich nations to the poor nations; and, fifth, the faster distribution of technology from the rich to the poor nations. Peking, at this time, was saying that the new majority had written a brilliant chapter and it was sweeping ahead under full sail while the ship of imperialism and hegemonism foundered. As I was saying, the West has started to hit back, speaking of the tyranny of this new majority and the need to challenge the coalition between the communists and the Third World. </para>
          <para>I think there is some profit to be gained in looking at the motivation of the Third World and its conduct. It appears that in recent times- by recent times' I mean, say, since about the time of the discovery of Australia- there have been 3 huge revolutionary movements in the world. The first was connected with the French and American revolutions which sought to throw off autocratic and aristocratic government and to replace it with what might be called minimal government. There was the realisation that countries were better off if the government interfered less in the business of the people. There was created what might be called a minimal state. In this century there has been another huge revolutionary movement- the Russian and Chinese revolutions. They, too, were designed to throw off autocratic and aristocratic rule. But in this revolution total state government was imposed. During this century another revolution has been going on unnoticed. It has been going on more or less offstage. It is what I call the British revolution. The British revolution started just before the turn of the century with the formation of the Fabian Society in London. A group of young intellectuals got together. It consisted of Graham Wall as, Beatrice and Sidney Webb, George Bernard Shaw and other intellectuals. They propounded the philosophy that private ownership should be superseded by public ownership, that production for profit should be replaced by production for use, that competition should be replaced by co-operation, that individual benefit should be replaced by common benefit, and that industry should be subject to collective and democratic control. Generally, the socialist characterised himself or herself by his or her commitment to fellowship. If we look at all these revolution in historical perspective, we can see the Hegelian dialectic in operation: The first revolution bringing about the minimal state, the second revolution bringing about the total state and in the synthesis between the two one can see the welfare state of Great Britain coming about. </para>
          <para>But there are 2 important points in the British doctrine. The first one is its bias against economic development. The fundamental assertion of the British doctrine was that there was plenty of wealth to go around if only it was fairly distributed. Redistribution and not production was central to its theme and profit became synonymous with exploitation. The second point was that British socialism was more anti American than it was anti-Soviet because America was the quintessence of capitalism. The British thought they were making a revolution just for Britain. So they were and the Tories half agreed with them. But they were making much more. During the first half of this century the influence of Britain abroad was much greater than that of any other country. The new political philosophy was carried to Europe and socialist parties sprang up in one country after another. More importantly than that, it was carried to Britain's colonies. At this time, the British empire covered a quarter of the earth's surface and it was spread to the farthest corners of the earth. Countless numbers of people came from the colonies to Britain to attain a higher education, and there they came into contact with this Fabian socialism, particularly if they had any contact with the London School of Economics. The pattern of thinking of the elite who were to gain control in these dependencies was prescribed in this way. </para>
          <para>The worldwide British revolution really got under way in 1947 when the socialist British Government gave independence to the socialist Indian Government. The approach has been continued subsequently under successful Conservative governments. The colonies one after the other were emancipated by socialist-inspired means and with socialist-inspired constitutions, until in 1974, 47 of the 87 states which had joined the United Nations since its foundation were previously British colonies. The non-British colonies were also influenced by this Fabianism. The situation now is that these less developed countries numerically dominate all world forums that are characterised by universal membership. The Third World has been very quick to convert the precepts of Fabian socialism to its own purposes. For example, the idea of independence from autocratic and aristocratic rule has been changed to a demand for independence from colonial masters. The opposition to class discrimination has been changed to an opposition to racial discrimination. The idea of workers being exploited by the capitalists has been changed to exploitation of the colonies by the capitalist nations. </para>
          <para>The Third World now claims a right to share in the wealth of others. British socialism on its own was prepared to forget the past and to go on, but not the Third World and the communists. The Third World demands revenge, reparations and something akin to looting. It is now easy to see why America, representing capitalism, and South Africa, representing discrimination, are the targets of the Third World. It is easy to explain the loudmouthed self- righteousness of the less developed countries and the guilt complex of the West leading to its pandering and kowtowing to these nations which have led to the monstrous burlesque. I spoke about it before. Let us take a look at what justification there is for this guilt complex in the West. One has only to look around these newly emerging nations to see that the benefits which the colonising nations received were well matched by the benefits they bestowed on their colonies. Certainly they could have done more, but without the coming of the white man there would have been no development at all. One should look at the nations that have been colonised and those that have not. It is the nations which have not been colonised that are poorer, such as Libya, Liberia and Ethiopa. Those nations are poor. The ones that have been colonised are much better off. It was the Liberian Ambassador to the United Nations who likened the situation in his nation to that of a man who had to build his own house from the ground up compared with a man who was left a large inheritance. Many of these nations are grateful. </para>
          <para>Socially, they were given health benefits and education benefits which they would otherwise not have had. Politically, they were given the idea of modern administrations, an independent judiciary and democratic government. But they have all chosen not to follow those ideas and they have returned to despotism. It is true that, if the white man had not come, there would be no population problem in the lesser developed countries. The high death rate at binh, short life, plagues, pestilence, floods, disease and internecine wars would have kept the population stable as they did for countless centuries. </para>
          <para>The joint Third World-communist coalition is immoral when it is judged by the conditions which exist within its own ranks. For example, in the Third World nations there are some with thrusting economies such as Singapore and Brazil. There are others like the Arab States, rich from oil, where the per capita income is $5,000 a year compared with India just over the water, with a population 100 times as great and a per capita income of less .than $200 a year. There is a gross imbalance of wealth within the less developed countries .themselves. Most of the wealth is fructifying in the pockets of cliques which by hook or by crook have assumed control. </para>
          <para>The communists pretend to be the champions of the Third World and they lead the attack on the Western world, yet the West gives over $ 1 2 billion in aid to the Third World, the communists give $1.4 billion and the Arabs, who pretend to be friends of the Third World, put up the price of oil, adding $10 billion to the burden which the Third World has to carry, virtually wiping out all our foreign aid. There is no good cause for the West 's guilt complex. </para>
          <para>I think that we should take a more realistic and objective view of our relationship with the less developed countries. This does not involve quality judgments. I think that we would all be prepared to concede that those countries may have some cultural aspects which are superior to our own, but in technology the West is incomparably superior, and the whole issue turns on technology the ability to turn resources into wealth. The West has done this by its own ingenuity and effort. This is not a cause for shame. On this key issue the West holds all the trumps and it should play its hand accordingly, with strength. A cringing posture, as though it is an offence to bc ingenious, progressive and prosperous, invites a crooked deal. We should stand up for our own rights and achievements. We should throw off this habit of appeasement. We will gain the respect of other nations when we have regained our own. </para>
          <para>There are 5 incontrovertible facts that everyone should know. the first is that there is no limitless source of wealth waiting for redistribution. Prosperity depends on production. Second, socialism has failed as a producer of wealth, and it stands out there in the world as an abject failure for all to see. How can it work in the less developed countries? Look at what it has done to Great Britain. Since Great Britain espoused this nonsense its share of the world cake has been halved. Third, economic growth does not depend on Western conspiracies but on its own laws, and that it is not an egalitarian process. Fourth, the lesser developed countries are operating on imported ideas. They cannot progress until these are replaced by their own indigenous ideas. Last. development rests not on aid but self exertion on ingenuity, organisations, conservation and above all, work. </para>
          <para>We should not confuse our idea of liberty with that of other people. Liberty is a subjective commodity. Our espousal of it has led to pockets of permissiveness, licence, anarchy, obscenity and degradation. Other people's ideas of liberty may be a lot more healthy for them than ours. Our ideas of liberty are no more indigenous to Zaire, say, than are the Fabian socialist's ideas of socialism. Therefore if we are to solve the problem we must forget all about ideological solutions. We should all live according to our own lights and co-operate as separate political communities on the basis of objective and demonstrable common interests. </para>
          <para>At the centre of all this lies the United Nations. It is an example of the prime illusion that others are able to operate effectively in institutions which do not correspond in origin, nature, tradition or design to their own. The United Nations was designed on Western concepts of liberty and decision-making, especially decision by majority vote. It is the ultimate paradox that the less developed countries reject and denigrate the system of one man one vote in their own countries but they demand and exploit the right of one state one vote in the General Assembly because they do not understand democracy's ground rules. They demand and exploit that vote despite the disparity in their powers, their resources, their experience, their responsibilities and their contributions. </para>
          <para>The world is not a democratic world. It is not a world of Western civil liberties. Attempts to make it so have proved a disastrous failure. These illusions, embodied in the United Nations, have shaped and precipitated the present absurd world situation. There is no possibility of organising international affairs by a majority vote in a global organisation. Inter-state relations must relate to real considerations- a regional grouping of states- based on common resources, common problems, common technology and common economic advantage. Whatever the political costume of the players, here is the theatre for co-operation, consultation and collaboration. It is the basic building block for a workable world where interest cuts across ideology. Global conferences, resolutions and declarations will not bring world order. Regional states will compact, consolidate and grow in their mutual self interest. If we can gain our self-respect vis-a-vis the rest of the world and foster this new development, then we shall see a new world order. I think that if that happens the </para>
          <para class="block">United Nations will be outflanked, isolated and redundant. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- Before I take the opportunity presented to me in this debate to address the Senate on some problems in the Australian Capital Territory resulting from the present Government's policies and non-policies, I take the liberty to address myself to some of the remarks which have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil.</inline> I was very interested to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil's</inline> amazingly esoteric view of the history of the last century. I do not intend to address myself to all the assertions he made. However, he devoted some time to talking about the United Nations conference on population control held in Romania in 1974. He seems to suggest, among other things, that population control in the Third World had failed because of the influence of Fabian socialism. Last year as a delegate to the United Nations conference for International Women's Year I was very privileged and interested to meet many of the women who had attended the population control conference in Romania as delegates for their countries in 1974. There was quite a deal of discussion, informally as well as formally, of the failure of population control in some Third World countries. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would like to add to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> some of the reasons given for the failure of these programs in Third World countries, reasons which really had nothing at all to do with the ubiquitous influence of Fabian socialism. The women of the Third World became very angry at the kinds of population control programs that were being inflicted on their sisters because those programs were based on Western values and Western technologies and completely ignored the spiritual and cultural values of the women who were supposed to fit into those programs. It was from many tragic experiences where women involuntarily were subjected by visiting specialists to forms of birth control that were totally alien to their values of family and child rearing and child bearing that opposition to Western-type population control grew to the extent that there was a massive political rejection of these programs at the Romanian conference. I think if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> had considered what was said by women delegates at that conference he would be better informed as to why some of the population control programs in the Third World had failed. </para>
          <para>It was the view of those women, women who were intimately involved in what is happening to their sisters in the Third World countries, that if population control is to be successful, it must bc something that the women themselves want and understand and which does not destroy their whole fabric of family life. It never ceases to amaze me that people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> can expect other cultures to do what we think may be best for them because a particular idea may have proved successful for us, and at the same time perhaps resist any attempts within his own society to accept what other people might consider to be progress. We have seen in our own country a number of large lobbies organised to resist certain forms of control of fertility in this country. Those lobbies have a right to exist, to organise, to express themselves and to be effective if enough people support them. I would not deny that for a moment. But it strikes me as sadly ironical that we permit those kinds of lobbies to exist in our country- we permit people to express a range of views on subjects such as population control in our own country- and yet people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> look at the Third World countries and say, They have too many children. Why do they not accept compulsory sterilisation or the introduction of intra-uterine devices or some other western method of population control?' They might be acceptable to us in terms of our cultural values. Perhaps such methods are acceptable to some people in the community and not to others. But it is certainly totally unacceptable to say this to the women in villages in India or parts of Africa. I point this out because I think that it was rather incomplete for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheil</inline> to talk about the failure of population control programs in the Third World without talking about what seemed to me to be the most morally significant aspect of that failure, namely, that the women on whom these programs were inflicted were never consulted. </para>
          <para>I proceed now to the rest of my remarks. I would draw the attention of honourable senators back to some of the things that are happening in the Australian Capital Territory as a result of the change of government. I know that the view is widely held that the Australian Capital Territory is different and perhaps more privileged than other parts of Australia. But I think that in some ways the Australian Capital Territory, being the seat of government and the place where Government policies are most easily and directly implemented, provides a good litmus test for how a particular government is going. I am afraid that in the Australian Capital Territory we are seeing chaos in a number of policy areas which affect the everyday lives of ordinary people. I speak first about the confusion in the public transport system. Very recently, the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> decided virtually to cut out bus services. Buses are the only form of public transport in the Territory. I say that in case honourable senators imagine that there are other forms of public transport. Bus services in the early mornings, in the late afternoons and on weekends were cut. Of course, this meant that the people who use bus services- children, housewives doing their shopping, elderly people, people who cannot afford cars, students and teenagers- had no way of getting from one place to another except if they could afford a taxi. Of course, most people in the categories I have mentioned cannot. </para>

              <para>- No, taxis are not cheaper today. Although I think that perhaps buses are too expensive for a lot of people, they are still the cheapest form of transport. The removal of this form of transport at these crucial times has stopped people from getting to work and stopped elderly people from getting to senior citizen clubs or to hospitals to take advantage of the free medical system while it exists. It has prevented housewives from going to large supermarkets to do their shopping and forced them to use local, expensive small stores. Very seriously, it has prevented teenagers, of whom there are huge numbers in Canberra, from doing anything at all on weekends. As a result of a great deal of public outcry some of the services are being reinstated. But I suggest that a government which sees as an economy measure the taking away of a basie public service like the public transport system in a community where there are very many people dependent on it is a government which is on the wrong tack. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Another matter of great concern to people in the community is that there appears to be some threat to the salaried specialist service at the Canberra Community Hospital. I do not think that this is just a local issue. I hope that honourable senators from other States will pay some attention to this. It was mainly in the Australian Capital Territory that the Government had an opportunity to establish real choice under the Medibank system for clients of medical services. What we had at Canberra Community Hospital was the option of a free salaried specialist service. People did not have to have it if they did not believe in free medical attention. If they wanted to have a private specialist attend them and claim their rebate they could do this. If they opted for the free service, the hospital had employed a certain number of specialists who were there to provide it. The Australian Medical Association opposed this development and, as a result of its opposition, the Government was rather tentative in setting up this service. It employed a few specialists- not a great many and not a specialist in every area- and the idea was to see how the service went. The service has proved extremely popular, and it is not surprising that it has. When people come to the Territory and do not know any specialists but need specialist attention, it is logical that they should take advantage of the free specialist service at the hospital. This is what many people have done, with the result that most of the salaried specialists who are at the hospital now are seriously overburdened. </para>
          <para>What does this mean? It means that if we want the system to be maintained more salaried specialists must be appointed very soon. If they are not appointed, the fact that the doctors are overburdened now and some patients have to wait for weeks to get to a doctor will mean the undermining of the service. People will say: 'The free service is no good because you have to wait for weeks'. This will enable the Government to phase the service out. The salaried specialists are extremely concerned about this. They also are concerned because they believe that the Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt,</inline> is discussing ways of providing more specialist services- not necessarily free services- at the hospital with the private specialists in the Territory and representatives of the Am but not with the salaried specialists who are already working in the hospital. They have endeavoured to see the Minister for Health to discuss their concern with him; but, so far as I know, to date they have not been successful. </para>
          <para>A couple of weeks ago on their behalf I wrote to the Minister and asked whether he would speak to the salaried specialists about the future of this service in the Territory. I have had no reply. I do not want to be unduly pessimistic, but the lack of action by the Government, in either appointing more specialists or even discussing the matter with the salaried specialists who currently are overworked and concerned about their future, suggests that the Government intends to let this service run down- it is the only really successful example of free specialist medicine of which I am aware- so that it can say that it has been a failure and phase it out. The people of the Territory then would be deprived of the choice of a free service. I hope that the Minister for Health becomes aware of my remarks and addresses himself to this problem very quickly. </para>
          <para>Other matters that are concerning the people of the Territory are directly related to the present Government's policy on employment. The policy of no recruitment into the Public Service has left thousands of school leavers with no jobs. Canberra is still very much a Public Service town. That means that if the Public Service does not employ these people there are not many other employers who will. Not only has the Public Service stopped recruiting but it has cut down drastically on some of the training programs it has offered. For example, it used to offer an extensive program for girls wishing to become typists in the Public Service. Enrolments in this program have now been reduced to, I think, 30, which means that women are being deprived not only of employment but also of the opportunity to acquire the skills which could lead to employment in better times. </para>
          <para>Similarly, people hoping to be employed in the construction industry are in a very unhealthy situation. Despite the fact that there was an announcement yesterday that the Government had backed down on its hard line attitude on contracts let by the National Capital Development Commission to the tune of $50m for urgent school buildings, the cancellation of major NCDC projects led the Executive Director of the Master Builders Association to say, as reported in yesterday's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> that there was nothing in the NCDC's announcement regarding the $50m that will be made available to make him revise the Association's previous estimate that 4000 to 5000 fewer people would be employed in the construction industry in Canberra by June this year than were employed in September last year. This is a serious situation and one that has been brought about directly by the Government's 'squeeze Canberra' policy. </para>
          <para>The housing situation has grown drastically worse in the last few months. There was an increase in the price of land- a decision which was taken unilaterally by the then Minister for the Capital Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eric</inline> Robinson, without consultation with the local Legislative Assembly. The Government conveyancing office was shut, which has meant that people buying houses with Commissioner for Housing loans now will have to pay up to 100 per cent more in conveyancing costs to private solicitors. There has been a drying-up of funds for Commissioner for Housing loans. As yet there has been no specific statement about what funds will be available and under what terms funds will be available to people in Canberra seeking Commissioner for Housing loans. </para>

          <para class="block">The telegram was signed: 'Bob Ellicott, LiberalNational Country Party spokesman on Aboriginal affairs'. It is obvious that when those promises were made they were purely political speculation. The Liberal and National Country Parties had no intention of carrying them into operation. I have pages of documentation before me showing that the Aboriginal people are now as badly off as they were prior to 2 December 1 972. </para>
          <para>Two references on the last page of that telegram relate to the setting up of new funds. That has not happened. Funds previously established by the Labor Government have been dissipated, suspended, frozen or in fact are not being kept up to the level at which they ought to be kept for ongoing programs. It was also suggested that additional Aboriginal people would be appointed to staff positions, but we have found not only that additional Aboriginal people are not being appointed to staff positions but also that Aboriginal people are in fact being dismissed in increasing numbers. It will be recalled that a few weeks ago <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> and I had a discussion through the Australian Press regarding the sacking of some people in an area in central Australia. A number of Press statements was made dealing with this matter. I will refer to them as I progress. I do not want to have a personal argument with the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, but if he accepts the portfolio he has to accept the responsibility that goes with it. The unfortunate fact that the Prime Minister obviously has his finger very tightly on the control of Aboriginal affairs, as does the Premier of Queensland, is to the discredit of the Government. The Minister ought to be given the right to make a few decisions himself. </para>
          <para>The National Council of Aboriginal and Island Women has had its budget cut by at least 50 per cent. Previously it had a staff of four; it now has a staff of two. The allowance for the running of the Council's car has been cut to $6 a week. I do not know whether any honourable senator opposite can run his car, including petrol, maintenance, registration and insurance costs, on $6 a week. The Federal Liaison Officer now has to do the job of the office cleaner as well. She is doing that when she ought to be out in the field doing a job on behalf of her own people. Last year, before the advent of the Fraser Government, by arrangement with the then Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Department it was decided to abandon the holding of Council meetings on the promise that they would be held this year. There will be no Council meeting as the Council has now been advised that no funds will be made available. The excuse given by the Department is that it wanted proof that the organisation was a national body. </para>
          <para>It is a bit like the land rights problem at Aurukun. There has been a continuing argument as to whether the people there are to be dispossessed. The Queensland Government says that they are to be dispossessed. The Australian Government has not done very much about contradicting that statement. When the Queensland Ombudsman turned up there the day before yesterday he must have talked only to the gum trees around the settlement because the Aboriginal reserve council members were in fact in the Northern Territory. If that is an example of the organisation that is going on it is not hard to believe that the Government has set out on a concerted effort to deprive the people of their rights, of the grants to which they are entitled and of the ordinary justice that all of us in this community expect and accept. </para>
          <para>One would hope that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs would at least keep the Australian Labor Party's officers up to date on what is happening in the same way as the Ministers of the Labor Government used to do in days gone by for shadow Ministers, but there has been no communication in this regard. The position has become worse than that, as a gentleman named </para>

          <para class="block">I refer now to comments made by the Minister in a Press statement issued on 1 March 1976. 1 will not quote the whole statement, but I think that I should quote certain paragraphs of it to prove the points that I am making. The Press statement was issued in response to a statement made previously by me in which I accused the Minister of political duplicity over the mix up that was taking place in central Australia. The Press statement released by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline>said there was no denial from any section of the community that the country was facing a severe economic crisis and ways had to be found to cope with the massive deficit. One acknowledged means was to cut down on Government spending. He added: </para>
            <para>The economies have been made throughout almost all areas of Government expenditure. The cut of $7.3m made to the current Aboriginal Affairs budget is, as I have stated previously, not a single blow aimed at the Aboriginal people. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let us reflect on that for a moment. The then shadow' Minister for Aboriginal Affairs said prior to 13 December: 'Do not believe the propaganda that the Labor Party is spreading because no cuts will be made in the Aboriginal budget'. Less than 3 months later- within those famous 100 days- we have the Minister telling us of the massive cuts that have been made in Aboriginal expenditure. If that is not political duplicity I want to know what is. The Minister's statement continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No person will go hungry, despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> 's assertion to the contrary. Also, major disruptions to programs are not anticipated. </para>

          <para class="block">He did not say that that would not happen but that it was not anticipated that it would happen. But the Government can still take the eggs off the kids in the Central Australian settlements; it can still cut out the breakfast programs in other settlements; and generally, by dismissing people who probably will not receive social security payments, it can take the money away from a man and his family. I suppose that if one is black that is in order in this society but it is not in order as far as I am concerned. The Press release of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs continues:  . . 'wholesale sackings', as alleged by the Opposition spokesman had not taken place. There had been some terminations of employment and closure of kitchens in the Northern Territory as part of an ongoing program started in 1974 under the Labor Government.

Apparently, at the direction of the Government, in the areas that he has been he has been told to talk to white people only and, to make it look respectable, now and again he may have a short conversation with an Aboriginal. </para>

We decided about the significance that each tribe will supply to the House of Parliament in Canberra, Capital city of Australia.

Our suggestion to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> that we would like to keep one law, no change. Because the Liberal Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> took over this time we don't like, we don't agree and are unhappy. This recommendation will go to the Northern Land Council. If the Government themselves not happy about this discussion we would like the solicitors, ambassadors, lawyers to come over and talk with us at Galiwinku about this system, this law we have been keeping throughout the ages, because the Aboriginal law it is not changing except because of the B al and a amongst the Yolngu people. But privately and individually the Aboriginal law is the same and one. Not to change. Nobody can move that we change that and break that. Nobody can conquer the law (Aboriginal law) and order. If any government or anyone puts out of his way, with one wish, will spoil it. </para>

            <para>- Let me refer to another Press statement released by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. This Press release was issued in the face of the promises made by the coalition parties prior to 13 December. The statement was made on 4 February. The Minister said on that date that his Department would defer the funding of certain projects and make savings in others, including travel, overtime and other administrative costs to put into effect the Government's decision to cut spending in this area by $7m. He said that this would reduce the total expenditure by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs from the Budget appropriation of $ 142 m to an amount of $ 1 35m for the current year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
		  <para>In the final paragraph of that statement he said that other savings would be made by economy measures already announced concerning the general field of Public Service unemployment. I say that these cuts are only the thin edge of the wedge and the cuts will be much greater than $7m. Let me cite a few examples which I believe will indicate this quite clearly. Before the last federal election the Country Party sent a telegram to all the settlements saying that there would be no cutbacks in the Aboriginal Affairs budget or Aboriginal projects. That was a lie. I read the telegram earlier. I wish to refer to a circular that was sent to people in various areas, long distances from Alice Springs. Part of the circular reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Now a lot of people are being hurt by cutbacks and we want to find out what is happening at your place. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The first cut that was made applied to the Congress. Its budget was cut by $2 1 , 000 so that it can no longer put on the staff it needs to do the job. The medical service has run out of money and cannot get more although it was promised more. So far as I know it still has not got any. In regard to legal aid, there is only enough money for about another 6 weeks operation and the Government will not say if it will give more. This is happening with every Aboriginal service, whether it be the medical service in any of the States or in the Territory or whether it be the legal service. I know that some lawyers want to see the Aboriginal legal service abolished. </para>
          <para>Many doctors who subscribe to the journals of the Australian Medical Association want to see Aboriginal medical services abolished. Finance to housing associations everywhere has been cut back. A lot of people have lost their jobs in certain areas. Let me refer to some of them. Docker River received some $330,000 less and 12 people were put off. Yuendumu received $300,000 less and 8 people were put off. Jay Creek received $180,000 less and 3 people were put off. Haass Bluff received $200,000 less and one person was put off. I listed a number of other areas previously and I will not repeat them. I have a document that was made available by elders and other people associated with the administration of tribes in the Papunya area. I will read part of the document. The document was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser, Mr Viner, Mr Whitlam</inline> and to myself. It reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We are the bosses at Hermannsburg. We want the promise. We want the promise for the land rights too. You  promised not to cut Aboriginal money before the election. Already you have broken that promise. You promised to make that land rights law right away after the election. Now you say the Darwin mob might make that law. We want you to make it yourself as you promised. </para>

              <para>- Well, as I said, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> made tribal noises the other day as a result of a delegation of National Country Party people who came down to Canberra, following their vote of no confidence in him. Those people saw him yesterday. They saw <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, also. I understand that the Prime Minister has said that as soon as possible the land rights legislation will go through both Houses of the Federal Parliament. I am not too sure that that is going to happen because, if the National Country Party dominated Legislative Assembly in Darwin can get its way, it will not allow that legislation to go through here. </para>

The  President  of the day was anxious to knock off for dinner as were Ministers on the Government side that day. They agreed to its incorporation and we had a lot of fun trying to get those words out. There is nothing at all obscene in this proposed incorporation. There are straight statements.

              <para>-I thank the Senate. Let me continue with the sorry story of what is happening. I turn to a statement that was given to me by responsible people. The Papunya settlement had a total of 16 persons sacked, including the industrial staff to whom I referred earlier in this debate. These are the people who do the grass cutting, cleaning and so on around the various settlements. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> made a statement that eight were sacked by accident and were reemployed. Now, my authority, who incidentally, is not an Aborigine, is totally reliable and totally associated with the black community - </para>

              <para>- Thank you. No one had been re-employed to his knowledge and the sackings were deliberate. The statement from the Haass Bluff settlement is to the effect that the kitchen was closed before the last election. This was while there was a caretaker government. The doors allegedly did not shut properly on the kitchen so the Department of Aboriginal Affairs shut the whole place. At Utopia station, two housing association workers were sacked. At the Hooker Creek settlement the kitchen was closed because it did not show a profit and 4 persons were sacked. At Areyonga the kitchen was closed. In fact, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs put it to people that if the kitchen did not close down other economies would be made. So the people decided to close the kitchen and 7 persons were sacked, five from the kitchen and two from home management. Since then, one person has been re-employed. I mention next the Santa Theresa mission. There, all 15 -year-olds to 18-year-olds have been sacked by the Council to save money due to the cuts. The people tried to protect the older workers with family responsibilities. Only half wages are being paid to those still in jobs. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, the Prime Minister and others are saying that there are no cuts. All of these cases that I am presenting can be substantially backed up. </para>

          <para>At Mary vale station, the housing association was stopped. That was done just prior to the election. Approximately 7 persons were sacked at Docker River from the housing association because work never actually started. The price of meals was increased by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs from 10c and 20c to $1 and $2 a meal. All 70 school kids used to eat lunch there but now they do not have lunch in many instances because nobody can afford the $1 or $2. Absenteeism at the school is sure to increase. I turn to the Garden settlement. Four persons were sacked there. This was the result of various bungles as well as lack of money. For 3 months the people tried to get the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to buy a part for a pump. It did not come; the crops failed; so 4 persons were sacked. That is a summary of statements that have been made by responsible people in these areas. </para>

            <para>Representatives of our Organisations have now visited every major Aboriginal community in Central Australia in the past week. The purpose of the visits was to seek the opinions of communities on the current controversy over cutbacks in expenditure and Land Rights Legislation. </para>
            <para>At every community the response was similar. The people strongly support the stand which we have taken and have urged us to maintain the demand that Federal Parliament pass the Land Rights Legislation as a matter of priority . . . </para>
            <para>It is also clear from our discussions with our members that Government cut-backs have been even more serious than wc originally thought. Despite what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> may believe, no choice was offered to communities about cut-backs.

          <para class="block">I understand that he was a popular officer. I suppose that a good excuse for his dismissal is that there were cut-backs in finance. But the crux of the situation is that, while the Government protests that it has made no cuts in moneys for Aboriginal affairs and while it protests that nobody will suffer, it is in fact sacking people. The fact that this is happening is a repudiation of every promise made by the Liberal and National Country Parties prior to the election on 13 December 1975. </para>
          <para>The Aboriginal people cannot be blamed if they protest. Let us suppose that a few dollars was used in getting a meeting together in Alice Springs or anywhere else in Australia. Have not the Aboriginal people the right to congregate? Have not they the right to protest? Have not they the right to state their case in the courts of justice for themselves? After all, the Prime Minister has just had a junket to New Zealand. He is going overseas on another junket. He is projecting a trip to Red China, as honourable senators on the Government side call it, in the near future. Who is going to pay? Is the Prime Minister going to pay out of the profits of <inline font-style="italic">Nareen?</inline> Is he going to pay for the trip out of profits which he is able to make as a result of the superphosphate bounty? No. We the taxpayers will pay for it, and so we ought to. If we spend a few dollars on behalf of the Aboriginal people out of taxpayers' money. that is their right. I hope that note will be taken of the motion and that the Government will take stock of itself and reorganise its budget for Aboriginal affairs. </para>

              <para>-I thank the Senate. The purpose of my motion is simple. In the Senate last year, during the term of the Whitlam Labor Government, by a unanimous vote we created the National Parks and Wildlife Service. Of course, the prime purpose now is to acquire additional acreage to enable the Service to operate. The plain fact of the matter is that any land used by the Australian Government for. defence needs or for the installation of lighthouses or any other communication units is Commonwealth territory. When technological changes make a lighthouse obsolete, I want the land on which the lighthouse stands to be acquired by the Government and kept for its original purposes. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>I should like to illustrate the value of such a policy. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> and I came here as fledgling senators in 1966 we were associated with a very fine conservationist, Doug Dorward of Monash University. I am sure some honourable senators may have seen his documentary dealing with Cape Barren geese. At his instigation, we visited the Goose and Chap ell Islands in Bass Strait. I am insistent that we should have iron-clad regulations on what constitutes a fauna reserve and particularly an island reserve. Sheep were running on both Goose and Chap ell Islands. Of course, when it came to the competition for vegetation the sheep won. Then, of course, the residue of the Cape Barren geese became a menace to the pastures on Flinders Island. Then there was a response from the farmers. The number of Cape Barren geese was less than two hundred. As a matter of fact, this situation regarding the Cape Barren geese was almost on a par with that of the whooping crane in the United States. The population of that species was even further decimated than was the population of the Cape Barren geese. I must pay a tribute to all concerned. In the case of the Goose and Chap ell Islands, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> and I were able to see Ian Sinclair, the then Minister for Shipping and Transport who was the custodian of lighthouses, and the Premier of Tasmania at that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reece.</inline> As a result, both islands were made fauna reserves with iron-clad regulations. That was a bipartisan approach, and it was successful. I feel that in future all honourable senators must endeavour to ensure that land, which is no longer used because of technological changes, becomes reserves. </para><para>When the previous Liberal Government was in office certain ideas were put forward about projects in the Jervis Bay area, which is on the New South Wales coastline. I am thinking of a particular penguin rookery. We came across one or two areas that could have been called private enterprise Shangri-las. People obtained a lease say, 20 years ago, and developed a private sanctuary. To me, that situation is not for the common good. I believe that all off-shore islands should be preserved in the way that I suggest. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Broomhill</inline> was the Minister for Conservation in South Australia- he is an extremely competent and dedicated Minister- a case arose involving a lighthouse in that State. The matter involved him and the then Australian Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones.</inline> In these instances, the fact that the land was Commonwealth territory meant that it was subjected to some surveillance by naval patrol craft. </para><para>At the time I suggested- I did not get my way completely- that the Royal Australian Air Force also should keep an eye on these places. It may well be that with the increase in narcotics smuggling and with the greater degree of collaboration between the customs people and the Navy, we will find that a lot of these islands will be less subject to pillage by some of these drunken amateur fishermen and people like them who go on a slaughterhouse expedition. The point about which I am concerned is that when a lighthouse becomes obsolete a marine slum could develop. I think all Tasmanians will agree with me that in earlier years there were some tremendous depredations in regard to seals. Of course, we are supposed to learn from past history. I simply emphasise that I believe that we should establish the positive formula, that as each of the lighthouses on these islands is phased out due to technological changes, the land automatically becomes a fauna and flora area. I say that with a lot of feeling. I am sure that some honourable senators were nauseated a few weeks ago to see the bloody traffic in seals that goes on in certain outposts of Canada. We might have a situation where we are in need of a certain country's trade but I believe that we can remain solvent without indulging in such an activity. It is to the credit of successive Australian governments that we have a very effective monitoring system in the Antarctic in relation to the seal population. </para><para>I will relate for some of the new honourable senators a very fine story that I admire about a very illustrious Australian- John Grey Gorton. When he was a Minister in this chamber and he was responsible for science and kindred matters, I know that whenever I asked him a question - </para><interjection>

              <para>- Senator John Grey Gorton as he then was. He was a very fine Australian, although I know that a lot of Liberal senators seem to recoil in horror when I mention his name. The fact is that -every time a question was asked by conservation groups about ideas that some queer people had for the use of certain types of insecticides- some people wanted to experiment down at the South Pole- John Grey Gorton was a very strong champion in the fight to ensure that seals were protected. This is not a question of establishing a Utopia; it is a question of plain fact. We will always have people in the community who want to destroy things. </para>

          </continue><para>I believe that as time goes on the commercial areas will spread out around the coastline but it is essential that we should maintain some of these areas as reserves. I have never argued that we cannot have industrial projects on the coastline, but I have always believed that they should bc established only after the conservationists have had their way. I know that people like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, who keeps a finger on overall policies, would well know that a senator who may aspire to greatness in the United States Senate in the near future- I refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ed.</inline> Muskie who will be succeeding <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mike</inline> Mansfield- has always played an important role in regard to the coast of Maine in the United States. He has indicated to me in letters that there always seems to be a plausible excuse for making an exception so that the coastline can bc used for other purposes- whether it be for an oil refinery or something else. I make the strong plea that the areas listed in the answer to which I have referred- I am sure there will be additional areas- should be consolidated by the Australian Government. </para><para>I have no doubt that honourable senators on both sides of the chamber- I speak here in regard to my own State- will agitate for the Australian Government to unlock certain land. I accept that principle provided, of course, that the Commonwealth Government does not let the States go into the real estate business. In the Middle Harbour of Sydney a dastardly act was perpetuated by the Lewis Government. With the concurrence of" the Australian Government some land was released and the governments then went 50-50. Half of the land was made a fauna reserve and the other half was used for high priced dwellings. Today the big cities need their lungs, as it were; they need these handkerchief areas. Although my opening remarks referred to coastline projects they still have particular relevance to the overall transfer of land. </para><para>I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> is in the chamber. I suppose that he is really the honest broker who handles all the Government's land matters. I inform him that I told certain conservation groups that I expected this matter to come up today. As a postscript to this matter pf the overall land transfer from New South Wales I have been asked to suggest to him that a portion of the Holsworthy Army Camp land which has been deemed redundant to a degree should be grafted onto the Heathcote State Park instead of being used for housing. I say that for a nostalgic reason. Some years ago my colleague in the shadow Ministry, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> and I were successful in prevailing on the Postmaster-General to keep certain Pm excavation out of the Heathcote State Park. I simply conclude on the note on which I began: As far as item 4 is concerned I believe that a lot of these acquisitions which were justly needed for defence purposes and which have become outmoded could form the nucleus of the empire of the National Parks and Wildlife Service that was formed last year. </para><continue>

            <para>That the Senate ask the Government to make such funds available as will enable projects commenced during International Women's Year 1975 to continue and be expanded, and take urgent and immediate steps to eliminate all forms of discrimination against women in Australia, and to actively encourage the elimination of discrimination against women in all parts of the world. </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">I rise on this matter because I feel that, as International Women's Year finished about two or three weeks ago, the matter should not be dropped but should be kept before the Government and the people of Australia. Because when International Women's Year was first mooted the government of the day had long recognised that discrimination against women was incompatible with human dignity and with the wellbeing of society, it saw International Women's Year as a chance to highlight areas to which the community had turned a blind eye for so long. That Government recognised, and I think that the whole community should recognise with some sober thought, the fact that the year had to be granted. In the year 1974 it was thought necessary to give the world 12 months in which to recognise that there had been discrimination against women, that there was discrimination against women and that unless steps were taken to bring women out of themselves and to realise their full potential, the world was missing out on the potential of over 50 per cent of the population. So it was thought necessary to nominate a year to ensure that the basic human rights of women were recognised. </para>
          <para>International Women's Year was seen as a year to provide opportunity to stand back and assess what had been achieved and what needed to be done. In many ways what needed to be done far outweighed what had been achieved. Various things such as equal minimum wage, maternity leave in the Public Service and equality of promotion in the Public Service which could be done by putting pen to paper had been done. But the feeling in the community in many ways had not been changed. In many areas nobody had thought it necessary to do anything for women in a particular fashion. Some of the projects that were taken up during International Women's Year, of which I think we should not lose sight, have only just begun and should be extended. So I am asking the Government to look at them very keenly and to provide the necessary funding. I refer for instance to the continued establishment of a network of community centres to respond to women's problems and to encourage their activities. People talk a lot about suburban neurosis, about the problems of the nuclear family, about the problems of women from other countries who do not speak English and who are isolated in outlying areas of our major cities. Up until this point nobody thought that by providing the sheer physical environment, a place where women could meet, talk and discuss their problems, we might be going a long way towards curing some of those very real, very nasty and very modern complaints that do so much to tear the fabric of our modern society apart. </para>

              <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cormack,</inline> but I do know that our civilisation covers more than the outer suburban areas. As I was about to say, women in country areas sometimes have an even harder row to hoe because at least in some areas of our cities people can occasionally board a tram- when the tram runs and go to communicate with their fellows, with people who speak the same language or with their families, although that is becoming increasingly difficult in the cities which we have created. People in the country have an even harder row to hoe. Women isolated in the country where they have not even a telephone cannot communicate with their fellows. In that regard the present Government might consider making the telephone a public utility and not just a luxury that some people can afford. Even a telephone is better than not having human beings to talk to face to face. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Other areas in which women needed the establishment of some sort of community centre were the areas of health, shelter, refuge, counselling and rape. Some very hard things have been said about the sort of women who have taken advantage of these centres and the sort of women who have set up these centres. But I suppose that it is a bit hard for men to understand that there are times when women want to talk to people who understand exactly what their health problem is- and that is not a man. Sometimes it is of great comfort for a woman to talk to another woman about what is happening to her body, because that woman does understand as it has been happening to her body. She can talk to somebody who understands what she is saying and does not have to go into a great deal of gynaecological detail. She knows that she will receive sympathy from the person to whom she is talking because that person has suffered from the same sort of disability. With the best will in the world, no man can understand how a woman feels in some circumstances because he is not a woman. He is a man. For very little outlay and upkeep such centres can be established where women can go and find out that they are not freaks, that the things that happen to them happen to other women and that somebody ought to be taking some notice of the things that happen to them. </para>
          <para>By the same token, women who because of their domestic difficulties, because of over work there will be more of them- have broken down and have found that they cannot stand the pressure of working, keeping a family and looking after a house, need some place where they can go after the first violent reaction so that they can find their way back into the community, talk to their fellows or their peers, talk about ways to manage their lives and ways to manage the seemingly endless problems that come up. When that breakdown comes, when violence occurs in the home that seems to be happening with increasing frequency these days- there needs to be a place of quiet where people can go, talk to other people, talk out the problem and be assured that things can be better, that something can be done, that they are not mad but that it is just the pressure of modern society that has pushed them out of kilter for the moment. Once upon a time that place was the church. Increasingly- I do not want to go into this argument- it is not the church anymore. Once upon a time it was the family doctor. Now a person is lucky if he sees the same doctor more than twice running at the same clinic. So there has to be another place. These days there is not the large family unit where there were grandmothers, mothers and aunts to whom a woman could talk. Sometimes there is just a 3-year old, whom she loves very much but who does not talk her language. There needs to be a place where people can go. I am not saying that there does not need to be a place where men can go in such circumstances. But in this instance I am very much aware of the fact that there needs to be a place where women can go to seek shelter and refuge and some advice. It is becoming an increasingly more serious problem in the community because so many people are getting to a crisis situation these days. It is an area at which our society has to take a greater look. </para>
          <para>So many of the crises, burdens and problems that arise could be side-stepped if there were more facilities available for people to get together to discuss, to increase the skills they have and to practise the skills they have achieved in being housewives and mothers. They have considerable skills in being housewives and mothers. Too often these days I meet women who, when I ask them what they do, hang their heads and say, 'We are only housewives'. It is one of the saddest sights to see. They are not only housewives. They are also people who have contributed tremendously to our society and to our civilisation. They are the people who have kept our civilisation and our society going. Without their expertise, their care and their love I doubt whether society would have lasted as long as it has. It is good for them to realise, it is good for their inner beings to know, it is good for their confidence to know that they have the skills, that they can share those skills with other people, that they can teach other people those skills and go on contributing in that way. This was one of the areas that International Women's Year wanted to cover and I think started to cover. </para>
          <para>Another of the areas that we wanted to look into was the effect of the education system on women's self-image. So many women had no confidence in themselves. That was partly due to the education system they had gone through which had seen them as only filling in their time at school. It had seen women as filling in their time between leaving school and having a baby. It did not give a damn what happened to them after that period of producing a family had passed. In some cases, they were left with 30 and 40 years of their lives in which they could give of their expertise to the community. The isolation of women, on which I have touched, is a very real problem. It is a very real problem in an understandable way for migrant women who come to Australia and who do not understand our language. Their husbands are away all day, and sometimes all night too, because they have 2 jobs to fill. Their children learn another language that is not their mothers' language. There are no programs on the television in their languages. There are no programs broadcast by the radio stations in their languages. They are lucky in some instances if they can read a newspaper because of the circumstances in which some of" them came to Australia, even if they could buy a newspaper in their own languages. That is a terrifying isolation in which to leave anybody. </para>
          <para>It is terrifying for women more so because while their husbands go out to work and of necessity must have some contact and learn something of the community they live in, those women can be locked up inside 4 walls day in day out. It is not human to leave them there in that condition. Until the International Women's Year conference raised that problem it was not even considered to be a problem. I am ashamed to say that not a great deal has been done about it up to this point. For those women it is a diabolical problem. But it can be a problem also for women living in outer suburbs and who spend their days in conversation with 3-year-olds. The husbands in those areas do not get home from work until 7 or 8 o'clock at night. By that time their wives are worn out. The terrifying isolation of looking at 4 walls and talking to yourself 5 days a week is not good. It does not do good things to good human beings. </para>
          <para>International Women's Year wanted to cover the participation of women in the area of films, television and radio programs. It wanted to get their expertise and their ideas into those areas. We found that in those areas women were very good clerks, filing clerks, telephone answerers or letter-typers and they gave a great deal of advice. It has often been said that managing directors can die but as long as their secretaries are there the next managing directors will be able to carry on. That holds true just as much in the area of the media. Women are working hard in that area and have a great deal of expertise. But because they are women not very much notice is taken of them. One little program was broadcast by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It was the <inline font-style="italic">Coming Out Ready or Not</inline> show. It was written by women for women and was broadcast by women. I must say that it was a breath of fresh air in the great mass of material that pours out through the radio stations. I am amazed that commercial stations which profess to have such a great concern for women and which certainly, day after day, try to sell women goods worth hundreds of thousands of dollars cannot take up the challenge and do something along their own lines to provide a program for women which is produced by women. For once, they should listen to what women want and provide it. They should not do as so much of the media does, namely, provide the greatest load of tripe unsung because it is cheap and because it fills in the time between when the station goes on air and the time when the husbands come home at 7 o'clock at night. </para>
          <para>International Women's Year provided an opportunity to stand back and assess what had been achieved up to date in this area and what needed to be done. It was discovered that a great deal more needed to be done than has been done up to that time. When the national secretariat for International Women's Year advertised the fact that money could be devoted to various projects coming under the heading of International Women's Year, by 4 December 1974 the costed submissions it received amounted to $3.5m. At that stage only $2m had been allotted for this purpose and there was still 12 months to go. The submissions poured in on all sorts of subjects. Some of them sounded funny; some of them sounded like the sort of ideas that could go on for year after year. But they all came from areas concerned for women's rights, for women's lives, for women and their children and the sort of lives they had been living. The submissions poured in. It proved that although until that time other departments and institutions had had some responsibility in that area- they had had it for a long time- they had not done anything about communicating their ability to deal with those problems to women in the community. There had been no communication between those departments and institutions and women in the community. There was obviously a need for a great deal more, and more vital, vital communication. I do not mean just publishing on the notice board of a department the fact that they were able to do this, that and the other thing. I mean actively going out and finding the problems, letting the people with those problems know that they were in a position to assist and that the machinery was there to do something about the problems that existed. Such departments should be actively getting out into the community to participate in the problems. </para>
          <para>It was obvious that in many areas there needed to be centres set up, advice given and a little money spent. Nobody could say that $2m spent in 12 months for International Women's Year in a big country like Australia, a country as wealthy as Australia, is a lot of money. A little more money had to be spent. But at the end of 1 2 months, after so many years of neglect, wc should not just chop off the funds, have everybody turn back into pumpkins, go back to where we were and turn a blind eye to the problems that were uncovered. It was 12 months really spent in discovering what the problems were. Now we want to spend the next 50 or 100 years making sure that those problems are dealt with, that new problems do not arise, that all our citizens participate to the best of their ability and that there is not discrimination against part of our community. Unfortunately, we know that that discrimination still exists. We know now that it exists in areas of which we had not even thought. I am not saying that discrimination does not exist in other areas, but in this instance we will not find out how far discrimination against women goes unless we give women a chance to speak out, to talk about their needs, thoughts, worries, hopes and dreams. We cannot do that by imposing ideas on them or by telling them what they have to do. We can do it by opening up opportunities for them to speak out for themselves. That needs more time, and that is why I want this Government to extend some of the funding that went into International Women's Year. In 12 months we got articulate women to speak out. In 12 months there were women to whom the idea of speaking out filtered through. This is like the tip of an iceberg. There are some women speaking out, but there are thousands upon thousands of women who do not know that they are oppressed, who do not know that life could be better and who do not realise what society is doing to them. We have to give ourselves a chance to listen and give them a chance to talk to us. </para>
          <para>Discrimination against women exists in Australia in many different ways and some of the things that we have found out give us an idea of the direction in which we should go. For instance, in this House some time last year I asked whether there had been any research into the induction of labour, the practice of bringing on labour and having babies bom in office hours. It created some mirth. I am ashamed to say that it created some mirth on the part of our Minister. In the following few weeks I received letters from individual women, groups of women, scientists and doctors saying that no research had been done and that up to that point nobody had thought it terribly important that research like this be done. One got the distinct feeling that, because it was something that was happening to women who, after all, do have babies and always have had babies, and because everybody knows how it happens- although I am not sure that everybody knows how it is brought about- nothing had been done. </para>
          <para>Take the pill, for example. Many women around Australia have said for a long time that people do not really know what effect the pill has on some women, women in certain conditions. Because society now is in some ways dependent on the pill and because so many women are pressured into using the pill, one would think that science would investigate very promptly, as it concerns such a large proportion of the community, the effect that the pill has on women 's systems and the effect that it has on women mentally, and would take immediate steps to make sure that women were safeguarded against any excesses. </para>

              </talker>
              <para>- I have a great deal of concern about the attitude of some midwives towards their patients. In some instances one would think that they were at a stud rather than in a hospital where human babies are being born and human mothers are going through suffering. I also think that society has ignored the fact that breast-feeding is going out of popularity. In International Women's Year there was a group which tried to get funding in order to spread the news about breast-feeding and about how well babies did and how much better they were for it. This is an area that scientists and governments should investigate and one into which science should do some research, because these are very basic things. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>We sat back very smugly in the last couple of years and said that equal pay had come in and therefore women were right in that area. We know very much to our sorrow that under equal pay some people are more equal than others and that this is still one area of great discrimination. Because we make institutional changes, that docs not necessarily mean that we change the attitude of society. Because we pass a Bill, that does not mean that the feeling behind that Bill filters down to the lowest level of society. We all know of cases where women are machinists and mcn are technicians. The division of labour is such that, because one sex gets one title and the other sex gets another title, the male sex is entitled to a higher rate of pay. That is discrimination at the lowest level and something has to be done about it. Governments have not done any more about it, unions have not done any more about it and employers have not done any more about it. </para>
          <para>This is a basic principle, because in enticing women into the work force in many ways we arc getting them out there as cheap labour. When some of them stagger out of bed at 6 o'clock in the morning, get children off to school, do the chores, go to work, come home, look after the family and then fall into bed, it is time unions, employers and governments looked at what amounts to not much more than slave labour for a great percentage of this community. We accept that cheap labour, that slave labour; but, when those women get put off their jobs, do they get unemployment benefit? Evidently they are not looked upon as a solid part of the community or work force. They are usable, and when we need them we get them out of the house and use them. When their jobs close up, out they go with no compensation of any sort. </para>
          <para>Another area of discrimination which appeals me, and for which I feel my sex is as much to blame as the other sex, is in superannuation. I had not looked at it very closely before I became a senator. I suppose I had never come upon it. For the life of me, I cannot understand why a system should exist where husband and wife are supposedly a team, contribute equally to the wellbeing and finances of home and family and life and out of their joint income the husband pays superannuation and then if the husband dies the wife gets only a percentage of the superannuation entitlement for which they have paid for so long, whereas if the wife dies first the husband receives his full superannuation entitlement. A wife left with a house and children pays the same for rates, electricity, shoes, food, education and living as does the husband who is left. So why should she get only a percentage of what they both in a sense have contributed to the superannuation fund? </para>
          <para>I talked about enticing women back to the work force. To make it better, more pleasant and easier for women to go back, in government circles we brought in maternity leave. Perhaps we should think of a new name for it, because I find that in the community there are people who think that women who leave work to have babies get 12 months leave on full pay. We know very well that they get not 12 months leave on full pay but 2 months leave with no pay at all. The object is that their jobs, their promotional opportunities and their places in their department are kept for them. That entitlement has not filtered through to women in industry. They do not get any sort of maternity leave and there is no provision for them to go back to their jobs in industry. That should be done. </para>
          <para>We entice women back into industry; but what do we do about retraining them for a proper place in industry? Nothing. We bring them back because so many of them think that some money is better than no money at all and will take the most menial, dreary, dull and underpaid jobs there are. If they were retrained they could come back with a full capacity to contribute. Those who had some training before they left industry need some further training in order to catch up with what has gone on in the meantime. We have paid lip service to that need. In the National Employment and Training scheme we paid lip service to it. It is important that the women who fec i that they want to come back into the work force should be able to do so under the best possible conditions, but it is even more important that the women who have to come back into the work force are able to do so under the best possible conditions. </para>
          <para>I ask the Government to look at this matter as a matter of great priority: There are women being trained under the NEAT scheme who have lived on the supporting mother's benefit for a long time or who, if they have not lived on the supporting mother's benefit, have done menial jobs in the community- scrubbed floors, taken in washing and kept house for other people- to provide the sort of income they need to enable them to keep their children as best they can under the same conditions as those enjoyed by the rest of the community. It is an up and down sort of life. They are in and out of employment. If they were given some training that enabled them to obtain qualifications they would then be able to hold down a job while looking after their families and to stand up in the community as equal citizens and not as ones relying on government handouts. By the same token there are women in the community who because of their domestic circumstances- they may have a husband who is an alcoholic and upon whom they can never depend to bring in a regular income but who brings in some income- should be given the chance to achieve those qualifications that will enable them to look after their families in a solid fashion without, as has been suggested to some of them by some government employees, having to leave their husbands and so entitle themselves to the supporting mother's benefit. If we are really talking about women coming into the work force and we are not doing more than paying lip service to retraining we ought to look at these things. I would like to quote from a booklet put out by the Women's Bureau of the Department of Labour entitled 'How to find the job you want'. One knows that it is directed to women because it has a rose on the cover. Amongst the advice it gives is the following: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If you have young children, be able to satisfy the employer that they will not unduly take your attention from your job or make you an unreliable worker; the employer may wish to be assured that you have made adequate arrangements for the care of your children while you are working. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">What employer would dare ask a man what arrangements he had made for his children or whether he was being a proper parent before he gave him a job? I once met a young woman with 5 young children whose husband was dying of a debilitating disease. She realised that if she was going to look after those children by herself for the rest of their lives and give them all the care that she and her husband would have otherwise given them she would have to gain some qualifications that would enable her to take up some work that would allow her to do so. She went along and was interviewed about retraining. The gentleman interviewing her said to her: I realise that you need to have qualifications, but you are young and have 5 children now. Do you think that you will have more children?' She said that she did not think that she would. She said that because of her husband's condition she did not think that there was any likelihood of that in any case. The interviewer persisted and asked her how she knew that there was no likelihood that she would have more children. Finally she said: 'I have had an hysterectomy; so I cannot have any more children'. The wretched man had the cheek to ask her the name of the gynaecologist so that he could check on whether that was true. Only men would do that to women. Men would not do it to other men. I think it is time that we took this matter very much to heart. </para>
          <para>The conditions under which women in the workforce are employed smack of discrimination to the nth degree. The Metropolitan Board of Works in Melbourne has some rather delightful guidelines for the employment of women. For instance, married female employees have only temporary status and there is no way in which those females who are married can ever become permanent. A female employee who marries is required to resign and apply for reappointment to a temporary position even though she does not need to stop work. How cynical is that? A female employee who marries and has to rejoin the Board as a new employee is not eligible for annual leave until the completion of a further 12 months service, despite the fact that there has been no break in the continuity of her work. Married women, as temporary employees, cannot be members of the Board's superannuation fund. Married women, as temporary employees, are not eligible for paid study leave. So that puts paid to any thought that the Board really accepts women as a real part of the workforce, as real citizens. They are just there to fill in time and to do odd jobs. Something has to be done about it because they are human beings and they have a lot to contribute. </para>
          <para>Women are at some disadvantage in the area of legal aid. This applies especially to women who are at home and who have no income. We went to the extent of establishing legal aid offices because we believed that nobody should be at a disadvantage before the law and that everybody, even women, should be equal. But somebody has to look at the area of the women in the home who have no income and who therefore go along to a legal aid office to get some advice on, say, divorce because of the conduct of their husbands. Their husbands are not going to give them money to go and obtain that advice. If they are in the position of being a part owner of the home, of having a joint bank account with their husbands, it seems that the door is closed to them everywhere in relation to obtaining any sort of legal advice. </para>
          <para>In this context I have to raise today the subject of rape. In some quarters rape has become a bit of a giggle, but I am sure that it has never been a giggle to the people who have been the victims of it. Males should stop laughing about the subject of rape. They should stop making jokes about it in bars. They should see it for what it is- the invasion of another person's privacy, the dragging away of that person's dignity, and the treating of that person as an animal and not as a human being. The final indignity is that in court that person has to prove her own innocence in the matter. A lot has been said in recent weeks about this matter and there have been articles in the newspapers about it, but is it not time that wc did something about it rather than just talk about it as being something that happens to other people? I cannot help feeling that if more mcn suffered from rape something would be done about it more quickly. </para>
          <para>I feel that the present governments and future governments will have to look at how taxation affects women. There is some talk now about various forms of taxation, including death duty and probate, being looked at. At least in this area people pay lip service to the fact that a woman who does not go out to work may still contribute much to the family home, the family property and even the family business and are seeing that she is a partner in or a part of that circumstance. But I think that Treasurers will have to have a look at the tax that working wives pay. As long as husbands and wives are taxed differently, even though in most instances the working wives work twice as hard, there will be many women around who feel that they are being discriminated against. I think that it is the duty of governments to take up those sorts of matters and to come up with some proposals for the relief of what in some ways I think is indiscriminate taxation when it comes to women. </para>
          <para>An area of discrimination that governments can do something about is the media. I know that it raises a bit of a giggle among my male colleagues and even my male constituents, but the fact of the matter is that women are depicted on radio and television and in the newspapers as happy little twi rps who have no mind of their own and as some sort of a vegetable that has a continual smile on its face, that is never allowed to lose its temper, that is never allowed to be a human being and that is never allowed to have hates and loves of its own. As long as it washes, irons, cleans and does what it is told and pops into bed when it has to then it is well and truly under control. If we are talking about discrimination then let us talk about that sort of discrimination. </para>
          <para>Newpapers should treat women as adult human beings. I do not suppose we can legislate to ensure that newspapers present us with the sort of material to read that would broaden our outlook, broaden our minds or give us more information, but at least governments could legislate for women to be treated as whole human beings and not as some sort of cardboard cutout that is propped up either to sell soap powder, trucks, carpets or any other thing that happens to be going at the moment. This puts women under undue pressure to conform to an image that the media cuts out for them. This is not fair to people who are locked up day after day with the radio, television and newspapers. We know the influence that they have on people. If women do not see themselves depicted in that area as real human beings then I feel they are never going to take themselves seriously as human beings. </para>
          <para>In the motion which is before us we ask that this Government take steps to ensure that discrimination against women in all parts of the world is brought to an end as quickly as possible. I am very humble about telling other countries what they should do about discrimination when I feel that my own country could do so much more about setting an example. Perhaps the best we can do as far as overseas countries are concerned is to set an example by setting our own house in order first. Surely we could advise our representative on the United Nations to watch out and to encourage movements in other countries towards cutting down discrimination against women. Surely assistance could be offered and sought on a government to government basis in this matter. </para>
          <para>I am reminded of an old Chinese proverb which I have quoted before but which appeals to me in discussing this matter. The Chinese say that women hold up half of heaven. If that is so it seems to me that women are entitled to recognition in their own countries as full, well meaning, well disposed intelligent human beings who can contribute so much to the good of their country. </para>

          <para>- I rise to state briefly my growing concern at the apparent disregard of some members of the government for civil liberties in the Australian community. Of course, it is natural in any parliament that the extravagances of temperament can lead individuals to make claims which sometimes they later regret and which one can write down at times as being simply a personal expression that does not convey the will of the party to which the  speaker  belongs. Therefore those views are not taken as indicating any general trend or any dangerous manifestation in the controlling administration. However, an aggregate number of occurrences recently have caused me concern. I am indeed worried that at a time when the Government is concentrating quite rightly on the economic problems which are severe in Australia it might do so to the detriment of the freedoms which we have enjoyed up till now. There are many notable countries in the world which have demonstrated that a magnificent economic recovery can be obtained with, at the same time, the loss of a major amount of the freedoms which the community had enjoyed. We do not want that to happen here. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There are 4 recent occurrences which, amongst others, have caused me concern. The first was the mention made by the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> of a possible charge being laid against the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Whitlam)</inline> of sedition. This has received a fairly critical response from the community at large. Some people believe that we would be emulating some of those leaders in darkest Africa if the Leader of the Opposition in a democracy such as ours could be under the threat of legal action and of its consequences for sedition. A second instance I relate is one of recent days when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> criticised the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission for not holding down wages in the community and for recommending a national wage increase of 6.4 per cent. </para>
        <para>I believe that occurrences of yesterday have invalidated that criticism because General Motors-Holden's Pty Ltd awarded a wage rise to certain employees far in excess of the 6.4 per cent increase recommended by the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The Commission therefore cannot be charged with being the economic arbiter in wages. It has the duty of preventing disputes and is the innocent party in this particular wrangle. In fact, the nettle of wage fixation is not a matter for the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission but is a matter for the Government. If the Government wants to succeed in that area by way of legislation or force it can only do so on its own initiative. But if there is disorder as a result of that action it will not be the fault of the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission, which is charged with preventing industrial disorder concerning claims for increased remuneration. </para>
        <para>I think it was yesterday that the suggestion was put forward and received by our  President  that an investigation should be conducted into the accreditation of 2 journalists in Parliament House because of criticisms which have arisen which do not concern anything which has been reported from this House. I believe that it is a very substantial departure from the usual type of investigation that one would expect for a journalist who writes about something completely outside the activities of this House to be investigated in this way. As we know, the subject is still a matter of possible debate in this chamber following the President's statement to the Senate today. If his statement is read correctly I believe that it diplomatically says just what I am saying: It is not the business of this Senate to concern itself with the action that has been suggested. </para>
        <para>Yesterday and today we heard the Leader of the Government in the Senate embarking on what appears to be a personal vendetta against the Australian Broadcasting Commission. In all these matters it would seem that in aggregate we have an attempt to demoralise people who are members of commissions or working employees of institutions of very long standing in the community and who at times have been vigorous in their actions. But I believe that these people have operated within the laws of this nation and that now they are being subjected to a type of parliamentary intimidation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in particular has in no way substantiated his wild accusations. This morning in reply to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> was unable or unwilling to state one item which would support the charge which he so recklessly made yesterday. In response to a question to which I did not expect an answer, he would not comment on his view of newspaper journalists and their criticisms of government. He would not place them in any way within the same strictures that he has placed the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He said yesterday when referring to the Australian Broadcasting Commission: 'You blokes have been leaning on it for years'. He concluded by saying: 'The sooner it is cleaned up the better as far as I am concerned '. </para>
        <para>I thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> Minister in the Lower House this morning very politely but purposefully repudiated the Leader of the Government in the Senate and said, in answer to a question asked by the Leader of the Opposition in  the  other place: <inline font-weight="bold">'Senator Withers</inline> is a very valuable and capable colleague. He speaks with a bluntness which can be refreshing-' He then paused and said: 'on occasions'. The tenor of this reply was not lost on members of the other place  nor  was it lost on others who were listening. I am pleased that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Eric</inline> Robinson, has taken such a sensible view, and has agreed  to  an investigation into the ABC which is welcomed by its Acting Chairman and which will be  welcomed  by all thinking people in the community. I reject the thought that people in the Australian Broadcasting Commission whom I respect and whom I believe a host of members of the public respect will feel intimidated that the Leader  of  the Government in this place, an important Minister in this Administration, can so loosely charge people collectively without any finite instances whatsoever. </para>
        <para>It is true. What I am saying cannot be denied. Is it a system of British justice to charge  an  organisation or an individual loosely without  any  information? Can we assess the  Tightness or  wrongness of the Minister's statement if he will give no example whatsoever? One cannot begin a trial or as assessment when there is no information. Of course the Minister, as any Minister  of  the Crown other than he would do, should either substantiate his claims or withdraw them. If he will do neither his standard of operation will bc below every other member of the Ministry.  His  colleagues are exhibiting some honour in this matter. </para>
        <para>On Tuesday the Attorney-General made what was a very substantial mistake in answering an important question. On Wednesday he had the ministerial responsibility to correct himself at great embarrassment to himself. Whatever the rights or wrongs of the question and answer may be I believe it is a sign of a very real regard for his ministerial responsibilities for him to do that. We know, despite the public criticisms of the Attorney-General, that he would never involve himself in these loose and collective charges that the Leader of the Government has involved himself in here. I express concern that this subject in aggregate is something which we must guard against. </para>
        <para>I end by centring my regard and giving an example of what can happen to our freedoms. There has been talk on the national scene of a Privacy Bill. A Privacy Bill was talked about by the Labor Administration and I understand it is being loosely talked about by the present Liberal Administration. It concerns me that the people to whom I referred in these 4 instances may have a hand in drafting and implementing a Privacy Bill in the national Parliament. I wish to refer to the Privacy Bill which was passed through the lower House of the South Australian Parliament, controlled by a Labor administration, in 1974 and to indicate to the House briefly how our freedoms can easily disappear if an administration believes that it is being pursued by the media, as it would appear at least <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> believes he is so pursued. At this late hour I shall refer only to the relevant clause on how our freedoms would have disappeared in South Australia had the Legislative Council passed the Bill. The extract to which I refer reads: </para>

        </list>
        <para class="block">I think all honourable senators would know on upon thinking about it the implication of making it an offence punishable by fine or imprisonment if someone publishes a fact which is likely to embarrass. That is the extent to which a State parliament, with government instigation through its Lower House, went to suppress the rights of individuals in the South Australia community. I expressed at that time my great concern and took some little hand in having that Bill defeated. 1 expressed concern when the Labor Party talked in office of a Privacy Bill because of the actions of it colleagues in South Australia. I express my concern now that a Liberal administration talks of a Privacy Bill at a time when it members can involve themselves as I have listed at the beginning of my remarks. It would be a very strange and sorry thing if the left and right were to combine so vigorously- I refer to the South Australian Parliament and to the Liberal Administration here- in suppressing individual freedom. </para>
        <para>I would call on the Leader of the Government in the Senate to either substantiate his charges which I believe have embarrassed his own leader and have worried the public, particularly the Australian Broadcasting Commission's employees, or properly to withdraw them. By so doing he will be upholding the standards which his colleagues have set and which he so far has not upheld in this House. </para>

I draw the attention of the Senate, and in particular the attention of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> who represents the Minister for Primary Industry in this place, to the daily coalition administrative statement of 25 March which contains a Press release of 24 March concerned with the canned deciduous fruit industry report of the Australian Industry Development Corporation. At the outset let me say that it would have been much more helpful to the Senate had we had the summary of this report yesterday when we were debating the State Grants (Fruit Canneries) Bill 1976.I am concerned with the last paragraph of the Press release put out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> which states: </para>

            <para>Does the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications appreciate that in some areas of Adelaide within 4 miles of the General Post Office, Telecom Australia cannot provide new telephone services- even for urgent business purposes- within a period of one year or more? Does he consider that this is probably the worst record for connections in Australia? Can he ask his colleague in another place to take urgent steps to provide emergency support for Telecom 's operations in South Australia- from other States, if necessary? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Telecom Australia has advised that it is true that some applicants in relatively close suburbs of Adelaide have been waiting for a long time for telephone services. Urgent business services take a higher priority than non-business services but in areas where existing plant is fully occupied and requires large scale extension the priority allotted a particular application sometimes does not have significant effect. There are at present 3268 deferred applications in the Adelaide Telephone District. This results from record levels of demand in recent years and although there have been corresponding record levels of services provided, it has been impracticable to avoid the present large build-up of applications awaiting service. Very special measures are in train to recover the position including transfer of technical staff from Victoria and Tasmania and the allocation of additional funds for extra plant. It is planned to progressively eliminate currently deferred applications in the Adelaide suburbs and all those existing in December, 1975 will be cleared this year. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The letting of contracts by the Commonwealth generally follows a procedure of tendering, open on an Australia-wide basis. In relation to administrative services it is relevant that, on the Commonwealth's initiative, it is proposed to establish in Tasmania the Council for Inter-governmental Relations and the Australian Maritime College. </para>
            <para>The Administrative Review Committee's role is to report on means of improving Commonwealth/State administrative arrangements and the avoidance of unnecessary supervision, duplication and overlapping of activities, lt will he apparent, therefore, that the particular issues raised by the honourable senator are not central to the Committee 's tusk. I will nonetheless see that the Administrative Review Committee is aware of the honourable senator's comments so that where practicable they can take them into account in their work. </para>
