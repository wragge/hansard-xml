            <para>- The Government's policy is to investigate the voucher systems as they might apply or as they function throughout the world. That investigation has not yet commenced. 1 am unaware that in fact the voucher systems have failed overseas. I am aware that in certain cases there have been some considerable successes. As to their increasing inequality, the main claim that is made for the voucher system is that it establishes equality for all children throughout the community. Nevertheless, as yet we have nothing authoritative to report because we have not commenced the investigation. </para>

            <para>- I have not as yet read the report. I shall do so in detail at the earliest date and I shall discuss it with the Minister for Transport at the earliest date. Any suggestion of any threat to human health, in whatever degree and however minor might be the threat, is worth investigating. But I think that the problem must be put in perspective. A view is being put around that the introduction to commercial flying of Concorde aircraft raises a new factor in the world and a new threat to health. Nothing could be more wrong than this. For more than a decade now, and increasingly every day, supersonic aircraft in their hundreds are flying throughout the world, over all continents. It is well to keep in perspective that in Australia we have. 100 Mirage fighter aircraft and some 24 Fill fighter bomber aircraft, all of them supersonic, all of them flying at high altitudes and all of them, therefore, having a potential to affect the ozone by pollution. I want to draw the attention of honourable senators also to the fact that in western Europe- and no doubt in eastern Europe many hundreds of military aircraft, flying out of countries such as the United Kingdom, France etcetera, are flying inter continent ally continuously daily, and that the total of these and the total experience militarily day by day, week by week, over the years- and indeed over the decade- has been quite massive. I do not say that as any total - </para>

I said that if there is any possible threat, however minor, to the health of people it ought to be investigated. When the honourable senator interrupted I was about to say, as I had said, that we should put the matter in perspective- the half a dozen Concorde flights compared with the many thousands of daily military flights- but that we would have this matter investigated. I wanted to say that there was no new experience to the world in terms of potential threat to health in the flight of supersonic aircraft and that, in perspective, the military aircraft, if there is a threat, must constitute a much greater threat to the ozone. No suggestion of this has been raised. Of course we shall have the Senate committee's report examined, and shall have it examined by scientists. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs: Has the Department of Aboriginal Affairs sent telegrams in the last few days to all regional offices of the Department requesting information on the expenditure of Aboriginal organisations on items such as capital works, plant and equipment, wages, dwellings and contents, buildings and vehicles? Has the Department asked for a breakdown of wages in terms of Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal? is this breakdown in terms of white and black another step towards the cutting of Aboriginal staff and is the purpose of this exercise another money saving device? Can the Minister advise also if the result of this will be an attempt to bulk purchase on insurance for all Aboriginal organisations? </para>

            <para>- I am unaware of whether telegrams have been sent to regional offices requesting details of expenditure relating to capital works, plant and equipment, motor vehicles or anything of the nature that has been mentioned by the honourable senator. I think the assumptions that he has drawn from any such telegrams, if he has knowledge of them, could be inaccurate. It would be understood that a breakdown of expenditure at this time would be required for a variety of reasons. I shall check with the Minister as to whether such telegrams have been sent. It could be that in the normal course of departmental work information is required. I doubt very much whether any such information is required to do any of the things that were suggested in the question directed to me. </para>

            <para>- My recollection is that I did see some such comment arising out of the failure rates. I do not know the detail of it. My own Department and its subsidiaries- the Education Research and Development Committee, the Curriculum Development Committee and other elements of the Department- are enormously interested in all reports that come forward, including the Radford committee report and other material. We are particularly interested in matters of research which could identify reasons for matriculate not succeeding as they move further. To my knowledge, we have not been asked by the Queensland Government for assistance in relation to its own inquiry. We will be tremendously interested to watch the progress of any investigation that is made on this matter by the Queensland Government or any other government. I should add that I think it is timely, both in the States and in the Commonwealth, to open up one's mind from time to time to the whole question of the success or failure of our education systems at all levels and, I think the honourable senator will agree, to challenge existing beliefs and orthodoxies to see whether we can do better. In that regard, I certainly will be directing all elements of my Department and the commissions towards such evaluations. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister Assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs. Has the Minister's attention been drawn to the statements made by various State Premiers expressing concern at the Prime Minister's statement that State governments, as well as the Australian Government, have a responsibility to cut back public spending? When was that view first expressed to the State Premiers and does it not contradict the federalist policy of the Government? Is not the new policy an attack on the sovereignty and rights of States and why was this change of policy not raised first in the Senate, which is supposed to be the States House? Can the Minister inform me whether the same restriction is to apply also to local government and semi-government authorities, as it seems to represent an expression of centralist philosophies? </para>

            <para>- I have seen reports, but not actual statements by Premiers, suggesting that Premiers have some concern that the Commonwealth is asking for good housekeeping in all spheres of government in Australia. I would be surprised- nay, astonished- if there were any suggestion by even the Labor Party that a Commonwealth government at a time of economic stringency, at a time of severe inflation and unemployment, should not have the right and the duty to say to State governments and to local governments: 'It is your duty, equal with ours, to put your house in order, to get efficiencies, to cut out waste, to use your money to better advantage when the need for money is pressing upon all. ' Not only is this not against the federalism policies; it is fundamental to federalism that there should be teamwork, a working dialogue in all 3 spheres. It is fundamental that the Commonwealth should be inviting the States and local government to co-operate in economic management. If the honourable senator were to look at the Commonwealth's policy statement on federalism he would observe that we have said that it is the moral responsibility of all spheres of government to co-operate in the economic management of the country at a time when even the Australian Labor Party has agreed in a recent debate that there should be restraints on spending. Who more has a moral responsibility than the States and local government to look to saving costs, to eliminating duplication and to putting their money towards re-employment and the abatement of inflation. </para>

              <para>- I have a supplementary question. Of course, I do not have any disagreement with the statement that there should be good housekeeping at all levels of government but I do not think the Minister has properly replied to my question. Statements have been made by the Premiers of Queensland, New South Wales and Victoria regretting any suggestion that there should be cutbacks in public works and/or housing funds. That is an area on which I feel the Minister should give us a more definitive statement. </para>

              <para>- Last year I did not hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> suggest austerity when his own Government cut education programs by $ 105m and the Schools Commission program by $43 m. He sees austerity now where he saw great joy last year. The simple fact is that in the debate in recent days in this Senate all Labor senators admitted that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> 's doctrine last year was right- when you have an intolerable deficit you must cut it in half and cut $2,600m from it. The Federal Government is seeking to do that and to achieve good housekeeping throughout Australia. However, in doing that it has guaranteed the State governments a buoyant general purpose revenue and has guaranteed local government the most buoyant general purpose revenue it has ever had. So in those circumstances both State and local government have cause to be happy. </para>

            <para>-There were newspaper reports some weeks ago that there was to be a visit by a Japanese group. From my recollection it proposed to have discussions on this matter with the Premier of Western Australia. At that time the Commonwealth Government made it very clear to the Japanese Government that we would not receive a visit of such a mission and did not wish it to come to Australia. The Commonwealth Government maintains that position and does not withdraw from it. As to the other part of the honourable senator's question in respect of nuclear waste facilities, I point out to the Senate that in view of Australia's constitutional powers and responsibilities under the treaty on the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, any question relating to the establishment of nuclear waste facilities in Australia is a matter for the Commonwealth Government alone. Press reports in early June stated that the Japanese Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miki,</inline> had indicated that the Japanese Government was not giving any thought to nuclear waste facilities in Australia. I re-emphasise: Neither is the Commonwealth Government. </para>

Is the Minister able to advise whether there will be any sackings in connection with the new proposals which follow the announcement in January? In view of the fact that there have been complaints from the Department of Foreign Affairs and also, I see, from union delegations in relation to the statutory authority Telecom Australia that the present ceilings are hampering necessary developmental work, will the Minister consider holding discussions with staff associations in the same way as talks were consummated in February? </para>

            <para>-The procedures will be basically the same as those which occurred before. There will be no dismissals; there will be no sackings. Most likely, natural wastage through resignations and retirements will be sufficient to achieve the ceiling cuts. The honourable senator mentioned the Department of Foreign Affairs and Telecom Australia in particular. The Prime Minister has made it quite clear on a number of occasions, certainly to Ministers, that if there is any trouble in any department in providing services for the community we should come back and the ceiling will be reviewed. It is not the intention in imposing staff ceilings that any services to the community shall be disrupted or delayed, or be of less quality. As to consultations with staff organisations, I am quite certain that the Ministers for the departments concerned are always quite willing to see members of union staff associations or anybody connected with the particular departments. </para>

            <para>- My question which is directed to the Minister for Social Security follows an answer she gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> a few days ago on the telephone migrant interpreter service. What is the position regarding the use of this service? Has there been any growth in the use of the service since its inception? Are any recent statistics available which show the use made of the service, particularly in Adelaide? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Bishop</inline>asked me a question on this matter towards the end of last month. I am in the course of preparing a reply for him on some specific matters. In answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young's</inline> question today, I am able to give information. As at April this year, as far as Adelaide is concerned, there were 822 calls by users of the telephone interpreter service. In relation to the growth in the use of the service, there has been a change in the use of languages. For instance, in Adelaide there has been a growth in the use of the Italian language by migrants. This is not surprising when we know of the proportion of migrants of Italian origin who are in that city. For the information of honourable senators I have a table which shows statistics as at April this year. With the concurrence of honourable senators I am prepared to incorporate the table in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>-The answer to the honourable senator's question generally is yes. I noted with interest the report of the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment. The news report that I read this morning which connected the Concorde aircraft with any comments in the report seemed to me to be entirely inconsistent. I noted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> spoke on a radio broadcast this morning in an attempt to right that misunderstanding. Honourable senators would know that the Australian Academy of Science produced a report on climatic change in March of" this year. The comment made in that report certainly supports the honourable senator's view that there should be greater research into the upper atmosphere. The report makes the following comment on page 45 in relation to jet exhaust: </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The effects of stratospheric jet exhaust on ozone concentrations are still the subject of active investigation. Effects to date are certainly minor. The Academy has reported on this earlier. Its recommendations for stratospheric research and monitoring have now become more urgent due to the emergence of other dangers. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report indicates the greater danger of fluorocarbons. I believe that Australia, while maintaining its own climatic investigations, should become increasingly involved in international scientific programs aimed at measuring, monitoring and interpreting the characteristics of atmosphere, ozone and ice masses. I believe that this will follow in the early days ahead of us. </para>

Presumably, that means in the administrative field. In view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> undertaking, I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> that if it is good enough for the Commonwealth to give an undertaking that it will not dismiss members of the Commonwealth Public Service, presumably that same standard would apply to the State public services. Therefore, if the States are not expected to engage in dismissals of staff, can he indicate in what areas he anticipates the States are to reduce their expenditures? </para>

              <para>-One would think there might be a Premiers Conference coming up next Thursday which accounts for the restlessness of the natives. The situation is simply that the States are sovereign States within themselves. How they effect their good housekeeping is a matter for themselves. One would hope that they would give consideration to the maintenance of their permanent public service, which is a basic principle. All that the Commonwealth is doing is saying that the nation itself has a major economic management problem- I take it that that is not argued- and that each of the 3 spheres has a responsibility in that regard and should look to good housekeeping. How they achieve their good housekeeping is a matter for them. </para>

            <para>-Is the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry aware that in 1974 the Queensland Government sponsored an extensive research survey of the commercial fishing potential of the Torres Strait area at a cost of more than $250,000? Did the Queensland Government have this report classified as confidential in a deliberate attempt to conceal important information on the Torres Strait area at a time when the border question was under consideration? Is the Fisheries Division of the Australian Department of Primary Industry now engaged on a similar study? Is this study being unreasonably hampered by the non availability of the Queensland results? Will the Minister, in the interests of economy, suggest to his Queensland counterpart that the results of the State survey be made available to those with a legitimate research interest in the fisheries potential of the Torres Strait islands area? </para>

            <para>- I am quite sure that this unwarranted suggestion of a tribal war over fish in Queensland is very largely incorrect. What I would suggest to the honourable senator is that this is an appropriate question for the notice paper and an appropriate area for me to try to find out from the Minister whether what the honourable senator has said is correct. I think it is also worth recording that Australia does have a substantial resource of fish which could well be enlarged with the expansion of the opportunity if our sea zone expands. This is an area about which we ought to know a great deal more. Equally it would seem to me to be regrettable if areas of knowledge which are held in Australia are denied from one body to another. </para>

            <para>- I address a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I know that the Minister will be aware of some concern among chemists in relation to chemists' remunerations for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. I leave aside the proceedings that are currently before the courts. Has the Pharmacy Guild of Australia put proposals to the Government as to how it would see the determination of chemists' rates of remuneration, including professional fees, being carried out in the future, including a suggestion that these matters be decided by a fees tribunal or some other form of arbitration? Will the Government give consideration to the Guild 's proposals? </para>

            <para>- I am aware that the Pharmacy Guild has made representations to the Minister for Health with regard to the remuneration paid to its members for the supply of pharmaceutical benefits. Some of its recommendations already have been considered by the Government. It will be recalled that in April the Minister for Health, on behalf of the Government, made an offer to the Pharmacy Guild of an increase of 5c a prescription in chemists' professional fees retrospective to 1 July 1973 to wipe the slate clean for the past and to pave the way for agreement on a further review of chemists' remunerations. The Government was not prepared to take these matters to arbitration. The result of that was the Pharmacy Guild's taking out of a High Court writ against the Commonwealth to test the Government's powers to determine the chemists' rates. Nevertheless, in order to facilitate a review of chemists' remunerations in the future, on 2 1 April the Minister for Health invited Guild representatives to meet with the Government as soon as possible and to provide him with joint recommendations on several matters. Two meetings have been held- one on 19 May and one on 2 June. Consideration of these matters is continuing. I assume that the matters that have been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight</inline> in his question are the subject of discussion at the meetings that are being held. </para>

Under the Australian Assistance Plan such schemes as the handyman services for pensioners and the home help schemes organised with the Country Women's Association were established with very modest funding. Will the Minister reconsider Commonwealth Government involvement in such projects, now that they have been started, if the State governments prove unwilling to take up such financial commitments? </para>

            <para>- As far as the services that have been mentioned are concerned, I believe them to be very important indeed in giving independence to many older people who wish to remain in their own homes. I would be looking at those services, particularly the handyman services, as an alternative to aged persons homes and hostels in relation to the responsibilities of my Department. But, as far as the Australian Assistance Plan is concerned, the Minister concerned in the State of Victoria has already mentioned that he hopes further to develop the Plan. I assume that, in the way in which the Plan works, the services that have been of benefit to the community will be continued by the State Government. It will be understood that for the next 12 months we will be funding those officers involved in the Australian Assistance Plan and the transition to the State Government is one matter which 1 am sure will have the attention it deserves. </para>

I have taken the view- I am sure that my Government also takes the view- that the question of the need for teachers in a particular State is one for the State government concerned since, I think everyone must agree, sovereignty regarding primary and secondary education in Australia lies with the State governments. Therefore, it is for the Victorian State Government to make a value judgment as to whether there is a need for these teachers, particularly in terms of special ties and mobility. Apparently there is some demonstration of the fact that although there are some unemployed teachers in that State, they are neither willing to be mobile nor able to be specialists. </para>

          <para>In my judgment it would not be a proper thing for the Commonwealth Government to use a visa system to override the States. A visa should not be, and I hope will not be, a political policy weapon. A visa gives a right of entry for a decent wholesome person to this country. The question of whether that person ought to be brought to this country depends upon the State Government of Victoria and not upon some punitive weapon concerning a visa. Of course, I will transmit to my colleague in Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lindsay</inline> Thompson, the substance of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer's</inline> remarks. It would not be our intention, as I understand it, to use visas for punitive purposes. </para>

            <para>-Senator Steele Hall raised with me some weeks ago a question concerning the Government's policy in providing funds to non-government tertiary institutions. In fact, he drew my attention to one specific institution. I made it clear to the Senate at that stage that this Government, faced with the position, as the previous Government was, of placing limitations on the amount of money available for various programs of education, had placed a limitation on the program to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Steele</inline> Hall has referred and advised all non government tertiary institutions, before December of last year and before the recruitment of students for this year, that the amount of money available to them for this calendar year would be the same as the amount available last year and no greater. They were given a guarantee that they would get the same amount of money but no escalation in the amount of money. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The question of how an institution should use the money depends entirely upon the policy of the institution and its policy for the recruitment of students. Clearly, if" an institution saw fit to maintain the same number of students as last year, no problem would exist as to the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amount per student. But if an institution saw fit to recruit substantially more students, the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> amount per student would decline. That in fact occurred in the institution concerned. Due to economic stringencies my Government has found it necessary to maintain those ceilings. I have checked and found that there was an unequivocal statement to all such institutions that the quantum of money would be available. If there is less money available per student that arises out of the private policies of the individual institutions in their recruitment of the number of students. I am afraid that I cannot offer or foreshadow relief for that situation in the future. </para>

              <para>-I repeat: The Minister will recall that the constant theme of Liberal criticism of the Whitlam Government last year and indeed this year has been that it was prodigal in the expenditure of public moneys. Yet this morning, in answer to a question the Minister was at pains, as he is almost every day in answers to questions and in debates generally, to point to cuts in public expenditure introduced by the Hayden Budget and use these cuts as justification for cuts in public expenditure by his Government. Will the Minister tell us what his charge is against the Whitlam Government? Is it that it was too prodigal with public funds or that it set an example of responsible public expenditure to his Government? </para>

              <para>-Is it not strange that as soon as 'the truth is revealed the natives get angry, restless and irritable? The simple fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland asked me a question concerning the difference between the 2 Governments. The difference is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> diagnosed the problem and then did not cure it. He said that a Budget deficit of $5,000m would cripple the community. He said that it must be cut by half otherwise it would cause grave inflation and unemployment. He did not cut it, and the Budget deficit, when we inherited it, was about $5,000m. The difference is that we have set out to cut expenditure. I have pointed to a number of cuts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland acknowledges these. The other night in debate he acknowledged that it was proper for a government facing a deficit to make substantial cuts, so we are as one on this. </para>

            <para>- If the honourable senator had read the report from the Commonwealth Grants Commission which was tabled in this Senate some days ago he would have found a considerable amount of information to his advantage. What happened is that this Government went to the people of Australia on a federalist policy that was adopted. Included in that policy was in fact a parallel series of policies to those of the local government associations of Australia, which asked that there ought to be a growth revenue supplementary to rating revenues for local government. We said that we would do this and give a percentage of personal income tax and that it would have 2 characteristics part of it <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> to all municipalities and shires and part of it equalisation. It is no centralist thing to say that we will give a supplementary revenue to another sphere of government. </para>

              <para>- Because there have been some interjections I shall repeat what I said. We are relating the quantum of money to the amount that the Commonwealth Grants Commission gave last year in untied grants. Does anybody in the Labor Party deny that those grants totalled $79.9m? The answer is no. We are relating an amount of $ 140m as the parallel of money to be passed to the States and Grants Commission in untied grants. That is 75 per cent more than last year. There is no fraud whatever. All the cards are on the table. The Premiers Conference at its last meeting discussed the percentage by which the money should be divided as between <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> and equalisation. Lest anyone think it is centralist, for the first time the 6 Premiers were invited to give their views. A quaint thing is that the Labor Premiers said: 'This is the first time we have ever been asked our views on anything'. So rather than being centralist, it was federalist. We said we would ask the Grants Commission to give a viewpoint on this, and the Grants Commission has done so. We said it may be that there could be variations between States; we may put a minimum on the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant and have the States vary it. I am aware that the local Government Association in Western Australia has agreed with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court on what ought to be the percentage of local government grant <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline> So in what he is saying, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court has the full support of the Local Government Association in Western Australia, which I visited last week. </para>

              <para>- What I said, and it was a direct answer, was that the Premiers had had a discussion. The general tenor of the Premiers' discussion at the Premiers Conference in April was that there would be differences between the States as to the percentage <inline font-style="italic">per capita.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court had asked for a high <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> rate. The Local Government Association in Western Australia supports <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court in the precise percentage. It told me so at first hand last weekend. The matter is to be determined next Thursday. There is a general view, and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court would be right in interpreting it, that there might well be freedom by the individual States to increase the <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> rate. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court said that, he was reflecting what the Premiers Conference said and was reflecting what the honourable senator from Western Australia apparently is opposed to, that is, the policy of the Local Government Association in his State. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and relates to the additional charges for priority paid mail, particularly priority paid mail to members of Parliament while they are in Canberra. Is the Minister aware that if an article is sent priority paid it is supposed to be delivered as soon as practicable after arrival? That is not quite the case here in Parliament House. An article could arrive in Canberra by 9.30 in the morning and sit at the Canberra Post Office until the mail is collected again at 2 o'clock. As additional charges have been paid, and as that service would have been made available normally by ordinary air mail, will the Minister examine the situation and see whether priority paid mail could be hand delivered by the post office in Canberra? </para>

It has come to my notice that out of the Supreme Court of Tasmania Hobart Registry in the month of May, 302 writs have been issued by the Commissioner of Taxation for collection of tax. It also has come to my notice that there is a feeling that the demands for collection are unduly severe and abrupt. Can the Minister assure me that no special instructions have been given for that sort of action, and that reasonable business cooperation will be extended by the Commissioner of Taxation as we would expect of other creditors, that is to say, due payment in the ordinary course of business? Will he also ascertain how many writs for the collection of income tax have been issued over the last 3 years out of that registry in the month of May so that I can make a comparison of the annual performance? </para>

I do not suppose that the honourable senator would have available for me afterwards a dissection showing whether these are summonses based against corporations or against people because some extensions of time were given for company tax payment. It is the normal rule that tax is due to be paid before the end of June in most cases. This represents either extra amounts to be paid under the pay as you earn system or corporation tax in respect of which there has been a relaxation. It is my understanding that in bona fide cases the Commissioner has a discretion and an ability to help people where it is justified that they should be helped. If there has been a departure in practice or instruction one would like to know about it and I am glad to have had the matter drawn to my attention, and that of the Treasurer. </para>

            <para>-On 28 April <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> asked me for details of the cost of inquiries established by the present Government. In addition during the sittings of Estimates Committee A I gave an undertaking to provide the most up-to-date cost of royal commissions and similar inquiries established by the previous Government which come within the administration of the Department of Administrative Services. I have obtained what information I could get up till today. I do not say that it is complete because some of these commissions are still sitting. As further information comes to hand I will produce it in the Senate. The information concerned consists of tables of figures. Therefore I ask leave to incorporate the tables in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

              <para>-I think that I should explain to honourable senators the reason for tabling these transcripts of public evidence which the Committee took and authorised at the time to be published. I do this not as the  Chairman  of a now defunct Committee of the Parliament but as a private senator who feels that this publicly available evidence should be drawn to the attention of the Parliament. When the report of the Joint Committee was tabled last week, a limited number of copies was available for circulation to senators and members. There has been considerable discussion of the report, discussion which I hope will be facilitated by a wide distribution of the report within the next 2 weeks and the availability of the transcript of evidence at the same time. Copies of the transcripts are available in the Senate Records Office and the Parliamentary Library. I shall address myself to that in a moment. Only a limited number is available at present but copies will be circulated to every senator, I hope prior to the resumption of the sittings next August. </para>

          <para>I have not asked for leave to move for the printing of the report because this would cost a considerable sum of money and I think would attract frowns from the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> We will use the domestic reproducing systems of both Houses of the Parliament to produce a limited number of the transcripts. I hope that at least a set may be available for the members of the committee that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has appointed so that they can sail some uncharted seas with some of the evidence taken by a prior committee at their disposal. </para>

            <para>- I feel obliged, in the way <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack felt obliged, to nave the evidence of this Committee tabled. The Committee is now defunct. It ceased its hearings at the prorogation of the last Parliament. A large amount of evidence was taken by that Committee and that evidence, which I trust will be tabled, will assist considerably in their deliberations those who are at present engaged in preparing legislation of a similar nature and legislation to cover companies within Australia. A considerable amount of effort was put into the submissions to the Committee. Many of them were quite substantial. It is proper that the authors of those submissions have their work recognised and made available to other interested parties. This includes quite a few academics investigating in this field. To assist these people, the Committee secretariat has prepared a 43-page index of comments on the Committee's terms of reference and the clauses of the Bill. This index as well as an alphabetical index appears in the front of the first of the 14 volumes to be tabled. It can therefore be made available to those working in this field. We would be doing a disservice if this evidence was not tabled. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue><para>Despite the fact that the Committee's work was not completed, it had achieved the purpose of allowing a large number of organisations and individuals to express their views on the proposed securities legislation. The Attorney-General's Department followed the work of the Committee very closely. Those people who may be responsible for the drafting of any new legislation affecting this area will be well informed of the views of interested organisations as well as the views of senators who served on the Committee. Members of the Committee became more familiar with the various aspects associated with the introduction of uniform securities and corporations law at the national level. This will lead to a more informed debate and the saving of time if and when future securities legislation reaches the Senate. </para><para>May I say briefly that committees of the Senate have been looking at the securities industry closely for over 7 years now. Some recognition must be given to those who took part in that investigation. It must be understood that senators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack, Senator Rae</inline> and senators on this side of the chamber in that period became most expert in the workings and very much aware of the needs of the securities industry. For that reason, it would be unfair not to recognise that work and it would be unfair also for the Government not to recognise this fact and not to take advantage of the expertise of these people in the Senate. </para><para>I merely mention that it would be of great advantage to the Government,, which is now again preparing legislation in this field after this lengthy period, to recognise that there is this expertise in the Senate and to acknowledge that any legislation that is proposed should come under some scrutiny by those members of the Senate who, in my experience, would have as much knowledge as most other people in the industry in this very complex area. </para><para>In particular, I wish to give recognition to the following members of this Committee: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drury</inline> from South Australia who has retired from the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack, Senator Greenwood, Senator Walsh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I pay tribute also to the staff of the Committee, including the Secretary, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ducker,</inline> and the research officers, Messrs Mackey, Starr and Overton. The Committee achieved indirectly great advances in the securities industry. But the </para><para class="block">Committee was achieving something more. I believe that towards the end it was achieving success in clearing the maze of legislation which attempts to supervise the securities market. I think the Committee was very much aware of the necessity not to over-regulate the industry. I must admit that some members of the Committee are smiling rather wryly at the fact that the States, and interests within the States that endeavoured to frustrate this legislation, now find themselves caught with legislation far more restrictive and regulations far more complex than perhaps the Committee of the Senate would have recommended. </para><para>The views of the Committee I, of course, cannot express. But my own views are that the securities industry does need to be regulated and that legislation needs to be brought forward as promptly as possible as the delays have been far too great, but that in the interests of the industry itself one should take care that the legislation which comes forward to control or to supervise the securities market and the companies market should not to the disadvantage of the industry; rather it should be to its advantage.

          <para class="block">This Bill will give effect to the Government's decision, as announced by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> on 2 February 1 976, to abolish the Social Welfare Commission. In reviewing the activities of over 50 bodies of various kinds which had been conducting inquiries for the Commonwealth, the Prime Minister said:  the Government has decided that the Social Welfare Commission and the Australian Housing Corporation, should be abolished while the functions of the Australian Development Assistance Agency and the Road Safety and Standards Authority should be taken over by Government Departments. The Government has taken these decisions on the basis that the functions of the four bodies concerned can be carried out more efficiently and cheaply and more properly under Ministerial and Parliamentary control if conducted within a departmental framework. </para>
          <para class="block">The Social Welfare Commission was established as an Interim Committee by the Labor Government in early 1973, and the Social Welfare Commission Act received the royal assent in November of that year. In reaching its decision about the Social Welfare Commission the present Government was mindful of the fact that in June 1975 the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> had announced the Labor Government's intention to abolish the Commission. </para>
          <para>It is clear to the Government that the Social Welfare Commission is not required in a situation in which the Government, through its Ministers, will be determining priorities and maintaining direct communication on social welfare issues with State, local government and voluntary agencies and representatives of consumer groups. For example, there are many voluntary welfare organisations which are playing an important role in commenting on the formulation of social welfare policy. The Government will continue assistance to voluntary bodies and aim to upgrade mechanisms of communication with such groups in the voluntary sector. I will say a little more about our plans for improved consultation with the voluntary welfare sector in a few moments. </para>
          <para>Funds are made available through my Department to three of the larger national voluntary organisations each year. The Australian Council of Social Service, ACOSS, the Australian Council on the Ageing, ACOTA, and the Australian Council for the Rehabilitation of the Disabled, ACROD, will receive in 1976-77 grants totalling $450,000. In addition to the funding of these national bodies the Government supports a variety of other organisations in the welfare field. For example, grants paid through my Department this year to the Good Neighbour Councils alone will  total  1.037m. </para>
          <para>The Social Welfare Commission did not directly administer any Commonwealth welfare programs. This is the role of the Department of Social Security and other relevant departments of State, which are under direct ministerial control. The Government fully recognises the importance of social welfare in the life of the Australian community. Accordingly, in order to ensure that adequate data is available for policy and planning purposes and that the best use is made of available resources, it is proposed to establish a social welfare research centre within the University of New South Wales. Preliminary negotiations have already taken place with the University which, since 1972, has had a family research unit funded through the Department of Social Security. Further details regarding the proposed centre will be announced in the near future. </para>
          <para>As mentioned earlier, the Government is taking steps to fulfil its commitment to provide effective mechanisms for co-operation and interchange of ideas with interested groups in the social welfare field. A national consultative group on social welfare is to be established to meet with me and my officers to discuss and advise on current issues in social welfare which come within the responsibility of the Commonwealth Government. Matters such as gaps and deficiencies in programs, arrangements for service delivery, assessment and review of priorities, and the modification of programs in the light of research findings, changing needs and social and economic conditions will be among those on which I will consult with the group. </para>
          <para>I envisage that the consultative group will have a membership of about 12 people comprising academics from relevant disciplines and other suitably qualified people active in the social welfare field, together with possibly one or two distinguished people with appropriate experience. It will include representatives of national welfare bodies and voluntary social welfare agencies, and will be serviced by the Department of Social Security. In establishing the consultative group the Government will ensure that there is no overlap or duplication between it and the more specialised advisory bodies such as the National Advisory Council for the Handicapped. </para>
          <para>The basic welfare needs and problems of people are, in the main, similar throughout Australia but there are differences between States and, indeed, within the States. It is accordingly proposed to establish a social welfare consultative committee in each State. These committees will provide an input, in relation to the situation of people in each State, on problems or difficulties encountered in the administration of Commonwealth social security or social welfare programs at the State level. Arrangements are also being made to develop regular consultation between the Department of Social Security and organisations representative of women's interests. This will ensure that the very valuable contribution which these groups can make in relation to the special needs of women is available to the Government in formulating its social welfare policies. </para>
          <para>Further details of the consultative mechanisms proposed will be announced shortly, but at this stage I can assure honourable senators that our proposals will greatly strengthen our links with people and groups active in the welfare field. In addition to my Department's continuing involvement in income security issues, routine monitoring and evaluation of welfare programs are being developed and upgraded within the Social Welfare Division of the Department. A variety of case-study, survey, experimental and cost analytic techniques will be utilised to augment regular program monitoring. This will be particularly relevant in the introduction of new programs and the review of existing programs. </para>
          <para>More specialised evaluations are also conducted within the Department. An example of such an evaluation is the cost-benefit survey of the Australian Government Rehabilitation Service which was conducted over 5 years and reported on in 1975. Findings from studies such as these provide essential information for the formulation and development of policies and programs. The importance of independent evaluations conducted outside the Department, supplementary to departmental evaluation and monitoring, is recognised and will be supported. Such evaluations have been conducted in respect of departmental programs. For example, in a pilot program 2 work preparation centres for the mildly mentally retarded are being evaluated over a 3 year period by Macquarie University in Sydney and Monash University in Melbourne. </para>
          <para>The Government will continue to' support independent inquiries which examine various aspects of the social welfare field. These inquiries, of which the Poverty Inquiry and the National Superannuation Committee of Inquiry are examples, are particularly important in contributing to the development of social welfare policy. Honourable senators will recall that in 1972 the Liberal/Country Party Government commissioned, with the support of the State Ministers responsible for child and social welfare, a family research project within the University of New South Wales to undertake a series of studies directed towards understanding and documenting family disruption and breakdown and changing family patterns in Australia. I have given undertakings in the Parliament that an examination would be made of activities of the Social Welfare Commission to ascertain the extent to which existing research projects and tasks would be continued. </para>
          <para>I have already announced the Government's approval for the continuation of research projects initiated by the Commission and being undertaken by outside bodies and institutions. On abolition of the Commission these projects will be administered by the Department of Social Security. We have also agreed to the funding of two additional research projects and four fellowships in welfare studies. Two major areas into which a number of these projects have a substantial input are the development of services relating to families and social welfare manpower planning. In reference to the former, wide ranging research is being conducted on family services in each State and the Territories, to ascertain current and future service needs of families in Australia. These studies are complementary to the work of the Commission's Family Services Committee on which is represented relevant departments at Federal and State levels, and the voluntary welfare sector. The Family Services Committee will continue in order to complete a major report in this area during 1 976-77. </para>
          <para>In relation to social welfare manpower planning, present statistics concerning the workforce in the welfare field are not satisfactory. A continuing study of the changing roles of existing workers and the emergence of new needs in the community requiring new types of personnel, both professional and voluntary, is necessary. This work will be undertaken within the Department of Social Security. The meeting of State Social Welfare Ministers held in Darwin on 2 1 May 1976 identified social welfare manpower planning as of vital importance and I have agreed to the Minister's request that the work initiated by the Social Welfare Commission in this area be continued, with more direct involvement of the States as they are major users of welfare manpower. Investigation will continue on the need for a national body to co-ordinate education in social welfare in Australia. This study is seeking information from a wide range of interests, including tertiary institutions, employers, practitioners in the field, professional associations, voluntary organisations and industrial groups. </para>
          <para>At the Darwin conference of Ministers there was also strong support for standardisation of social welfare statistics. It was noted that there was great difficulty in arriving at priorities in social welfare or making any meaningful comparisons of welfare programs without having an adequate data base. I have agreed that the Department of Social Security should undertake work immediately in this area seeking the cooperation of the Australian Bureau of Statistics in setting up a working party, comprising representatives of relevant Commonwealth and State Government, departments, to examine questions of the standardisation and adequacy of social welfare statistics and the desirability of convening a national conference on these matters. </para>
          <para>Members of the staff of the Social Welfare Commission now occupy Public Service Act positions which are included on the establishment of the Department of Social Security. Action will be taken to transfer Commission staff to the unattached list of the Department on repeal of the Social Welfare Commission Act. Some officers will be used in activities, such as administering research projects and fellowship awards, servicing the Family Services Committee and undertaking work in the area of social welfare manpower planning, responsibility for which will be absorbed by the Department. Others will be involved in other ongoing tasks in the Department of Social Security, either associated with former responsibilities of the Commission or with other responsibilities of the Department. A number of officers have already left the Commission; of those remaining some will be absorbed in the Department of Social Security, some will obtain positions in other Commonwealth departments, and some will seek employment outside the Australian Public Service. </para>
          <para>The Government is mindful of the work which the Social Welfare Commission has undertaken but, for the reasons I have outlined, it is now considered opportune to consolidate advice on and research into social welfare matters within the appropriate departmental structures. As I have already indicated, consideration has been given to the existing commitments of the Commission so that wind-up action can proceed in an orderly and efficient manner. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to make amendments to the Family Law Act 1975. Honourable senators will be aware that the Family Law Act has replaced the old divorce, maintenance, custody and property laws contained in the Matrimonial Causes Act and to some extent in State and Territory legislation, and that it came into operation on 5 January this year. Honourable senators will also doubtless be aware that the basic provisions of the Act were subsequently challenged in the High Court which, on 1 1 May, delivered judgment substantially affirming the validity of the provisions. </para>
          <para>While decision was substantially favourable to the Act- and was welcomed by the Governmentthe limited extent to which the Court held it to be beyond power does give rise to problems. I refer to the decision that, in the case of custody of children, the Act was valid only to the extent that it applied to proceedings between the parties to a marriage for the custody of the natural or adopted children of both of them. This means that disputes between one party to a marriage and, say, a grandparent of a child of the marriage would fall outside the jurisdiction of the Act and would therefore have to be resolved according to relevant State law. Likewise disputes between a husband and wife over a stepchild would be outside the Act. </para>
          <para>In the case of matrimonial property, the High Court held that the Act is valid only where the property proceedings are related to pending or completed proceedings between the parties for divorce or other principal relief. Here again, the jurisdiction over resolution of disputes is therefore divided between the Act and the relevant State law. </para>
          <para>A further regrettable consequence of the decision as to the  Emits  of jurisdiction under the Act is that the jurisdiction of the Family Court of Australia, a federal court created by the Act, is limited to the same degree. This means that a person who has taken proceedings under the Family Law Act in the Family Court, only to find that his case is beyond the limits of the jurisdiction under the Act, would have to start again in the appropriate State court under the relevant State legislation. It will be seen that the High Court decision has meant that the concept of a Family Court able to deal with matters relating to family law cannot be realised under a law of this Parliament. Under present constitutional limitations, this concept can only be realised through a system of State Family Courts exercising State and federal jurisdiction covering the whole area of family law. </para>
          <para>One of the main purposes of the Bill now before the Senate is to amend the Act so as to bring it into line with the decision of the High Court. The definition of matrimonial cause in section 4, which governs the extent of jurisdiction created by the Act, has been narrowed in the areas of custody and property to the degree called for by the decision. In the areas of maintenance and injunctions, the definition has been confined to proceedings between the parties and, in the case of maintenance of a child, to proceedings by or on behalf of a child against one or both parents. The expression child of a marriage has been limited to the natural or adopted children of both parties to the marriage, although the existing, wider meaning has been retained for the purposes of section 63- which prevents a divorce becoming absolute unless the court is satisfied as to the welfare of children of the marriage. </para>
          <para>The Attorney-General is concerned at the difficulties and hardships that may be encountered by people as a result of the incomplete extent of the jurisdiction under the Act in the areas of custody and matrimonial property. He therefore proposes to raise these matters with the States at the next meeting of the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General arranged for later this month. The Standing Committee is already examining proposals for uniform matrimonial property laws amongst the States and Territories, and the Attorney-General hopes that it will be able to come up with some firm proposals in the light of the High Court's decision. As far as custody is concerned, the problem of the disputes beyond the reach of the Family Law Act is part of a wider need for uniform State and Territory laws as to custody, including custody and rights of ex-nuptial children. All these are matters on which there should be uniformity of law as far as possible. Being fairly clearly beyond the power of the Commonwealth, they should desirably be the subject of a uniform approach by the States. </para>
          <para>Before leaving the decision of the High Court, I should mention that section 97(1), which requires proceedings under the Act to be held in closed court, was held to be invalid so far as it purported to apply to State Courts when exercising jurisdiction under the Act. The clear policy of Parliament, as expressed in section 97 ( 1 ), was that proceedings under the Act should be in closed court. As the High Court decision means that the closing of State courts when exercising federal jurisdiction is a matter for State law, the adoption of the principles of section 97 (1), so far as closing their courts when exercising jurisdiction under the Family Law Act is concerned, is a matter for the States. Although the jurisdiction pf the State Supreme Courts over new proceedings under the Act has now been terminated- at the request of the States- State courts of summary jurisdiction are expected to continue to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Family Court for some time to come. In the meantime, section 97 will remain unaltered, so that proceedings before the Family Court of Australia will continue to be in closed court. </para>
          <para>The remainder of the amendments are mainly of a formal nature, with a few being of substance. None alters any of the main principles of the Act. For the benefit of new senators, I mention that these principles were debated at great length in both Houses of the last Parliament, and the Bill was extensively amended before being finally approved by a free vote of members on all sides. These remaining amendments include some that were foreshadowed, but not moved, by the Attorney-General in the previous Government during the debate on the Bill, and others for which the need has been disclosed by experience with the administration of the Act since its commencement. They amount to a miscellaneous collection, which I can best deal with in a general way by taking them in broad categories. Each of the amendments is explained briefly in the explanatory memorandum circulated in the Senate with the Bill, and can be further clarified in the committee stage if necessary. </para>
          <para>One category comprises amendments included to ensure that State Family Courts established pursuant to section 41 of the Act can operate on the same basis as the Family Court of Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">In the grafting-on of the provisions for State Family Courts to the Family Law Bill during its passage through Parliament, a few oversights and omissions occurred which this Bill seeks to remedy. For instance, the Bill provides for transfers of proceedings from a Supreme Court to a State Family Court in the same way as the Act now provides for transfers to the Family Court of Australia. An omission in the provisions of the Act governing appeals from State Family Courts is also dealt with. </para>
          <para>After Western Australia decided to establish its State Family Court, it became apparent that it would be preferable for the Court to have its own counselling staff rather than use that of the Family Court of Australia, as envisaged by section 4 1 of the Act. The Bill includes amendments to ensure that this can be achieved. At the request of Western Australia, a provision of the Bill will permit one person to hold simultaneously the offices of Judge of a State Family Court and Judge of the Family Court of Australia. Having in mind that double judicial commissions are not usually encouraged, the Attorney-General has given careful consideration to this matter and has accepted the Western Australian view that the holding by one person of commissions in both courts could be desirable in the special circumstances of this case. </para>
          <para>The Bill also includes some amendments to the transitional provisions of the Act, which provide for the disposal of proceedings that were pending when the Act came into operation. In the case of pending divorce proceedings that have been continued under the repealed Matrimonial Causes Act, as permitted by the new Act, some uncertainty has arisen as to whether decrees granted after 5 January become absolute in 3 months, as under the old Act, or in 1 month, as under the new Act. The Bill seeks to make it clear that such decrees become absolute in the shorter period, consistently with decrees that had been granted but had not become absolute on 5 January. Also, the right to apply to have pending divorce proceedings dealt with under the new Act on the no-fault ground is extended to either party, provided they have been separated for the required period. At the moment the right is restricted to a petitioner or cross-petitioner. </para>
          <para>The Bill contains some amendments to make the maintenance and custody provisions more effective. One amendment will enable an authority or officer of the Commonwealth or a State to take proceedings to obtain a maintenance order on behalf of a party or child. This would make sure, for example, that the Department for Community Welfare in South Australia may continue to take maintenance proceedings on behalf of persons to whom it pays pensions. The amendment will correspond to section 106 (b) of the Act, which enables proceedings for enforcement of maintenance orders to be taken on behalf of persons entitled to moneys under them. I might add that section 106 (b) has itself been redrafted as a formal amendment. The substance of the provision remains unchanged. </para>
          <para>Other amendments made by the Bill are designed to clarify the powers of a person to whom a warrant is addressed to enforce a custody or access order. Doubts have been raised as to the extent of these powers, and the amendments spell out the powers under a court order that may be exercised, where necessary, to search places and to use force to take possession of a child. </para>
          <para>Two amendments in the child welfare area have been included in the Bill at the request of the former New South Wales Government. One of these ensures that a child who is under the guardianship of a State or Territory Director of Child Welfare while awaiting adoption cannot be the subject of a maintenance or custody order except in special circumstances. At present the Act confines this exemption to children who are under the care and control of a Minister pursuant to State or Territory child welfare legislation. The other amendment would take away the jurisdiction that a court now has under the Act to order the continuance of a custody or access order relating to a child after the child has been adopted. </para>
          <para>By an oversight when the original Bill was being amended during its passage through Parliament, provision was not included to enable appeals to be taken from Territory Supreme Courts to the Full Court of the Family Court, which is the court of appeal from State Supreme Courts under the Act. The only avenue of appeal from Territory Supreme Courts is therefore to the High Court. An amendment in the Bill provides for appeals from Territory Supreme Courts to the Full Court of the Family Court. To facilitate the determination of questions of law by the Full Court of the Family Court, a provision has been inserted to enable such questions that arise in any proceedings before the Family Court to be referred by way of a case stated procedure to the Full Court. An authoritative decision of the Full Court could thus be obtained without the need for a full scale appeal. </para>
          <para>The remaining amendments in the Bill are consequential upon those already referred to, are relatively insubstantial or are of a formal drafting nature. Honourable senators will recognise the need to remedy promptly any defects in an area of law that is so important to so many people in the community as this law obviously is. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">This Bill provides for the validation until 31 December 1976 of duties collected in pursuance of Customs Tariff Proposals Nos 7 to 13 introduced into the Parliament during this session and not enacted to date. The Bill is essentially a holding measure pending the introduction, anticipated for the Budget Session, of a Customs Tariff Amendment Bill to enact the tariff changes contained in the Proposals. I commend the Bill. I suggest that perhaps the Bill could go straight through its remaining stages. </para>

          <para class="block">Honourable senators on this side of the House will know that the aim of the Government, and a clear commitment in our election policy announcements, is to bring the Northern Territory to ultimate Statehood. This aim was reflected in the Governor-General's speech on 17 February last, in the following words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In line with its policy of developing governmental authority, the Government will progressively act to confer executive responsibility on the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory with the objective of advancing the Territory to Statehood. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Northern Territory is poised on the threshold of an important period in its history. The Territory's resources- particularly its minerals- are only just beginning to be tapped in a major way. In 1974-75, for example, mineral output was valued at $140m, an increase of 75 per cent over that of 1972-73. The more important minerals produced are manganese, gold, copper, bauxite and alumina and bismuth. Its uranium reserves are of world significance, as also is the McArthur River lead zinc deposit. Oil has been discovered in the Greenie Basin and offshore exploration is continuing. Mineral output from the Territory will become an important factor in the nation's trading position during the 1980s. </para>
          <para>In many ways, the Territory is in a position not dissimilar to that of several of the Australian States (or Colonies as they then were) in the latter half of the nineteenth century. Its population is now of the order of 100 000, including about 25 000 Aboriginal people. This population constitutes something less than 1 per cent of the total Australian population but those people inhabit approximately 17 per cent of the total Australian land mass. It is worth noting, that the State of Queensland, when it attained responsible government in 1859, had a population of a little over 30 000. South Australia had approximately 85 000, and Tasmania 81 000 inhabitants when they were granted responsible Government in 1856. </para>
          <para>The unique nature of the Territory's physical environment has bred in, or attracted to it, a special kind of people. Despite many hardships and disappointments they have established themselves and their families in the Territory on rural properties, isolated settlements and towns of great character and vitality. With its known natural resources guaranteeing it a secure economic base, allied with the strength, resourcefulness and initiative of its people and under the guiding hand of the Territory's own fully elected legislature, the future of the Territory must surely be bright. </para>
          <para>As promised, this Government, immediately on being elected, began moves towards executive responsibility for the Legislative Assembly based on the recommendations of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Constitutional Development of the Northern Territory- recommendations which were available to the previous government for twelve months. That report, which was presented to the Parliament by the honourable member for Hunter, as  Chairman  of the Committee, has made a valuable contribution to the Territory's constitutional development. The Government will continue to have regard to many of the Committee's recommendations as we proceed with the devolution of executive autonomy. </para>
          <para>Our immediate aim is the transfer of executive responsibility for the Northern Territory Public Service and a large number of Northern Territory statutory authorities, broadly along the lines suggested in the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee. Since this Government took office, a number of discussions have been held with members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on the transfer of executive responsibility. A Consultative Committee, consisting of the Minister for the Northern Territory and Members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, has been established to consider the issues involved in the transfer of executive powers. As the first step in this process, I have reached accord with the Executive of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly that the Northern Territory (Administration) Act be amended along the lines set down in this Bill. The provisions in the Bill are designed to enable the Government to progressively transfer administrative responsibility to a Northern Territory executive. </para>
          <para>I want to emphasise that the passage of this Bill will represent one of the most significant events in the Northern Territory's history. Whilst I welcome the action taken in 1 974 to establish a fully elected Legislative Assembly, there was little point in bringing that about without the transfer to the Assembly of real powers and responsibilities. Indeed, the previous Government promised that not only would a fully elected Legislative Assembly be established for the Territory, it also promised increasing autonomy to the Territory through that Assembly. However, when the ALP was absolutely rejected by Northern Territory electors, the promises and assurances where speedily forgotten and the Assembly ignored. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the Bill. As I have said, it is directed principally at making the legislative changes necessary to facilitate the progressive transfer of executive responsibility to the Legislative Assembly for the Northern Territory by amending the Northern Territory (Administration) Act 1910-1974. </para>
          <para class="block">Clauses 1 and 2 </para>
          <para class="block">These are formal provisions and cover citation and commencement. The Bill is to come into operation on a date to be fixed by Proclamation. </para>
          <para class="block">Clauses  3, 4  and  5 </para>
          <para class="block">These are interpretive and technical and insert additional definitions and revise the headings to parts II and IV of the Principal Act. </para>
          <para class="block">Clause 6 </para>
          <para class="block">This repeals sections  4ZA  and  4ZB  of the Principal Act dealing with the Administrator's Council, its composition, appointments thereto and its functions. It renames the Council as the Executive Council of the Northern Territory of Australia, lays down its membership and provides for its procedures. It enables the Administrator to attend all meetings of the Council and to preside at meetings at which he is present. The clause sets down consequential interpretive provisions. </para>
          <para class="block">Clause 7 </para>
          <para class="block">This inserts a new Part in the Principal Act enabling the Administrator, after consultation with the Minister, to determine the number of offices of executive member of the Legislative Assembly and their respective designations. It further enables the Administrator, after consultation with the Minister, to determine the matters in respect of which the holder of an executive office performs his functions as executive member. Those matters will be all matters arising under specified laws of the Territory- other than Commonwealth laws- and matters to which the function of a specified Department of the Public Service of the Territory relate. Determinations by the Administrator under this Part are to be published in the Government Gazette of the Territory. This Part further establishes the functions of an executive member as being to assist in the administration of the Government of the Territory with respect to the matters within his control but subject to the directions (if any) of the Administrator. In particular, an executive member is enabled to formulate policies and plans and proposals for expenditure in relation to such matters, to make recommendations to the Executive Council of the Northern Territory in relation to those matters, to administer specified laws within his control and to direct activities of a specified Department of the Public Service of the Territory. Directions by the Administrator under this Part are not to be given until the Council has had the opportunity to tender advice. Whilst the Administrator is not bound to accept such advice, if he does not he must cause a statement of his reasons to be laid before the Legislative Assembly within a specified period. This part further provides for the appointment of an executive member and the termination of such appointment. It also provides for the tenure of such office and an oath or affirmation of office. </para>
          <para class="block">Clause 8 </para>
          <para class="block">This provides for consequential technical amendments to the Schedules to the Act. The introduction of this Bill gives me great pleasure and satisfaction. The Bill represents a major step forward in the Territory's progress towards executive autonomy. The authority and responsibility which this Bill bestows on the Territory's Legislative Assembly reflects the Government's confidence in the democratic process and its commitment to the Federal system of government. It is tangible evidence of the Government's determination to give effect to its election undertakings on the constitutional development of the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>The transfer of authority which will flow from this measure will impose serious responsibilities on the Members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. For the first time in its history it will be a responsible legislature in the constitutional sense. The Government looks to, and is confident of the ability of, the Legislative Assembly to meet that responsibility. </para>
          <para>It is appropriate and laudable that the people of the Northern Territory should, at this stage in their history, seek largely to control their own affairs. The Government is determined that this desire will be fulfilled as quickly and effectively as possible and this Bill is an important step towards the realisation of that aim. It is, most importantly, an indication that the Government intends to work in a spirit of amicable cooperation with the people of the Territory and their elected representatives in the task of giving birth to Australia's seventh State. As such, I feel sure that it will command the support of all Senators. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- When the Northern Territory (Administration) Amendment Bill 1976 was introduced in the lower House I think it was intended to leave it there until the Budget session, but I understand that there is now a requirement to have the Bill passed in this chamber today so as to give the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly an opportunity to implement some of the measures contained in the Bill. A number of points in the Bill ought to be debated at length but because the session is about to come to an end we have reached a gentlemen's agreement not to delay unduly the passage of the Bill through the Senate. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I want to make two or three brief remarks. First of all, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. Many of the provisions included in the Bill are the result of recommendations made by the joint House all-party committee which was established by the previous Labor Government. The provisions could quite easily already have been incorporated into legislation for the Northern Territory had not the Country Party at that time held up the appointment of the Committee by delaying the appointment of its representatives to it. I do not propose to make an issue of this at this point of time as there will be other opportunities to debate some of the relevant matters. </para>
          <para>I sincerely hope that the new House of Assembly will use with justice the powers that are now being gradually transferred to it and that it will use these powers in the interests of the Northern Territory people. The Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch),</inline> of course, has said certain requirements are going to be passed on to the new House of Assembly, particularly the introduction of a domestic double taxation system. I hope that the House of Assembly will be very lenient in any of these new taxes that may be imposed. I do not think that any honourable senator in this chamber expects at this time that this will lead to the establishment of the new State that has been promised by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> The procedural matters that have to be carried out are nearly all set out in the 2 reports- the original report that the Joint Committee submitted to the Parliament and the second report which was compiled as a result of further inspections and further evidence taken after the advent of Cyclone Tracy. The Opposition does <inline font-style="italic">not</inline> oppose the Bill. </para>

        <para class="block">Aboriginal Affairs </para>
        <para>It is not a normal practice to apply a 5/12 formula to this appropriation. The estimate is normally arrived at by the department and the Treasury agreeing upon the sum of money necessary to give effect to approved programs of expenditure in the period 1 July to 30 November. That is how the estimate was arrived at on this occasion ($ 12.8m). </para>

        <para>The amount provided for the Capital Works and Services- $45m- is to finance works in progress at 30 June 1976. It is the amount that will be needed to meet commitments in the Supply period. It is not based on a proportion of the previous year's expenditure- this is consistent with previous practice. </para>

          <para>- I do not want to take up the time of the Committee but in question time today I asked the Minister for Social Security, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> a question on the Department of Aboriginal Affairs' special works project. She promised me that she would have the answer at the time that we discussed the appropriations. I am unable to find in the appropriations an appropriation to carry on the special works program of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, unless it is included in the allocation for other services. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> whether there is to be a reduction in this or whether it is to be increased in accordance with the recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs. The honourable senator is arriving now and I presume that she has the answer, as agreed this morning. </para>

          <para>- I just want to follow up very briefly a matter that I raised yesterday, I thank the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> for the information that he tabled this morning in respect of some other questions I asked. In raising a question yesterday I instanced the example of Western Australia possibly seeking the approval of the Loan Council to engage in overseas loan borrowings in its own right. During the course of the Minister's reply he drew attention to the provisions of the National Debt Sinking Fund and the acceptance of the responsibility of guarantees and repayments of such loans by the States which may be authorised by the Loan Council. I appreciate the complexity of the operation of some of these Treasury mechanisms, which I think in many cases are largely drawn up to confuse politicians. That of course is not a reflection on the Treasury - </para>

            <para>- We shall see whether it is or not. Specifically the matter I want to raise is the question of State borrowings in those circumstances. I shall read from a Treasury document which was circulated some time ago. Actually, I think it was circulated three or four years back but has since been updated, so it may be that the section that I shall read is no longer current, but I suspect that it would be. I seek clarification from the Minister- not now but perhaps if he could write to me after obtaining information from his advisers. The Treasury document states: </para>

          <para>If the Loan Council unanimously decides, however, a State may borrow outside Australia in the name of the State, and may issue securities for the amount so borrowed.

        <para class="block">A query has been raised in my mind after reading the reply given yesterday and this document. There appears to be an implication that, firstly, there has to be a unanimous decision by the' Loan Council. Is it mandatory under the Financial Agreements Act that the approval of the Loan Council be obtained? If there is not a unanimous decision of the Loan Council, does that enable the State to act in its own right, outside the provisions of the National Debt Sinking Fund? If such is the case, or even if it is not the case, are there any circumstances whereby the Western Australian Government could seek overseas loans in its own right and thus bypass the provisions of the Loan Council? I do not seek an answer immediately to that question, but if the Minister could give me a considered reply in due course I would be appreciative. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr Chairman,</inline>I shall comment, as I did yesterday, very briefly on the general question of the Loan Council, the loan agreement and the National Debt Sinking Fund. On behalf of the Treasurer, I will obtain for the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Wriedt)</inline> a studied reply to the query he has raised. It is a most important query in the operation of a sensible, economic and capital program in a Commonwealth which consists of a national government and a series of State governments. I think one could have a very interesting discussion about this matter. I can see the general concern of the honourable senator, and I should say to him that it is a concern I share. There is a very useful book written by a man called Gilbert called <inline font-style="italic">The Loan Council,</inline> issued by The Federal Financial Relations Group of the Australian National University, which I helped to get started. It is well worth reading in the general context of what the honourable senator has been talking about. In my view, the overall credit-worthiness of the Australian nation is properly in the custody of the central national government, and that is the general tenor of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> 's concern and something he very properly raises. It is something that ought to be answered very clearly and very definitely. I will ask my advisers to ensure that the honourable senator gets a letter from the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> clearing up the matter. </para>

Can the Minister tell us whether that represents the total allocation for the Organisation or whether the process has developed in this country, as it has in the United States, where there are other items within the appropriations in which certain padding takes place which is not identifiable by the Parliament? I realise this is a difficult question to put to the Minister at this stage, but perhaps he might be able to discuss the matter with his advisers to ascertain whether that amount represents the total allocation for ASIO. </para>

          <para>- All I want is an assurance that that represents the total allocation made to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation and that in fact there is no other area within the appropriations, which we accept as being the barometer of expenditure from different departments and organisations. Does this allocation represent the basic allocation needed for the proper operation and bookkeeping, which we heard so much about this morning in question time, of the various departments and agencies? That is the only assurance I need. I am not attempting to pry into or in any way identify the activities of any person or group within the Organisation itself, but we are concerned with funding. In those circumstances, 1 ask the Minister to express a very firm view that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> will give to the Senate the assurance that in fact this represents the total allocation. If the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation requires $4m, for example, surely that can be shown. What concerns democratic-minded people throughout the world, and in the United States Senate particularly, where discussions have taken place, is that there have been departures from normal funding operations. One would hope that that situation has not crept into our accounting system in this country. </para>

          <para>- I do not want to labour the question, but I think I am singularly fitted to join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> on this issue. Together with other honourable senators, I had the opportunity on an earlier occasion to question the then Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour.</inline> I do not think any of us abused that trust. Inefficiencies in that field were revealed which, with all due respect, if the Organisation had been subject to inquiry by a high level Senate committee, fully aware of its national responsibilities, would have been detected earlier. I am not being nasty about this. I am talking about their limited translator interpreter facilities in one area of political espionage. I say respectfully to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> has touched on this to a degree, that although nobody has a higher admiration than I for the former Prime Minister, Ben Chifley, conditions and attitudes change. Anybody who reads well to the centre publications like <inline font-style="italic">Time</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Newsweek</inline> will know that in the United States <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Church</inline> and a host of other senators are getting up now and saying: 'We do not want the whole of the Senate to get everyone's dossier, but we believe that three or four highly placed senators every year at least should talk to the security agencies on their principles and operations'. The best example of this I can give, and I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will not mind me doing this, was an occasion when he and I were on a committee. I found myself then defending a certain area of ASIO activities. He was arguing for the right to know more about how our money is spent. This is not the time for that debate but I hope to see the day when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> his  deputy  and the leaders from the other side of the House, at least once a year talk to the Director of the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation. I can assure honourable senators that those of us on the Select Committee on the Civil Rights of Migrant Australians had intimate discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barbour</inline> and none of the information given to us got into the Press. This is not a pious dream as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

            <para>- The Opposition supports the Wool Industry Amendment Bill and the 5 Bills dealing with, the wool tax which flow substantially from the primary Bill. This means that in the life of this session of Parliament we have dealt with more than a score of Bills dealing with rural matters and, with the exception of the superphosphate legislation, the Australian Labor Party Opposition has given its assent to all of them. I hope that this will indicate to the rural communities our support for rational legislation and our desire to set straight the record in terms of the propaganda that the Labor Party is not interested in the problems besetting the rural communities, is not able to understand the problems and has adopted a policy of neglect of rural communities. That is not so. This Wool Industry Amendment Bill is just another of those Bills which were initiatives of the Labor Administration. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With some minor exceptions, the proposed legislation is substantially the same as was proposed by the Whitlam Labor Government. It is based on the needs of the industry and the interests of the Australian people. The present Liberal-National Country Party Government has elected to continue for one more year- that is, 1976-77- the operation of a floor price in the wool market. It must be stressed again that it was a Labor Government which responded to the needs of the wool growers by introducing the floor price scheme in a way in which no previous Liberal-Country Party Government was prepared to do. Whilst this legislation is largely machinery in nature it does provide the required guidelines for accounting procedures to be applied to the Australian Wool Corporation. These accounting procedures or guidelines are necessary in order to take into consideration the additional trading functions associated with any profit or loss during this year arising from the manufacture of and trading in woollen products. These expanded functions of the Corporation were not supported by the existing accounting arrangements. </para>
          <para>The tax levy Bills to support this legislation deal with the grower funded market support scheme, a fund agreed to by the growers which permits them to pick up some of the losses, if any, which occur at the end of the operation of the floor price scheme. This market support fund is operated on a 5 per cent tax on all wool sales and collects some $45m to $50m a year. The Auditor-General has drawn attention to and certified a loss of $22m because of the accounting procedures which had been debited against the fund for the year 1974-75. In order to continue the operation of the fund, new tax Acts for this period have to be passed now, and we give our assent to them. The Wool Industry Amendment Bill amends section 20A of the principal Act by providing that the Minister consult with and have regard to the views of employer organisations, and not only appropriate trade union organisations, before taking action likely to affect the conditions of employment or demand for labour. </para>
          <para>In the original Act the obligation was on the authority to consult with the appropriate trade unions and during the debate on 1 1 December 1974 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> the then Minister for Agriculture in the Labor Government, discussed this matter in the Senate. He said that he was quite prepared to review the provision in the new year. There was not a great deal of difference between the views of the Opposition and of the Government at that time on this point so it is not a contentious issue for us now. In those circumstances, of course, we agree to add to the legislation that the employer organisations should be consulted because we want both points of view to be recognised and both sides to be consulted. </para>
          <para>The complexity of the legislation only reflects the difficulty in drafting adequate legislation to cover machinery matters concerning accounting procedures of this nature. This legislation picks up a defect discovered in the Wool Amendment Act 1974. That was a drafting defect and not a deliberate defect on the part of the Labor Government. The drafters of the legislation saw fit to provide explicitly for accounting procedures in relation to the activities of the Wool Corporation in the processing, manufacture and trading of wool products. No opposition is given to the consummation of the power expressly provided in the legislation put forward by the Labor Government in the 1 974 amendments to the Bill. The power is subject to the Minister's approval. The change of title of the Wool Scourers, Car.bonisers and Fellmongers' Association of Australia, brings the legislation up to date with the latest change of title to that organisation. </para>
          <para>The Wool Industry Amendment Bill 1976 also deals with existing policy and does not indicate what the Government's future policy will be in relation to the industry, other than to state that it is the policy of this Government to continue the initiatives of the Labor Government for only one more year. I appreciate that that is not the public view but in terms of this legislation it does just that. It continues the initiative which we took. It makes no mention of whether the floor price for wool is to be altered from 250c a kilo for 21 micron wool- that is known as clean, average merino wool- and it does not in any way extend the financial strength of the Corporation to keep abreast with inflation. I draw attention to the fact that graziers and several organisations representing growers are pressing the Government to index the floor price scheme to take into account inflation. Of course, that is a matter with which one of my colleagues will be dealing in more detail. I hazard a guess that the industry must look very carefully at any proposal to index the floor price because it may well create a bottomless pit for the industry in the years to come. </para>
          <para>Whilst it is hoped, and it has been predicted, that the outlook for the wool industry for 1976-77 is good, with clear indications of a revival for the wool industry based on Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development predictions of economic recoveries led by the United States and followed by other major trading partners, the situation is by no means certain. Recent transactions show that the Wool Corporation has not been obliged to buy in so extensively at the floor price. The market is showing those tenuous signs of recovery which will be welcomed, I am sure, not only by the rural communities but also by all Australians. We recognise the fundamental nature of the primary industry as part of our total economic scene. Notwithstanding this, the Government ought to make the firm commitment to stand by and to assist the wool industry and, in particular, the wool growers, at least as much as the Labor Government did when wool growers were confronted with the most severe economic recession since the Second World War. I think the industry needs the sort of assurance that in fact the Government is prepared to aid the industry and to stand by it whatever the vagaries of the market may be. </para>
          <para>The floor price of 250c a kilo for 21 micron wool provided the security necessary to enable wool growers to hang on. It is perhaps indicative that the difficult decision of assessing what the floor price should be has stood the test of time. I think the more far-sighted members of the producers section of this market see the need to keep that situation while it is tempting to suggest that the price should be different. Assessed primarily by market trends and not by the cost of production, figures for which are unavailable because of the vast differences in the size of properties and the quality of wool, the floor price at 250c a kilogram has assisted wool growers when they most needed help without causing an una manageable drain on the finances of the Corporation. </para>
          <para>The very operation of the floor price system, guaranteed to an extent by the market support fund, illustrates the advantages of having a single marketing and promotional authority partly guaranteed by producers in the industry and supported by the Government. But in the evolution of time rural producers are coming to see the need for government promotional activity and government support schemes of a nature which will provide stability in the rural productions. One might digress for a moment to point out that the party to which I belong supports these general principles. It does not see the need always to involve itself in production incentives because production is now becoming an important negative factor in the whole rural scene. The statistics illustrate that only approximately 80 per cent of the wool market is guaranteed by the operation of the floor price scheme. This occurs not through any fault in this legislation but because of the constitutional constraints placed on any Australian government by the Federal Constitution. </para>
          <para>The Australian Parliament, confined by section 51, and in particular section 51 (i), can only legislate in relation to the export of a commodity, not the mere sale or purchase of a commodity. Thus, until such time as the wool is ready for export the floor price scheme does not operate. Other marketing outlets for the wool growers are the private treaty merchants. It is true to say that these merchants are in a position to undercut the floor price scheme to the detriment of the grower. What is interesting is to assess why some growers are willing to sell their wool to these merchants, often for a lower price than would be received with the floor price operating at auction. </para>
          <para>It seems that the grower is not just bound to the more traditional outlet of the private treaty merchants. Whilst most growers verbally support the existence of an alternative market for the sale of their wool, they do not actually sell to that source at a price lower than that guaranteed at auction unless the need forces them to do so. In many instances it is the very struggling farmer which the floor price was specifically designed to assist who is forced, because of liquidity problems, to accept the cash value of the wool off the sheep's back offered by the private treaty merchant. Many of these farmers, especially mixed farmers, have their time taken up by other production lines on their farms. This is particularly so in Western Australia where it is said that one-third of the clip is sold by private treaty. </para>
          <para>No firm proposal has emanated from the Government in relation to this problem. It is time that the co-operation of the State was required to deal effectively with this matter because the auction system is under State jurisdiction. The need for co-ordination and direction has come from one source. The Wool Corporation may be that very source, but without enabling legislation and the agreement of all the States to legislate concurrently on particular matters, the Corporation cannot be empowered to do so. The Australian Government should not abdicate its responsibility to achieve this consensus. It should offer the necessary leadership. No grandstanding of the new federalism policy and the handing back of taxing powers will compensate for the loss of a nationwide scheme which would benefit both producer and consumer. We suggest to the Government that this matter ought to be examined to see how we can assist those sections of the wool producers who are forced to deal with private treaty merchants. We should see how some other legislative process could be developed which would give the producers the opportunity of participation and benefit from the wool price scheme. </para>
          <para>The wool industry, like so many of our agricultural industries as I have indicated, has been hit by the world recession. The prospect and indications, however tenuous, of the recovery of Australia's major wool trading partners, particularly Japan and members of the Common Market who, for example, purchased 29.2 per cent and 35.9 per cent respectively of our total wool exports for the year 1974-75, are brighter than they were in the several preceding years. We are trusting that that optimism can be maintained. Production in Australia of approximately 790 million kilograms of greasy wool is well below the peak of 925 million kilograms achieved in 1969-70, although that is higher than the interceding years. Of course, even this industry is under-producing, when compared with its potential, because of market considerations. The problems of disposal of the wool are linked with overseas markets, Australia having a mammoth 60 per cent of the total world market. With the operation of the floor price the volume of exports dropped 3.7 per cent. The price level, however, was determined largely by the Wool Corporation which in order to support the price purchased 33.5 per cent of the season's offering in 1974- 75 compared with 6 per cent for 1973-74. The stockpiling had reached 1.6 million bales compared with 176 000 bales for the previous season 1973-74. </para>
          <para>The research and promotion activities of the Wool Corporation no doubt have helped the synthetic products which seriously threaten the wool market. In 1974-75, contribution by the Australian Government to approved programs of wool research was on a 50-50 basis with wool growers, who contribute by way of 3 per cent tax on sales, which taken with the 5 per cent for the market support fund makes a total of an 8 per cent tax on sales. It was decided that in the years 1975- 76 and 1976-77 the Government would contribute three-quarters of the cost of these programs. For this latter period, the Government contributed one-quarter of the projected wool promotion budgets leaving the balance to be paid for by the wool growers. It is to be hoped that this Government's support to the industry will continue. </para>
          <para>Whilst the Opposition does not oppose this Bill, it is clear that by merely extending the initiatives put forward by the Labor Government for only one year the Liberal-National Country Party Government has not indicated to the wool growers and to those members of the rural communities materially affected by the industry what the Liberal-National Country Party policy is or what the Government intends to do in the future. So whilst we support the extension of the program, we feel it is necessary to indicate publicly acceptance of the general principles of the original legislation. Veiled in this extension of what can only be described as holding-on provisions of the floor price, it is hoped that the tenuous signs of recovery in the wool market will blossom and return the industry to the prosperity of the 1950s and the 1960s. This would be welcomed by all Australians but the policies of the Government should not be to sit back and wait and hope. </para>
          <para>The Labor Government, in its short 3 years, sprinkled with 3 election campaigns did not sit back. It instigated many research programs and reports. I think the rural community has not understood the value of the Industries Assistance Commission report and the rural policy Green Paper upon which many meaningful decisions can be made. We are not suggesting that this IAC report is the panacea or the total answer to all of the problems facing the rural communities. But we do believe that its relevance and authenticity in terms of its fundamental study and review of rural production provide the basis upon which a viable rural policy can be determined. In respect of the wool industry, that report went further than any previous LiberalNational Country Party government report in responding to the short term need and support that the industry required whilst it was in office. The Liberal-National Country Party Government before 1972 chose to continue to take <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> measures in regard to the wool industry. This Government is choosing at least to support that scheme which Labor introduced for another year. Whilst there is no objection to this, it is no substitute for policy decisions and long term planning. The rural communities and all Australians whose prosperity is still linked with the performance of our rural industries in overseas markets cannot afford the luxury of continued government piecemeal or <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> actions or inaction or a return to the hit-and-miss approach which we believe characterised the rural policies of previous Liberal and National Country Party governments in the 25 years since the second World War. </para>
          <para>The 5 tax Bills are machinery in nature and deal with the tax on the sale of wool in order to continue the contribution by the producers to the market support fund. This fund is to underwrite any final loss in the operation of the floor price introduced by Labor in 1974. There are no new procedures to the operation or collection of the tax or with the carrying out of the operations of the fund. The tax is levied by 5 different Bills because of the interpretation of the Federal Constitution. The levy of 5 per cent on the sale of wool is designed to capture all transactions whether by auction, export or sale by private treaty merchants. At least all of those transactions make some contribution towards the activities and the financial viability of the Wool Corporation. As Labor supports the extension for one year of the floor price for wool it would be inconsistent for us not to support the extension for one year of the collection of the tax for the market support fund. In those circumstances we do not oppose the legislation. We support the 6 Bills that are currently before the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I support the Bills before the Senate which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> said, are aimed at maintaining the floor price scheme for wool for a further 12 months and also to continue wool industry levies in order to supplement the market support fund which eventually the growers will take over. It is interesting to note that the levies have raised to date approximately $50m per annum. It is only a matter of time before there will be no government commitment in the fund. This is what the industry has been seeking. We certainly support the industry running its own affairs. Of course, as wool is sold at a profit, so more money will go into the fund and pay for the running costs and the interest involved. I noticed that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> used the usual Labor Party tactic of saying that the Labor Government had done everything for the wool industry and that we had not. It is interesting to note that a former Liberal-National Country Party government introduced legislation for the Australian Wool Corporation which the Australian Labor Party opposed. The Australian Wool Corporation set up a flexible floor price scheme in which it was allowed to borrow money for the purpose of stockpiling wool or to purchase wool - </para>

              <para>-We had a flexible floor price at that stage. It was a procedure being developed at that time. Anyone associated with the wool industry will know that there are difficulties in getting the wool growers to agree. We had the spade work done. The Corporation was being prepared, as honourable senators well know, to undertake this work before the 1972 election. If we had won the 1972 election, the Wool Corporation would have been introduced by our government. The industry agreed to the imposition of a levy, which was the important part of the whole operation. All that can be said is that while the Labor Government did set a fixed floor price, it also imposed a tax of 5 per cent on the wool industry - </para>

              <para>- I mentioned that. Besides putting a fixed floor price on the market, all that can be said of the Labor Government's actions in 3 years was that it imposed a tax of 5 per cent on the industry, which I agree the industry eventually agreed to accept. Of course, there are other things which the Labor Government did to the wool industry during the 3 years it was in government. It did nothing about inflation. </para>

          <para class="block">Rampant inflation has been the biggest problem of the wool industry. Any industry that sells 90 per cent or more of its product overseas cannot put up its prices. It has no power to charge more for its products. Obviously, such an industry will be affected if rampant inflation exists in its costs. </para>
          <para>Let me list a few more of the decisions made by the former Labor Government. What did the Labor Government do to the taxation deductions for farm improvements that were necessary to keep the industry going? They were taken away. The petrol price equalisation arrangement was also abolished. Postal charges were increased astronomically, as were telephone charges. Honourable senators know that in remote areas of Australia telephone charges are very costly. Nearly every call to a doctor or to a business house is a trunk line call. These are things that the Labor Government did for the wool industry. There was a proliferation of strikes which meant that a great number of producers were in difficulty in selling or transporting their wool. There is no justification for honourable senators opposite, to say that the former Labor Government did everything for the wool industry and this side of politics did nothing. </para>

          <para>Let me return to the requirements of the wool industry and the problems facing that industry. Now that one problem has been resolved, let us deal with the current problems in the industry. I believe that what we must do is see that adequate wool stocks are maintained. It has been said that the Australian Wool Corporation will be able to pay back by next year all of the money it has borrowed from the Government. Whether that is right depends on what happens in the market. This is the estimate. I would hope that the Government would not be requiring that money so early as I think that a "need exists for adequate stocks not only in Australia but also overseas in those countries which purchase our wool. An example of why this action is necessary is the recent storemen and packers strike. Wool growers who sold wool in February and who probably had wool in store in December or January still have not received payment, because the wool has not been able to be moved from the storage areas. </para>

The wool industry is a very sensitive industry. I am speaking now of the manufacturing side, the end result of the production of wool in this country. Problems experienced by the wool industry in the past have related to purchasers being unable to acquire quantities of wool when they need them and also the fluctuating prices which have created big disadvantages among different manufacturers. </para>

              <para>-That is why we introduced the flexible floor price system which is operating today. It is approximately 280c for 2 1 micron wool clean. That means that the price will not drop sharply to 250c. It will come down in stages with the Wool Corporation buying any surplus wool when the demand is slow. In the interests of the industry we not only must have these stockpiles but also must try to maintain prices at a reasonably stable level. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I turn to other matters that I believe are necessary of consideration by the wool industry and particularly by the Wool Corporation. I say for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> that I hope that records have been kept of all payments made so far by growers. I suggested in the Senate last year when we were talking on the wool legislation that there will come a time when it is no longer necessary for growers to contribute to the fund or to buy from the stockpile. I have always believed that a revolving fund is necessary. This would result in not just one section which has been through hard times, as those presently engaged in wool growing have been, being the only section to pay the levy with those who receive the benefit of this levy later on not contributing to it. With a revolving fund, after 5 years or 6 years those who contributed in the earlier years will receive their money back and those who are coming into industry or who are new to the industry will continue to contribute to the fund by way of levy. I hope that that will be done as I think that such action will be necessary in the future. </para>
          <para>I believe also that every encouragement should be given to research into reducing costs in the industry. This should not only relate to properties and the shearing of wool but should also be concerned with the marketing of wool by the Wool Corporation. Although we are inclined to believe that today prices are very high when compared with the prices prevailing a few years ago, the profitability of wool-growers throughout Australia has probably never been lower. This is an unfortunate situation which results from costs escalating to such an extent. Most of the industry now finds itself in trouble. Certainly what those in the industry cannot do now but which they were able to do a few years ago is to withstand a recession in the price obtained at wool sales or the effects of droughts which a number of growing areas do experience from time to time. Costs still seem to continue to rise. Wool growers do not have the viability or the capital behind them to be able to withstand any big financial problems. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Australian Wool Corporation will take into account and investigate these matters and also push forward as fast as it can with the introduction of modern methods of marketing. We have our objective measurement and sale by sample systems. I believe that in this area alone we could reduce to a large extent costs in the wool industry. Madam Acting  Deputy President,  time is moving on. I say in conclusion that I and members of my Party wholeheartedly support these Bills. </para>

            <para>- I shall not dwell for too long on commenting on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> 's remarks, but I do wish to make a couple of points. For as long as I can remember- in fact from 1951- the wool-growers of Australia have with varying intensity been applying pressures to the Government to implement a floor price for the whole Australian clip. I can recall throughout much of the 1950s and all of the 1960s telling wool-growers that such a scheme was unlikely to be implemented until a Labor Government was elected. That was precisely what happened. No such scheme was implemented until a Labor Government was elected. All the histrionics and the denials of the National Country Party cannot alter the historical fact that for more than 20 years despite the National Country Party's claim to represent agricultural industries it failed to secure what most sections of primary industry had with varying levels of intensity demanded throughout that period. To achieve that end, the election of a government which was politically opposed to the National Country Party was required. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Two other points arise from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> 's address. Firstly, I wish to puncture the inflation myth- the myth that because inflation is running at any particular level in Australia it therefore, <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto,</inline> cripples exporting industries. That simplistic view may have been valid in the days when governments attempted to maintain rigid exchange rates. It is no longer valid when the Australian dollar is floating as it has been floating for the last 18 months. A rate of inflation in Australia significantly higher than the rate prevailing in relation to our trading partners will, granted with some time lag, ultimately be corrected by adjustments in the international exchange rate through the open market. </para>
          <para>The third point that I make is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> and the National Country Party are victims of the fact that once the National Country Party learns a new line it seems to keep on repeating it. </para>

              <para>- Yes. It seems to be unable to shed a line once it is learnt or unable to unlearn a line once learnt. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> was again plugging this line that the Labor Government had inflicted hardship upon the wool industry because what he euphemistically calls investment incentives were withdrawn in the 1973 Budget. At the risk of being tediously repetitious and I regret that it is necessary to be tediously repetitious because the National Country Party in particular and the Liberal Party to a somewhat lesser extent still do not seem to have learnt this lesson- I put to the Liberal and National Country Parties this question: Do they really believe that investment in such industries as dairying, fruit growing, beef or wool would have been higher in 1 973 and 1 974 than in fact it was? Do they really believe that, if the Government of the day had provided some artificial stimuli to generate new investment and thereby increase productions in those industries, those industries would have been any better off? In case they have no idea of the current position of those industries, I remind them that their acute problem at the moment is one of surplus capacity. So what the National Country Party still claims would have been a sound and viable agricultural policy in 1973 would in fact have exacerbated the problems which exist today. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>The Bills before the Senate, although they are concerned with striking levies and so on, are an integral part of the Labor Government's major initiatives to apply a floor price from September 1974 onwards. This legislation continues the most significant innovation in the area of agricultural policy that came from the Whitlam Government. The level at which the floor price should be set has always been a contentious issue. My own view is that the level of 250c set in September 1974 was probably somewhat higher than the market realities justified and that the 250c floor price set for the 1975-76 season was the appropriate level- of course, we have empirical evidence to support this now- insofar as there has been some decline in stocks but substantial stocks are still being held. The appropriate level of the reserve price next year must remain a field for speculation. Nevertheless it need not be entirely ignorant or ill-informed speculation. </para>
          <para>When in Opposition the members of the present governing Parties freely distributed their advice and made their assertions that the reserve price should be set at a higher level than whatever level the Australian Labor Party had allowed it to be set at. For example, as far back as 22 May last year, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> said:   . . The Parties on this side of the House believe that that level of  support  should be at least at the present rate of 250c. </para>
          <para class="block">From time to time spokesmen for the Liberal and National Country Parties argued that the floor price should be indexed to either the consumer price index or the Bureau of Agricultural Economics index of farm costs or wool industry costs. The view was put forward- quite unrealistically in my opinion; I will return to that later- by those spokesmen that the floor price should automatically increase from year to year in accordance with increases in the BAE index of farm costs or wool industry costs. So those spokesmen will now have the opportunity to put the taxpayers' money where their mouths were when they were in Opposition. </para>
          <para>I do suggest- I offer this suggestion constructively that the current state of the wool market justifies the Government giving serious consideration to reviewing the level of the floor price for the coming season with some adjustment upwards. I do not accept the belief which has been irresponsibly promoted by some members of this Parliament and by some parliamentarians outside the federal sphere, particularly by the Premier of Western Australia, that the demand for wool- I use the word 'demand' in the sense of it being a composite of quantity sold and price- is determined by whatever floor price is set. That sort of nonsense was liberally promoted by the Premier of Western Australia, amongst others, in September 1974 when he had the audacity to assert that if the reserve price- the floor price- had been set at 300c instead of 250c the Wool Corporation would have sold more wool. That sort of view, of course, clearly reveals the monumental ignorance of the process of price formation to which Professor Lloyd referred at a conference in Perth in 1 970. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Sir Charles</inline>Court's views in this instance were that if one increases the price of a product the quantity sold will likewise increase. It is certainly an original view of the process of price formation and marketing reality. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> might respect that, with his immense knowledge in this area, but I have not struck anyone else in Australia who supports it, other than some irresponsible political propagandists who have an axe to grind. In the long term, of course, to anyone who has a rational or even a minimal appreciation of the true forces which determine prices in a market place- that obviously excludes <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court and, by his own admission, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright-</inline> and the process of price formation the floor price in the long term must be set by the true market demand for wool. That sort of analysis, of course, does not exclude significant government intervention for the short term. There always remains the problem of determining the appropriate level at which the reserve price should be set in the short or medium term. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>To return to the point of the level at which it ought to be set this year, there are certain objective facts which are relevant and which point in the direction of a higher floor price being justified. I refer firstly to what was, on the whole, a well considered submission that was sent to me and, I understand, to other members of Parliament by the Farmers Union of Western Australia. I trust the figure given is correct- I have not checked it- but it is claimed that there was a fall of 600 000 bales in the stocks held by the Wool Corporation between November and March and that 600 000 bales represented something very close to 40 per cent of the Corporation's total stocks. Another objective fact is that the market for the last month or 6 weeks has held at a fairly consistent level at around 275c per kilogram clean. I think it is reasonable to say that the price of wool is likely to rise, although no one can be certain of these things, at something like the general increase in prices not only in Australia but also in the countries to which we sell and the general increase in price in the last year has still been in the vicinity of 10 per cent. Given those 3 facts and, in addition, the apparent economic recovery or the beginnings of an economic recovery in many of our trading partners, it does not seem unreasonable to suggest that the Government ought to review the level of the reserve price with a view to increasing it. The level to which it ought to be increased is, of course, highly debatable but it seems to me that an increase of the magnitude of 10 per cent would not be irresponsible and ought to be seriously considered. </para>
          <para>I want quite clearly to dissociate myself from the view promoted in some sections of the industry, frequently with the backing and encouragement of the National Country Party, that the level of the floor price of wool ought to be set by something that they call the cost of production. The cost of production concept just does not have any viability unless governments are prepared to enter into open-ended and continuing commitments for price support, and that sort of policy no responsible government can contemplate. I concede all the difficulties that are involved in making a reasonable assessment, but in the long term the floor price must be set by the true market demand for wool and that does not exclude short term intervention. The Labor Government did intervene. It was an extremely costly exercise in the short term. The cost to the Budget in 1974-75 was in excess of $300m. There is not likely to be any net cost to government finances this year. I mention in passing that the non-expenditure of the $80m appropriated in the 1975-76 Budget for finance for the Wool Corporation is now claimed by some Government spokesmen as being a saving instituted by the superior housekeeping of this Government. It has even been predicted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> and, I think, some others, that the great bulk of the outstanding advance currently owed by the Corporation of around $300m will be returned to the Government in the next financial year. If that should happen, I hope that the Government does not have the audacity to claim that its superior housekeeping has been responsible for that too. But I acknowledge the very possibility of that advance being repaid is a factor constraining the Government, a factor working against the Government allowing for an increase in the reserve price. </para>
          <para>Finally, I want to give some figures in response to the belief promoted by political propagandists who are more concerned with saying what is popular than what is true, that is, the belief that the current problems in some sectors of agriculture have been caused by the Labor Government. The reality of the situation is that the Government in power has little influence over the aggregate level of farm income except in those sectors that suffer from chronic surplus capacity. It is in those sectors that governments have been culpable in the past. Governments, both State and Federal, have promoted surplus capacity in fruit growing and in dairying, in particular. I refer to the level of farm income on a calendar year basis- I have incorporated it in other ways before- for the years 1970 to 1972 under a Liberal-Country Party Government. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>before the suspension of the sitting I was saying that the government in power, no matter which party constitutes that government, has little influence on the aggregate level of farm income, except where government action induces or sustains chronic surplus capacity. This has been a factor in industries such as the dairy industry, the canned fruit industry and the apples and pears industry, and it is a factor in the current difficult situation. For example, in the calendar years 1970 to 1972 the average net farm income, in constant 1966-67 prices, was $982m. In the 3 calendar years from 1973 to 1975 the average net farm income, again in constant 1966-67 prices, was $ 1 ,430m. So the belief that in the 3 years of Labor rule things were very difficult down on the farm is quite clearly contradicted by the objective facts. In fact, in those 3 years net farm income in real terms was some 45 per cent higher than it had been in the preceding 3 years of Liberal-Country Party government. </para>

They would do these people a service if they paid more attention to the truth than to the popularisation of misleading analyses or to the promotion of false hopes. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I will not go through the objectives of these five or six Bills that we are debating. Firstly, I should like to refer to a couple of matters that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> discussed. He questioned the right of private wool buyers to operate in the wool market. I refer him to a report of the economic section of the Australian Wool Corporation into the question of private wool buying. That report recognised the value of private wool merchants and does not suggest the abolition of private wool buying. But it recognised that if the operation of private wool buying gets beyond its present level it could create some difficulties. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I refer honourable senators to the debate on these Bills which ensued in another place and also something that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> mentioned regarding this Government's so-called indecision in not giving the wool industry a lead as to what the future wool reserve price will be. I refer to the speech made by the honourable member for Blaxland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keating,</inline> which is reported on page 2659 of the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of 28 May 1976. There he is reported to have said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Now it is up to this Government to say where it stands but to date we have heard nothing except that it will do it at the end of the season. Let the Government give the industry some indication. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This would be a completely irresponsible and mischievous thing for the Government to do. Let us imagine the situation if the wool buyers of the world had advance warning of what the reserve price was to be. If the reserve price was to be higher there would be a rush for wool. Conversely, if the price was to be lower the buyers would hold off buying wool. As I have said, it would be completely irresponsible for the Government to indicate what the reserve price was to be. </para>
          <para>I turn now to deal with some of the comments that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> made. I respect his views on quite a number of things that he mentioned. He speaks with quite a lot of knowledge on economic affairs, but I suggest that his memory is rather lacking when he refers to the establishment of the reserve price program. For the illumination of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> and other honourable senators opposite I point out that the Australian Wool Corporation was set up by the Liberal-Country Party Government. The suggestion was made to the wool growers that there should be a reserve price scheme. Governments of our political colour do not impose on people things that they do not want. It took many years to convince the growers that a reserve price scheme would work. So rather than there being indecision on our part, we were waiting for the growers to decide what they wanted us to do. Honourable senators will recall that when the Wool Corporation was established it set up its own flexible reserve price. Two of the most vehement opponents of" the establishment of the Corporation were Messrs Patterson and Whan. Sadly, they are no longer in this Parliament. But the Labor Party was strongly opposed to the establishment of the Wool Corporation which has done a tremendous amount of good for the industry. All growers throughout Australia have recognised that the Corporation is making a very important contribution. </para>
          <para>These Bills refer to the imposition of a levy of 5 per cent on the sale of wool. I also remind honourable senators that in addition to this levy there is another levy of 3 per cent which has been imposed for many years and which is used for research and promotion. 1 believe that the way in which the wool industry levies itself is an example to other rural industries. Wool growers, by their tremendous support, have recognised the importance of research and promotion. Now they are financing the reserve price scheme. Although the present Bills set a minimum price for wool for this coming season, they do not prevent an increase from being made in the reserve price for the financial year beginning 1 July. I wish to make it quite plain that these Bills do not prevent an increase from being made in the reserve price. </para>
          <para>I have received representations, as probably other honourable senators from rural areas have, to the effect that the reserve price should be increased to 300c per kilogram. Many wool growers, particularly in Western Australia, believe that if this increase were granted they would voluntarily provide a 10 per cent levy to allow the Wool Corporation to be controlled more and more by the growers and to have less dependence on governments. In response to that I indicate that I agree with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> said, that it would be completely irresponsible of this Government to recommend an increase in the reserve price beyond what we can rightfully expect the market level to be. I also must point out that the flexible reserve price is operating again. As other honourable senators have already mentioned, this price is operating substantially above 250c per kilogram. </para>
          <para>In passing I should like to pay a tribute to the Australian Wool Corporation, and in particular to Pat Moore and John Benn is on, the Corporation members from Western Australia, both of whom I know quite well. I also refer in particular to the staff, to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Arthur</inline> Farnworth, Malcolm Hawser and Morris Pell whom I personally know. They have done a tremendous amount of work for the wool industry. Probably the work that they have done will never be completely recognised. </para>
          <para>In 1974-75 the income received by the Corporation was $88m. Of that, $60m was received from growers through levies and $ 14.7m was contributed from Government funds specifically for wool promotion. In that year the main portion of the income was expended on the International Wool Secretariat. Very few people understand that the major portion of expenditure on wool promotion is incurred overseas. Unfortunately, very few growers in Australia have an opportunity of seeing the functioning of the International Wool Secretariat. I can assure them that it is doing a tremendously good job. It concentrates its work more in areas where wool is used. </para>
          <para>We export 90 per cent of our wool and we export to some 38 countries. The countries are listed in the latest report of the Australian Wool Corporation. The report shows that Japan takes 29 per cent of our wool, France 1 1 per cent and the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics 13 per cent. These figures refute some of the arguments that members of the Labor Party consistently put forward in trying to tie in diplomatic relations with international trade. The report shows that our exports to mainland China have actually fallen off quite substantially and that we export 5 times as much wool to Taiwan as we do to the People's Republic of China. There is no significant difference in the percentages before and after we recognised the People's Republic of China. At June 1975, 1.6 million bales of wool were in store in Australia as a result of the operations of the reserve price scheme. This is a third of our annual production and is rather an alarming amount. Currently 1.3 million bales of wool are held in store, conservatively valued at $250m. </para>
          <para>The wool industry received tremendous competition from synthetics some years ago. One of the reasons given for this is that manufacturing wool from the raw state into the fabric is quite a lot more expensive than is the manufacture of synthetics. There are many reasons for that; I will not mention them all now. I pay a tribute to the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation for its major innovation in the spinning process of wool. CSIRO has developed a self-twist machine which is currently being manufactured by the Rep co company. Wool is being forced into the high cost market. Because of the factors I have mentioned we cannot compete with the cheap production of synthetics and we are being forced into the high quality, high fashion market. But things are improving and rather interestingly the high price of oil is forcing synthetic manufacturers to raise their prices, thus helping the natural fibres. </para>
          <para>The advances in production techniques in the last few years are quite outstanding. Honourable senators will be aware that about 60 per cent of the Australian wool clip is sold by sample and objective measurement. I pay a tribute to my own State of Western Australia which took the lead in this field. I think some 80 per cent of wool in Western Australia is sold by objective measurement. Many other innovations are in the pipeline. Computer selling has been talked about a great deal and could save the cost involved in wool buyers travelling around the country from sale to sale. Also, tremendous advances have been made in the last 10 to 15 years particularly in sheep breeding programs. I would like to say how much I appreciate the help that CSIRO and various institutes and departments concerned with agriculture have given in this regard. </para>
          <para>As everybody would realise, costs are increasing in the industry. This is its most serious problem. The Australian Wool Corporation completed a calculation recently comparing the years 1970 to 1976. It was able to show, quite conclusively, that the cost per kilogram of getting wool from the sheep's back to the woollen mills has increased from 30.46c in 1970 to 74.75c in 1976. This is a 145 per cent increase and is far above any inflationary increases. I counsel the Government that a consideration of costs in the industry is our major priority. </para>

            <para>- in reply- As we were told by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> who is the shadow Minister for Primary Industry, this Bill is not opposed by the Opposition. Therefore a long reply is not called for. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> mentioned briefly the question of growers selling their wool by private treaty. Of course in the present market situation growers choose to sell their wool privately. It is open to them equally to sell at auction if they wish to do so. The floor price scheme is designed to operate within the auction system and there would be practical difficulties, I am informed- for example, methods of appraisal- in attempting to extend the scheme to private treaty selling. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> talked about the Australian Wool Corporation endeavouring to keep records of amounts paid by growers. In this activity the Corporation needs the co-operation of brokers and the many private treaty merchants who provide information of sales records. It is not easy to do, but the aim is a laudable one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> said a great deal but did not specifically leave anything to reply to. It was interesting to hear his observations on lots of matters and equally to disagree very strongly with a great number of them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas,</inline> who spoke from a considerable experience of wool growing and sheep breeding, said a couple of very interesting things. He referred to the immense rise in costs of production in the last five or six years which was much greater than I had imagined. He informed us quite properly that there are limits for the animal breeder to produce a commercial product by useful genetic and selection work in mating and programs to be able to achieve a result which will overcome the solid upward thrust of cost pressures such as the ones that he mentioned. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am concerned about the great Australian wool industry, which began really with very few sheep and has a tremendous record of achievement. All the Australians involved throughout its history have produced a superb animal for the process of wool production. This has been done by very good mating programs, good classification work and good identity. I think it is a great tribute to the Australian primary producer that he has been able to do this and that our wool has reached its present position in the world. Equally, in passing, I suppose one might say the traditional Australian plant breeders made much the same sort of improvement with wheat. One might talk at great length about these areas in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> and I have a common interest but I shall refrain from doing so in the interests of getting our work through. </para>

            <para>-The Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Termination Bill is largely a machinery Bill. It is complementary to legislation of the Australian Labor Party Government establishing the Australian Staffing Assistance Group, which was provided for under the Papua New Guinea (Staffing Assistance) Act 1973. The Group came into being on 1 December 1973, which coincides with the date on which responsibility for the Papua New Guinea Public Service was transferred to the Papua New Guinea Government. A fairly large number of people were involved in the changeover and when that particular legislation was introduced it was decided that further recruitment to the Group would cease on 30 June 1975 and that the Australian Staffing Assistance Group arrangements would be wound up on 30 June 1976. So this virtually means that it was necessary to have this present legislation introduced to wind up the loose ends of the whole program. There is no need to talk at length on this matter. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </para>

              <para>- The Opposition supports the legislation that is before the Senate. The first Bill- the Dairy Adjustment Amendment Bill- probably might be considered to be somewhat more contentious than the others. We recognise that this Bill was introduced into the Parliament in 1 974 by the Labor Government, lt replaced former assistance measures, such as bounties on butter, cheese and processed milk, which were then phased out. It is interesting to recall that at that stage the legislation had the support of all parties. When the Bill came before the Senate on 10 December 1974 the then Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> summed the legislation up by saying that it assisted the persons whose needs were greatest in the dairying industry and who were likely to go out of dairying if assistance were not available. The dairying assistance program is designed to make dairying an economic proposition. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>The Dairy Adjustment Amendment Bill proposes some minor amendments to the existing legislation. For example, it proposes to appropriate $3.5m for the purposes of the legislation $2m for selected short term adjustment for dairy farmers in financial difficulties and $1.5m which was previously made available to the States by the Labor Government. The legislation provides also for new proposals for carry on loans. These are for cases where dairy farms for the time being uneconomic would be economic if satisfactory market conditions were restored. The terms and conditions in the legislation providing for carry on loans, provide for maximum loans in individual cases of $4,000 for up to 7 years. The legislation also extends the provisions for diversification assistance where there are prospects of viability in some other form of rural production. The assistance available for reallocation is increased under this Bill from $3,000 to $5,000. The total amount payable is increased to $46.5m. Previously $25m was made available on a 4-year program. Assistance is given where there is a reasonable prospect of viability, which is judged by the States' own administrative authorities. </para><para>The effect of the proposed legislation will be to widen the criteria in the original legislation on rural reconstruction and to extend the provisions for the marginal dairy farm reconstruction scheme. I think it has to be said that the dairying industry has been adjusting for a considerable number of years. Some people have suggested that this is a euphemism for going broke. The decline in the number of dairy farms in Australia in the last 10 years or so has been something like from 55 000 to 33 000 dairy farms. So already very considerable readjustment has been taking place virtually under our noses. A specific program of dairy reconstruction, build up and adjustment was needed 10 years ago. I draw the attention of the Senate to a parliamentary decision made in 1959 to conduct an inquiry into the dairying industry and a report of the dairying industry committee of inquiry was submitted to the Parliament in August 1 960. </para><para>That report was to take into consideration the developments which were to accrue and which subsequently did accrue as a result of the development of the European Economic Community and particularly as a result of the lucrative market of the United Kingdom going into the EEC. The tragedy is that this report interestingly enough the majority opinion was by Professor Downing and Professor Karmel, who subsequently did some very important work for the Australian Parliament- did make a number of recommendations based on what were then apparent trends and on what were considered to be potential trends in the event of England moving into the EEC. While the debate did rage over a number of years, it has to be said that very little was done by the Liberal and Country Parties when they were in government in Australia to exercise any influence on the English decision or to take the essential steps that were necessary if England were to make that decision subsequently. In the report, apart from a lot of other recommendations, it is stated: </para><quote>
            <para>During the transition period, special schemes to provide technical and capital assistance should be devised, in order to strengthen the position of marginal producers who remain in dairying, in order to help those who wish to leave the industry, and in order to help those who can neither establish themselves in the industry profitably nor move out of it. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">Of course, they were the sorts of decisions that should have been planned in the 1960s. We have now reached the stage, I think, where no other industry in Australia is in a more chronic state than the dairying industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> who is responsible for the presentation of this Bill, not only has that report to fall back on but he also has the report of the Industries Assistance Commission, which was presented to the Parliament in October 1975. 1 find it incomprehensible that he has taken the step of delaying the essential restructuring that is necessary in the dairying industry by calling for yet another report, which it is anticipated will not be received until August or September of this year. Of course, that will be post-Budget. Clearly, if we are in any way to take any meaningful steps towards the stabilisation of this very important industry, steps must be taken in the forthcoming Budget. </para><para>That prompts the criticism from the Opposition that waiting for the report is putting off the evil day. It is putting off the day of recognition of the problem which faces all of those in the dairying industry, State by State. We have the IAC report and we have the reports from that very important organisation, the Dairy Corporation, which has constantly advised governments, both past and present, of the difficulties in the industry. There is no doubt that the decision which faces this Government is a very difficult one. lt is a decision which, if delayed, will become even more difficult. The sooner the decision is made the sooner we will be able to solve the problem, if it is at all soluble. </para><para>Surely the Opposition is entitled to say that pan of the blame for the delay in decision making must fall on the shoulders of the Liberal and Country Parties. After all, they had 23 years to recognise the trends and to bring about a restructuring of the dairying industry. The first initiatives should have been taken in 1960, when the first moves were made and when it became apparent that there were going to be changes in our production of dairy products as a result of the report of 1960. However, those initiatives were not taken. The 1 960 report was designed primarily to advise the Government on developments which were going to be disastrous from the point of view of the 250 000 people who in some way or another were involved in the dairying industry. </para><para>After 14 or 15 years in which very little was done in the way of substantial thinking and forward planning, there is no doubt that we have reached an important stage for the dairying industry. It is D-day, it is a Disaster Day, it is Doomsday for those who comprise a very important section of our rural community. Most people have been shocked by the intensity of the problem, by the decision of the farmers in Victoria to kill cows in the way that was shown recently on television. Most members of Parliament will have received some letters indicating the community's indignation- certainly I have and I know the Minister and other members have about such a callous waste of a very important resource caused by the state of the dairying industry. </para><para>I think it has to be said that the dairying industry cannot afford any longer the inaction of governments. The failure of governments generally to recognise the inevitable day, so far as the European Economic Community is concerned, has to be understood by the farmers themselves. There was no doubt that Australia was going to be denied our long term access to the European Economic Community and to the markets of Great Britain. In those circumstances, we say that the Government is largely responsible for the problem it currently faces because it did not take appropriate action at that de which would have had the effect of minimising the hardship which occurred in subsequent years and which is occurring now. Markets were lost and there was a contraction of the industry, but given the existing markets it is clear to the Opposition that that contraction was not enough. </para><para>There is a clear case for Government intervention and Government leadership. When it is recognised that some 50 per cent of our total dairy production is for export, and that so much of this production which went to Great Britain was lost in 1972, clearly we have a responsibility as a Parliament to examine the reasons why there was no forward planning. We are now confronted with the very grave difficulty of trying to assess how to save a great percentage of those involved in the dairying industry. The question will be asked: What did the previous Government do? The previous Government phased out the bounties which were increasing production. Those bounties were increasing production when it was apparent that production was going to be the death knell of the industry. What did the previous Government do? It allocated S28m for restructuring the industry, to bring about essential changes which should have taken place 10 or 1 5 years before. </para><para>We knew what the economic aims of the EEC were. They were to attain self-sufficiency in the food market. Despite the fact that Europe has a most inefficient dairying industry in comparison with ours, and I am sure honourable senators will concede that Australia is at the top of the poll- I think it is a very close second to New Zealand in efficiency in dairy production- that is clearly not a factor in terms of our access to overseas markets. Of course, there are political reasons why these problems in Europe exist even today. The conservative forces in Europe prefer to maintain as a political base a small farm concept. The average farm in Europe which is involved in the dairying industry has only 14 cows, but it provides the political base for the Christian Democratic parties and Conservative parties in those countries. </para><para>Governments in Europe have been prepared to subsidise the dairying industry in those countries in order to maintain things as they are and to freeze out the more efficient milk producing countries like New Zealand and Australia. The demonstrations that we have started to see in Victoria and Tasmania will be mounted time and again as the very grave chronic crisis faced by the dairy industry seeps through. I am amazed that the industry has been as constrained as it has although I would imagine that if there had been a Labor Government those in the industry would have been marching on Canberra and placing the whole of the blame upon the Labor Government. As it is, at this stage they are having their protest rallies in the areas in which they live because they have been conned into believing that the last 3 years of Labor Government was the reason for the crisis developing within the industry. </para><para>This is what is being said by the Government's spokesman on primary industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair,</inline> the Minister, is telling the farmers that they have a problem because of the Labor Government. For 3 years out of twenty-seven Labor has been in office. For almost 24 years the conservatives have been in government. Yet what does <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> say in the Press release which he was kind enough to send to all members of the Parliament? He said that the Government was worried about rural poverty. He told a meeting in Launceston organised by the Tasmanian </para><para class="block">Farmers Federation that he believed rural poverty to be the greatest problem facing Australia's rural community. That is precisely what I have been saying in recent debates. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> would acknowledge that. The Press release states: </para><quote>
            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline>told the meeting that recent market collapses for many major commodities such as beef, dairy and horticultural produce has accentuated the poverty problem in closely settled farming areas such as Tasmania and Victoria. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">That is true and we do not take issue with him on that. It goes on to say: </para><quote>
            <para>The problem has also been aggravated by the lack of Government assistance to rural industry under the 3 years of the Labor Government. </para>
            <para>This lack of assistance plus poor forward planning under the Labor Government means that we are facing a problem which should concern all Australians- not only the ones that live in country areas. </para>
          </quote><para class="block">For heaven's sake, we had to fight 3 elections in 3 years. We were beset with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> admitting at the time we came into office that they would set about to undermine the Government and bring about its defeat. Fair enough; that is part of the political process. But in the time when we were struggling to survive it was difficult to do any forward planning or to look at things in an objective capacity. However, what we did for the dairy industry was phase out the bounties that were enabling the industry to produce more food because we knew the market was going to become the problem area. We went on the offensive by allocating $2 8 m for the restructuring of the dairy industry. </para><interjection>

It is not true. It is a palpably untrue statement. In my brief access to records and statistics I have discovered that something between $900m and $ 1,000m was paid directly to rural industries in the 3 years of Labor Government. For example, in 1973 we allocated $30m under the States grants rural reconstruction scheme; in 1975 we allocated $56m for the construction of an animal health laboratory in Geelong; in 1 973 and 1974 we allocated over the 2 years $4.6m for a fruit growing reconstruction scheme; in 1975 we allocated $5.68m for the apple and pear stabilisation scheme; in May 1973 we made available in the form of 2 lots of rural credit allocations to farm development loan funds $104m at very favourable interest rates, and then a term loan fund allocation of $ 1 90m; on 4 December 1974 by way of financial assistance to the beef industry, which was at that stage apparently beginning to show signs of decline, we allocated $20m; in 1975-76 we added another $8m. Then we made available another $ 19.6m for matching loans with the States. On 30 June 1975 we allocated $3m to the Australian Meat Board to promote exports, and at the same time we made available another $ 19.6m for carry-on finance. </para><para>What did we do in 1974? We allocated $350m for the floor price support scheme for the wool industry. We made available for the dairy industry $28m to bring about part of the process that is essential for the survival of the dairy industry. In our last Budget we made available another $ 19.2m for the dairy industry. So we find it difficult to understand how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> can make those sorts of inflammatory statements to meetings of farmers when he should be concerned with the basic problem of the industry. Is the Government saying that the Industries Assistance Commission report which was presented in October last year is not relevant? Is that what it is seeking to say? If there had been a specific dairying reconstruction program built up and adjusted over the last 10 years, the crisis in the industry would have been at least partially avoided. The dairy industry is a classic case of the result of the failure of the conservatives to apply any forward planning principles to primary industry. Their attitude seems to be to wait until the farmers agree, but unfortunately they generally do not agree until it is too late, and in the meantime to subsidise them to keep them quiet. This invariably means subsidising the bigger farmer and the squeezing of the little farmer. </para><para>What is the attitude of the Liberal and National Country Parties to primary industry policy? They are still concerned with stimulating production. If honourable senators opposite who have interjected really analysed the industry in this country they would find that in practically every phase of primary production there is overproduction. Yet, when we look at the Government's program and policy we see that it still wants to give emphasis to production. The Government seeks to create the impression that, if the farmers produce more, they will be more prosperous. The dairy industry in Australia is in a state of chronic crisis. It is facing the crisis not because of production problems but because of the lack of markets and over production. Nowhere is it a question of efficiency, of diversification or of doing more than trying to establish new markets for industry. </para><para>As has been stated by so many people, the facts are that the markets for dairy products are becoming less available than they have been in the past to countries like Australia. In these circumstances, because this is a minor step forward, all we can do is support the legislation. We suggest to the Government that the research programs and all the other programs which it has available to improve production should be maintained so that there will be improved efficiency. The Government should explore any avenue of improved marketing. It will have to give consideration to taking the disastrous step of changing the whole dairy industry structure. We recognise that the dairy industry is one of the most decentralised industries in Australia. If it were to collapse then tens of thousands of people, if not hundreds of thousands of people, would be thrown onto the already swollen labour market and into the swollen cities. </para><para>That means that if this problem is to be tackled it will not be tackled on the basis of cheap party political partisanship of the type in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> engages. In fact, we will have to seek the co-operation of the main political trends and thoughts in our country to bring about the essential reallocation of resources in such a way that this will protect the livelihood and the future of the dairy industry. It is to this end that we give our limited but critical support to the legislation which is before the Senate. </para></speech>

            </talker>
            <para>-In view of the fact that most of the time which was allocated to this debate has already been used I shall be brief. I agree with the previous <inline font-weight="bold">speaker. Senator Gietzelt,</inline> on one point and that is that the dairy industry is a tragedy. But having listened to the rest of the honourable senator's manifesto 1 really could not find much to agree with. I could not agree with the collection of figures which were produced and which the honourable senator claimed represented the amount of money given to the rural industries. He included a figure which represented an advance to the Wool Corporation as if that money were going to the industry. That is deliberately untrue as the honourable senator well knows. The action in providing that sort of money with one hand and at the same time taking it away and multiplying it as it is taken away because of the results of inflation speaks for itself. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The dairy industry can be looked at by some with all the advantages of hindsight. The previous  speaker  gave us a lot of good advice in relation to what he could have done 20 years ago. He did not give us one good piece of advice as to what he will do for the next 20 years. It is the next 20 years that we are concerned about. The industry has to face a rationalisation period now. It is doing that and it will do that with government assistance. In the past it has been very difficult to plan a long way ahead because circumstances change from year to year. Those of us who came into the Senate at the beginning of this session well know that at that time there was really not one piece of authoritative information available to us which was relevant in the circumstances of January 1976. What had been prepared, even as late as the middle of 1 975, was no longer relevant. This is the sort of speed at which the situations in markets change. </para>
          <para>Nobody at that stage foresaw what the price of skim milk powder would be today. Nobody can tell me what the price of skim milk powder will be at this time next year. Nobody can tell mc what the price of cheddar cheese will be. Nobody can foresee these things. At the time the last amount of money was put out to the industry world trends indicated that there would bc a good market. This was a product the market for which collapsed in 18 months. The $28m which was put out for dairy reconstruction did not reconstruct anybody. All that has done is to increase the debts of the industry by $28m. The problem of the dairy industry is that it has been through squeeze after squeeze spasmodically. It has kept on becoming more and more efficient. This drop in the number of farmers from 62 000 to 30 000 has, in itself, not solved the problem. While farms have been getting bigger and more efficient they have been keeping up production. The last lot of money which was injected into the industry only increased production by making people milk more cows. Right through it has been a struggle for viability. As farmers have increased their liabilities they have increased their personal work and, at the same time, suffered falling returns. </para>
          <para>At meetings in Victoria in the last week there have been 20 000 of the farming community and in Tasmania they have had 2000-odd. This figure represents nearly 60 per cent of the dairy industry of Australia. All these people were at the meetings because they had been beaten by inflation. The farmer is not responsible for inflation. He is not responsible for the international politics which are involved. But he is the victim. The problems which are facing the dairy farmer are of national origin. The farmers need national support. They will need national support while the adjustments take place. The industry has been having many of these meetings. It has undertaken that it will voluntarily reduce production. It has voluntarily undertaken to improve the efficiency of the industry, particularly at manufacturing levels. It has undertaken that no new dairy licences will be issued for the present. </para>
          <para>In spite of all this, whatever happens will not happen overnight. Changes will need to be made. It is not a case of saying we will close one factory and keep another one going, or anything of that sort, because so many of the rural communities depend very heavily on the involvement of the industry. The markets generally will have to be reassessed. I believe that this is where the Government must see about assisting with the creation of markets in new areas overseas and in new areas in Australia. We have to sponsor and to assist new products. I believe that we have to make every effort to form a proper trading agreement with New Zealand. Most of all, I think we have to settle down and to try to refinance the dairy industry which has put itself out on all sorts of long term, short term and mixed finance. When a financial squeeze hits an industry of this sort it immediately hits the younger groups and the more enterprising groups. Usually it leaves in the industry the older, hard core and the less efficient. This is where we have to try to make every effort to keep rationalisation ahead of us and to make sure that we keep the industry efficient both in the long and short term. The Bills provide for a very short term operation. They will do nothing to put the industry right but they will get us over the period immediately ahead. With that in mind, I support the Bills. I am still waiting for the results that will come from a proper, thorough in-depth investigation so that we can see how we can both keep the industry alive today and keep it viable so that as we reorganise for the future it will be able to prosper again. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I rise to speak briefly on these 3 Bills before the Parliament in relation to the dairy industry and to give support to the Opposition shadow Minister for Primary Industry, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> who I believe has done his homework very thoroughly; I think he is to be commended for the arguments he has put forward in the Senate today. As has been pointed out already, the 3 Bills will appropriate $3.5m for dairy adjustment to follow the $28m provided by the Labor Government for the same purpose in 1 974. The second Bill, the Dairy Industry Research and Promotion Levy Bill, will repeal the existing butter fat levy legislation. The third Bill, the Dairy Industry Research and Promotion (Miscellaneous Amendments) Bill will replace the existing Act with one allowing for a levy to be struck on whole or liquid milk as well as butter fat in order to finance the administration and promotion activities of the Australian Dairy Corporation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is not before time, in my humble assessment, that such legislation was introduced. For years the liquid milk section of the dairy industry has been exempt from a levy. From my knowledge of the political history of the dairy industry, I believe that the only reason why the liquid milk section of the industry has been exempt is that it has always been better organised, far more vocal and higher up in the chain of dairy politics than the manufacturing sector. The pity of the whole exercise, I suppose, is that as with most agricultural industries, it is only in times of crisis that some advances seem to be made. But that Bill will certainly overcome an anomaly that existed in the industry for a long time and break down some of the antagonisms that have developed in the industry on this question for a number of years. </para>
          <para>As I have said, the Dairy Adjustment Amendment Bill will appropriate $3.5m for short term measures only. But I note also in the second reading speech of the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> that $ 1 .5m of that $3. 5m has to all intents and purposes been expended already by the States. That amount of money will be spent to pay back the States. I would suspect also, without knowing what the position is amongst the restructuring authorities in the States, that the applications are already in and that they will eat up the remaining $2m that is being appropriated. If one breaks down the figures, one finds that if every farmer applied for the maximum loan of $4,000 and were to receive it, only 500 farmers would benefit. If we take cognisance of the fact that on top of this money being appropriated by the Federal Government the State governments must also contribute a like amount, 1000 dairy farmers across Australia could receive the maximum loan. This means that roughly one dairy farmer in every forty in Australia at the present time would receive the loan. I think this indicates the short term nature and the paucity of the funds being appropriated. </para>
          <para>The Minister noted in his second reading speech that the dairy industry was facing serious problems when this Government took office. In fact, the dairy industry had been facing serious problems when the previous Liberal-National Country Party Government was in office, as was noted in the speech of the Labor Party shadow Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> We had 23 years of Liberal rule. During tha* whole period the fortunes of the dairy industry, like the rest of Australia's agriculture, waxed and waned. No serious attempt was ever made to come to grips with the basic problems confronting those industries and the dairy industry in particular. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> said earlier, in 1960 the McCarthy Committee report was brought down. The Liberal and National Country Party governments sat on that report for 12 years. They did not even open the report to have a look at its recommendations. It was not until the advent of , a Labor Government in 1 972 that the report was brought out of the archives and action started to be taken on its recommendations. Of course, as the dairy industry realises now, had that report been consulted during the 12 years when it lay in . the pigeon-hole, the industry may well have been in a far better position today than it is currently. </para>
          <para>Some criticism has been levelled at the Labor Government during the period 1972-75. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> basically laid those untruths to rest. He said that the Whitlam Labor Government had started to face up to the basic problems confronting agriculture and the dairy industry in particular. It will be remembered that the Labor Government did not, in fact, have a 3-year term of office. It had two 1 8-month terms. It is asking a little too much for any government to overcome the residue of problems as a result of 23 years of mismanagement by another government. But, as I have said, the Labor Government when in office set out to restructure the industry by the implementation of some of the McCarthy Committee recommendations. As a basis for that move, it established the Australian Dairy Corporation in place of the old Australian Dairy Board. I think that those of us who were involved in politics of the industry knew pretty well that the old Australian Dairy Produce Board was a pretty political sort of operation. Unfortunately, there were members of the Board who perhaps could have been retired much earlier than they were. Thanks to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> the then Minister for Agriculture, over those two 18-months periods, that Australian Dairy Corporation was established. For the first time in the history of the dairy industry there was an authority looking after it which contained men with marketing expertise. Of course, the pity of it all is that before the new Dairy Corporation could get under way, another crisis overcame the industry. </para>
          <para>The dairy industry in my State of Victoria is- in my opinion, as one who has had over 40 years of experience in it- in the worst situation it has ever been in. The crisis in the industry, of course, is compounded by severe drought conditions right across the dairy areas of Victoria. It is compounded further by extremely low prices for chopper cattle. In fact, the current mode of operations is to give away stock or shoot stock. On top of all that, over quite large areas of Victoria there has been the worst cricket plague in living memory. Thousands of acres of pasture have been laid bare. Of course, there will be no recovery in those areas until perhaps mid or late spring. At the present time one of the other problems that is confronting the industry is the anomaly whereby factories, by virtue of their product, are paying different prices to farmers. The factory that my farm currently supplies is paying 60c per lb for refrigerated bulk milk. Adjoining farmers are receiving only 50c per lb for milk of the same quality. That situation again leads to stresses and strains among producers in the same industry. </para>
          <para>The cost of production as assessed by the Victorian Department of Agriculture is approximately 54c per lb. 1 think that it is actually 54.5c per lb. But this did not stop the farmers at the meeting at Warrnambool addressed by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> asking for a Government support of 70c per lb. I might indicate to the Senate that that meeting was the only one in the State of Victoria which was not organised by the new dairy farmers organisation, the United Dairy Farmers of Victoria. It was sponsored and run by the local farmers themselves. That probably accounts for the difference between the guaranteed price which that meeting sought and the price that was asked for at the other meetings, which was 55c per lb. </para>
          <para>Quite frankly, a Government guarantee of only 55c per lb will see thousands of dairy farmers walk off their properties. It will destroy the souls of those farmers and their families. If farmers are to remain viable in the industry I estimate that a guarantee of between 60c and 65c per lb is what is needed. As my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> said earlier, this problem is arising basically because of the extensive production of dairy products in the European Economic Community. I noted in statistical data presented in a paper some 6 weeks ago by the Dairy Corporation that in the EEC stocks of skim milk powder at 11 March this year were 1 157 681 tons or tonnes- I am not sure which-as against a holding at the same time last year of 398 937 tons or tonnes. That shows roughly a three-fold increase on stocks at hand in the past. When this sort of crisis has developed in the past- it has happened almost in the fashion of a miracle- one of the centrally planned economies has moved in and bought extensive stocks of skim milk powder at bargain or give away prices. It has cleared the market and allowed the Australian industry to export again at what was basically a paying price. Whether the same thing will happen again at this stage no one knows, but in the short term this is the only hope for the Australian dairy industry. </para>
          <para>Again, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> who has his finger right on the pulse, said, the problem in the EEC has been brought about because of the goals and the political aspirations of the Community itself for a common agricultural policy. The fact is that the governments of France and West Germany have been elected by virtue of the dairy vote. As politicians are the same all over the world, it is most unlikely that they will deprive those farmers of the high subsidy they are presently paying them and be kicked out of office for doing so. As far as one can see, perhaps for the next 5 years, we can expect this very inefficient dairy industry in the European Economic Community to be fostered by way of subsidy at the expense of the highly industrious and intense dairy farm areas of this country, particularly in Victoria and Tasmania, where the bulk of our export commodity is produced. </para>
          <para>Let me deal again with the position in my State of Victoria. It seems to take a crisis situation before governments move and before farmers will get together and finally decide to agree, even if it is only to disagree, or to come together concerning their differences. In Victoria the authorities have at last- only momentarily, regrettably stopped issuing dairy licences. The recent announcement by the Victorian Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Smith,</inline> was to the effect that the Victorian Government will be making moves to allow a wider spread of the liquid milk market over the whole of the industry rather than have it retained by what could only be termed the silvertails of the industry. Again, it took a crisis to bring that situation about. </para>
          <para>Just over 5 years ago I was in a rather invidious position myself. I appeared before a Victorian Milk Board inquiry to advocate that very theory. I proposed that the liquid milk market should be speed right across the board and that every dairy farmer producing milk of the quality required should have equal access to that market. I can well remember the  chairman  of that inquiry threatening me with all sorts of dire consequences because I told the truth. Unfortunately, I was not able to prove my claims because, to do so, I would have had to dob in all my mates, and I have never been one to do that. I was threatened with all sorts of diabolical punishments because I told the truth. I detailed the facts about the ports which were going on in the Victorian dairy industry at that time. </para>
          <para>I suppose that if I had the time, the ability and the research facilities now available, I would have been able to go further and find out the very things which the Victorian dairy industry inquiry found out and published in a report which it produced either late last year or early this year. It pointed out the ports and the rackets which were being perpetrated by certain vested interests in the dairy industry including certain industry factory managers and others in high positions who have used the knowledge that they have obtained from sources within the industry to line their pockets or to line the pockets of their factories with the attitude of letting those in the rest of the dairy industry go to hell. Again one hopes that the Victorian Government will take action in these areas to see that the industry is straightened out. </para>
          <para>I conclude on this note: As has already been said, I do not think any question can arise in the mind of any person who has had a look at the Australian dairy industry in recent times and our declining export markets as to the options available. There are 2 options available to governments of the day. We are talking about the Australian Government. One is to continue to subsidise the present number of dairy farmers at the present or increased rates of production. The longer the present situation continues, the higher the subsidies will need to be to keep dairy farmers above some form of peasantry. The price of doing that must be offset against the other option which is to rationalise the industry to a stage where it is producing sufficient for the home market and for the better paying export markets such as cheese in Japan, with some surplus to allow for adverse seasons and for the possibility of new markets in other areas of the world which would pay for those dairy products. Those are the 2 options which are available to the Government today. I hope that the Liberal and National Country Parties will see the light and press on with one of those options. </para>
          <para>Quite frankly, my option would be a pretty heavy rationalisation of the industry to remove dairy farmers from the form of peasantry in which they are currently. A number of them will not like it because this is the only life that they know. The problem must not be compounded by allowing young men to enter the industry, as thousands are doing at the moment, and finding themselves at the mercy of the money lenders of this country, with their wives and children being forced into work in the dairy and the cow yards Such a situation only brings the industry back to the state in which it was when I grew up. At that time it was a case of mum, dad and the kids all working in the dairy with mud up to their knees. Is was not very pleasant. But that is the future for the dairy industry in Australia unless this Government moves urgently, firmly and heavily. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I rise to support the Bills. In doing so I hope to be brief. A great deal has been said already about this subject. These Bills are important to the survival of this very important Australian primary industry. Some things have been said about the concern that has been expressed in Victoria. I think I should begin my remarks by saying a few words about that, I attended two of the marches in Victoria last week when 20 000 rural Victorians took to the streets. Among the men, women and children who marched were dairy farmers who had travelled many miles to attend, trade unionists in their overalls and dust coats, and businessmen in smart suits and ties. As one newspaper report aptly put it, 'while the curious looked on, the concerned marched in Leongatha, Maffra, </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Camperdown, Colac, Shepparton and Wodonga'. </para>
          <para>I think that for the first de- in Victoria in any event- a fundamental fact of economic life has been realised, namely, that the prosperity of cities and towns in rural Australia depends greatly on the prosperity of the primary industries that surround those cities and towns. I think that there is now an acute awareness in Victoria of the gravity of the situation in this respect. We are not conducting a post mortem on the industry today, but we do have a rescue operation to carry out urgently. For that reason the introduction of this legislation is very timely. </para>
          <para>I wish to reply, firstly, to the criticism- unfounded, of course- that has been levelled against the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> who complained about delays occurring while the Minister is grappling with this problem. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> had a great deal to say about the LiberalCountry Party Government being inactive up to 1972. The honourable senator shares an abysmal ignorance of the problems of this industry with the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating),</inline> who led the debate on this legislation in the other place. They have not done their homework on the economics of the industry because the fact is that this was a healthy, prosperous industry in most areas of Australia till 1972, which is when Britain joined the European Economic Community. Then the problems started. If the debate today is on who is responsible, the Government that was in power in Australia in 1972 and the subsequent 3 years must take the blame. </para>
          <para>As I have said, the introduction of this legislation is timely. I wish to deal very briefly with a few of its provisions. The $2m that is to be made available, in addition to the remedies that were available in the legislation passed in 1974, represents the provision of very important carry-on loans. A maximum of $4,000 is to apply in each case. These loans are very timely and reasonably generous in terms of the repayment and interest rates. They will materially assist in the short term a number of farmers whose asset position is sound but who, due to falling prices and circumstances entirely beyond their control, have temporary liquidity problems, such as the payment of rates, interest on mortgages and other regular outgoings. The States will be making a similar contribution. </para>
          <para>The 1974 legislation has resulted in considerable progress being made in Victoria in that many people who are no longer viable have been taken out of the industry. The legislation provides finance on generous terms and at a low rate of interest to enable a dairy farmer who is viable to take over an adjoining or neighbouring property of a smaller dairy farmer and thus build them into one viable unit. I pay tribute to the work of the Rural Finance and Settlement Commission in Victoria in this respect. There is, of course, an urgent need for greater activity this year because the crisis has become much worse. Undoubtedly more people will have to be taken out of the industry. As I have said, this legislation provides short term assistance to the industry. he problems in the long term are grave. </para>
          <para>As the Minister has said, first of all the industry will have to be buttressed and maintained until the end of August by the sort of assistance that is already being given of subsidising the price at the level of 50c per lb to enable the farmers to stay in business. That type of assistance will have to continue. I support the policy announced last week by the VDU and the survival figure of 55c per lb. It is true, of course, that until 1 8 months ago people were getting 70c per lb, but with the compounding of the markets and the general situation one must look to a survival figure that will enable the industry to carry on until the unprofitable farmers are taken out of it and those who are viable remain in it. All State governments have agreed to limit production. </para>
          <para>I await the presentation of the Crawford report, which is due at the end of August. Without in any way anticipating what the report will say or pre-empting what its recommendations will be, I take the view that if the industry is to survive it must be placed on a federal basis like wheat, wool and our other great primary industries. State jealousies must be forgotten. </para>

            <para>- It is not centralism. I do not have time to digress. I have only a few minutes left in which to speak, so do not interrupt me. The situation is that stabilisation is wanted in this industry in place of the outdated and inadequate equalisation scheme. The price of milk is different in different cities. The price of milk in Sydney is 20c a pint, or something like that, more than it is in Melbourne. The High Court said recently that milk can be sold interstate. If the interstate barriers are not preserved in the short term this industry will collapse. I hope and trust that the Crawford report will provide some guidelines for putting the industry on a sound federal basis whereby everyone in the industry will receive the same price for his product. That will enable the more efficient dairy farmers to survive. Those who are inefficient will have to get out. We have to face the facts. I agree with the second option of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer.</inline> The industry must be rationalised and stabilised. I have every confidence that within the relatively short term of two or three years it will come back to be one of the great primary industries of this nation. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Tehan</inline>castigated my colleagues the honourable member for Blaxland <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Keating)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> for failing to do their homework. I think that he also used the word 'ignorance' with respect to their comments upon the dairy industry. I find it more than a little ironic that, having laid that charge against my colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> then proceeded to display a monumental ignorance of the subject to which he was addressing himself. That was shown very clearly in, I think, his second last sentence when he referred to a difference in the price of liquid milk of 20c a pint or something like that, between Sydney and Melbourne. In fact, the difference in price is 7c for 600 millilitres. But that was a minor error compared with the other gross errors in the speech he has just delivered. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> a healthy, prosperous industry existed prior to 1972. Evidently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> 's knowledge of the dairy industry suffers from the same gaps as the knowledge of a certain ecclesiastical gentleman who wrote a pontifical letter to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> a few weeks ago. I wonder whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> or the worthy canon whose name I have forgotten has ever heard of the report published by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics in 1967 that is commonly known as the Mackay report, which in fact showed that 27 per cent of the dairy farmers in the manufacturing sector of the industry had cash incomes of less than $1,000 and that something like 42 per cent had cash incomes of less than $2,000. If that fits <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> 's definition of a healthy and prosperous industry, his standards are certainly extremely low. It is a good example of the point that I was trying to drive home particularly to members of the National Country Party earlier today. They would do a great service to the people whom they claim to represent if they paid more attention to truth and less attention to popularity. </para>
          <para>This healthy, prosperous industry was analysed very perceptively by the Dairy Industry Committee of Inquiry, the report of which was published in 1960. That Committee of Inquiry is commonly known as the McCarthy Inquiry. It elucidated all the problems of the industry which had existed for more than a decade prior to the report being published. Of course, that report was then promptly ignored by the Liberal and National Country Parties right up until 1970 when the force of circumstance became so intense and the reality became so obvious that they could no longer totally ignore the report. They introduced the marginal dairy farm reconstruction scheme which helped a little bit. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> should have said that if the LiberalCountry Party Government had not been inactive up until 1972 the industry's problems would not be quite so bad as they in fact are. </para>
          <para>The conservative government in his own State of Victoria was far from inactive during the 1960s. After the publication of the Mackay report and of the report of the Dairy Industry Committee of Inquiry, the Victorian Government was still sponsoring land settlement and/or irrigation schemes in order to settle new farmers, to establish new dairy farms, to add to the chronic problem of surplus capacity in the industry. Indeed, as recently as this year- this is almost unbelievable- the Victorian Government placed dairy farmers, gullible and unfortunate individuals, on new dairy farms in the irrigation area at Rochester. As I mentioned last week when commenting on this particularly lunatic scheme, we have this absurd position where the Victorian Government, using money supplied by its own taxpayers and by the national Government, supplies irrigation water to dairy farmers at about half its economic cost. This Government then subsidises the fertilisers that the farmers use on the irrigated pastures, and the final product is butter which is extremely difficult to sell and skim milk powder which the Australian Dairy Corporation currently is trying to flog off to Japan at $150 a tonne as stock feed. That is the absurd position in which the activity rather than the inactivity of Liberal-Country Party government has placed the dairying industry. I will say no more about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> 's particularly ill informed contribution to this debate except to repeat the advice that I offered to the Liberal and Country Parties earlier: They would do a great service to their constituents, to the people who misguidedly put their faith in them to represent them in this Parliament, if they were to pay more attention to the truth and less attention to conventional wisdom. </para>
          <para>As I have said, the dairy industry's problems go back a long way. The current crisis was partially unforeseen insofar as the catastrophic decline in the price of skim milk powder, to which I think other speakers in the debate have referred, was not entirely foreseeable. Nevertheless, that catastrophic decline should not be allowed to obscure the fact that the industry has chronic problems which extend back for more than <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> decades. The only permanent solution for the industry most members of the Liberal and Country Parties have recognised this from 1970 inwards is, firstly, an absolute reduction in the quantity of products supplied, in the volume of production, and, secondly, an amalgamation of the smaller and generally uneconomic units. Coincidental with those 2 matters is a tendency to move dairying from those areas where the physical environment is unfavourable. </para>
          <para>It is difficult to assess the correct size of the dairy industry in the future because it depends on so many variables which are totally beyond the control of an Australian government. One of those variables is the climate, the seasonal factors. The second is the actions which foreign governments may take which may interfere with the free trading of dairy products. But it seems to be agreed by most people who have looked rationally at the industry- that probably excludes nearly every honourable senator opposite who has spoken in this debate- and by many of the more enlightened people within the industry that the most sensible objective of the policy would be for the industry to contract to something like the size of the domestic market, with some safety margin for exports and some safety margin for filling in the deficiencies in supply to the domestic market in bad seasons and also to that very limited export market which may return profitable prices. Indeed, the Australian Agricultural Council has announced its commitment to a policy like this. On the evidence available now that appears to be the most sensible policy for governments to pursue. Even this Government seems to be pursuing that policy, although it will have enormous difficulties coping with the parochial prejudices of various State governments. This is one area in which 1 agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan.</inline> Probably it requires some strong action at a national level to ensure that the parochial interests of State dairy industries are not allowed to become operative to the detriment of the dairy industry as a whole. </para>
          <para>Something else which is a concomitant of a sensible policy for the dairy industry is the proposition that people, including dairy farmers' sons, must move out of the industry. Something which will handicap that proposition quite considerably is the sort of view which was expressed by the honourable member for Darling Downs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr McVeigh)</inline> in the House of Representatives on 1 August 1974. In criticising the Marginal Dairy Farms Agreement Bill, he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Firstly, there is no allowance under the proposal for a son to buy out his father and thus retain the family dairy farm. Sons of farmers are obviously the best dairy farmers of all. They have had instilled into them at the knee of practical experience the way that things are best done. They also have the typical love of the land. Provision should have been made in the scheme so that sons could take over the family farm and retain it. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That sort of primitive agricultural fundamentalism has no place in the formulation of a rational policy for the dairy industry. </para>
          <para>The other point on which I wish to make a few comments concerns the 2-price scheme, as it is commonly known, which prevails in the industry throughout Australia; the marketing arrangements under which there is a preferred privileged class of dairy farmers who supply the liquid milk market and a victimised class of dairy farmers who supply the manufacturing market. Earlier I referred to the Dairy Industry Committee of Inquiry of 1960. The report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the dairy industry of 23 October 1975 refers to the report of the Dairy Industry Committee of Inquiry. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The conclusions drawn by that Committee were that the high prices paid for fluid milk in some Milk Board areas  . . do a great disservice to the dairy industry. They create a feeling of injustice in those sections of the industry that do not share them. They tend to raise the costs of cattle and land; adopted in one area they establish arguments for adoption in others; and most importantly of all they restrict the consumption of a nutritious food and cause an increase in the volume of surplus butter for export'. The Committee of Inquiry concluded that 'There is only one answer to the problem of high prices for liquid milk and that is to reduce them'. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">In that one passage the 4 most objectionable features of these discriminatory pricing arrangements are spelt out. They include the inevitability of arrangements between dairy farmers themselves, the fact that the market price of milk quotas represents capitalised monopoly profit. Let us be completely clear about that: If the price of milk was not excessively high, the right to supply milk in itself would not have a market value. Whatever the value of milk quotas may be- it appears to be between $300 and $350 in Western Australia, and it is alleged to be about $500 in New South Wales if quotas were freely traded- it represents capitalised monopoly profit. There are objectionable political side effects to this, such as Ministers in the previous coalition government in New South Wales holding quotas to supply 3000 gallons of milk a day, the market value of which, had they been freely negotiable, would have been in the vicinity of $150,000. That represents a gift from the milk consumers of New South Wales to Cabinet Ministers in the previous coalition Government in New South Wales. </para>
          <para>The other points which were encompassed show that the quotas add to the surplus of manufactured milk products. Because the supplies of liquid milk obtain prices which are two are three times the prices obtained by producers of manufactured milk and because the producers probably fail to distinguish adequately between their average price and their marginal price they are given a buffer- an area within which they can significantly expand their marginal production which will be sold at manufacturing milk prices, whilst still retaining a very satisfactory average price for themselves. Apart from the probability that that does not even maximise the income for the individual it imposes additional pressures on those producers whose outlet is restricted to the market for manufactured products. It causes extra and unnecessary competition for struggling dairy farmers in that area and featherbeds regional inefficiency in production itself. </para>
          <para>The survey conducted in my own State of Western Australia by the Department of Agriculture in 1975 showed- the figures varied a bit from region to region so I will quote round figures- the return on farm for liquid milk was 60c a gallon and the return for manufactured milk was 22c a gallon. The liquid milk market is supplied mainly from the region close to Perth, much of which is irrigated. The cost of production, as assessed by the departmental formula however fallible that formula may be, the same formula was used in all areas- was shown in this survey to have been in the vicinity of 60c a gallon in that region while in the Busselton zone, which was not irrigated and which had only just recently moved into the liquid milk market area, the cost of production was 40c a gallon. That was not accidental. The fact that traditional liquid milk producers had been feather bedded and had enjoyed the monopoly returns which accrued from the captive market for many years had led to the development of inefficiency in production, whereas the people who recently had been butterfat dairy farmers had to be very efficient to survive. The consequence of that efficiency was shown in the production costs of ex-butterfat dairy farmers being only two-thirds of those in the other sectors. </para>

              <para>- It applies also in Victoria, my colleague tells me. Of course, I am not as familiar with the regional situation in Victoria as he would be. I find it particularly disturbing, in view of the strong criticism of this discriminatory pricing arrangement which goes right back to the 1960s, that the present Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> in a speech to dairy farmers at Warrnambool, Victoria, on 24 May last proposed that an excise- although he did not call it an excise, conceptually it should be regarded as an exercise- ought to be applied to liquid milk sales which could then be redistributed among the manufacturing sector of the industry. I quote his words from a Press statement which was issued subsequent to that address: </para>

          <para class="block">Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> in his in-depth study of the matter did not even read the Press release his own Minister put out. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> continued: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">What <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is proposing in that sentence is that the price of milk to consumers in Victoria ought to be increased and the additional money spread around the poverty section of the industry, that is, the manufacturing sector. </para>
          <para>Let it be very clear that what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is proposing for Victoria is that people in Melbourne should pay up to 7c extra per 600 ml container for their milk. That is what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is proposing. I hope the people of Melbourne and of the country towns throughout Victoria, where people also buy milk in 600 ml containers, realise precisely what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is proposing and that they let <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> know their reaction. Apart from that aspect, for the industry as a whole that is not a satisfactory arrangement. The IAC report commented that the demand for milk was not totally elastic in response for price changes. In other words, an increase in price in real terms will lead to reduced consumption of liquid milk. This is precisely what has happened throughout the last 10 years. Page 220 of the IAC report shows the apparent consumption of liquid milk in 1963 to have been 129 litres per capita. and in 1974 the figure had fallen to 122 litres per capita. I do not have any more recent figures than the 1974 figure. </para>
          <para>History has shown us- and I think market surveys have shown the same thing- that the response to a significant increase in milk price especially if it is in one lump- will be a decline in the quantity purchased. Not only is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair's</inline> proposition objectionable from the viewpoint of society as a whole but also it has serious defects even from within the narrow perspective of the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> is proposing that dairy farmers should price themselves out of the most lucrative section of their market by price increases. Whatever the justification may be for price increases to these dairy farmers- I accept that the justification in the short term is considerable for providing either strictly welfare assistance, clearly delineated as welfare assistance, or finance for reconstruction within the industry, and the reality is that reconstruction also means contraction- the payment should come through the tax system from society as a whole and not from the people who purchase milk in Melbourne and in the other towns of Victoria as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sinclair</inline> has proposed. </para>

            <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> could only match his wisdom with his arrogance the dairy herds of Australia would be chewing the cud very quietly tonight. I have heard these pseudo economists, these pastoral amateurs and these ranting farmers turned politic before, and have not heard any advice that is worth listening to. The plain fact is that when a primary industry gets into uneconomic circumstances there are all sorts of economic analyses to show why it should not be assisted. Let us look at the causes that the gentry from the other side have given us for the industry's predicament today. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> says that there is a drought in Victoria. Will that continue this year, next year or the year after? Then there are low prices being paid for chopper cows. Is that concomitant with the beef market? Will it continue. Then there is a cricket plague. I thought that one of its specimens had got into the chamber when I was listening to the speech. Then the factories are paying different prices. These are the causes of the economic depression in this area! Then another wiseacre comes forward and says that due to Britain's going into the European Economic Market, the export market has turned against dairy products. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>On the concession of the great agricultural analyst, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> a largely unforeseeable and sudden collapse took place in the overseas market for processed milk. What these gentlemen forget is that we have had rapid inflation of gigantic proportions fed and encouraged by a government for the past 3 years, so that the cost-price ratio sustained by the dairy farmer has gone bitterly against him. The prices of his products have gone down and his costs have gone up. We have had this illustrated by reference to the price of whole milk having gone down to 55c in some States and to 45c in some places. But that has not stopped a wholesale claim for complete indexation upwards for the wage earners of the country. </para>
          <para>We are debating a miserable Bill to make available a minute sum- $3.5m- as extra assistance. I say that it is altogether insufficient. But we are debating it. What did the plateau indexation of wages cost? It cost $700m. What would full indexation of wages cost? It would cost $ 1 , 1 00 m . Yet we are debating the economics of an industry where the assistance for this year on an emergency basis is $3.5m. </para>
          <para>Take this assistance in line with other dear babies of the socialist Opposition. Do honourable senators know what we are paying this year in pre-maternity leave to public servants? Just twice the proposed assistance to the milk industry $7m. Do honourable senators know the loss that we are making on the Canberra bus service which serves this little community? It is a loss of $4.2m-$700,000 more than the proposed increase. What are we paying for unemployment? As much as $500m. Yet these geniuses are advocating that, because of the present uneconomics of the dairy industry, the amount of assistance to the industry should be reduced. They say the sons of dairymen must get off the land. They conveniently forget the prices at which the properties would have to be sold, including plant and herds. Where are the farmers to go to? To the ranks of the unemployed who are already subtracting from the Treasury $500m this year due to an abysmal collapse of commonsense and a pathetic failure to understand what work and business is and of how money has to be kept to a value to equate it. This argument comes from those people who supported <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> through the last 3 years of tragic misjudgment in the financial control of this country. </para>
          <para>Then we notice that the price factor on our exports is most severe. Last year we paid just $8m to about 13 000 gentlemen on the waterfront and expect to pay about $ 12m this year for idle time- idle time, defended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer,</inline> defended by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> and, of course, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> who led for the Opposition in this debate in his new found role, with that charm of novelty that a new proposition brings to him. He has even grown a little benign because some acquaintance with the farming features of a decent life where men work has given his otherwise class-pursuing attitude a little benificence. He defends the payment of $8m to 13 000 waterside workers for idle time. Just because the agricultural industries, which produce 50 per cent of our exports, are down to 6 per cent of the vote the Opposition wants to ignore them and give them only the pickings, or a bit of sour milk, or the crumb of cheesecake. We will be paying $3.5m as a supplement to dairy farmers and $8m for idle time for the waterfront workers. </para>
          <para>I have been here for some time. I was here when the McCarthy report was presented. We have these people who have come into the Senate, whose avalanche of new experience, acquired so quickly, amazes me. They assume that the McCarthy report was not considered. They say it was pigeonholed for 12 years. I remember vividly its coming into our Party room. The proposition was put: 'It is on the table for study. Next week, is anybody going to put forward a proposition in favour of this report?' There was a deathly silence. Nobody would advocate such depressive measures. We rejected the report out of hand. Why? These wise acres forget that at that time the mining wealth of Australia had not been discovered. Australia's potential for exports to maintain the balance of payments depended upon primary production. Our policy then was insistent that we would have 2 blades of grass growing where one was growing then. It was imperative that the dairy farms should go on and expand, and the beef farms should expand, the wheat acres should expand, and the wool farms should expand. </para>
          <para>Then we came to the experience of the European Economic Community getting under way in the early 1960s. We were told that the dairy industry of the EEC was such that it has a surplus of butter- it was not safe to go to Belgium lest a wall of sour cheese or curved milk should fall on you and overwhelm you. A delegation of this Parliament came back and said: Curtail your dairy products'. Two years later we were getting the best prices we have got in the postwar period. These are the gentlemen who ought to heed Thomas Jefferson's words: </para>

          <para class="block">That is an illustration of Canberra telling this industry what to do. </para>
          <para>There have been many absolutely erroneous figures quoted here today. An unpardonable exaggeration was made on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> when he referred to $350m being made available to primary industry for wool. He well knows that that is a banking loan which is only guaranteed by the Government- a loan lent to the wool industry on commercial terms.  His  Party, when previously in Opposition, was opposed to any assistance to the wool industry because the wool industry at the time was depressed. If we had succumbed to this melancholy, mildewed outlook instead of tiding an industry through its ups and downs and seeing it over a survey of 1 5 years we simply would have given nothing to the wool industry. </para>
          <para>In order to correct these exaggerated figures, I have had prepared a table showing assistance given to the industry over the years from 1970 to 1975. I would be grateful if the table could be circulated to honourable senators. The figures have been prepared for me by the Department of Primary Industry, so they can be taken as correct. In 1970-71 the grand total of assistance was $60.4m, and of that $ 12.7m was devaluation compensation. Assistance by way of butter and cheese bounties amounted to $4 1.5m. Then we come to the 3 inflated Whitlam years and we find that in 1972-73 total assistance was reduced from $60.4m to $33. 1 m, and the bounty also was reduced. In 1 974-75, the last year of the Whitlam era, total assistance was reduced to $ 18.8m and the bounty almost disappeared. In the present year, the year in which Whitlam was kicked out constitutionally, to the great credit of the Constitution of this country, the bounty has almost disappeared at $1.3m. All through those years, instead of increased assistance based upon a bounty and devaluation to compensate for adverse export circumstances, assistance has been reduced from $60.4m in 1970 to the present figure of $20m for this year. If the $3.5m which is being voted under this Bill is included, the amount for this year is $23.5m. </para>
          <para>In an era when wages increased by from 80 per cent to 100 per cent and the export and domestic prices of dairy products were reduced, government policy reduced assistance to an industry confronting those adverse economic circumstances from $60m to $23m. When it is considered that that $23m, at 1970 values, is today worth only about $1 lm, the extent of the downturn of government assistance to the industry becomes apparent. What is wanted for this industry is more money, in the same way as other items of beneficence have come from the exchequer to tide this industry over temporary economic circumstances. As surely as night follows day and as surely as summer follows winter, so too will the varied circumstances of our world provide markets for dairy products. They are a fundamental product for human consumption and for other purposes. </para>
          <para>These little men, these miserable men, these socialist men who only give public money where they cannot multiply votes and in this area because the agriculture industries as a whole provided only 6 per cent of the votes, they ignored them, But they gave $8m for idle time on the waterfront, $500m for the unemployed, and all the rest of their squander mania. This subsidy of $23m should be at least $63m, and then the dairy farmers who are in such a plight economically would be able to exist through the trough of this depression and make their own decisions, with the aid of a rural bank and other proper mechanisms which ought to be introduced into the financial structure to assist them to make their own decisions. Then, according to the prosperity of the beef industry, the wheat industry, the fruit growing industry, according to other opportunities, they will be able to decide whether the dairy industry should be reduced or whether it should be destroyed, as the socialists here say. </para>

            <para>- in reply- It has not been possible for me to be here for the whole of the debate on this matter, for which I have some regret. However, I am very pleased that I was here to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> to see the table he presented and have a little time to look at it, and to hear his general views on the industry and its current problems. These Bills are not opposed. There is no point in my spending a long time developing various arguments when no arguments were developed against the Bill. People are very concerned about the industry, and they are genuinely concerned. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I have taken quite serious note of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said. My job here, representing the Minister, is to communicate to the Minister some of the comments made in this debate, particularly those of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> and to submit the table he has produced. I add to that my own observation, which of course belongs entirely to me and not to the Government or anybody else, that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said about primary industry has been my own experience. Whatever else you do, you do not just give up and walk away. Historically, Australia has demonstrated that most of the industries that were thought to be no good are capable of reviving, given proper assistance and proper support. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition opposes the States Grants (Hospital Operating Costs) Bill 1976. The superficial aim of this Bill is to provide funds from the Commonwealth to the States for hospital costs allegedly because the hospital agreements between the Commonwealth and the States negotiated last year are invalid. The Opposition, together with many others, does not accept that these agreements are invalid. Even if they were, we believe it would be better for the Commonwealth to introduce, and more appropriate for this Parliament to pass, validating legislation for those agreements. The true reason for this Bill is that the Government wishes to renege on the Commonwealth-State hospital agreements. It is using the opinion of 2 lawyers, one a Minister in the present Government, to dishonour the agreements and negotiate new ones. The Government is determined to opt out of its responsibility to fund public hospitals. It is already doing so in another sphere- repatriation. The Minister for Repatriation <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> has announced that the Government will save $2.2m on repatriation costs by admitting repatriation pensioners to public hospitals as hospital service patients. What the Minister does not say is that in doing this the States will have to pay the $2.2m saved by the Commonwealth because the States pay 50 per cent of the cost of hospital service patients. This is the first Government in the history of this country to refuse to accept full responsibility for repatriation patients. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The history of this legislation is very interesting. The Government was determined for ideological reasons to dismantle the system of health funding we have in this country. First of all, it announced the new Medibank changes. The Opposition accepts that the Government has the numbers in this and the other chamber to pass legislation to force such changes through. The Government announced at the same time that the hospital funding system would have to change and that it would like to renegotiate the agreements which were negotiated last year between the States and the Commonwealth. However the State governments, including the conservative State governments led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen, Mr Hamer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Court, did not like this and they pointed out to the Commonwealth that they already had written agreements, and they made threatening noises and told the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> just where they stood. They said that they did not want these agreements torn up; they wanted them to continue. And so they should. Then and only then was it conveniently discovered that in the late night hours <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> and the Solicitor-General gave opinions that the agreements were invalid and, in the words of the Prime Minister, the Auditor-General would not approve the paying of these funds. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> said that this was very unfortunate and that the agreements now would have to be renegotiated. </para>
          <para>These agreements between the various States and the Commonwealth were drawn up after hard, long and careful negotiation between the Commonwealth and the States. The legal officers of the Commonwealth and the States were involved. In Tasmania both Houses of Parliament looked at the agreement. The legal officers of the Queensland, Tasmanian, Victorian, Western Australian and New South Wales Governments still assert that the agreements are valid. It has been revealed that the Auditor-General has never questioned the payments and has not given the opinion that they should not be paid. We now have the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon),</inline> seeing a good thing going, I suppose, announcing that he is looking at the legal technicalities of the various transport agreements between the Commonwealth and the States that come under his jurisdiction, to see whether he can get out of his responsibilities. This is a sordid and shabby episode in government in this country. </para>
          <para>The Government on advice conveniently coming just at the right time intends going back on negotiated agreements with the States in a vital area of national interest. It does not intend to introduce legislation to overcome the objections of its advisers but will use them instead to bargain with the States. As I said before, in Tasmania the agreements were looked at not only by the legal officers of the Tasmanian Government but by both Houses of the Parliament. They were passed by both Houses of Parliament. The present Government's Liberal Party colleagues in the Tasmanian Parliament did not question the validity of these agreements at any stage. The Opposition believes that if in the future of this country Commonwealth and State agreements are to be upset on the views of 2 lawyers and then this discovery is to be used to negotiate previously agreed conditions, Commonwealth-State relations will be a shambles. Agreements will be utterly worthless. </para>
          <para>We oppose the legislation, first of all, because we believe it is unnecessary. We oppose it because we believe it is an example of unscrupulous and dishonest behaviour by the Government. We suspect the way in which the alleged legal technicalities were discovered. We express our concern because if this sort of behaviour goes on the future of Federal-State relations in this country will be very dicey indeed. I believe that in those few short words I have summed up our disagreement with the Bill. We intend to vote against the motion that the Bill be read a second time but shall not continue the argument any more. </para>

            <para>-The Road Safety and Standards Authority (Repeal) Bill 1976 repeals the Road Safety Standards Authority Act 1975 which provided for the establishment of an independent statutory authority to spearhead a major drive for road safety in this country. I suppose this Bill is symbolic of a lot of other things which this Government is doing. For the major part of this session, inside and outside Parliament, the Government appears to have been wrecking the legislation instituted over 3 years of Labor Government. I feel that I should say many things but I propose to keep my remarks as short as possible. I believe a number of points ought to go on the record. As I mentioned earlier the Bill was initiated by the Labor Government, as were so many other facets of life in this country which were long overdue. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Reduction of the carnage on our roads is a major priority of the Australian Labor Party in government or out of government, even if that is not a priority as far as members of the coalition parties are concerned. Naturally we intend to oppose the Bill. The Australian Labor Party views this legislation as another nail in the coffin of the continued safety of motorists on Australian roads. This Bill is another example of redirection of expenditure by the conservative government from urbanised areas into rural areas. We do not criticise the suggestion that rural roads ought to be upgraded. But the general attitude of the Government appears to be that we look after a minority in the community at the expense of the very great majority. I have continually complained about this situation in relation to Queensland where, providing one has some friends in the National Country Party of Australia somewhere, roads are built or maintained at a reasonable standard. There are other areas where this sort of action does not take place. Already we have witnessed the transfer of $ 13.2m from the national highways and urban local roads to the rural roads. The bulk of this finance, interestingly of course, is going to the home State of the Minister. I suppose he has to protect the home State because that is where his votes come from. </para>
          <para>This highlights the sectional attitude of the Government and of the Country Party tail wagging the Liberal Party dog. This rural vote buying by the Country Party dominated Government will be at the expense of many lives on Australian roads over the next 3 years. The abolition of the Road Safety and Standards Authority to save a mere $700,000 in the calendar year or, expressed in decimal points, .003 per cent of the total Budget outlay, at the expense of many lives can only be described as scandalous and callous. Road safety is one of the most distressing problems currently facing our society. This Government is now demolishing one of the means whereby that problem could have been efficiently and thoroughly analysed. During the period of the Labor Government, we consistently gave encouragement to road safety organisations. We endeavoured to introduce legislation to improve the standard of construction of motor vehicles. We endeavoured to introduce a lot of other measures that would have reduced the carnage on the roads. Some of the figures I am about to cite are nothing less than frightening. </para>
          <para>The reasons given by the Minister for Transport for the abolition of the Road Safety and Standards Authority indicate his complete lack of understanding of the functions of the Authority. The small savings in administrative costs, the avoidance of unnecessary duplication those are his words- and the more efficient use of staff are irrelevant in terms of the lives saved by the concept of the Authority. When the Minister introduced the Bill he confined his remarks to approximately 5 minutes, indicating the scant regard of the conservatives for road safety and his smugness in their numbers. If the debate had been on the lives of cattle- this applies particularly to the National Country Party- we would no doubt have been subjected to a long winded speech and one of dubious value. It should be brought home to Government senators that the numbers in the Parliament will be changed in 3 years. It is the repeal of legislation like the Road Safety and Standards Authority legislation that will get them seriously off side with the people who elect governments. They expect a government to solve problems which they themselves are unable to solve. The road carnage is one of these problems. </para>
          <para>It is obvious to everyone that road safety is a matter of great national concern. It has been estimated that the annual cost in monetary terms exceeds $ 1 billion. In other words, it is 2 per cent of the gross national product. In addition, during the 10-year period from 1965 to 1975- these are the latest figures available- 35 000 Australians were killed on roads. That figure represents more than the total population of a fairly large sized city. In 1974-75, 90 000 Australians were maimed or injured in road accidents. In the 12-month period ending April 1976, 3618 Australians were killed on our roads, yet the Government is so short-sighted as to repeal legislation that may have done something in the long term or in the short term to reduce this carnage. The figures I have cited represent the approximate voting power of four or five urban electorates or up to 10 country electorates. Since most deaths occur on urban roads, it is obvious that the deaths of urban voters stirs little regret or emotion in the members of the National Country Party which dominates this Government. </para>
          <para>The scandal and outrage that the Opposition and the Australian people feel about the high handed activities of the Government will be expressed over the next 3 years and most forcefully and finally in December 1978, or before then if an election is held before that date. This is consistent with what I have been saying in the Senate during the whole of this sessional period, namely, that the people in the community who have to suffer most are those who cannot defend themselves or speak for themselves. We have seen this attitude of the Government in just about every piece of legislation that has come before the Senate. We have seen the forecasts of expenditure cuts affecting those sections of the community who can least afford them. The people who are being deprived today of unemployment benefits and, in the long term, those who do not receive enough to sustain themselves, will be in exactly the same position as those who are now being deprived of the means of obtaining safety measures on the road. The Opposition opposes the Bill. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I think that the record should be put straight. The Road Safety and Standards Authority Repeal Bill does not abolish any functions in terms of road safety and standards within the Government function, nor does it diminish them in any way. What it does is to transfer the administration from a separate authority to the Department. I repeat the assurance given by the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> in another place that there will be no diminution of effort in terms of road safety measures and standards. The functions will be carried out. By carrying them out in this way we will have them carried out at least equally as strongly. We have a total dedication to reducing accidents and of deaths on the road. At the same time, we will save public moneys in so doing. </para>

            <para>-The States Grants (Air Quality Monitoring) Bill provides for financial assistance to the States for purposes connected with the monitoring of the quality of the outdoor atmosphere. The Opposition does not oppose the Bill but I want to make a couple of comments, in particular with reference to statements made in the second reading speech of the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> as recorded on page 2210 of Senate Hansard of 2 June 1976. He said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Air pollution levels in some of our cities are approaching, and on some occasions have already exceeded, safe community health levels set by the World Health Organisation. The need for monitoring of air pollution as a precursor to stricter controls in some locations is therefore urgent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I pause there briefly to state that some of the monitoring of air around our major cities and the industrial areas of those cities in particular leaves a lot to be desired. Not only does this apply to the major capital cities. It applies also to many of the provincial areas, particularly in the inland areas where, apparently, air currents do not shift away the pollutants in the atmosphere as successfully as they are sometimes shifted in air currents in areas near the coast. There is a definite weakness in a lot of the State legislation. Alternatively, if there is not a weakness, the legislation is not observed in the way it ought to be observed. I refer particularly to those areas where mining activities are being carried on and specifically where there is some form of manufacturing process in operation. </para>
          <para>In another part of his speech, the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Current metropolitan air monitoring programs in each State differ in instrumentation and procedures. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is an understatement of the facts and an over-simplification of the whole case. The fact is that money must come from the Australian Government as part of its contribution to the States so that they may set up the procedures for monitoring and, if necessary, insist by regulation that the local legislation be carried out. This is in itself a warning to the Australian Government that we ought to be taking a greater responsibility in this field. I would suggest that, on future occasions when legislation of this nature comes before the Parliament, the responsible Minister might go into greater detail in setting out the areas of responsibility for the State and in setting out the areas of responsibility of the Australian Government to ensure that, when money is granted to the States in this respect or when financial assistance is provided in any way, the States carry out the job for which those grants are being made. May I say with respect to the committees of this Parliament and legislation in those areas over which the Australian Government has control, we ought to be much stricter and we ought to bring down the type of legislation which totally and completely forces those people who pollute the air to carry out the control measures required of them properly and in accordance with the provisions of the appropriate legislation. We do not oppose the Bill. </para>

            <para>- It seems quite prophetic that the Senate should be discussing this Bill today when yesterday the Senate Standing Committee on Science and the Environment presented its report on air pollution in this chamber and also, as I understand, tomorrow is environment day- or to-day- in the United States of America. The main thrust of the report presented by the Senate Committee yesterday was directed towards the need to develop a co-ordinated Commonwealth-State approach to air pollution. The report highlighted further measures which should be introduced without delay. Let me name a few of those. They include: Improved public transport systems with added incentive for their greater use; decentralisation of commercial and industrial activities with attendant planning controls to minimise local pollution; and improved urban traffic flow achieved through careful evaluation of improved secondary roads systems and traffic control. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I regret that some headlines in newspapers related to the report were grossly distorted and alarmist in their character, particularly with respect to the Concorde aircraft. This prompts me to quote very quickly a couple of sentences from 2 articles that I read on this type of alarmist headline. I quote first from an article in the <inline font-style="italic">New Scientist</inline> dated 26 June 1975 under the heading <inline font-style="italic">The Danger of Environmental Jitters.</inline> The article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Scientists who encourage public fears on the basis of incomplete or ill-digested evidence constitute a serious environmental problem. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>It goes on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>People worry about things they do not understand because they do not understand them. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I refer also to another article in another science magazine called <inline font-style="italic">Science</inline> in which I noticed this sentence which I thought was quite significant: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The discovery of a new environmental problem unfortunately often brings with it both claims of imminent disaster and bland denials that the problem exists at all. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">These are 2 examples of the points of view that one is faced with on any matter associated with pollution. One of the important aspects about the activities of Senate committees is that different thoughts are examined as are different points of view with the idea of arriving at some compromise which will satisfy the demands of conservationists on one hand and scientific progress on the other. The article from the magazine <inline font-style="italic">Science</inline> was concluded quite amusingly, I thought, by the journalist when he wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whether alarmist statements can be attributed to what one scientist described as 'the smell of a Nobel Prize' or simply to poor judgment, they have not served to increase the credibility of a serious problem. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I say that because too frequently we are confronted with alarmist headlines that cause unnecessary concern to the public. I now refer very quickly to the Bill and to the second reading speech. The Bill provides $200,000 for 1975-76. Appropriations for each subsequent year will be according to future needs and within the Budget context. I question whether this is sufficient to undertake an adequate monitoring system throughout Australia. I also question whether it is sufficient to provide the technological capacity to monitor the upper atmosphere. I conclude by asking the Government seriously to consider this very important aspect of its funding in future years. </para>

          <para class="block">To illustrate the motive for that question- being a New South Welshman, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> will appreciate this- let me remind him that in the central western suburbs of Sydney there was a long guerilla war between the citizens of east </para>
          <para class="block">Concord and Bushells Pty Ltd over the company's failure to control the odours- I will not say that they were objectionable odours- of tea, coffee and other by-products. A local urban action committee found that reports were never made available to anyone except the State Pollution Control Commission and Bushells. What I am getting at is that if we believe in more people having a say in decisions, somewhere along the line these findings and these readings should be made public property. They should not merely be available to governments but also to <inline font-style="italic">bona fine</inline> groups of citizens. </para>
          <para>My other point follows on what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> had to say about the sharing of information on atmospheric pollution. I believe that there was a lack of liaison, whatever may have been our private and ultimate decision, about the Concorde aircraft. As honourable senators know, I received reports from the United Nations in Jamaica 2 months ago but there was no feedback to the States or to the Commonwealth Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. I simply put my question to the Minister and say that there must be better communication. We can take consolation from the fact that both the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution and the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution advocated a national body. We have a co-ordinated body. It is a shandygaff, but at least it is a start. </para>

            <para>- I am taking both of these Bills on behalf of the Opposition. Might I say, firstly, in respect of the Family Law Amendment Bill that the Parliamentary Labor Party has considered this matter and decided, insofar as its members are concerned, that there should be a free vote on the Bill. Insofar as the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill is concerned the Party, as a Party, does not offer any opposition to the Bill. The Bill puts into effect the decisions of the Remuneration Tribunal in respect of judges of the Family Court who at this stage, as I understand it, are being paid at a lower rate than they should be. The date on which the legislation is to be given effect is 5 January last. I assume that the level presently set out in this Bill, which I regard as being inadequate in comparison with the salaries paid to judges of some of the State Supreme Courts, will be reviewed when the Remuneration Tribunal presents its report to the Government later in the year. I understand that has to be done before 5 or 6 August. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As I have said, the Family Law Amendment Bill is a non-Party Bill and members of the Opposition are to be given a free vote on it. The Bill has arisen out of a High Court decision on 1 1 May last in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Russell</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Russell.</inline> As I understand it, the High Court held in its decision in that case that the Family Law Act is valid but that there are certain sections of it which are deemed to be invalid. As was explained by the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> when he introduced the Bill, the amending legislation is aimed at writing down the Act in accordance with the Australian Constitution. Proceedings relating to property, for instance, are not valid if they are related only to property. Those matters then would have to be dealt with under the State Married Women's Property Act, unless they relate to an ancillary matter where the normal divorce proceedings are concerned. There are other matters in the Bill relating to custody and, of course, closed courts, which were the subject of a question by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> during the course of the Senate's proceedings this week. I have mentioned briefly the subjects of custody and matrimonial property. </para>

            <para>The Attorney-General is concerned at the difficulties and hardships that may be encountered by people as a result of the incomplete extent of the jurisdiction under the Act in the areas of custody and matrimonial property. He therefore proposes to raise these matters with the States at the next meeting of the Standing Committee of Commonwealth and State Attorneys-General arranged for later this month. The Standing Committee is already examining the proposals for uniform matrimonial property laws amongst the States and Territories and the Attorney-General hopes that it will be able to come up with some firm proposals in the light of the High Court's decision. </para>

            <para>- I strongly oppose the Remuneration and Allowances Amendment Bill which relates to the remunerations and allowances payable to judges of the Family Court. The Bill proposes that the Chief Judges salary be increased to $36,000 per annum together with an allowance of $2,250 per annum, that each senior judge- I think that is each senior judge in each State- should receive a salary of $35,000 per annum plus an allowance of $1,750 per annum, and that other judges of the Court should get $30,000 per annum and an annual allowance of $1,500. The present allowance fixed by law when the Family Law Bill was passed by the Parliament is, I think, about $7,500 less than that. It may be $5,000 to $7,500 less. This Bill not only proposes those increases but also makes them retrospective to 5 January. It is the cardinal principle of judicial independence in the Federal sphere that a judge should have a life tenure but that his emoluments should not be dependent in the slightest degree upon agreement with the Executive. His emoluments should be guaranteed by law and fixed by law. Due to the imbroglio in which this Family Court was brought into being- almost an abortion- in January - </para>

              <para>- It was. By reason of the difficulty of appointing judges the concept misfired. We have a situation in which judges have been appointed to a court and we have a proposal that their proposed increased allowances be made retrospective to a certain day by agreement with the Executive. Judges would never take a position on that basis in any court that I know of. It surprises me to be told that we have appointed to the judiciary people who for 5 months have been expecting, on Executive promise, increases of the order mentioned here. </para>

          <para>As I was overseas when the Family Law Bill passed through this place, I just wish to observe that, vicious though it is I now regard the principle of the Family Law Bill as not in issue. I think we will have to have some little more experience on an extended operation of the family aw legislation to see the true extent of the damage that it will do to this community. I think that then it will come up for wholesale review; but that will depend on the parliament of the day. I regard the measure, in providing as a basis for dissolution of marriage not some fault of the party against whom the divorce is claimed but the mere fact that the 2 parties have chosen to live apart for 12 months, as a socially obnoxious and unjust measure. I think that it will be completely subversive to family life, as we know it, and within the next quarter of a century will have revolutionised the whole social basis of our civilisation. </para>
          <para>The measure is being abused. One of the provisions in the Bill is that in allowing maintenance of either party regard shall be had to the social service entitlements of the parties. Because these courts are secret, naturally one's insight into them is very restricted indeed; but all my information leads me to believe that there is a wholesale attitude whereby, if the parties by agreement between themselves fix an amount of maintenance that entitles the other party to the full social benefit of, say, a widow's pension or an age pension, agreement is reached upon a figure of maintenance to be payable by the party personally irrespective of means and much below the amount that party's means would afford. I regard that as a complete abuse of the statute. The enormity of it can be shown by the fact that in this coming year the amount of public moneys that it is estimated will be payable in social services to divorcees is $5 5.8m. The amount of money paid to deserted wives and deserting wives, who are classified as widows for the purposes of pensions, is rising at an astronomical rate. The amount of money paid to divorcees is rising at an undreamed of rate. As 1 have said, the appropriation this year is $55. 8m. I regard that as the product of an abuse of the provision to which I have referred by the Court facilitating consent orders whereby the parties are exempted from their proper maintenance obligations which are then unloaded on to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> on me and on other taxpayers. I regard that as just one further step towards the communal state. </para>
          <para>We can provide all sorts of arrangements for the care of children on a proper basis, but once we get to the stage where the state not only cares for them but also maintains them, it will take only another few steps before we will be training them and guiding them in their occupations. I am thoroughly alarmed at that trend and I wish to register my complete rejection of it as a principle of this legislation. </para>
          <para>The next point to which I wish to refer is one which I tried to put before the Senate when I returned from overseas last year and when we were involved in the Committee stage of the Family Law Bill. To my complete dismay 1 found that this Bill had provided for a Family Court especially set up to exercise jurisdiction in this field under the Family Law Act- an Act the very name of which offends me. It is called the Family Law Act, just as the communists call guerrilla activity a peace movement. This is an Act for the destruction and denigration of the family. It does not provide for the legal protection of the family. Section 97(1) of the Bill states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Subject to sub-section (2) and to the regulations, all proceedings in the Family Court, or in another court when exercising jurisdiction under this Act, shall be heard in closed court. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The High Court, in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Russell</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Russell,</inline> has said that that provision is invalid insofar as it purports to extend to State courts invested with jurisdiction under this Act. If this Parliament is to invest State courts with that jurisdiction, it cannot alter their structure and essential qualities. Although I have not had an opportunity fully to peruse the judgment, as I read it the question as to the validity of this provision in relation to the Family Court, a Federal Court set up by this Parliament, was not in issue. But there are some observations in the judgment that seemed to assume the validity of that provision. I suggest that it is recognised that it is an essential part of the structure and quality of State Courts and English Courts to do their business, except in matters of infancy, lunacy or other matters of competence, in public, that is, they are open for any citizen to go in and observe the way in which the laws are administered. Although it is competent for State parliaments or the English Parliament to subtract that quality from one of their courts, in the judicature provisions of our Constitution we say that the judicial power of this Commonwealth shall be vested in the High Court and such other courts as Parliament provides. I want to know whether there is any authority to say that a court, a tribunal, which is required to sit in closed court, can, under the essential understanding of the British system of judicature, properly be called a court. </para>
          <para>The matter is not without authority. I mean to say there is authority relevant to the matter but not deciding the matter. But I am dismayed and disappointed to find that although some of the High Court judges referred to the decision in <inline font-style="italic">Scott</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Scott</inline> in 1913 Appeal Cases, yet the very relevant passage that I want to bring to the attention of the Senate was not commented on or adverted to. I want to read a brief excerpt from Lord Shaw's judgment where he was dealing with an attempt by the Court of Nullity in Great Britain to prevent the publication of proceedings of an order and when the matter came before the law Lords, Lord Shaw, dismayed to think that any judge of England would purport to imprison a person who published those proceedings contrary to the order, said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I candidly confess, my Lords, that the whole proceeding shocks me. I admit the embarrassment produced to the learned judge of first instance and to the majority of the Court of Appeal by the state of the decisions; but those decisions, in my humble judgment, or rather- for it is in nearly all the instances only so- these expressions of opinion by the way, have signified not alone an encroachment upon and suppression of private right, but the gradual invasion and undermining of constitutional security. This result, which is declared by the Courts below to have been legitimately reached under a free Constitution, is exactly the same result which would have been achieved under, and have accorded with, the genius and practice of despotism. </para>

            <para>What has happened is a usurpation, a usurpation which could not have been allowed even as a prerogative of the Crown, and most certainly must be denied to the judges of the land. To remit the maintenance of constitutional right to the region of judicial discretion is to shift the foundations of freedom from the rock to the sand. </para>
            <para>It is needless to quote authority on this topic from legal, philosophical or historical writers. It moves Bentham over and over again. 'In the darkness of secrecy, sinister interest and evil in every shape have full swing. Only in proportion as publicity has place can any of the checks applicable to judicial injustice operate. Where there is no publicity there is no justice.' 'Publicity is the very soul of justice. It is the keenest spur to exertion and the surest of all guards against improbity. It keeps the judge himself while trying under trial'. 'The security of securities is publicity.' </para>

          <para class="block">Those are all quotations from Bentham. Lord Shaw continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>But amongst historians the grave and enlightened verdict of Hallam, in which he ranks the publicity of judicial proceedings even higher than the rights of Parliament as a guarantee of public security, is not likely to be forgotten. </para>

          <para class="block">Lord Shaw continued, quoting Hallam: </para>

            <para>Civil liberty in this kingdom has two direct guarantees; the open administration of justice according to known laws truly interpreted, and fair constructions of evidence; and the right of Parliament, without let or interruption, to inquire into, and obtain redress of, public grievances. Of these, the first is by far the most indispensable; nor can the subjects of any State be reckoned to enjoy a real freedom, where this condition is not found both in us judicial institutions and in their constant exercise'. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I forbear to quote at length but I wish to be permitted a further short quotation. Lord Shaw said: </para>

            <para>The right of the citizen and the working of the Constitution in the sense which I have described have upon the whole since the fall of the Stuart dynasty received from the j judiciary-and they appear to me still to demand of it- a constant and most watchful respect. There is no greater danger of usurpation than that which proceeds little by little, under cover of rules of procedure, and at the instance of judges themselves. I must say frankly that I think these encroachments have taken place by way of judicial procedure in such a way as, insensibly at first, but now culminating in this decision most sensibly, to impair the rights, safety, and freedom of the citizen and the open administration of the law. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I have taken the liberty of reading to the Senate that quotation because I do not wish those who give me ear here or outside to misunderstand the fundamental nature of the proposition that a court can be properly classed as a court only so long as it does its business in public. That is one of the cardinal qualities that distinguishes it from an administrative tribunal. But before we would have confidence in administrative tribunals, unless they were adjudicating on matters of confidence we would require them to sit so as to operate as a tribunal openly under the scrutiny of the public. </para>
          <para>Therefore it surprises me when I turn to the Bill to find that despite the fact that the High Court invalidated section 97 insofar as it referred to other courts in the sense of State courts, as I read the Bill there is no amendment put forward to section 97 although in other respects of custody and property there has been an attempt to alter the language of the Bill so as to come within the constitutional limits allowed by the High Court. Let me refer to the second reading speech of the Minister which was put in our hands for the first time this morning. If my understanding of it is inadequate I have some excuse because I have been doing a little other work during the day. The Minister stated that the provision requiring State courts to operate in closed court was invalid. He then said that the clear policy of Parliament as expressed by the section was that proceedings under the Act should be by closed court. If that means that the Attorney-General is going to sustain that policy as a matter before this Parliament I hear it with the greatest misgiving. The Minister went on to refer to other matters. </para>
          <para>He goes on: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Although the jurisdiction of the State Supreme Courts over new proceedings under the Act has now been terminated- at the request of the States- State courts of summary jurisdiction are expected to continue to exercise concurrent jurisdiction with the Family Court for some time to come. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I am at a loss to know why, in view of that, the words 'other courts' have not been excised from section 97, because as I read what the High Court said, it is a clear statement that neither the State summary jurisdiction courts nor the State Supreme Courts can be required to sit in closed court. Therefore I wish to indicate that 1 am completely opposed to the maintenance of section 97 ( 1 ) of the Act and will seek to vote against it to register my opposition. </para>

          <para>I now refer to 2 matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> Neither is covered in this Bill, and therefore I will deal with them very shortly. However, they are matters which I think should not go without some answer. In the first place, he refers to the provisions of the Family Law Act which relate to social service entitlements and the taking into account of those entitlements in the fixing of maintenance orders. That, of course, was a deliberate policy of the original Bill and it is one which the Senate Committee advised, and on which, first, the Senate and subsequently the House of Representatives agreed; namely, that it was a provision which would stop what had previously been high orders made against husbands who disappeared so that the State finished up paying the whole amount. I have no doubt that when all the evidence is examined that this provision will remain. I am assured by judges that it has been found to be a just provision which is working well so far as the Act is concerned. </para>
          <para>The second matter to which I draw attention is in regard to closed courts. That, of course, is not a matter which is covered by this Bill but which, as the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott)</inline> has said, is one of the matters to be considered in discussion with the States to see whether some uniformity can be found in regard to both sorts of courts. That again was a matter of policy which was put into this Act with deliberate intent; namely, that we should not have, insofar as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bentham</inline> is concerned, the sort of statement that where there is no publicity there is no justice. Anyone who has had a long experience with family law and its operations over the years would know that where there is all this publicity there is no justice, there is no fairness, there is the scarifying of children and innocent persons because of newspapers and others- I do not need to name them- which over the years made a lot of money out of the embarrassment of people; and that was a very deliberate thing. Whether courts be open with an option to close or whether they close with an option to open is a matter which can be discussed and considered by the State Attorneys-General in trying to find some uniformity. </para>

              <para>-The community, of course, has an interest in settlements. To say that a court is closed is not to suggest that these matters are not the subject of knowledge; it is not to say that they are not subject to appeal. It is not to say that if a judge misbehaves his actions will not be known on appeal. Of course, there are people who are allowed into the courts. There are people who, by permission, can be there. I do not want to take the time at this stage because of the fact that this matter is not covered by the Bill. Therefore, I want to turn to the Bill that is before us. But I shall argue that matter with anybodywith <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> or anyone else at any other time. So far as the running of the Act is concerned, I believe this was the greatest social achievement of the Twenty-ninth Parliament. I believe that the Act has been operating in a most effective way. But when one takes into account the difficulties under which the judges have had to operate, we see that some problems have been found. The amendments contained in this Bill are actually wider than I think was suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, although, of course, they cover the matters that he raised. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para class="block">They cover also the suggestions which the judges have made over the period that the Act has operated. Many of the suggested amendments in this Bill are those that the judges have found necessary to overcome some obscurities. The amendments therefore cover matters in relation to the enforcement of maintenance orders. They cover important matters in regard to the enforcement of custody orders, where difficulties have been found. Of course, they also pick up some difficulties in regard to the appeals system which were not covered in the original Bill. The amendments cover another aspect- the facilitating of the formation of the State courts. A State court has been formed in Western Australia. It is desired to make several amendments in this Bill which relate to making State courts easier to operate- giving further facilities to the State courts and making it possible for State courts to operate in still other States should these States wish to have them. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, the amendments, by reason of the cases of Russell v. Russell and Farrelly v. Farrelly, have come through the judgment of the High Court which demonstrated that there are limitations to the powers which the Commonwealth has to make these laws. Jagged edges are left by reason of those judgments. I return therefore to say that this Bill is a patchwork job. Necessarily it has had to be so. It is designed to reduce the definitions so that it only covers those things that are within the constitutional power at the present time. Any suggestion that this would be a satisfactory long term solution is, I think, another matter altogether. In reading the debate on this Bill in the House of Representatives I find that this aspect does not come out clearly except in the speech of the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Ellicott).</inline> In fact, I think that there are three or four areas where we must make sure that efforts are made to overcome the anomalies and the unfairness which now exist, even under this Bill. </para>
          <para>In regard to custody it has long been realised that it would only be with the support of the States that we could get a situation where ex-nuptial children would be treated in the same way and with the same facilities of the Family Court available to them as are enjoyed by children of a marriage. But it is worse than that when we consider who are illegitimate. They could be children of a wife and not the husband, but have been supported and treated as members of that family for years. Later, after the natural father has disappeared, we could find that the husband leaves the wife and he may not be responsible for the maintenance of the children. The wife may have difficulty and not be able to get an order for custody from the family court. She would have to go to another court. This means that there is a jagged edge in regard to the areas of custody and maintenance that needs to be smoothed in the interests of justice to all parties concerned. </para>
          <para>A similar situation exists in regard to property. This Bill means that people will have to go through divorce proceedings and that property proceedings can take place in the family court only if they are ancillary to a divorce. When the original Family Law Bill went through it was one of the measures designed by this Parliament to get away from the necessity to jump from State courts and Federal courts and to avoid the tactics and the costs which are involved. I hope that this will be another matter which, in co-operation with the States, can be avoided. </para>
          <para>Closed courts are another matter which calls for co-operation between States and Commonwealth. I believe that probably now more than ever it is essential that States should be persuaded to exercise the power to create State courts, or they should be persuaded to refer the power to the Commonwealth so that the gaps can be closed. This would prevent, for example, a situation where custody proceedings are undertaken and the family court can make no arrangements to give custody to an aunt or a grandparent. </para>
          <para>It must concern itself only with parents, the 2 parties to the marriage. That is the limit of our jurisdiction, whereas we know that in many cases the proper person to have custody may be an aunt, a grandparent or someone else. This is obviously an unsatisfactory area. I welcome the fact that the Attorney-General is approaching the States to see whether this can be clarified. </para>
          <para>I believe that in the 5 months that this Act has been operating we have seen a magnificent job done by too few judges. I believe that shortly more judges will be appointed, and they are obviously needed in a number of States. The judges have worked diligently and worked overtime to minimise delays which would be most detrimental. I think the Parliament should pay them the credit they deserve. </para>
          <para>Today in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> D. Broun,  President  of the Family Law Practitioners Association of New South Wales pointed out the physical difficulties which judges have to undergo. He concluded by saying: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Against that background, the judges have notably succeeded in maintaining proper dignity and respect in their courts as a result of two important factors: the personal dignity and manifest integrity of the judges themselves; the cooperation of all but a few of the barristers and solicitors that practise in those courts, and the respect which is both due and given by those lawyers to those courts. </para>

          <para>The last thing I want to say in respect of this Bill which is concerned with the administration of family law is to pay a tribute to the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> because since the beginning of this year I have seen the way in which he has taken an absorbed and constant interest in this very difficult area. I have seen his concern to see that the Act works as well as it possibly can. I believe that this is a useful Bill because it does in fact amend various matters which have come up in the course of practice. But I believe it is not the last word. We have to ensure that with the States justice is brought into all the areas I have mentioned. With those remarks, I support both of the Bills. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for National Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question: (1)I refer the honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator to</inline> my speech on 3 1 March 1976 in the House of Representatives during the debate on 'Australia: Political and Trading Relationships and Energy Reserves' (Hansard, pages 1175 to 1 177). </para>

              <para>In December 1975 the Japanese Ministerial Council on General Energy Policy adopted a report which included an estimate for 1985 of 49 000 MW installed nuclear generating capacity. The 1972 estimate for 1985 was 60 000 MW. (3), (4) and (5) It is not appropriate for me to comment on what Japan is likely to achieve nor on specific tonnages which is a matter for commercial negotiation between Japanese and foreign organisations. As I indicated on 25 February 1976 in a statement on my visit to Japan, the Japanese made it clear to me that their concern is not for immediate supplies since they have already secured the bulk of their requirements of uranium until 1985; the Japanese desire is to be able to look with confidence to Australia as a major source of supply in the period after 1985. Existing app roved contracts for the supply of Australian uranium to Japan are approximately 7000 tonnes uranium. </para>

With regard to (2), the format of the application forms of the scheme is currently being reviewed by my Department. Every effort will be made to make them as simple as possible, but because of the wide ranging provisions of the scheme, the degree of simplification which can be achieved is limited. The forms must be adequate to obtain all essential information to establish clearly each applicant's eligibility in view of the need to safeguard the expenditure of public funds. A decision on this matter will be reflected in the 1977 application forms, which will be available towards the end of the 1976 school year. </para>

            <para>Copyright in videotaped films made by members of the public who use the resources and advice provided by the Community Video Resource Centres is owned by the makers of the films. The ownership of the copyright in the films does not depend upon the ownership of the tapes used to make the films and is therefore not affected by any change in ownership of the tapes. In the absence of a properly executed written assignment of copyright, the copyright in the films will remain vested in the makers of the films. A separate copyright may exist in the material included in the films, such as an original musical or dramatic work. The Community Video Resource Centres do not provide the material for inclusion in videotaped films nor do the centres undertake any responsibility for that material. In cases where the maker of a videotaped film wishes to include copyright material in the film, it is a matter for him to obtain the necessary authority from the owner of the copyright in the material to include the material in the film and. where the maker wishes to exhibit his film in public, to perform the material in public. </para>

Among those present was the Minister of Justice for Papua New Guinea. My question is: Is the Minister of Papua New Guinea a permanent member of the Standing Committee of Attorneys-General?

          <quote>
            <para>As the honourable senator will be aware, the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development was brought into being in December 1 975. This was done by combining together and rationalising elements of the former Departments of Environment, Tourism and Recreation. Housing and Construction, and Urban and Regional Development. </para>
            <para>In preparing an answer to the Senator's question, the assumption has been made that the Department existed in this configuration prior to December 1975. Figures given in the accompanying Table1 reflect this assumption as far as is practicable. </para>
            <para>These figures show that expenditure by the Department would have been $377.0m in 1973-74 and $825.4 in 1974-75. Estimated expenditure provided for in the 1975-76 Budget is$848.82m. </para>
            <para>Table 2 sets out a breakdown of the 1975-76 estimates by State and Territory. In summary form, this shows the following expected allocations of funds: </para>

        </para>
        <para>The unallocated items are mainly salaries and administrative expenses, and grants-in-aid to national organisations. </para>
        <para>The 1975-76 estimates are, of course, higher than the actual expenditure that will be achieved. Following the Government's overall review of 1975-76 expenditure it was announced that savings of at least $3 lm would be achieved from the Department's programs. It is likely that further savings will have been achieved by the end of the financial year. It has not been possible, at this stage, to determine precisely how these reductions would be apportioned to the States and Territories. </para>

              <para>1 ) By tracking radar reflecting targets suspended from balloons, winds in the upper levels of the atmosphere in the vicinity of the radar installation are determined. Winds are computed by measuring the motion of the balloon through successive layers of the atmosphere. By this means wind speed and direction are obtained for heights from about 150 metres above the surface to approximately 17 kilometres with occasional measurements to 30 kilometres. Information from a network of wind finding stations is necessary for three-dimensional analyses of the state of the atmosphere. From these analyses, predictions of the future state of the atmosphere are made, which are used as the basis of forecasts for general purposes, and in particular are applied directly in making forecasts for aviation of winds at flying levels. </para>

              <para>1 ) The Prime Minister of the Seychelles did raise the question of Qantas establishing an air link between Australia and the Seychelles during his recent discussions with the Right Honourable Prime Minister; he also discussed the matter with the Minister for Transport and with Qantas. The Seychelles' Prime Minister was advised that it was not economically possible at this time for Qantas to introduce services because of the very limited traffic flow between Australia and the Seychelles which can best be handled by present connecting services through Mauritius. Nevertheless, in looking at future services on Indian Ocean routes, both the Government and Qantas will bear in mind the interest expressed by the Seychelles' Government in improved aviation links with Australia. </para>

            <para>It is this Government's policy to encourage exploration for and development of more gas reserves by allowing the limited export of liquefied natural gas. </para>
            <para>During my recent visit to Japan, a question repeatedly raised by the Japanese was the prospect of availability of LNG from Australia, and in particular Australia's attitude towards its export from the North West Shelf. </para>
            <para>I described the efforts we were making to reach early decisions on various options open to us, and assured the Japanese that Australia looked forward, when production commenced, to meeting some of their LNG requirements from this source. </para>
            <para>The Labor Government, on the other hand, as far us I cun judge, procrastinated over offshore petroleum development throughout its term of office, preferring instead to engage in disputation with the States on questions of sovereign rights offshore with offshore development languishing in the meantime with the consequence that Australia has yet to produce any LNG. </para>
            <para>Australia exports about 1.2 million tonnes of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) a year, most of which is exported under long term arrangements of some years standing. This gas is surplus to Australian domestic requirements. </para>
            <para>While the Labor Government continued to supply to Japan, and our other major trading partners, whatever liquefied petroleum gas we could reasonably export, it was committed to the view that all natural gas produced from the North West Shelf would be purchased at the wellhead by the Pipeline Authority and any exports of LNG would thus become its responsibility. This Government prefers to sec such undertakings carried out by private enterprise and is currently engaged in discussions with the North West Shelf consortium to this end. </para>

              <para>1 ) and (2) There are two industrial estates in Gladstone. The Too loo a estate and the Clinton estate, are administered by the Queensland Department of Commercial and Industrial Development. The honourable senator will appreciate that the operation of these estates is a matter for the appropriate State and local government authorities and as such falls outside the sphere of direct Commonwealth responsibility. </para>
            </item>

          <para>I understand that the Gladstone City Council is anxious to avoid noxious industries on the Too loo a estate while the Clinton estate is primarily designed for large scale industries requiring heavy power inputs and sea board facilities. The industries to which the honourable senator has drawn attention do not fall within either of the latter two categories. However, I am advised that the Department of Commercial and Industrial Development has the question of finding suitable locations for these industries under active consideration and will be discussing the matter further with all the parties involved. </para>

            <para>I direct a question to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. He may recall, during the time that he has been giving some attention to this portfolio, that several weeks ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs, after speaking to members of the Indonesian Government, said that he had been given assurances by the Indonesian Government that there would be an act of genuine self determination by the people of East Timor. I wonder whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs has received any further advice from the Indonesian Government as to how arrangements for that act of self determination are progressing. </para>

            <para>The 'Provisional Government of East Timor' has outlined the procedures they envisage for a process of self determination in East Timor. These are to entail the formation of a Peoples Assembly to be made up of representatives from each of East Timor's thirteen administrative districts. It is understood that the nomination of representatives has begun and that the Assembly will meet in Deli within the next few weeks. According to the statement delivered by the representative of the 'PGET' to the United Nations Security Council on 12 April, the Assembly will be charged with determining the future political status of East Timor. Further elaboration has been provided by another 'PGET' representative, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mario</inline> Carrascalao, at a press conference in Jakarta on 4 May. He indicated that, were the decision of the Peoples Assembly to favour integration with Indonesia, that decision, in the form of a petition, would be conveyed to the Indonesian Government and Parliament. </para>
            <para>The procedures outlined by the 'PGET' have been generally confirmed by Indonesian officials. They have also stated that, in the event that a petition seeking integration is received, the Indonesian Parliament and Government would still need to conduct their own investigations amongst the people of East Timor to ascertain their wishes. </para>
            <para>Both the Indonesian Government and the 'PGET' have stated their wish for United Nations participation in the process of self determination.

            <para>In a reply to a question without notice on 19 May the Minister for Foreign Affairs advised that the Indonesian Government and the 'PGET' had stated their wish for United Nations participation in the process of self determination in East Timor. </para>

We have no information of what response, if any, was conveyed by the United Nations Secretariat to the Get delegation. </para>
            <para>An invitation to attend the meeting in Deli was conveyed to the Acting  Chairman  of the Committee of Twenty-Four by the Get delegation on 24 May. The  Chairman  of the Committee of Twenty-Four responded in a Note handed to the Get delegation on 28 May. This response was to the effect that since the Committee of Twenty-Four had not been involved in the proceedings leading up to the announced meeting of the people's assembly the Committee was not 'in a position to dispatch a mission to attend that meeting'. </para>
            <para>On 1 June, in answer to a question without notice in another place, the Minister for Foreign Affairs noted that no indication had been forthcoming from the United Nations that it would be involved in the meeting in East Timor and that accordingly the Government had 'decided that it would be appropriate for us not to attend '. </para>

I undertook to refer the matter to the Treasurer who has supplied the following answer: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Taxation concessions of the kind referred to by the honourable senator already exist. </para>
            <para>Thus, as regards sales tax, solar water heaters of a kind installed as fixtures in houses already qualify for exemption, the exemption applying to the solar heating panels attached to the house exterior as well as to the components located within the house. Other solar heaters, including those of a kind used for industrial purposes, attract tax at15 per cent although in certain circumstances solar heaters used by manufacturers could qualify for exemption as being embraced by the definition of 'aids to manufacture' in the sales tax law. </para>
            <para>On the income tax side, depreciation at the appropriate rate is allowable in respect of solar heaters installed in premises used for the purposes of producing assessable income. Again, subject to the relevant conditions being satisfied, such units could also attract the new investment allowance. </para>
            <para>Whether the law should be amended to extend the scope of those concessions raises a number of issues. For one thing, energy is not the only resource that might be seen in need of conservation. Again, if there is a cost saving to be achieved by installing solar heaters, that might be thought a sufficient incentive in itself. But my immediate concern is with the budgetary implications of any such amendments. </para>
            <para>I have noted the honourable senator's suggestion and will bear it in mind during the forthcoming budgetary preparations. </para>

            <para>I cannot understand the crocodile tears wept by members of the Opposition over the Government's recent package in relation to those people seeking homes and those who have homes and are paying interest at the present time. As the Prime Minister has made perfectly clear, the package which was recently brought down by the Minister for Environment. Housing and Community Development is one which commends itself to the Australian electorate because of the overall benefits it provides. For the Opposition to raise the question of housing reminds me that as a consequence of its policies when in government, because of inflation, because of industrial unrest in the housing industry generally, because of the totality of the Australian Labor Party's policies in the housing field, this country increasingly became one of rent payers, not home purchasers, and that is the simple fact. The former Government was discredited not least because of its housing policy. If one seeks projections, one obviously docs so against the background of historical facts. I simply say to the Opposition that they sold out the home building industry in this country, and they know it. They have no credibility on this subject. I reaffirm what the Prime Minister has said: The package which the Government has brought down is an attractive one for the home building industry. It will assist persons purchasing their own homes, and I believe that it has been well accepted by the great majority of Australians. </para>
