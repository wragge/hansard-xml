            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I preface my question by drawing the Minister&#39;s attention to the fact that 1200 hectares of land in the Gladstone area of Queensland have been set aside as an industrial estate for the development of noxious industries under the control of the Queensland Department of Industrial Development. Is the Minister aware that the Queensland Department of Industrial Development has refused 3 industries, namely, sawmilling, chrome plating and asphalt production, part of this industrial zoned land and that as a result at least one of these industries will have to leave the area if the land remains unavailable? As these industries offer job opportunities in a high unemployment area, I ask the Minister whether he will use his good offices to persuade the Queensland Government to make available the land for the industries listed. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran. Mr Dunstan,</inline>is on record as saying very clearly that the federalism policy is a genuine new deal. Let me make it perfectly clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> refers to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> &#39;s statement. Nothing could show more clearly the massive ignorance and failure to understand the subject than the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran.</inline> I remind the Senate that the minimum guarantee given by the Prime Minister at the Premiers Conference was that for the next 3 years no State would fall below what the formula of the previous Government would yield. So in fact the guarantee means that they may well get more but they will not get less. It is an interesting situation therefore that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Corcoran</inline> is arguing that he would have to impose surcharges if he got what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> would have given him this year. To understand federalism is to understand that this will do the States, including South Australia, a good deal in 2 ways. In the first place, tax indexation, in abating inflation, will keep down the wages bill of every State and therefore cut the costs of every State. In the second place, indexation, by abating inflation, will help re-employment and every person reemployed this is apart from the humanity of reemployment will pay taxes. Out of every dollar paid in personal income tax the States will get their extra share. So there is a vested interest in every State for federalism to succeed. I do not intend in my other capacity as Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations to regard this dispute as a demarcation dispute. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Science. I preface my question by saying that I am sure the Minister will recall that the state of social science research in Australia was referred to in highly unfavourable terms in the 1974 report of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, and that the 1975 Liberal Party policy stated that the Australian Science and Technology Council should include social scientists. I ask: Why has the social science component of the Australian Science and Technology Council been withdrawn and the social scientists on the Council sacked? How will it be possible for the Council to assess the social implications of changing scientific technology without a contribution from social scientists? </para>

            <para>- The honourable senator refers to the Australian Science and Technology Council. As he knows, the Prime Minister has made a statement that the Council is to be restructured. Those individuals who served on the Council have been notified and thanked, but their names have not yet been made public. Those individuals who are to be invited to serve on the Council have been approached. Because they have not yet given notice of their acceptance, public notification has not been made. The honourable senator suggests that no individuals of a social science discipline are on that Council. I am unable to give him an answer in regard to that matter. If he has information in that regard, he has more information than has been made public. </para>

Is the Minister aware of an apparent Australia-wide shortage of 1976 influenza vaccine which, I think, is called Victoria? Does the Minister realise that the people who are currently most affected by this shortage are young children, old people and people suffering from heart and respiratory conditions? What action has the Government been taking to rectify this desperate situation? Will the Minister inform the Senate whether the Government is taking action in relation to the expected epidemic in North America this winter caused by a new mutation of the present influenza virus? </para>

            <para>- I recall answering a similar question a short time ago with regard to the availability of the influenza vaccine. At that time I referred to a statement that had been made by the Minister for Health, I think towards the end of April, in which he talked of the numbers of doses of the vaccine which were available and the fact that the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories did not direct the way in which the quantities available were disseminated throughout Australia. I will obtain for the honourable senator any further information that is available at this stage. </para>

              <para>- I give that assurance because the Minister for Health has asked that the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories ensure that as the vaccine becomes available supplies are distributed equitably throughout the country. The Department of Health is watching the overseas situation and there is no indication that the virus will reach Australia this winter. I referred earlier to the demand and the lack of opportunity for the Serum Laboratories to determine the wholesale distribution of this vaccine. This makes it very difficult for me to give the commitment and assurance that the vaccine will be available in those places where it is most required. However, the Department of Health is watching the situation and every effort will be made to ensure that it is. If there is any further information which I can obtain from the Minister for Health I will see that the honourable senator receives it. </para>

I refer to the recent interview granted by the Prime Minister to the American magazine <inline font-style="italic">Variety</inline> in which he gave a policy statement in relation to the Australian film industry. Is it the intention of the Prime Minister to use American magazines as a forum for policy statements in relation to such a sensitive and important industry as the Australian film industry? Does the Prime Minister&#39;s expressed opposition in this article to quotas for Australian films being imposed on exhibitors mean the rejection by this Government of the report of the Industries Assistance Commission which made it clear that the industry could not survive unless such quotas were imposed? Does the Prime Minister&#39;s statement foreshadow a backing down on the Australian content on radio and television? </para>

It is far better for him to give an interview in Australia to a foreign publication than to be like his predecessor and wander around the world at enormous expense to the taxpayer, spending most of his time hitting Australian journalists in the eye with a television camera. As to what is going to happen to the IAC report, I suggest to the honourable senator that he should wait with patience. The Government&#39;s intentions on that report will be announced in due course. As to the matter of Australian content, I have no intention of attempting to say what the Government&#39;s policy is at this moment.

            <para>- As to the first part of the question, 1 am not able to give the honourable senator details of the tenders which have been called from private contractors. As to the second part of the question, I think it would be understood that my Department produces numerous pamphlets and leaflets giving information regarding benefits that are paid through the Department. This should be construed not as being propaganda warfare but rather as a source of information to enable as many people as possible to be fully aware of the benefits that are avail a be to them. I will obtain information with regard to the tenders which the honourable senator claims have been called and give him the information when I have it. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. Has the Minister seen an article in yesterday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> headed Pm Men Accused of Swindle&#39; which contains allegations by a former Telecommunications Commission linesman that telephone subscribers are footing the bill for Australia-wide calls recorded on subscribers&#39; meters but made by Commission technicians with tapping devices, achieved by the technician either by clipping a portable automatic dialling device onto overhead lines and then attaching markers to cables to remind him when a householder is away, thereby allowing others to misuse the line as well, or by attaching a dialling device to a subscriber&#39;s severed cable in a metal street terminal box? Is it a fact that regulations require that any such use of a subscriber&#39;s telephone be reported to enable a credit to be made for that service? If so, is it possible for the Minister to inform the Senate what records are kept of such calls reported to and credited by the Commission? If records are kept, are details of the number of calls made available to any subscriber whose service has been used in this way? Is it true that a linesman who did not report that he had made a call on a subscriber&#39;s line could be dismissed? If so, what attempts are made to detect this dishonesty and how many Commission employees have been dismissed for this reason? </para>

            <para>-Senator Mulvihill was good enough to advise me that he would be asking a question along these lines. I have obtained the following answer from the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. The Minister has no power under the Passports Act to order the passports of persons convicted of bird smuggling or of any other offences to be forfeited automatically on conviction for a period of 5 years. Furthermore, it would not be just to withhold a passport from any person once that person had paid the penalty for his or her offence and had been released. Despite these considerations, the Minister appreciated the honourable senator&#39;s concern to deal effectively with people who become involved in the business of smuggling of fauna out of Australia using cruel and unfeeling means. </para>

            <para>- I have not read the report in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> to which the honourable senator has referred, but I wish to state in regard to unemployment benefit for farmers that farmers who will become eligible under the new guidelines which were stated last week will have to wait the normal 7-day period after lodging their application. If there are farmers who qualify under those guidelines and who lodged their applications within 7 days prior to the date of our announcement, the farmers making those applications would be considered as being eligible to receive unemployment benefit. In regard to the 7-day waiting period for general unemployment benefit, the statement by the honourable senator that what has been reported in the newspaper article foreshadows the abolition of the waiting period is not accurate. There is a 7-day waiting period for unemployment benefit after the date of lodging of an application. </para>

I have received representations from Timorese refugees now residing in Darwin who wish to make arrangements for relatives and friends to leave Timor and take refuge in Darwin. The Timorese in Darwin are prepared to finance air or sea charter arrangements. In view of the reported poor circumstances of people living in Timor, will the Government give urgent consideration to allowing arrangements to be made with authorities in Timor to permit the transfer of Timorese, particularly women and children, to the mainland of Australia? </para>

If the Government is to scrap the AAP, would the Minister agree that the cost of holding conferences for State Ministers, regional officers, local councillors and others is a waste of government money?

            <para>-The statements in the question that has just been asked by the honourable senator are inaccurate. There is to be a meeting of State Ministers in Darwin later this week. At that meeting the future of the Australian Assistance Plan will be discussed. This is the last conference at which this matter needs to be discussed. As regards previous conferences at local government and regional council level, and other discussions that have been held, we do not consider them to be a waste of money. The very nature of the plan was that at the end of the 3-year period it was to be evaluated and discussed and then its future was to be decided. Having in mind the terms of the question asked by the honourable senator, I think he may be a little disappointed when we do make the announcement from Darwin as to the future of the plan as all of the premises on which he has based his question are inaccurate. Arising from the discussions to be held later this week, I think that the 37 regional councils will have some satisfaction. </para>

She was deserted by her husband shortly after she began the NEAT scheme. Divorce proceedings ensued. Her claim for maintenance was considered in the light of the fact that she was receiving the NEAT payment. Under the new family law provisions, there is little chance that she can have her maintenance payments increased. Her rent and living expenses have increased and she may now have to terminate the course half way through it. Can the Minister advise what action the Government intends to take in such cases? </para>

              <para>- In that case, 1 think that this is a matter that I should refer to the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. With regard to the NEAT scheme, it may be that the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations in the Senate would wish to comment. Why I asked whether the woman was in receipt of a benefit from my department was to establish the fact in the honourable senator&#39;s mind that if she had been in receipt of that payment she would have in addition to that benefit received the NEAT training allowance. But with regard to the other matters and the determination of the NEAT training scheme allowance, I point out that they are in the area of responsibility of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. I am unable to comment further at this stage. </para>

            <para>-I am aware of the recent report. I am also aware that the National War Museum has some substantially valuable works of art painted by official war artists in both wars. They are very valuable parts of the Australian national collection. There is equally said to be a need for training art conservators, art restorers and repairers. To my knowledge, there is as yet in this country no course, although certain universities are developing art schools with the idea in mind that these sorts of people may be trained in Australia. The idea generally is very good. I know that the Department of the Prime Minister is working on it. I cannot tell the honourable senator any more than that, but I shall find out more for him. </para>

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Acting Minister for Foreign Affairs. He may recall, during the time that he has been giving some attention to this portfolio, that several weeks ago the Minister for Foreign Affairs, after speaking to members of the Indonesian Government, said that he had been given assurances by the Indonesian Government that there would be an act of genuine self determination by the people of East Timor. I wonder whether the Minister for Foreign Affairs has received any further advice from the Indonesian Government as to how arrangements for that act of self determination are progressing. </para>

It follows a question asked earlier today by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> regarding shipbuilding in Australia. I refer to the fact that earlier this year I raised the question, and the Minister undertook to obtain some information. By way of brief explanation I should indicate that, having particular concern for the development and expansion of the fishing industry in Tasmania, I would like to obtain the earliest possible answer as to whether the Industries Assistance Commission reference is likely to be completed, as it may lead to the bringing down of the subsidy of 25 per cent to vessels between 70 feet and 50 feet in length. </para>

He may recall that recently there was a statement about Woomera being placed on a care and maintenance basis. In addition there was some evidence that the Service Chiefs were to look at Woomera to see to what extent that base might be used for general tactical exercises or support purposes. Will the Minister give information at this stage as to what success there has been in those investigations and as to whether, with the new changes in the Edinburgh establishment, there may be some support activities possible at Woomera? </para>

Is the Minister aware that a close examination of the results of the survey indicate not only that Tasmania has the most unsatisfactory housing situation for old persons on an overall basis, but also that it had the poorest rating for the design, condition and safety of steps, stairs, porch and verandah, interior dampness, structural condition of floors and fire risk. Granted that the survey is being conducted with a view to improving the Government&#39;s programs of assistance for aged persons&#39; housing, will the Minister examine whether some form of urgent and immediate assistance might be given to those elderly Tasmanians whose living conditions are well below standard? </para>

I am becoming increasingly aware of the requests which are being made for assistance in the repair and maintenance of aged persons &#39; own homes, in addition to what can be done by the Government with regard to aged persons&#39; homes and hostels and the pensioner housing units which have been constructed in co-operation with the States. These matters have been receiving my urgent attention. I take this opportunity to mention that very shortly I will be announcing a 3-year program for the Aged Persons Hostels Act. I think that the 3-year program which we have undertaken will enable us to deal with the many hundreds of applications which we have had from voluntary associations to build further homes and hostels for aged persons. I know that that does not overcome the difficulties which many aged people face in attempting to keep their own homes in repair and maintenance. I think that that is a matter which also should have our urgent attention. </para>

I draw the attention of the Minister to the uranium deposit recently discovered near Georgetown in north Queensland. Is the Minister aware that the Australian company involved in this venture is controlled by And through its subsidiary, Stocks and Holdings Ltd. Is the Minister aware that 95 per cent of And shareholders are British residents? Does not the Minister therefore agree that the Australian equity requirements for the development of uranium deposits have not been met in this instance? Will the Minister ascertain whether the companies involved are seeking local participation? If not, what steps will the Government take to restrict the development of this deposit in the meantime? </para>

            <para>-I listened carefully to the honourable senator. He referred to a discovery in Georgetown. A discovery, of course, is not a development. He referred also to a wholly owned subsidiary of And. I presume he meant the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd. He referred to another company called Stocks and Holdings. I have no information which tells me that Stocks and Holdings is in any way associated with the And Bank. In general, his proposition is that this may, if shown to be correct, in some way breach the rules regarding uranium development and mining. Therefore I shall direct his question both to the Minister for National Resources and to the Treasurer, who has a responsibility, through the Foreign Investment Review Board, in this area. </para>

He said that work on the draft standard is proceeding and it is expected that an Australian standard will be published soon. I did note the report that the CSIRO has published a set of safety rules for microwave ovens. I think it is important that the public be aware of the concern that the CSIRO has shown by publishing that document. The CSIRO pointed out that exposure to microwaves at close range can cause permanent tissue damage, particularly to the eyes. Microwave oven users should follow basic safety rules as they would with other kitchen appliances. If the honourable senator wishes these safety rules produced by the CSIRO to be made public I shall seek to have the document incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

I ask: In view of the great importance to women of the issue of housing have any women been included in the Australian Government delegation? Were views of women&#39;s organisations sought in the preparation of the Australian delegation&#39;s brief? Were any women involved in the actual preparation of the Australian Government&#39;s delegation brief? </para>

I am somewhat surprised that the honourable senator finds a need to ask this question, because the major preparations for the conference were going on throughout the whole of last year. I do not know specifically the composition of the delegation as between men and women but I shall certainly seek the information for the honourable senator and let her have an answer. </para>

The honourable senator would know that the Government is preparing a White Paper on the whole of the manufacturing industry and its related problems. The Government is hoping, for the purposes of that White Paper, to get some useful contributions from all the unions involved as to the part that they might usefully play themselves. The Government also hopes for a fairly useful change in Australia&#39;s cost structure, which over the last 5 years has worsened markedly. </para>

To my knowledge no cuts have been made to the budget of that university, other than those which the university may make as a domestic internal arrangement. As the honourable senator would know, the Universities Commission made its report. It was adopted for the calendar year 1976. To my knowledge it has not been varied. If the honourable senator has any specific information to throw light on the matter, I shall be happy to pursue it. However, if what the honourable senator says is correct, I would say that it has occurred within the domestic budgeting of the university and, of course, the university must take responsibility for it. If there are other aspects to the matter I would be happy to pursue them. </para>

            <para>-It is true that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> was conscious of the need to study the aspects of supersonic flight, specifically related to the Concorde aircraft, with a view to preserving the environment. My understanding is that a number of technical studies has been made and a number of technical reports is available to his department. My further understanding is that discussions are now proceeding or are about to proceed between his department and the Department of Transport. Certainly I give an unqualified assurance that this Government will take into account environmental impacts before any decision on the Concorde is made. I will refer to the Acting Minister in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr MacKellar,</inline> the nature of the honourable senator&#39;s question. </para>

I ask the Minister: Should I infer from his answer that the residents of the Australian Capital Territory can expect vast increases in the rates they pay during the next 12 months, since that would appear to be the only means open to the Government to raise the extra revenues it will require to pay for State-like services in the Territory? </para>

            <para>- I am not responsible for the inferences that the honourable senator draws. She may wander at large if she so desires. But the conclusion she has drawn in fact would not be true. Stage one of the federalism revenue sharing program is a stage in which the States will be slotted in to a fixed percentage of personal income tax and they themselves will have no power to vary that. Because the Australian Capital Territory is not a self governing territory at this moment, it will continue in exactly the same way as before. Since I am on my feet and since the question has been asked, I make this comment: The honourable senator will know that the Constitution does not permit of any discrimination in taxation as between the States. Strangely enough, apparently it does allow discrimination as between Territories. I say that without any attempt to draw an inference; I merely say that it is so. I assure the honourable senator that whatever steps are taken in further stages to bring both the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory into overall federalism, and particularly as the Northern Territory moves to full statehood and the Australian Capital Territory to advanced self determination, there will be no inequity in the burdens borne by taxpayers in either place; there will be equity in these arrangements. If I may say so, there will be no tax havens. </para>

As I believe it is of general interest, I should like to expand on the answer I gave yesterday to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> with regard to his question about a person normally on award wages being required to accept piece work rates to prevent his unemployment benefits being terminated, despite the fact that he may not reach a minimum wage. I advise the honourable senator, and other people who may be interested in this, that it is not the usual practice to require a person on unemployment benefit to accept piece work if he had previously worked under an award. However, where such a person could reasonably be expected to earn an income from piece work equivalent to his previous level of earnings he would be required, subject to normal conditions such as suitability for the work involved, to undertake this work in order to satisfy the work test. There is no hard and fast rule applying in such cases and each case is examined on its merits. </para>

            <para>- Yes. I wish to state categorically that I have been mis-reported in the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> newspaper of today&#39;s date. Before I read from the article that appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> I would like to give some background as to how this matter arose during the course of this week. Yesterday at approximately 3 p.m., while I was doing some work in my office, I received a telephone call from a person who identified himself as a reporter for the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline> He asked whether he could put to me some questions in relation to the proposal that we have read about in the newspapers about the South Australian Government asking <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Nicholls to take up the appointment of Governor of South Australia. A number of questions were asked of me which I believe I answered honestly and sincerely. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>After asking the questions relating to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Douglas</inline> Nicholls the reporter then posed a hypothetical question to me. He asked: <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Bonner,</inline> if a like situation occurred in your State of Queensland and the Queensland Government offered you the position of Governor of that State, would you consider it?&#39; My answer to the question was: &#39;Surely, as an Australian, if a government offered me a position of that type I would give it consideration. I would give it serious consideration, taking into account my parliamentary career, which I believe has some time to go yet, and other factors. Surely, as an Australian, I would be honoured to consider such a proposal.&#39; Having said that, this mealy mouthed reporter then wrote an article it appeared in the Stop Press section, I might add which reads: </para>

            <para>- The legislation which the Senate is now debating is a very important piece of legislation. It represents, from the Government&#39;s point of view, an undoing or a dismantling of some of the important initiatives that were taken by the Labor Government in 1973. The Senate ought to be reminded that during the whole of the postwar years local government throughout Australia has been campaigning, agitating and pressing for the involvement of the Australian Government in the provision of funds for local government. It recognised in the post-war years that it would be essential, if local government was to carry out its correct responsibilities, for local government to receive untied grants from the Commonwealth Government and the State governments. It is a matter of record that for 23 years the Liberal-Country Party Government refused to take any steps in this direction. In point of fact, on the very last occasion on which the Australian Council of Local Government Associations sought audience from the then Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon,</inline> in 1972, he declined to see such a deputation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It was on the basis of the electoral mandate and program of the Labor Party put forward at the 1972 elections that recognition was given to establishing a formula and a principle involving the Australian Government in financial commitment to local government. This piece of legislation seeks to turn the clock back. It seeks to undo that Grants Commission decision in 1973 in which a formula was established which extended the general activity of the Grants Commission as it related to States to include local government. In the 2 subsequent Budgets, local government was to receive for the first time in Australia&#39;s history untied grants from the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>Now this coalition Government seeks to change that formula and to return the responsibilities through its so-called federalism policy to the States. This action has created a degree of dismay, uncertainty and concern in local government. It is creating havoc with respect to local government finances and planning. For example, the Bill which is currently before the Senate proposes to delegate to State grants commissions the responsibility of passing on to local government the means by which Australian Government revenue will be made available to local government. It so happens that, of the 6 States, only 2 States have State grants commissions operating for local government purposes within their jurisdiction. So complementary and supplementary legislation by the States is required. No indication is given in the legislation that the States have agreed or will agree to such a proposition. At a time when there is genuine concern about the degree of crisis that exists in local government funding, it ill becomes a government which is supposedly bringing competence and regularity in government finance into its operations that it should be introducing into this most important third tier of government such a degree of uncertainty. </para>
          <para>We make no bones about the fact that the Australian Labor Party was committed to the principle of untied grants to local government. It is in our policy. It is in our program. We carried that principle out. In the first year of government in our first Budget in 1973-74 some $56.3m was allocated to local government on a needs basis. The following year this amount was increased by over 40 per cent to $79.9m. That represented only a proportion of the funds that were made available to local government. Those figures represent direct grants to local government authorities. Some 800 bodies had applied to the Grants Commission which, after all, was an establishment which this and former LiberalCountry Party governments had accepted as an authoritative body in the determination of grants to the States. That very self same organisation was given the opportunity to determine the grants to local government. Some 800 bodies out of the 959 local government instrumentalities in Australia subsequently made application to it for untied grants. To the satisfaction of the great majority of local government, that was regarded as a breakthrough. </para>
          <para>The Australian Labor Party looks at this legislation with a great deal of concern and dismay. There is no provision in this Bill which maintains any of the principles of the legislation that was passed in 1973. It means that this Government seems to be embarking on a policy of spending the next 3 years repudiating and repealing the legislative efforts of the previous Government. If this is the way in which government is to proceed in Australia, one can imagine the sort of havoc that this will impose on governments right throughout Australia. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> is to begin to repeal every piece of legislation carried into effect by the government of his predecessor in New South Wales- the Liberal-Country Party Government- governments in Australia will be spending their time repealing legislation regardless of its value or innovation. We deprecate the attempts that are being made in this legislation to change the emphasis from one of need to one of per capita consideration, which has been suggested as the only formula that ought to be applied in these instances. </para>
          <para>No one can disagree with the unanimous view of local government throughout Australia that there was an essential requirement for Australian Government involvement in providing funds for local government. Local government was formulated in this country in the last century in an entirely different environment from that in which it operates today. The various State legislatures in the succeeding years have amended, changed and introduced new Acts of Parliament in order to determine the activity of local government within the 6 State jurisdictions. When one looks at legislation covering local government, the fact is that one can only come to the conclusion in general that that legislation represents something of a hotchpotch, something of an <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> approach and something which is unrelated to the types of responsibilities which local government has to face in the modern world. </para>
          <para>People do look to local government today to provide much of the better things at the locality level. One should not need to stress the point in the national Parliament that the provision of facilities at this level is for the community and is not for the local property owner. The original purpose of local government, which was to provide funds for property improvement, has long passed in terms of the historical development of Australia. In fact, local government now devotes half of its funds to providing community facilities. Its activities are no longer related purely to property enhancement which was the original concept of local government in this country. It was in the circumstances of these experiences that local government began many, many years ago to suggest that the Australian Government should allocate from the common pool of taxation a proportion of those funds to local government. </para>
          <para>We take no umbrage at the Government&#39;s suggesting that there should be a fixed proportion of Commonwealth revenue for local government. But what are not defined or stated in this Bill are the proportion and the principle upon which future funding will be made available to local government. I well recall in my local government years as president of a very large and growing shire convening ratepayer conferences, regional conferences of local government bodies and attending State conferences which were convened even by the New South Wales Labor Government in 1962 in Sydney for the express purpose of establishing the principle that there should be Australian Government involvement in the financing of local government and that a fixed proportion of national revenue should be made available to local government. </para>
          <para>Nowhere in the second reading speech of the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> nowhere in the speech of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> nowhere in the Government&#39;s public pronouncements is there any suggestion of what this proportion will be. When the whole philosophy of the coalition Government is to deprecate public expenditure, I think it needs to be stressed and stressed again that the present Government is endeavouring to create in the Australian community the illusion that spending money in the public sector creates inflation. One needs to look at the sort of money which the Australian Government gave to State governments in the past. I think this matter is relevant to the debate because all honourable senators know that local government was funded by State governments until 1973 when a Labor Government for the first time entered the area and gave funds to local government. </para>
          <para>The facts are that in the last Budget of the coalition Government the States received something like $3,6 14m in total loan borrowings, grants, untied grants, etc. A Labor government lifted that figure in its last Budget, in 1975-76, to about $8,566m, which represented something like 40 per cent of Commonwealth revenue being paid directly to the States with their varied and many responsibilities. Our last Budget was a Budget of restraint, a Budget on which we were enjoined and threatened by the media and other forces that unless there was a cut in public spending there would be even greater economic chaos in this country. Even at that time the Australian Labor Government made available to local government $230m. In addition we lifted the sum for sewerage from $27m in our first Budget to $ 115m in our last Budget. That amount was made available to the various States for sewerage works. Yet it is suggested that it was because of our recognition of the needs concept for sewerage and the needs concept for local government that we were contributing to a downturn in the economy and to all the other ills which are shown up by the deficiencies in the present capital system faced by the Australian people. </para>
          <para>We believe that this legislation, while agreeing to the principle of a fixed percentage of personal income tax, does not take into account tax indexation. There is nothing in the legislation to indicate that the Government will in any way lift this percentage to accommodate the tax indexation which may be introduced as a result of the speech of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> tomorrow evening. There is nothing to indicate that there will be a sum in excess of the funds that were made available in the 1975-76 Budget. So in these sorts of circumstances we are entitled to take the view that this legislation represents a retrogressive step- a step backward instead of a step forward- in providing a more substantial base for local government finance. </para>
          <para>There have been many committees of inquiry and royal commissions into the problems of local government funding. I need refer only to the one conducted by the New South Wales State Government. A copy of its report was made available to the New South Wales Parliament in 1967. The question of a local government grants commission, involving both the Commonwealth and the States, was relevant to the various submissions which were placed before that inquiry. The local government and shire associations made very strong submissions that there be a sharing of national taxation. It could be argued by the Government that it has taken this submission into consideration. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> in his contribution in the late hours of Thursday afternoon, 6 May, said that the question of federalism was a factor that had to be taken into consideration, that this was the new look and that this was the new way forward. Little was he to know that at the election on the following Saturday the New South Wales electors would reject the very simple way in which he had attempted to suggest that federalism was understood by the Australian people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>This concept has been well aired and discussed. It has been subjected to campaigning in the last Federal election campaign. I believe it has been widely embraced in local government circles and, indeed, in the community. </para>

          <para class="block">He was not to know, of course, that the electors of New South Wales were to have a very close look at that federalism policy and were to express very genuine concern about the ramifications of that policy. Of course he was not to know that local government, in its 2 subsequent submissions to the Government and to members of Parliament, would express considerable concern. That concern was expressed in recent documents which local government has circulated to members of Parliament. I refer to the comments of Councillor Thwaites. He said: </para>
          <quote>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is obvious that there is considerable apprehension in State Government circles and in local government circles about the federalism policy. One needs to look only at the newspaper comments to realise that, particularly at the very reasoned comment in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bergman.</inline> Time will not permit me to do other than refer to it. I put this to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> the 2 proponents in this place of the scheme. On 3 May Councillor Thwaites wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The whole exercise depends entirely on the level of assistance the Commonwealth Government decides to grant- and the Commonwealth will have to do some hard thinking about just what impact its promised, vital new reforms for local government will have. </para>
            <para>Local government recognises that the present stringent economic climate has limited its claim for 1976-77 to 2 per cent of personal income tax. The amount resulting from this will not- and this must be made very clear- mean a whole new future for local government. It will simply mean that the level of untied Commonwealth assistance in that year would be about 20 per cent of the rates which councils will be raising themselves. In other words, it will be just a little more than the expected rate of inflation. </para>
            <para>This means there is no magic to be expected from this new scheme, at least in these early days of economic difficulty. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Yet it has been suggested authoritatively that the share which will be applied to the Grants Commission in the revenue sharing arrangement of the Commonwealth-States scheme will be only 1.5 per cent of personal income tax. When we presented our last Budget we were told to exercise maximum restraint. In that Budget 2.2 per cent of Commonwealth income tax revenue was being made available directly to local government. The 1.5 per cent represents a reduction of something like one-third of the funds available to local government. As this starts to filter through the process, as it starts to filter through the community, what does Councillor Thwaites, the  President  of the Australian Council of Local Government Associations, say in his bulletin of yesterday?

          <para class="block">I was not able to get precise figures about funds which have been provided by the Commonwealth and States to local government authorities because they are not generally available. So 1 sought the assistance of the shire clerk of Sutherland in order to get some indication of what was received from the 2 arms of government for that council&#39;s last Budget. For the sake of the record and for the sake of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney,</inline> who I assume have a genuine interest in really solving problems facing local government in this country, I refer to the official figures which were given to me by the shire clerk. In the first instance I give to the Senate the total amount which that council received from the State government for its 1975-76 budget. </para>
          <para>It received from the State in direct grants $582,555. This amount is made up from local government assistance funds, which form part of the Grants Commission process which has been operating in New South Wales for the last seven or eight years. There were grants for Department of Main Roads construction, for transport bus routes, for bush fire protection, for welfare and youth work, for social workers, for after-school payments- that is after-school facilities- for vacation al play centres, for library facilities, and for Department of Main Roads maintenance. These amounts totalled $582,555. They are recurrent grants. They are grants from the State which the council can rely upon from year to year. They represent sums in excess of any other moneys which are made available to local government in any other part of Australia. These payments represent the top rank of payments made by States to local government. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators may ask: What was the Australian Government&#39;s contribution? In area improvement programs the council received $302,000. For leisure and recreation programs these are grants from the Commonwealth Government direct to local government- it received $66,000. In direct grants which were untied, and which the council decided how to spend, it received $600,000. For child care centres it received $100,000, and for urban and local roads it received $228,000. These amounts represented in total from the Australian Government to local government at Sutherland $1,296,000. In fact, the amount paid by the Australian Government directly to local government was more than twice the amount received from the meagre resources of the State Government. I accept that the State Government has meagre resources. </para>
          <para>Where in the legislation is it indicated that the States will be forced, persuaded or relied upon to continue those grants in the revenue sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States? There is no philosophical disagreement, as far as we are concerned, that there should be a fixed share of revenue given by the Commonwealth to the States, any more than there should be from the Commonwealth to local government. But unless the States give an unqualified undertaking that they will maintain their level of payments then local governments will be in a very difficult financial position. Of course, this is assuming- and remember that Sutherland received close enough to $ 1.3m- that the ratio of Commonwealth income tax will be at the 2.2 per cent level as it was last year. It has been said that that level might be 2 per cent. It has been authoritatively said that it will be 1 .5 per cent. Of course, every time that percentage drops by .1 per cent difficulties are created for local government. </para>
          <para>It has to be said that this legislation nowhere seeks to bring about that essential change in the financial relationships between the Commonwealth and the States. We have been attacked very strongly in this place and elsewhere on the so-called federalism policy of the Australian Labor Party. Because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> made statements in about 1957 or 1962 people accept that those statements represent in word perfect expression everything the Labor Party stands for. Basically, I do not find myself in a position which is different from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s interpretation of regionalism. I put it to the Senate that regionalism is by far a more democratic process than federalism of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> is the main proponent in national politics today. The trend towards regionalism is evident in local government throughout Australia. Clearly, we cannot continue to have 900 local government bodies. Clearly, we have to move towards larger local government organisations. Clearly, there has to be the establishment of regional authorities by which there will be an association between the national government and local government in a proper form of organisation. </para>
          <para>While we admit that there may be many flaws in the process of the Grants Commission, the fact is, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Else-Mitchell has indicated, that evolution is taking place, that experience is being gained and progress is being made in the regional concept. In Victoria only last year, at a conference at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> and the Minister for Local Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt,</inline> were present, the people involved in the regional associations of local government endorsed the concept as the best and most equitable way in which funding should be arranged from the Australian Government to local government. It was based on the very principle which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> repudiated in this place; that is the needs concept. Per capita grants are not the answer, any more than we have found that per capita grants have been the answer to the States&#39; developmental programs throughout the post-war period. We have had the Grants Commission so that special consideration, topping up consideration or needs consideration could be taken into account. It is only on the basis of establishing regional authorities that we can come to some understanding of the need for local government to look at the matters in a regional concept rather than in a purely parochial concept. We are not trying to establish a bureaucratic centralism. We repudiate the suggestion that all that has to be done is to adopt the new federalism policy which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser has espoused, a policy that is false, phony and pseudo. It does not take into account the views of local government itself. It does not in any way seek to express in this modern world the sort of needs concept which is essential if local government is to have any equalisation in terms of its responsibilities and the funds to cany out those responsibilities. </para>
          <para>It is in the light of this sort of experience that this legislation represents a turn back to the older methods. It does not represent the way forward. The financial mess which local government is in today has to be accepted. I give credit to this Government because at least it is prepared to carry on the concept which we as a Labor government recognised in  1973.  We not only sought to give direct grants to local government in  1973, 1974  and  1975,  but also we sought to make local government an integral part of the  3-tier  system of government in this country. We set out to make local government a genuine partner in the Federal system and to promote equality between regions. Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> cannot say to me in all seriousness that local government at Blacktown or Bankstown is on an equal footing with local government at Kuring-gai or Manly or Waverley in the older developed areas where most of the property improvement and other community facilities have been provided over a great number of years. Surely honourable senators cannot repudiate our concept that there ought to be equality between regions and that therefore we ought to be making greater sums of money available to those councils which have a particular responsibility to provide modern facilities in the modern world of today. Of course we accepted the responsibility to transform local government finance. If it had not been for the last Budget, we would have carried forward the policies which we had begun in  1973. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I listened to the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> who, like most members of the Opposition, believes that if he can put a case for spending a lot of money that is the be-all and the end all of it, irrespective of whether the money is spent responsibly or whether the people who have to provide that money can afford to be taxed to the extent that they are. This is a typical attitude of the Opposition. What effect did the previous Government have upon local government. We saw great spending in all sorts of areas, including local government. I will deal in detail with the operation of the Grants Commission later in my speech. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The previous Government&#39;s spending in nearly all areas resulted in a great burden being placed on the taxpayers of this country, particularly on the private sector, which was affected to such an extent that it went to the wall. There was unemployment all over Australia. Instead of allocating money responsibly to the local government authorities, the previous Government implemented such schemes as the Regional Employment Development scheme, one of the most wasteful schemes introduced by a Government as far as value for money is concerned. I do not think that any honourable senator opposite who has had experience with the RED scheme will say that it was a productive exercise, other than in providing employment. It was a completely irresponsible way in which to spend the taxpayers&#39; money. </para>
          <para>We know that the needs of local government have increased over the years. Back in the horse and buggy days the needs of local government were not so great. Sealed roads, which are expensive, were not required. Outhouses have been replaced by expensive sewerage systems. Water reticulation plants have replaced rainwater tanks. The responsibilities of local government have increased from year to year. The finance required to maintain the standard of living required by Australians has increased also. It is only natural that local government authorities are unable to gain all their revenue through the imposition of rates on their citizens. We all know that the old system of rating the unimproved value of land greatly disadvantaged those in the rural and pastoral areas. I can recall that in the shire in which I lived for many years- the Longreach shire- about  10  per cent of the people provided  92  per cent of the rates. We had situations where property owners were paying about  $4,000  or  $5,000  a year in rates. At that stage, the property owners were operating unprofitable enterprises because of drought and so on. The local doctor in the town, who was employed by the State, was not paying any rates to the local government authority. In comparison with the farmers in the areas the local doctor was receiving a very high income. Therefore the burden of financing local government was not fairly placed. It is only natural that there should be one taxing authority which will even out this burden so that taxpayers generally foot some of the bill for the requirements of local government. </para>
          <para>I should like to turn now to the question of the best way to disburse this money. This is where the Government&#39;s attitude differs from the attitude of the Opposition. We believe that the </para>
          <para class="block">States- which are far closer to the local government areas than is the Federal Government- are the best authorities to determine how the money allocated to the States should be allocated amongst the local government authorities. We believe that separate States grants commissions in each State will greatly assist local government authorities. After all, there is a variation of needs between States and there is a variation between the needs of local government. It is not true to say that, as suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt,</inline> the distribution would be on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis. There is provision in this Bill and in the Government&#39;s policy to ensure that whilst the States may receive <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> payments they may receive further payments if a need for them can be shown. Of course, the State grants commissions, when set up, will determine grants not on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis but on a basis of need. They will determine where the money should go. </para>
          <para>When the Labor Government set up the original Grants Commission it did so for the purpose of being a big brother. It wanted to make sure that local government throughout Australia would have to come cap in hand to Canberra. It attempted to bypass the States, therefore, reducing the responsibility of the States. The move towards regional areas was aimed firstly, of course, at undermining local government and, secondly, at undermining the States. The situation would have arisen whereby a great deal of expenditure within a State would have been made by the Federal Government on a regional basis and would have been directed by bureaucrats from Canberra. </para>
          <para>Australia is a vast country. It is not highly populated and is certainly underdeveloped. A great deal of the development that is required, from a public point of view, has to be carried out by the local people. The local people know what is required and they know what their needs are. When the Grants Commission was moving around Queensland many of the representatives of shires who went to the cities found that they had insufficient time to put their case. Those who had prepared an excellent case came away with a lot of money. Those who did not have time to prepare as good a case- although the need was there- came away with very little. There is no question about the fact that not enough time and consideration was given to the needs of these shires. There is little doubt that with the introduction of States grants commissions and with local governments so closely connected with the State Governments, time will be given to ensuring that the needs of local government authorities are met. </para>
          <para>We must remember the previous Government&#39;s attitude to local government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> mentioned that there will be a cut back in money allocated to local government. It is interesting to note, of course, that during the last 2 years of the Labor Government the private sector was hit so badly that the Government lost about $3,000m in tax receipts from the private sector- that is, the company sector and the provisional taxpayers who are mainly farmers. These people are mainly responsible for providing a great part of local government requirements through rating. We believe that to run the country on a businesslike basis, to get everyone back into production, we have to cut taxation if we are going to give incentive to produce to business and individuals. Once that is done we will be in a position to provide schools for local areas and we will be able to provide money to people who require public funds to operate a business. We will have the money available. First, we have to get the business going. The business of this country has to get going if we are going to fill the bucket in order to empty it for the benefit of everyone in Australia. I believe that local government will understand that while the Government is trying to get the economy back on its feet and moving again, it too will have to pull its belt in, like all other sections of the community. </para>
          <para>I now turn to the matter of regionalism. It has been said by both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> that it is our policy to get rid of regionalism and that regionalism is the greatest concept that could help develop the nation. There is nothing in this Bill or in our policy which says that we will get rid of regionalism. But we will allow the local authorities in the States concerned to decide how the regions will be worked out. They will not be worked out on an overall basis from a centralist organisation in Canberra. As I said before, once this Government is able to get the economy back on its feet, to get the nation producing again, and to get money into the coffers in order to support all public bodies such as local government authorities, then we will see this country go ahead. I am quite sure that local government, wherever one might find it in Australia, will appreciate the policies that we are expounding. I have no hest it at ion in supporting the Bill. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- In his brief address I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> has demonstrated yet again the confused and contradictory attitudes which prevail amongst supporters of the Government on the question of local government grants. On the one hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> assured us that, of course, the States know best how money ought to be distributed to local government and therefore the distribution of that money among local government units should be left with the State governments. If that is so, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> why the Government&#39;s policy stipulates that per capita grants will be paid to all local government authorities? If the Fraser Government really believes that the distribution of these moneys ought to be left entirely to the State governments, why has it served notice that it will stipulate, that it will dictate, to the States that a percentage, as yet unnamed, of the total funds must be paid to local government authorities on a per capita basis? </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I also found it rather interesting and certainly ironical that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> should have referred to farmers&#39; incomes, because I just happen to have in front of me a table prepared by the Parliamentary Library which shows on a calendar year basis net farm income at constant 1966-67 prices for the 3 years of Labor Government and the previous 3 years of government under the Liberal and National Country Parties. The table shows that net farm income at constant prices- that is, after allowing for inflation averaged $982m during the 3 years from 1970 to 1972 of Liberal-National Country Party Government, and net farm income in the 3 years of the Labor Government averaged $ 1,430m; that is an increase of 45 per cent. So if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> was postulating that it became difficult for farmers to pay rates during the last 3 years when their average incomes were, in real terms, 45 per cent higher than during the previous 3 years, I would say that it must have been impossible for them to do so in the preceding 3 years. I am not sure what relevance that has to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Bill but it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> who raised the issue, not I. </para>
          <para>It was interesting also to listen to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell&#39;s</inline> references to the alleged extravagance of the Whitlam Government in this area and the very clear implication that it is the intention of the Fraser Government to reduce the amount of money which will be paid in total from Federal sources to local government. I am grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> for having had the honesty, however unwitting it may have been, to make that intention clear and to spell it out. I hope the warning is appreciated by local government throughout Australia. </para>
          <para>As is the case with most of the Fraser Government&#39;s new federalism policy- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> has just very clearly illustrated this- there is a great deal of confusion and contradiction between its ends, its stated objectives, and the means by which it will attempt to achieve those stated objectives. Indeed, there is contradiction as to the means themselves. In his second reading speech on this Bill, the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The precise role that the Grants Commission will play in the implementation of the Government&#39;s new federalism policy has yet to be finally determined. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course, the Minister&#39;s second reading speech also makes perfectly clear that the only reason for this Bill amending the Grants Commissions Act is, firstly, to remove those sections of the Grants Commission Act under which the previous Labor Government made grants to local government authorities and, secondly, to provide a legal framework within which, in some way which has yet to be defined, the present Government&#39;s new federalism policy can operate. That, of course, there is a frank admission that the role that the Grants Commission will play in the implementation of the Government&#39;s policy has yet to be determined. Yet the Government, by its own admission, is amending the Grants Commission Act, destroying the machinery which was established by the Labor Government, without having any idea in its own mind precisely what it will establish in the Commission&#39;s place. Indeed, it could be justifiably said in regard to the Government&#39;s policy on this particular matter, as is the case with most of the Fraser Government &#39;s new federalism policy, that the Government is attempting to gestate, in a social and administrative vacuum, a viable policy from its own ideological prejudices. </para>
          <para>Apart from the frank admission in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech that the Government does not know where it is going, we find some other interesting contradictions. We are told repeatedly by this Government that the only purpose of this new federalism policy, in particular, this piece of legislation as one component of that new federalism policy, is to decentralise power. If the Government really believes in decentralising power from Federal sources, I put to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> as the Minister now responsible for this legislation- I hope he will take up the question in his reply to the second reading debate- the same question which I put to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell:</inline> If the Liberal Party really believes that the States can more competently and more equitably spend whatever amount of revenue may be raised for local government, why is this Government insisting that at least part of the money be distributed on a per capita basis? The Government has not entirely abandoned centralism or the concept of dictation to the States by the central Government. The Government clearly does not know where it is or what it believes in. </para>
          <para>Assuming that the decentralisation of economic and administrative power was desirable, we ought to bear in mind the simple fact that the State governments pretty effectively centralise power unto themselves anyway. Federal grants are made to the States, for example, for road construction. The State governments then impose on local government authorities additional restrictions and additional constraints. The State governments insist that local governments match the funds which the State governments hand on to local government from Federal sources. Some constraints are imposed, of course -indeed, this is necessary- by the national Government on the way in which such road funds can be spent. The State governments pass on not only all of those constraints; they add more of their own. So even if the decentralisation of administrative power were desirable, we ought to be very conscious of the fact that some State governments- I can think of one State Premier on the western side of the continent in particular- have no real objection to centralism at all. In fact, the Premier to whom I refer is a very keen centralist, providing he is doing the centralising and not someone else. A Press release issued on 23 April by the Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> had this to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Nixon, said today he was still seeking legal advice as to whether State Governments could sell off assets purchased with funds made available specifically for roads by way of Section 96 grants under the Commonwealth Aid Roads Act. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The subject matter of that Press statement was a proposal by the then Labor Opposition in New South Wales that some land which had been purchased for a freeway in inner Sydney be sold and the State Government retain the funds. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> has clearly stated that that is not on. He has stated that the Federal Government will impose its will on the present Government of New South Wales if it can get a favourable judgment from the courts. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> really thinks that this is important, I hope that his legal judgment is sounder than his political judgment because later in the statement he made on 23 April he said that the prospect of the Labor Party being elected to government in New South Wales was so remote that it was unlikely the people of that State would suffer. I hope that his judgment is sounder in other areas than it is in prophesying the results of elections. </para>
          <para>Within the legislation which is before us- the second reading speech admits that the Government does not know how this policy will be administered or how the Grants Commission is going to operate- and within the other published documents emanating from the Liberal and Country parties we have this interesting contradiction, a contradiction contained in one sentence, that not only will they pay per capita grants but also the per capita grants will incorporate a weighting formula. Surely that is a contradiction in terms. A per capita grant is a per capita grant and if it incorporates anything else it ceases by definition to be a per capita grant. This is indicative once again of the indecent haste with which the Liberal and Country parties threw this policy together. It is predictable, in view of the indecent haste with which they threw it together, that they have not the faintest idea how they will implement it. </para>
          <para>It has yet to be decided what will be the magnitude of the levy on personal income tax earmarked for local government. Before anyone can sensibly state whether this will be advantageous to local government it is essential that the magnitude of the levy be known. It is not known. Nor is it known what proportion of that levy, whatever the levy may be, will be designated for the per capita grants and what proportion will be designed for equalisation grants. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> the Minister responsible for this and other aspects of the Government&#39;s new federalism policy, was clearly confused both before and after Easter, as can be deduced from his replies to questions in the Senate. On 4 May I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> a question and referred to the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> that the surcharge in stage 2 imposed by the States would be &#39;more like in Canada&#39;. In Canada the levy has varied in the most recent year from 26 per cent to 42 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent. The Prime Minister stated publicly in his Press conference on 23 April that the level of surcharge would be comparable to that applying in Canada. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said on 4 May: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In no way would one contemplate that the kind of variations about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> speaks could or would occur. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">So on one hand we have the Prime Minister saying that a surcharge of a maximum of 42 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> per cent and a minimum of 26 per cent is likely to apply in Australia, since he has likened it to Canada, and on the other hand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> saying that in no way is this likely to happen. So from the 2 people who proclaim themselves to be most interested in this subject and primarily responsible for it, we have a clear contradiction on a crucial question of policy. Likewise, when </para>
          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline>was invited to reassure the Senate before Easter that the total amount of money granted to the States in real terms would increase by 58 per cent during the next 3 years as it had increased by 58 per cent under the 3 years of Labor Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> completely ducked the question. I invite him to comment on that in his closing remarks since he and many other Liberal Party spokesmen have asserted that the States will be better off financially under the new federalism policy than they were under the Whitlam Government. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and his colleagues to give a guarantee that the grants to the States will increase by something more than the 58 per cent by which they increased under the Whitlam Government during the last 3 years. In the second reading speech we find this bald assertion: </para>

            <para>The needs of less populated areas and of municipalities and shires with special disabilities will be protected. </para>

          <para class="block">I ask: In what way will these needs be protected and the special disabilities compensated for if it is the Government&#39;s objective that the distribution of the money be left as much as possible to the States? If it is the Government&#39;s intention to leave the distribution to the States, the Government is in no position to give any guarantee or to exercise any authority over the distribution of the grants and therefore cannot honestly assert that special disabilities will be protected. The second reading speech also stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No longer will local government have to approach the Federal Government &#39;cap in hand &#39;. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I thought that was a monumental piece of audacity from 2 parties which reigned for 23 years and which gave local government nothing by way of grants directly; parties which not only did nothing for local government by way of direct grants throughout their entire reign of 23 years but also had the audacity to oppose the 1974 referendum which would have given local government direct access to federal funds on a basis comparable with the States. It certainly has been a magnificent conversion by members of the Liberal and Country parties to the needs of local government. More likely, however, it is an empty piece of rhetoric such as we have become accustomed to hearing from all the spokesmen of the Government. </para>
          <para>Not only do we have no guarantee or even a reliable indication of the magnitude of the levy or the proportion of personal income tax which will be earmarked for local government, but also we have no information on the future of specific purpose grants, including road grants and grants for sewerage, which accrue to local government. </para>
          <para class="block">According to the Local Government Association of New South Wales, about $200m was provided by way of specific purpose grants to local government this financial year apart from the special $79m distributed through the Grants Commission. The Government&#39;s broad intention with respect to specific purpose grants appears to be that they wil be phased out. If the Government is really going to phase out specific purpose grants, local government in order to be on a financial basis equal to the position it was in this year will require $280m plus an inflation factor. This will require a levy on personal income of the order of <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> percent. </para>
          <para>The Government also tells us that it intends to index taxation, although in what way we have not been told. It intends progressively to transfer its current fiscal responsibilities through section 96 grants to the States and force the States to take over those responsibilities and pay for them with a State income surcharge, and if all those policies are to be implemented it follows inevitably that the amount of personal income tax collected by the Federal Government must decline. Therefore, since it has been indicated that the percentage of that reducing yield earmarked for local government will remain fixed, funds available for local government must fall in proportion with any fall in the total of federal personal income tax collections. The explanatory notes which were circulated with the Bill by the Minister make it very clear that the regional basis of data collection and planning which is entailed in the existing legislation will be abandoned. They also make it very clear that the distribution of that section, as yet unstated, of the total finances which would be channelled through States grants commissions would be left to those States grants commissions. </para>
          <para>Under the existing policy, 2 very pertinent facts emerge with respect to the distribution between regions, particularly the distribution between city and country. Firstly, the proportion of money paid to the less populous States is higher. My own State, Western Australia, with 8.2 per cent of the population, this year received 9.4 per cent of the grants to local governments. On a per capita basis, Western Australia received $6.90 a head compared with a national figure of $6. The discrepancy there is not particularly great, but it does become great when we look at the distribution between very well established urban areas and remote country shires. Within Western Australia, the average per capita grant to urban councils was $4.25 and the average per capita grant to rural councils was $20.12. Within those averages, of course, as one would expect, there  are some grants to local authorities in particularly remote areas which are extraordinarily high, and I will give a few examples. These are not all of the highest grants but are examples from the remoter areas of Western Australia. In this financial year the shire of Sandstone received a grant of $150 a head, the shire of Murchison $100, the shire of Menzies $66, the shire of Meekatharra $32, the shire of Lake Grace $25 and the shire of Halls Creek $34. In other words, to a factor of four or five, the existing policy favoured the rural areas as distinct from the capital city areas. </para>
          <para>I invite Government spokesmen to give a guarantee that that same distribution pattern will be preserved under their policy. I invite those honourable senators who purport to represent rural areas in the Senate- in particular I invite the National Country Party- to give a guarantee that their Government&#39;s proposed changes will provide a distribution of funds as favourable to rural shires as is the existing policy. If they choose to give that guarantee, I invite them to prove how they can do it when, by their own admission, they have abdicated the responsibility for the distribution of the grants, and indeed have proudly asserted that one of the most attractive features of their policy is that the national Government has abdicated responsibility for distribution of the grants at a regional level and will hand the distribution over to the States. </para>
          <para>I want to make 2 more points, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President.</inline> The equalisation concept, which was the basis of the Labor Government&#39;s policy, is specifically repealed by this amending Bill. Section 6 of the old Act is repealed, and the explanatory memorandum circulated by the responsible Minister spells out the fact that the equalisation concept has been abolished by this Bill. The second point I wish to make is that, whether it is a deliberate intention or not, one of the effects of this changing concept, the philosophical basis behind the legislation, will be to perpetuate parochial jealousies. The Liberal Party, and even more so the Country Party, has successfully traded on the fear people in remote areas and in country areas generally have of governments, whether they be in Perth or in Canberra. They have peddled this nonsense, this myth that the Labor Party has a conspiracy. It is going to bring in regionalism, it is going to destroy local government, it is going to destroy State governments ultimately; all of this is one component of the great socialist centralist conspiracy. That is the sort of nonsense which was peddled in the countryside by the representatives of the Liberal and National Country Parties. It was peddled so successfully that some particularly gullible local councils, aided and abetted, of course, by Liberal Party hacks sitting on those councils, believed it. I refer in particular to the town council of Northam, which pompously asserted that it was not going to put in for a grant in 1 974 from the Whitlam socialist centralist government, and it did not apply for a grant. Therefore, of course, it did not get one, and at the end of that year the mayor of Northam had the audacity to complain that the Northam town council had suffered financially because of the Whitlam Labor Government. </para>

              <para>- I have not finished the story yet. The  President  of the Northam Branch of the Liberal Party, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bulloch-</inline> I think <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kelvin</inline> Bulloch- then stated in a letter to the editor of the Northam <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> that &#39;by arrangement with our mayor I am replying to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh&#39;,</inline> and particularly to my assertion that the Liberal Party&#39;s political influence on the Northam town council had been responsible for the council&#39;s rejection of that grant. I think it is supremely ironic that the  President  of the Northam Branch of the Liberal Party, signing himself as the  President  of that branch, should have said: &#39;By arrangement with our mayor, I deny the charge that the Liberal Party has infiltrated the Northam town council and is misusing its power on the Northam town council&#39;. It is most unfortunate for the ratepayers of Northam that, firstly they had active members of the Liberal Party on the town council who were more concerned with pushing the Liberal Party&#39;s political barrow and political nonsense than they were with the welfare of the ratepayers of the town of Northam. It is even more unfortunate, of course, that the whole concept of regionalism, the notion and principle of regional cooperation, was undermined by the vicious, unprincipled tactics which were used by the Liberal and National Country Parties. That was unfortunate. It is tragic that one of the intentions of this Bill is to destroy permanently the concept of regionalism and the concept of regional cooperation. The Bill before us is a hybrid which has emerged from the conflict between the ideological prejudices of the Liberal Party and the reality of the world. Unfortunately, it does not have any hybrid vigour. </para>

I believe that the most sinister of its policies was that which dealt with the proposal to establish 30 or 40 regions throughout Australia comprising local government bodies in those regions which would have to apply to a central grants commission for their revenues. In other words, the requirement would be that decisions would be made for them by a central authority far removed from the areas concerned. Local government authorities could not even buy a grader or a tractor without recourse to this commission. But, of course, that policy is in keeping with the Australian Labor Party&#39;s purported intention to abolish the States. I recall the time a few years ago when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> who was at the time, I think, the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, delivered a speech at the Australian National University in which he referred to this subject and said that the State Labor members of Parliament were all working towards their own dissolution. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> delivered a very well-presented speech in the Senate on 6 May 1976. He referred to this matter also and said:   . . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> G. Whitlam, who, in a series of lectures starting, I think, in the 1950s and proceeding through the 1960s, sketched Labor&#39;s approach to the Australian Constitution. In those lectures, it is made quite clear that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and his Party see it as being desirable that the State governments should wither away and that Australia should be served by a central government in Canberra and a series of regional arrangements through building on what is now local government in Australia. </para>
          <para class="block">That plan has unfolded over the last two or three years. We believe that our policy of federalism will provide the States with a greater say with respect to the way they spend their share of the pool. It will certainly provide local government authorities with the capacity to look ahead and to plan their road programs and various other local activities in a businesslike way, guaranteed of a certain percentage of the taxation revenue. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline>made some comment with respect to the Northam Council in Western Australia. I can tell him that there were many local councils throughout the more remote areas of South Australia that were very concerned about the policies of the former Government, for example with respect to roads. The Labor Government Bill that was introduced into the Parliament provided less money in many categories each year for road programs. The Labor Government, in its judgment, relied on a report which assumed an inflation rate of 6 per cent per annum. But at that time, road construction costs were increasing at between 15 per cent and 20 per cent per annum. Any Government which introduces legislation as the Labor Government did in its roads grants legislation to provide less money over a period places an impossible burden upon local government authorities to plan properly for their road works. This legislation represents a sensible approach so far as we are concerned. I am certain that local government bodies and State governments throughout Australia will recognise that they will be able to plan more carefully and in a more businesslike fashion to spend their allocations in the best possible way. </para>
          <para>This Bill not only opens the way for the Commonwealth Grants Commission to continue in operation as a central body. It also makes possible the distribution of money through States grants commissions. It seems to me to be logical that that should take place. Reference is made in our policy to equalisation grants. The policy states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is intended that the principle of equalisation and the current advantages accruing to the less populous States vis-a-vis New South Wales and Victoria shall be sustained at all stages. </para>

          <para class="block">It goes on: </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline>referred to specific purpose grants. For the benefit of honourable senators I will read our policy on specific purpose grants as outlined in our federalism policy. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The coalition parties are convinced that national objectives can be fully asserted and social reforms achieved and maintained with a more selective use of such grants and without heavy-handed interference and duplication of functions. </para>
            <para>Many of the existing Section 96 grants are now part of well-established and universally accepted programs within the States. The moneys for such programs could be transferred to general purpose revenue reimbursement and ultimately absorbed in the States&#39; income tax revenue. </para>
            <para>Under such circumstances, the programs would continue in full without prejudice. A Liberal-National Country Party Federal Government would seek agreement from the States that this would be so, prior to making the transfer. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>If a future initiative should prove necessary to maintain or to increase the program, the Government would retain the initiative to invoke an appropriate special purpose grant.

          <para class="block">I hope that this adequately answers <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh&#39;s</inline> question regarding specific purpose grants. I am very pleased to be able to support this legislation which reflects ideas I put forward many years ago and which received popular acclaim in the Eyre Peninsula area. I do not know what happened to the amendment that I moved to the motion regarding this matter. It seemed to lose its way somehow. At the end of the motion I said that we ought to get the support of other local government associations to make appropriate representations with respect to the appointment of a royal commission on this subject. I am pleased that now we see this Bill paving the way for federalism policies which, according to the State Labor Premiers from Tasmania and South Australia, will give them a much better deal. I have pleasure in supporting the Bill. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I wish to speak very briefly about this Bill. Perhaps I should indicate just 3 important matters which the Bill contains and about which the Opposition is concerned. The Senate is debating a Bill to amend the Grants Commission Act. In his second reading speech the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> defined the purposes of the legislation as being threefold. He said that the purpose of the Bill is firstly, to remove from the Grants Commission Act any references to assistance for local government which are no longer appropriate under the federalism policy; secondly, to make specific provision for the Commission to advise the Government on matters relating to assistance to local government; and thirdly, to remove the obligation upon the Grants Commission to report on applications for assistance from local government. In his opening sentence the Minister described this Rill as being a step in the implementation of the Government&#39;s federalism policy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As we see it, the result of this legislation being passed by the Senate will be the changing of the name of the Grants Commission to the Commonwealth Grants Commission. This carries with it the implication, which is spelt out later in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech, that there will be established 6 State Grants Commissions which will perform in relation to local government a function, in a structural sense, similar to that which has been performed by the Grants Commission in the past. The legislation involves a change to the system whereby the Grants Commission directly inquiries into the affairs and, more particularly, the needs of the 880 local government organisations in this country and makes recommendations to the Government on the totality of the amount of money which should be made available to each individual council. The first point about that proposal which concerns the Opposition is that it is again indicated that the proposal carries with it the implication that at a primary level the concept of consideration of the needs of each local government council will be abandoned. It also carries with it the idea that the universality of interest of local government across Australia is a matter which is appropriately considered at a national level and not in a sort of segmented level, depending on the coincidence of State boundaries. </para>
          <para>If one examines the present system one finds that the Grants Commission reports on those needs to the Government and the Government then makes a decision about the total amount which will be made available by the Grants Commission for local government purposes. The Government is quite able to make that decision even though it may disagree with the assessment of the Grants Commission. When this legislation is passed, and we must assume that it will be passed, the Government will tell the Grants Commission at the start, as we understand it, the total amount of Government funds which will be available. The Grants Commission will then make a recommendation apportioning that sum amongst the States. One supposes that the State governments, having enacted legislation to establish their local Grants Commissions, will then charge those Grants Commissions with the task of apportioning that money amongst the local government areas in the State. I will make just one or two comments about that. The first is that although this approach may ultimately involve less cost to the national Government, or indeed greater flexibility to the national Government in deciding what the cost to it of local government will be, it is very doubtful in our view whether the proposed structure of providing grants to local government will involve less cost to the community as a whole. The situation may arise in which the Grants Commission, with 40 years of expertise, will have this function removed from it. That function will be reinvested in 6 State Grants Commissions which will be involved, possibly without the same degree of expertise, in assessing the amount of <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grants to be made to particular States. </para>
          <para>The next point to which I wish to draw the Senate&#39;s attention refers to <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grants. The Opposition sees this as carrying with it the implication, based on the present Government&#39;s ideological hang-up about these matters, that the richer local government areas will get richer and the poorer local government areas will get poorer. This is so, we believe, irrespective of any equalisation proposals or topping up proposals, if I can use that expression, when the primary criterion of need is abandoned. It is very difficult to say too much about this matter because there is so little revealing information in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. One suspects, perhaps unkindly, that this matter has been rushed through somewhat in order that the legislation might be on the statute books prior to the next Premiers&#39; Conference. If one examines the second reading speech delivered by the Minister for Administrative Services, there really is very little enlightenment as to what it all means. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> nods his head with his characteristic charm. If nothing else in politics, I suppose he could be described as a realist. He recognises, having glanced at the second reading speech prepared for him, that the author of that speech really does not know what is going to happen about the final arrangements which must be made in connection with this proposal, in terms of detail. One refers particularly to page 2 of the printed copy of that speech. </para>

          <para>Again, at page 3 of the printed copy of the second reading speech one reads: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The precise role that the Grants Commission will play in the implementation of the Government&#39;s new federalism policy has yet to be finally determined.

The proposed amendments to the Bill reflect this modified role. </para>

          <para class="block">Again that is a statement of characteristic imprecision.

One finds this statement to be an extraordinary example of the scene 6 months after the election in which there is still this calculated vagueness in a proposal as important as this one. </para>

              <para>- He has had his ups and downs which, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> knows, I would be the first to acknowledge. This sort of obsessional desire to raise up the ghost of regionalism and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> &#39;s earlier expressed views about the role of State Labor politicians, and then to use it as a stick to support this rather vague and waffling legislation in 1976 seems to me to be a bizarrely imaginative exercise, to put it in the kindliest terms. One of the things which practical experience of the Labor Government&#39;s endeavours to encourage regional arrangements shows is that this enabled councils and local governments to pool their resources, their initiatives and, indeed, their wishes in certain ways which have benefited each of those councils and the whole of the region. For example, I refer the Senate to a conference in May 1976 of the chairmen of local government bodies. This was presided over by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Else-Mitchell, the  Chairman  of the Grants Commission. In describing the Labor Government&#39;s programs for local government, he said: </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <quote>
            <para>These programs represented a breakthrough by local government because they manifested the recognition of the obligation of Federal Government to provide financial assistance for local government purposes as a supplement to the revenues which councils were able to raise from their traditional revenue sources. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The policy may, however, cause some concern to local government in 2 respects. One is that since the ultimate distribution of funds to local government will be the responsibility of the State Grants Commission, the public hearings which previously took place between local government bodies and the Commission will come to an end. The other is that the passing of responsibility to the State for local government grants will make unnecessary- and perhaps deny to local government- any communication with the Commonwealth Government or any of its agencies. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That criticism, made by the  Chairman  of the Grants Commission, indicates something of what is envisaged by the expression &#39;the new federalism&#39;, because the so-called new federalism is nothing more than a reiteration in some respects of nineteenth century colonialism in its attitude to this question. If we deny communication between the Commonwealth Government and local government in the way which I believe is envisaged by this legislation, the clock is really turned back to that period when the situation with artificiality of colonial boundaries was a key factor in governmental structures in this country. </para>
          <para>For those sorts of reasons which concern us, and concern us largely because this legislation is described as an aspect of the new federalism which seems to us to be a very vague and ill defined concept, the Opposition strongly opposes the purposes and the provisions of this Bill. Furthermore, we find it deplorable that, in these sorts of <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> arrangements which have been thrown together to constitute the new federalism, we should find a Bill as sloppy and imprecisely defined as the Minister in the second reading speech which he gave in this place indicates it to be. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> as I said before, acknowledges that imprecision. </para>

          <para>For those reasons we oppose the legislation. We think it is an undesirable and a retrograde step. We think it is bad for the structure of government in Australia generally. We think it is particularly bad for local government in Australia. We think it is bad because it severs rather than encourages the development of closer relationships between the 3 tiers of government. We think that in 1976 it is undesirable for Australian government structure and for Australian society as a whole. Accordingly we oppose the legislation, as a reprehensible, if I could use that characteristic expression, step in the structure of government in Australia. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank honourable senators who have spoken in this debate. I especially thank my colleagues on this side who have certainly understood what the Bill is all about and who have given it their unqualified support. It is a matter of regret that the Opposition has been so myopic about the Government&#39;s intentions, if I may pick up a term used by the Reverend John who has just resumed his seat. For at least a year the Government&#39;s intentions on federalism and on the relationship between the Commonwealth Government and local authorities has been quite well understood and well known, especially by the local authorities. It is no use honourable senators opposite, particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> and recently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> now attempting to say that what their present Leader, the then  Deputy  Leader, said in 1965 does not represent the official policy of the Australian Labor Party. Local authorities may not have believed us prior to 1972 that those lectures in 1965 did represent the official policy of the Australian Labor Partymuch as people did not believe Hitler and his <inline font-style="italic">Mein Kampf,</inline> and they saw what happened in the end. However between the years 1972 and 1975 local authorities felt the effects, and they saw what happened to them over those 3 years. Local government felt the full impact of Labor&#39;s socialist, centralist, mad hatter, lunatic economic policies. </para>

          <para>It is understandable that honourable senators opposite do not care for this Bill. After all, it dismantles the great centralised bureaucratic machine which they erected over the last 3 years and by which they hoped to establish from Canberra their ascendancy over local authorities. We are implementing our federalist policy and, as far as possible, are bringing about a devolution of power in this country, not just at State Government level but at local government level. Unlike our opponents opposite, I think it is fair to say, we believe in the involvement of as many people as possible in Australia in the decision making process. It is notorious that the Labor Party believes in as few people as possible being involved in the decision making process. As I understand and as I observed, not by reading the newspaper but with my eyes, in the 3 years between 1972 and 1975 the Labor Party believed in the decision making process by kitchen cabinets and one-man bands. In the terrible period that we went through during that time we realised that if local government is to be protected it must be protected by a restructured Commonwealth Grants Commission, with a guaranteed access to a share of Commonwealth personal income tax. This has been spelt out time and time again by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline></para>
          <para>I think it is enough for me to reply in these broad terms to the speeches in the second reading debate. To answer point by point what has been raised by honourable senators certainly would not convince them to vote for the second reading of the Bill. </para>

          <para>-The Committee of the Senate is debating clauses 1 to 3 of the Commonwealth Grants Commission Bill. As we all know this is a Bill to amend the Grants Commission Act 1973-75.I indicate now, as I indicated during the course of my remarks in the debate on the second reading, that the Opposition opposes the Bill. It opposed it at the second reading stage. It intends to oppose the Bill during the Committee stage and at the third reading. However, because we know the Government&#39;s legislative program is getting somewhat tight, it is not our intention to divide on all clauses. But it is our intention to state the Opposition case on each of the clauses. Then I anticipate that when you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> finally put the question that the Committee report that it has considered the Bill we will oppose that motion and divide the Senate. I emphasise that at this time so that our lines will not be crossed during the Committee stage. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Committee is dealing with clauses 1 to 3 of the Bill. Clause 1 is the short title; clause 2 sets out the date on which the Bill will come into operation as the day on which it receives royal assent; and clause 3 relates to the title of the principal Act being amended by inserting before the words &#39;Grants Commission &#39; the word &#39;Commonwealth&#39;. We oppose this amendment, as we indicated in our remarks during the debate on the second reading, because the use of the word Commonwealth&#39; clearly indicates that the Government intends retaining a Commonwealth Grants Commission and, likewise, having 6 separate State grants commissions. It is for that reason that we offer our opposition to this clause. I emphasise that prior to the Whitlam Government being elected in 1972 and before we amended the Grants Commission Act 1973 this organisation was known as the Commonwealth Grants Commission and it had been known as such from about 1932 or 1933 when it was established. </para>
        <para>If we have to have a distinction, naturally we of the Opposition prefer the word &#39;Australian&#39; rather than the word &#39;Commonwealth&#39;. I think it fair to say that had there been a number of State grants commissions at the time this legislation was amended by the Whitlam Labor Government we would have added the word &#39;Australian&#39; rather than retaining the word &#39;Commonwealth&#39;. The very fact that at that time we deleted the word &#39;Commonwealth&#39; from the title of the Grants Commission indicates clearly that it was the view of the then Labor Government that there should be only one grants commission. As I have said, this clause proposes to change the name of the Act to the Commonwealth Grants Commission Act. I point out that under clause 7 of the Bill section 8 of the principal Act is amended by omitting from sub-clause (7) the words &#39;Public Service of the Commonwealth&#39; wherever occurring and substituting the words Australian Public Service&#39;. There appears to me to be some inconsistency there. It is for the reasons which I have advanced that the Opposition opposes clause 3 of the Bill. </para>

          <para>- Clause 4 seeks to amend section 4 of the principal Act by deleting certain definitions now standing. It is proposed to delete from the principal Act the definition of appropriate Minister&#39;; the definition of &#39;approved regional organisation&#39;; and to insert in the definition of &#39;Commission&#39; the word &#39;Commonwealth&#39; before the word &#39;Grants&#39;. It is also intended to omit the definition of &#39;local governing body&#39; and substitute a new definition in lieu thereof. I take the time of the Committee to indicate that the definition in the principal Act of &#39;appropriate Minister&#39; which it is now sought to omit by this Bill reads:  appropriate Minister&#39;, in relation to a State, means such Minister of the down of that State as is determined by the Premier of that State by instrument in writing, and includes any Minister of the Crown for the time being acting for and on behalf of that Minister; </para>
        </talk.start></continue><para class="block">That definition is being deleted. I mention that because accusations have been made from time to time during the course of this debate that when the Labor Party was in government we did not extend any co-operation to the States. Quite clearly, in the Act which we brought into being, there was provision for Ministers of State governments to be appropriately defined. Now under the Bill the Government seeks to define approved regional organisation&#39;. Also, the Bill omits the present definition of &#39;local governing body &#39; which in the principal Act is defined as:  local governing body&#39; means a local governing body established by or under a law of a State; </para><para class="block">It is proposed to substitute the following definition:  local governing authority&#39; means an authority, established by or under a law of a Stale, that is, in accordance with provision made by the regulations, a local government authority for the purposes of this Act; </para><para class="block">We suggest that the amendments proposed by this clause commence the destruction of the regionalism concept by removing from the definition &#39;regional organisations&#39; and, as I have mentioned, &#39;appropriate State Minister&#39;. The definition of local governing authority varies the earlier definition of local governing body. It appears to me that under the new definition a local governing authority means an authority which is to fall within provisions now to be made by regulation. Apparently it is the intention of the Government to confine authorities to elected local government authorities thus, I suggest, including regional bodies such as county councils and other regional local government organisations. But it is not certain exactly what that means. I understand, according to the Minister&#39;s second reading speech as I recollect it, that that matter has been referred to the Grants Commission for further advice. </para><para>The problem as I see it is that the types of local government authorities will be determined by way of regulation and not necessarily in consultation with the relevant State governments. Thus, someone in Canberra could well be influential in determining which local government authorities will be prescribed or regulated for under the Act. That person will also be influential in determining those local government authorities which <inline font-style="italic">wm</inline> be eligible to receive funds under the present provisions. Because the deletions of the definitions in paragraph (d) of this clause virtually mean the destruction of the concept of regionalism as established by the Labor Government, we oppose the passage of this clause. </para>

I have no doubt that it is not intended that that type of body should be included within the provisions of this type of legislation.

          <para>-I rise to draw the attention of the Minister to a question similar to that of my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to the definition of local government authority. I suggest that in the words that are used- I think a superfluity of them is obvious- all that is meant is that local government authority means a State local government authority that is defined by the Commonwealth regulations. That is a pretty wide function to give to regulations. I wish to have some understanding of why it is necessary to resort to that and why in this Bill those categories of local authorities, such as referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> might not have been excluded in the definition and the statutory definition of local government authority applied. Why is it necessary to employ regulations to define what is, I think the Minister would agree, an essential definition on which one major part of the Bill will operate? </para>

          <para>- I think it is fair to say that the original idea behind this broad concept of providing finance for local government was that it would relate, in general, to municipalities and shires as the grants of the previous Government did. When it came to translating that, some legal difficulties arose because local government varies greatly between States, as the honourable senator would know. In some States, particularly South Australia, we have what are called unincorporated areas, and there are other difficulties. So I think that the explanation is twofold. First, the Commonwealth Government, through the Premiers Conference, invited the Commonwealth Grants Commission to look to what might be the definition of a local government authority and to make a recommendation to the Premiers Conference. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline>McClelland raised the matter of definitions. I should point out that there will be a continuing dialogue at the Premiers Conference level about this matter. The Commonwealth Grants Commission will report to the June Premiers Conference. There will be discussions and no doubt arising from them the concept of the definition will emerge. It might well be that as time proceeds the more tidy form of legislation would be what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> envisages- that is, rather than adopting the loose regulatory fashion, ultimately a simple amendment to this Bill by way of a tidier definition would emerge. I shall keep that thought in mind for the future. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline>McClelland also mentioned the fact that the aim, in this clause, appeared to be to destroy regions. The Commonwealth Government has no intention of destroying regions. The Commonwealth Government is perfectly happy for regions to emerge spontaneously from the grass roots at local or State level for a variety of purposes. It sees a lot of merit in their arising for a variety of purposes but it is quite emphatic that it does not see the role of a Commonwealth Government of our Liberal or federalist philosophy as being to impose policies by imposing regions from a Commonwealth level throughout Australia. It is not our intention therefore to impose regions to enforce our local government policies. It would never be our intention to impose regions for the indirect purpose of achieving amalgamations. So there is no need, for our part, of regions for this mechanical purpose, but if States or local governments desire regions then they can spontaneously emerge. </para>

I am more confused now than I was on the question of &#39;local government authority&#39;. It may be because of my imperfection in understanding exactly the English language. I am concerned about the words &#39;that is&#39; which have commas around them. Do I understand that &#39;local government authority&#39; means an authority established by or under a law of a State? Then, despite the fact that local government authorities may be established under a law of a State, we describe then what we mean by &#39;a law of the State&#39;- that is, one that complies with our regulation. </para>

The clause states that a local government authority means an authority which is established by or under a law of the State and so on. I should like to raise the question of local government in Norfolk Island. That island is not a State. So surely there has to be a clearer definition than that. Perhaps the definition of a local government authority should refer to not only an authority established by or under a law of a State but also to such territories of the Commonwealth of Australia which have local governing agencies of one sort or another. I simply use Norfolk Island as an example. I should be grateful if the Minister could address himself to that aspect when he replies. </para>

          <para>-I wish to raise a matter briefly on the question of regionalism. I do not wish it to be inferred for one moment from what the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> might have implied that a Labor Government was forcing on the States or on local government the concept of regionalism as a result of an arbitrary determination by any Minister of the Australian Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is trying to interject. I am just putting a case on behalf of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> had ample time during the second reading debate to make a speech had he wanted to do so. In the original Act the term &#39;approved regional organisation&#39; means &#39;an organisation or body that is, under the regulations or an approval under section 17 that is in force, an approved regional organisation for the purpose of this Act&#39;. Section 17 of the principal Act reads: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The Minister for Urban and Regional Development may, after consultation with the appropriate Minister of the State concerned, approve an organisation or body that represents, or acts on behalf of, the local governing bodies established in a region as an approved regional organisation for the purposes of this Act or revoke or alter such an approval. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Clearly under that definition there had to be consultation between a Minister of the Australian Government and the appropriate State Minister for the purpose of the Commonwealth determining and approving the regions that were being drawn up. </para>
        <para>However, on the aspect to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred, as I mentioned in the first speech I made during the Committee consideration of this Bill, the definition in the Bill of &#39;local government authority&#39; is &#39;an authority, established by or under a law of a State, that is, in accordance with the provision made by the regulations, a local government authority for the purposes of this Act&#39;. Having re-read that definition, I might say that I now realise the force in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> &#39;s argument as to why there is a comma after the word &#39;State&#39; and before the word &#39;that&#39;. Quite clearly the problem, as I see it, under this proposed definition is that the types of local government authorities will be determined by way of regulation and not necessarily in consultation with the respective State governments. As I mentioned earlier, it appears to me that rather than there being the consultation that previously existed between the Australian Government and the State governments on these matters by way of regulation, as it were, a public servant will be very influential, to say the least, in determining which local government authority will be eligible for funds under this legislation. I invite the Minister&#39;s comments on those matters. </para>

          <para>- As I pointed out, there exists throughout Australia a series of bodies which might loosely come under the heading &#39;local government authorities&#39;. Indeed, most of us simplify it- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland would know this- by referring to local and semi-governmental authorities to divide them in 2 categories. Indeed the Loan Council, as the honourable senator would well know, does that itself when it is working out borrowing programs.

        <para class="block">Melbourne and Metropolitan Board of Works, and so on. </para>
        <para>Again I refer to my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> There are some areas of States which are not covered by what we would call municipalities and shires and are unincorporated areas. For example, in South Australia the South Australian Government is itself directly a local government authority in these unincorporated areas. The previous Government denned the fact that its grants would be directed to municipalities and shires. That was its definition. We have already set out in consultations at the Premiers Conference- we will continue those consultations- to arrive at what our meanings will be in this regard. I do not wish to pre-empt them. Certainly we have in mind municipalities and shires, and certainly we have in mind to include city areas of government city councils- in capital city concepts. We have invited the Commonwealth Grants Commission to recommend definitions to the next Premiers Conference. Because there are these disabilities, what this clause provides is that, consistent with bodies being recognised as local authorities by the States, we will then by Commonwealth regulation indicate the types and classifications which, for the purposes of this Act, will receive funds, just as in the past the previous Government determined that only municipalities and shires, and not semi-governmental bodies, would receive funds. </para>

            <para>- Yes. In fact, I think the honourable senator&#39;s first proposition was the nearest to it, but they have to meet 2 criteria. They have to meet the criterion that they are under State law a local government authority; they have to meet the second one that they are gazetted by us in regulation. There is no difficulty with that. I turn now to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack &#39;s question. This Bill applies only to States.

        <para class="block">It appears to the Opposition that the repeal of that section of the Act would destroy the concept of equalisation which was the very basis of the Bill introduced by the Labor Government. As the Minister said in his second reading speech there will be substituted, firstly, the principle of grants on a per capita basis with grants thereafter being made on an equalisation or topping-up basis, having been assessed by the local government authorities. It is for the reason that the repeal of section 6 of the principal Act rejects the concept of equalisation, as we see it, that we oppose clause 5. </para>

          <para>- I shall be very brief. I simply want to correct what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland has said. Our policy certainly is not one which rejects equalisation. Our policy is thoroughly misunderstood by the honourable senator if he so construes it. We will establish State grants commissions and all States have agreed to that. I remind honourable senators that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Else-Mitchell, now  chairman  of the Commonwealth Grants Commission, when sitting as a royal commissioner on local government in New South Wales made a recommendation in relation to local government which was adverted to by the Opposition today. However, the Opposition failed to mention that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Else-Mitchell recommended that the true and proper way of establishing equity in financing local government, including equalisation, was to establish a State grants commission and it was upon his recommendation that the New South Wales Government set up a State grants commission in which the equalisation principle has been enshrined. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The honourable senator is not right in saying that because there is a second leg to our financing, that is, direct per capita grants to local government, it will in some way prejudice the capacity of the States for equalisation purposes. I remind the honourable senator, and history can reflect it, that the total amount made available by the previous government by way of grants to all the States for some 800 of the 900 local government bodies was less than 1 per cent of personal income tax. It amounted to something like $89m. That is the bench mark by which to measure the future. It is a matter of judgment how in the future we will decide an amount of money and how in individual States a percentage of that will go to per capita grants and a percentage to equalisation, but certainly we will continue equalisation. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition opposes the passage of clause 8 because it seems to cut the nexus between the Commonwealth Grants Commission and the local governing bodies. It enables the Grants Commission to inquire into matters relating to grants to States for local government purposes as a whole within that State but not for regions within the State. It enables the Commonwealth Government by way of regulation to determine the purposes for which the relevant grants can be used. I suggest to the Minister that this last factor is particularly dangerous as the Grants Commission could be used for purposes quite outside the intent of the Act and thereby could leave Parliament with no control over the purposes of the grants. By clause 8, sections 17 and 18 of the principal Act are repealed. They are the sections, one of which I read earlier, relating to the consultation between the Federal Minister and the respective State Minister on the qualification or approval of regions.

In my and the Minister&#39;s own State, New South Wales, large areas were devastated by floods and as a result the income and resources of local government bodies were very seriously affected and badly eroded. Is this new concept to take account of such happenings or circumstances as that? If not, what provision will be made for the share of the State apportioned by the Commonwealth Grants Commission to be reviewed in the event of a happening of that nature?

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Douglas</inline>McClelland has raised a number of matters. First of all I want to make it perfectly clear that the amounts made available to local government under the Federal Government&#39;s new policies will be entirely untied. There will be no directions attaching to them at all. What we are talking about at this moment, and honourable senators should put aside the specific purpose grants that exist today between the Commonwealth Government and local government, is a concept which provides on the one hand for direct per capita grants and on the other hand for equalisation or topping up grants. In stage one on which we are now embarking the amounts and the percentage of total funds we will provide will relate to the first phase about which I have talked. It will relate to giving money to the States for equalisation and direct per capita grants. There is a second phase in which we will look subsequently at individual specific purpose grants, one by one, to see whether, because they are institutionalised and because they are running well, they can be phased into future revenues as such, maybe without condition and maybe by block grant condition or some other way. But that is for stage 2 in the future and is not to be taken into consideration now. Nor is it to be taken into consideration in evaluating the amount that will be apportioned in the immediate fiscal year ahead. The Federal Government has no intention of abdicating its right and responsibility to use section 96 of the Constitution for the specific purpose for which it was written, that is, to make specific purpose grants, particularly in terms of disasters where extreme situations arise and there is a need to reinstate and rehabilitate. I say in direct answer to the honourable senator, that of course there would remain the section 96 type grant in the case of disaster. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>As to the inclusion in stage 2 of those specific purpose grants that are now available, if we do merge some of them into general revenue we will certainly consult the Commonwealth Grants Commission as to the formulae which would bring equity to this matter. But one should keep in mind in any case that these kinds of situations will be under review constantly. One should keep in mind also that the future existence of a council for inter-governmental relations will provide a continuing forum to expose inequities, to expose obvious channels of reform, and this Parliament will have the benefit as will the State parliaments, of being able to respond to that council. </para>

I thank <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. Many of the local government authorities in Australia believe, from bitter experience- and it certainly seems to me that they have grounds for this belief- that they have not always had passed on to them in full by State governments amounts of money which were intended to be used for local government purposes and which were made available by the Commonwealth. The States have tended to charge relatively high administration or other sorts of fees which come out of the amounts of money intended to be made available to local government. I understand that it has been indicated by one State that when the new scheme comes into operation it is anticipating being able to purloin some  15  per cent on the way through for its own purposes to cover its cost of administration. I am sure the Minister will be able to confirm that, so far as the Commonwealth is concerned, that would not be looked upon with any degree of approval or support. As I understand it, that approach is an indication that old practices die hard. </para>

        <para>When one looks at proposed section  17(2)  one sees that it is very much wider than the terms of the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. While I understand that the Australian Council of Local Government Associations has no quarrel whatsoever with the intentions set out in the Minister&#39;s speech, it is concerned that because of the wideness of the proposed sub-section there might at some future date be a misuse or an extension beyond the purpose for which the subsection is said to be necessary in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. I am assured that there are considerable difficulties in drafting a section which would limit the purpose to the words used in the Minister&#39;s speech. Clearly, what is intended is to provide for the manner in which a State can give to an area which has no elected local government authority the services which normally would be provided by a local government authority if one existed, and to provide no further. In other words, it is not intended that at some future date a State should be able to say that under this section it proposes to have its own electricity authority or its metropolitan boards of works or whatever it may be funded out of moneys which were intended to be made available to local government bodies. </para>
        <para>This is a matter where, had it been possible readily to amend the Act to make even clearer the Government&#39;s policy intention, I would have been suggesting strongly that that course be followed, but I am satisfied that there are difficulties in drafting such an amendment. I therefore seek from the Minister confirmation that my understanding is correct and that, should there be an attempt at some future date by some future government to make regulations- after all, it is that same regulation making power that is being given- which would enable a State to syphon off some of the funds for purposes other than the simple purpose of providing local government type services in an area where there is no local government authority, then other local government authorities will have available this debate to raise the question of whether any such regulation should be allowed through this chamber. I trust that the Minister will be able to clarify the matter and give that assurance. </para>

        <para class="block">Firstly, if any English grammar is still used in the country, will the Minister tell me what is the verb or the adjectival phrase which is qualified by the words in the last part of that proposed subsection &#39;or by way of expenditure &#39;? This is how I read it: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A reference to a grant of assistance is a reference to a grant of moneys to the State for the purpose of being applied by the State in payments to local government authorities situated in the State or by way of expenditure. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Does that mean that it can be applied by the State by way of expenditure? Which is the previous part of that proposed sub-section that is qualified by the phrase &#39;by way of expenditure&#39;? I suggest that those last 2 lines have been added as an afterthought. I am not surprised that their content gives concern to my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> The addition of those words &#39;or by way of expenditure for purposes declared by the regulations to be purposes to which this sub-section applies&#39; gives the regulation-making power to a person to expand purposes for local government purposes that are declared by the regulations. It is competent in the strict construction of this phrase to declare by regulations that an expenditure, for example, on a casino is for local government purposes for the purpose of this proposed sub-section. This appendage to proposed subsection (2) is strictly unnecessary if we take into account what is stated in clause 4 of the Bill. We have already conceded by passing that clause that, inasmuch as the regulations are there, they are sufficient to define those local government authorities that are included or excluded. For a body to be a local government authority for the purposes of the Act, it has to be a body which is in accordance with provision made by the regulations. Therefore, under sub-section (2) of proposed section 17 if the definition of local government authorities were contained in those regulations correctly, I should have thought that the Government would have all the power it wants when there is a reference to a grant of moneys to the State for the purpose of being applied by the State in payment to local authorities situated in that State. I suggest that for the proper purposes of this legislation we really do not need the awkwardly added words &#39;or by way of expenditure for purposes declared by the regulations to be purposes to which this subsection applies&#39;. In effect, that means payment for something that is not a payment to local government authorities as defined by the regulations previously set out. Therefore, I shall not pay to the draftsmanship of this clause the compliments which have occurred to me. I submit that it is a piece of awkward construction which makes for difficulties that never should occur to a person who writes English. </para>

          <para>- I also express concern at my inability to understand the clause. I note <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> opening remarks. He said that he would be very suspicious of this proposed new section had it not been introduced by the present Government. Apparently he has sufficient confidence in it and knows that the legislation will be administered properly. I should not have thought it was the job of the legislature to pass legislation to be administered by one particular government. If the wording of a clause is bad we should take steps to see it amended so that regardless of the government in power, the clause expresses its functions correctly and does what the Senate chamber, at the time of its passage, wanted it to do. The Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> may be able to enlighten me on a question I have. From my examination of the clauses of the Bill and of the Minister&#39;s second reading speech which expressed the Government&#39;s intention, I thought that it was for the State grants commissions to decide how the money is distributed when it is decided that a grant will be paid to a particular local government body. It is obviously for the Federal Grants Commission to inquire into what grant shall be made to each State. </para>

            <para>- No; one relates to the granting of assistance to the States and the other relates to the granting of assistance made to a State after a grant has been made. The matter is interpreted in proposed section 1 7 ( 1 ) (a) which deals with the reference of a grant of assistance to a State. It is not a grant of assistance made to a State when the State already has the money. Proposed section 17 (2) states that in the making of a grant of assistance to a State for local government purposes this shall be read as:  a reference to a grant of moneys to the State for the purpose of being applied by the State in payment to the local government authorities situated in the State, or by way of expenditure for purposes declared by the regulations to be purposes to which this sub-section applies. </para>

        <para class="block">I do not think that the words &#39;a grant of moneys to the State for the purpose of being applied by the State&#39; can be read as referring to grants that have been made to the State. As a recommendation, perhaps it gives a false interpretation or an artificial interpretation of proposed section 17(1) (a) concerning what the Grants Commission can inquire into. It is not clear what, under regulation, the Commission can inquire into or what the executive can declare, by regulation, the Commission can report upon. The Commission could report on the question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> raised. I visualise that under one regulation the Commission could report upon what percentage of the money should be made available by way of grant for local government and what percentage of the money should be used for meeting the administrative cost of the grant. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> raised another question. He asked whether this provision could include such things as casinos. He asked whether a regulation could provide that a grant should be given to a State for local government purposes for building casinos. I do not know. I suppose it is taking the matter to extremes, but the possibilities seem to be unlimited unless there is some restriction in the regulating power relating to the things that are necessary to be done for the administration of this Act. </para>

            <para>-This clause would be subject to the regulating power. That regulating power is provided in section 27 of the Act. This clause would be subject to the regulating power. The clause leaves the matter so wide that it is questionable whether the regulations could provide that the Commission could inquire into and report to the Minister on the question of how much he should give to a State and for what purpose he should provide the money. I suppose that ultimately, despite the Commission &#39;s recommendation, it is for the Government to decide what amount of money it gives and for what purpose it provides the money. </para>

          <para>- I mentioned during the course of my initial remarks on clause 8 that it appeared to me that the clause enables the Government, by way of regulation, to determine the purposes for which the relevant grants can be used. I suggested that this factor could be particularly dangerous as it appears to me- the Minister can correct me if I am wrong- that the Grants Commission could be used for purposes quite outside the intent of the Act, thus leaving Parliament with very little, if any, control over the purposes of the grants. I mentioned that during the course of my initial comments on clause 8. Obviously some ambiguity exists and the Minister can clear it up. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The other matter to which I wish briefly to allude is the political content of the Minister&#39;s previous statement in which he said that less than 1 per cent of total tax revenue was devoted by the Labor Government to local government purposes. All I need say to the Minister in that regard is that under our legislation the Grants Commission was charged with the responsibility of inquiring into and reporting to the Government and making recommendations to the Government on the needs of local government throughout the whole of Australia, on an untied and unconditional basis- ignoring, of course, the specific purpose grants and all the other forms of direct assistance that were involved- and the amount of money that should be made available by the Government for local government purposes. The amount of money that was determined by the Government was in fact the amount of money that was recommended by the Grants Commission; no more and no less. In the first year of operation- 1974- the amount, I think from recollection, was $56m, and in the last financial year it was $79m. That was the amount awarded by the Government on an untied and unconditional basis, after detailed investigation and inquiry by the Grants Commission. </para>
        <para>I emphasise- I am sure that there is no need to do so for the Minister, because of his knowledge of this subject- that every recommendation made by the Grants Commission to any government, irrespective of its political persuasion, over a period of 40 years has always been accepted by the particular government of the day. Therefore the amount of money which the Government awarded- whether it was 1 per cent or 2 per cent or 0.89 per cent or whatever it was- was the amount of money that had been recommended by the Grants Commission after making a detailed inquiry, and it totally ignored the other specific purpose amounts of money that had been detailed direct by the Government for local government purposes. </para>
        <para>I raised the question of certain happenings, such as a change in conditions, so far as a number of local government bodies in one State is concerned. Again I refer by way of example only to the floods in the north-western part of New South Wales which, as the Minister knows, caused a great deal of havoc in that area. Do I take it that a happening of that nature would be a matter relating to a grant of assistance made to a State, under section 96 of the Constitution, for local government purposes, and that such a matter would be referred to the Commission by the Minister under proposed new section 17(1) (b)? That was my understanding of what the Minister said. I emphasise that there is grave ambiguity in this clause. I ask the Minister to comment on those matters. </para>

          <para>- Firstly, let me say categorically to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that it is the intention of the Government, and of this Bill, that all the moneys shall go to local government and that there shall be no capacity in any way for a siphoning off for any indirect purposes. Should there appear to be a defect in the future, or should there be what might be regarded as some act not of good faith arising out of the discussions at the Premiers Conference, it is competent upon this Parliament to remedy that and to tighten up the situation. But the understanding of all the Premiers and of the present Federal Government is that this money shall go untied direct to local government, with the States being virtually the post offices that they have been in the past under the previous Grants Commission arrangements. I repeat: Should any disabilities in this matter emerge, it is competent upon this Parliament to remedy them. But at this moment we act in good faith. We have the clear statement of all 6 Premiers that they will set up Grants Commissions and that they will work upon an equalisation or topping up formular. Until we have cause otherwise to doubt we will proceed in that way. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It is true that the problem concerning clause 8 stems from a number of disabilities in terms of an understanding of what is a local government body. We had some difficulty with this matter previously. But I am instructed that sub-section (1) of proposed new section 17 provides for inquiry by the Commission into and report by the Commission upon grants made or to be made for local government purposes. Sub-section (2) of proposed new section 17 makes it clear that grants of assistance to States for local government purposes are of 2 kinds. The first kind of grant is a direct grant to a State for payment by the State to local government authorities in that State. This type of grant, which is the more typical kind, is directed at assisting local government authorities in the provision of services in the respective areas in which they operate. But there are some areas of particular States- I refer particularly to areas of South Australia which I mentioned before, although areas of some other States are involved as well- which are not serviced by a local government authority at all. It is the State itself which provides in these areas local government type services which would normally be provided by a local government authority. </para>
        <para>Consequently, sub-section (2) of proposed new section 17 makes clear that a second type of grant of assistance for local government purposes is envisaged. It is a grant to a State to assist it in the provision of services in an area of that State that would, had a local government authority serviced that particular area, have been provided by that authority. Thus, the intention of the Government is that the purposes declared by regulations made for the purposes of clause 17 (2) will be purposes related solely to the provision by a State of local government type services in those special areas of the State where no local government authority exists to provide such services. I hope that does clarify the situation. It is a difficult situation. It gave the parliamentary draftsmen, I know, considerable headaches in the actual drafting. I repeat, finally, that if in the journey there is a weakness, it is competent for this Parliament to amend that weakness most promptly. </para>

          <para>-I suggested that the Committee should consider these clauses together as they relate to inquiries by the Grants Commission and to certain aspects of the way in which the Commission shall take inquiries. These are really machinery clauses. But because the Government has decided not to allow the Grants Commission to continue to conduct earlier inquiries or inquiries which were referred to it on or after 1 October 1975 in relation to recommendations to be made to the Government under the existing Act for direct, unconditional and untied grants to be made available to local government, the Opposition feels that all of these clauses should be wrapped up together in the one consideration so that we may express our complete opposition to the whole of these provisions of the Bill. Therefore, the Opposition opposes clauses 9 to 12 inclusive of the Bill. </para>

The purpose of clause 14 is to amend section 26 of the principal Act in relation to savings by omitting the words of this Act&#39; on the second occasion where they occur in sub-sections (2), (3) and (4).

            <para>-The Maritime College Bill 1976 will not be opposed by the Opposition this evening, as this Bill is essentially the same as the Bill which was presented to the Parliament in October 1975 but which did not pass both Houses of the Parliament because of the events of 1 1 November. I do not intend to indulge in the orgy of political rhetoric that was evident in the debate in the House of Representatives in 1975. I think the circumstances of the day probably had a lot to do with that debate. I merely say that there could be very few institutions like the proposed maritime college in the founding of which so many people claim a part. In the debate in 1975 speeches made as far back as 1955 and 1965 were referred to, the speakers claiming that they had been the originators of this College. Dates were carefully cited to show who had first called for the College. Speeches were made, copied in great numbers and distributed in various parts of Australia, each proclaiming the important part that that  speaker  had had in the conception of the College. </para>

              <para>- A very big foundation stone, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine.</inline> I think it is reasonable to say that the decision to build the College and to site it in or near Launceston which some honourable senators may know is in northern Tasmania was contributed to by those who did a lot of leg work and who did not seek and therefore did not receive a lot of publicity. There were people on both sides of the Parliament who did that. They had as much to do with the siting and the building of the College as some of the people who received a lot of publicity about it. I believe there can be very few reports which have been presented to the Senate, certainly in the time that I have been here, which have been written in as simple and as clear a manner as the report by the Commission of Inquiry Into the Maritime Industry into the training requirements of seagoing personnel. The Commissioner was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summers. Mr Summers</inline> carried out his inquiry in a very businesslike and forthright manner. He correlated the facts and produced his conclusions with skill and clarity.

He set out quite clearly the need for the Maritime College to train officers and other men who will man our ships in the future. The Minister should be impressed by the Commissioner&#39;s words. On the first page of his report, without beating around the bush, when referring to the need of training requirements for seagoing personnel he stated: </para>

            <para>This is a matter on which urgent action is needed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The present situation is obviously unsatisfactory to say the least. It is a hangover from the days of sail and of press gangs. It is quite clear that the training of deck officers and men in our maritime industry is a mixture of the acquisition of experience and of passing examinations for certificates of competency. These examinations are concerned mainly with safety matters. The examinations for the certificates, in the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summers</inline> which are found on page 3 of the report, are:   not always up to date in their references to operational requirements on board. Nor do they thoroughly test an applicant&#39;s practical operation of modern equipment, such as radar, or of hyperbolic navigation systems such as Decca and Loran. </para>
          <para class="block">He adds later that one of the difficulties is that the attendance at training courses is not compulsory. People seem to have been acquiring knowledge and passing unsatisfactory examinations. The result is not always satisfactory people for our ships. I think of further and probably of more serious concern is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summers&#39;</inline> view: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Moreover, it is very doubtful that the present standard will continue to attract the type of men whose knowledge allows them to adjust without great effort to changes in types of shipping and cargo handling that are developing. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Obviously from these conclusions the implications for the future of our maritime industry, which is very important, are serious. It is disturbing to find that there is no introductory training, even in safety measures, for the majority of Australian mariners. It is also disturbing that there is no effective training for the crews of fishing vessels. Not all the States require any form of proof of competency for fishing boats and crews. It seems obvious to me that in the 1970s with increasing change and an increase in the sophistication of the various vessels and equipment, in the need for competency and the efficient turn around of vessels- in other words, for the effective commercial operation of vessels, including the effective transfer of cargo- the present system which seems to be a mixture of informal and incomplete training is not adequate for this country which should have a maritime industry <inline font-style="italic">par excellence</inline> to compete in the world trade. </para>
          <para>It is equally important that if we are to produce an efficient fishing industry capable of competing around our own shores with the Japanese, the Russians, the Taiwanese and others who fish here, we must produce the men with the knowledge and skill to efficiently man those modern vessels. This is not to denigrate those fishermen we have now or those mariners we have in our merchant marine. But times are changing. Ships are becoming more sophisticated, as I said earlier. The importance of commercial and competitive operation is obvious to anyone who has taken a close look at the industry as has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summers.</inline> I think the findings of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summers</inline> make it perfectly clear that it is quite wrong and inappropriate for people to blame the deficiencies of our shipping industry on various unions and union activity. Sometimes the unions are at fault but the tendency is to blame all our troubles in this area on them. </para>
          <para>It is ludicrous for a country of Australia&#39;s geographical position to find it necessary to import 50 per cent or more of its officers. It is not only ludicrous but also a sign of the inefficiency and insufficiency of our training. We are a developed country. We are considered to be developed. Really, we should be able to have training facilities which can be used to help mariners from less developed countries. But as it happens at the moment, and as is obvious from this report, in the training of seamen we are an undeveloped country. Of course there is no substitute for experience at sea for our seafarers. But I suggest that experience is more valuable when built on a sound theoretical and practical base which can be provided by a co-ordinated course such as we hope will be available at the Maritime College proposed by this Bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summers</inline> conclusion is summed up on paragraphs 75 and 76 of his report. He states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I believe strongly, however, that after so many years of Australia&#39;s fiddling with training for the maritime industry it is time for the Australian Government to take the stand that it wants a much better and much more effective system and provide funds for improving training and education. </para>
            <para>However, the cost of spreading the improvements around the States leads to the conclusion that it does not warrant more than one college. </para>
            <para>In reaching that conclusion, I recommend that the Australian Government should set up an &#39;Australian Maritime College&#39;. The College should be set up as part of an existing College of Advanced Education. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">After such a clear recommendation backed by solid evidence, no government- either the present Government or the previous Governmentcould ignore it. I commend this Government for pursuing, by introducing this Bill, the last Government&#39;s initiative. I welcome the siting of the college in Launceston, not for parochial reasons but because this is the best place for it. </para>

              <para>-We may need to put something in Old Sydney Town, I gather. As everyone knows, the area chosen in Launceston is near the sea. It is in the vicinity of Bass Strait which is an area subject to changes in weather, climatic changes and tidal changes. It presents navigational problems suitable in training. I gather that my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae,</inline> who has some intimate experience of this from his sailing activities will be able to elaborate on this point. I believe the presence of the usually navigable River Tamar adds to the attraction of the area although I do not know that the pollution of the River Tamar will make it a very popular place, particularly in the upper reaches. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I believe the site also fulfils <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summers&#39;</inline> other criteria in being close to a centre of population, close to an active port and close to fishing industries. The college of advanced education is already established. I hope that, with the implementation of the Karmel report on post secondary education in Tasmania, the site will become even more attractive and the acquisition of the maritime college will considerably upgrade the college of advanced education. I believe, that the proposed siting will also perform the function of establishing in Tasmania, especially at the college of advanced education, a national institution. We in Tasmania have at the moment no national institution, with the possible exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I hope that this institution will be a worthy one and will inevitably provide a base for the further development of the college of advanced education as an autonomous tertiary institution of which Australia and the northern part of Tasmania can be proud. I believe strongly that there is every reason why education, above all industries- if we can call it an industry- can be decentralised without great difficulty, certainly without much pollution, certainly without much of a transport problem being created and can, in some small way, help to remove the burden of population pressure from some of our bigger cities. It is obvious that some of the most prestigious educational institutions in the world are well away from the capital cities and away from the large areas of population. I hope this trend continues. I hope that the siting of this college in northern Tasmania and the application of the Karmel report on post secondary education will do this in Tasmania. I hope it will be an example of what can be done to the rest of Australia in this field. </para>
          <para>There was some difficulty in putting forward a case for northern Tasmania as the site of this college. Indeed, it was quite an interesting experience to be involved in this exercise, however peripherally. It was quite an interesting experience and, I believe, an education. There seemed to be a fair amount of bipartisan support, politically, but some of us- certainly myself, who at the time had not been in politics very long received an education in Establishment politics. I was amused all through the publicity battle over the siting of this college by how rough- I believe that is the best term- some of the gentlemen of the various educational establishments in this country can play the game. I was amused at statements made by academics. They were dressed up and aimed, I believe, at empire building and power gaining. Their statements were dressed up as rational and objective judgments. Any statements made in opposition to their proposals, particularly by politicians, were condemned as political game playing. I certainly learnt, I believe, that the exponents of political street fighting and in-fighting are not confined to parties, business or trade unions but are alive and well among some of our supposedly other worldy and objective, distinguished, dispassionate academic circles. </para>
          <para>I support the legislation, but I should like to hear from the Minister either in his reply to the second reading of the debate or in the Committee stage, just when the planning committee and the interim council will be announced. I should like him to give me some idea of the time scale of their operations. It would seem to me that a fair amount of the basic work- certainly the basic outline of the plan- has been done by the commissioner, and that a start could be made in the not too distant future not only for the sake of Launceston but also for the sake of the safety, efficiency and welfare of the Australian maritime industry and especially for the sake of those who sail the sea. I believe that in Tasmania above all, but in Australia generally, we need safe, efficient ships manned by well trained seamen on all decks and in all departments of the ship. Certainly we in Tasmania have no desire for any more <inline font-style="italic">Blythe Star, Straitsman</inline> or <inline font-style="italic">Lake Illawarra</inline> disasters. We certainly do not want to see any more of our fishermen lost at sea than can be avoided. </para>
          <para>I consider that our standing as a seafaring nation and our efficiency as a world trader and as a food gatherer are at stake in this issue, and I urge the Government to proceed with this plan as soon as possible. I urge it to make sure that all hurdles are removed so that this college can be established and that we can have an institution in the Launceston area of which we are proud and can have a maritime training institution in this country which, as is obvious from the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Summers,</inline> has been long needed. </para>

              <para>- Inborn, I am sorry. Tasmania has a proud maritime history. It probably has a higher percentage of its people associated with the sea than any other State has. It is, of course, the south island of Australia. As was once observed by one of the Ministers in this chamber, being an island it is surrounded by water. That is well known, but it does happen to be water which includes Bass Strait which carries the heaviest daily concentration of shipping of any seaway in Australia. It also does happen to have very good fishing grounds around its coastline. I believe that it is an ideal place, from an historical point of view, from a current usage point of view and from a facilities point of view for the establishment of this <inline font-style="italic">maritime</inline> college which, as has been mentioned, is something which has been talked about for a long time and which at last is to become a reality. It has been a gleam in the eye of many people for many years. I would just take the opportunity to congratulate anyone who has been associated with converting the gleam in the eye into the impending reality. The passage of this Bill will bring the reality so much closer. </para>

          <para>It is important that we get on with the job. The maritime college is of importance in that it will provide the services outlined both by the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> in his second reading speech and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> The college is of importance to the development of the area of Launceston as a centre of learning- that is, its association with the College of Advanced Education- and the opportunity that presents to the balanced development of educational opportunities for the State of Tasmania. One of the important aspects of this matter is that, irrespective of whether the full Karmel report in relation to the development of colleges of advanced education in Tasmania is implemented exactly as recommended, the establishment of this maritime college will assist in enabling the much earlier creation of a suitable college of advanced education or tertiary educational institution in the third region of Tasmania- the one which is not currently served, namely, the north west coast of Tasmania. I see the establishment of the college as an important part of the way in which the educational opportunities of all of the people of Tasmania can be enhanced, whilst at the same time the interests of the whole of Australia are being enhanced by the provision of the training opportunities which are to be made available by this maritime college. </para>
          <para>I look forward to the appointment of a planning committee to get on with the job and, as soon as possible, to the lie being given to those who, for their own publicity purposes, have been suggesting that in some way this project was not likely to go ahead. I know full well that the Minister has given assurances already on a number of occasions that the project is going ahead, that its completion is planned in the next 3 years from this year, and that there is no doubt at all that it is proceeding. The very fact that this Bill has been brought on for debate at this stage when there is a lot of urgent legislation to which priority could otherwise have been given; the fact that it was one of the very early Bills introduced after the change of government; the fact that it has been pushed forward to completion in this chamber, give the lie completely to those who suggested that this project would not be pursued as soon as possible. </para>
          <para>I simply summarise by saying that, although there are many aspects of training which I think it would be useful to debate, we are by means of this Bill setting up a situation in which a planning committee can prepare recommendations. I look forward to debating in more detail some of those aspects when the report is available. In the interests of ensuring that we get this matter under way as soon as possible, I am curtailing my remarks tonight. </para>

            <para>- in reply- I thank honourable senators on both sides of the chamber for their unanimous support for the Maritime College Bill 1976. 1 hold this as a very significant piece of legislation and a new and quite exciting venture in the educational field. I would like to stress 4 main points. There is in process at this moment well advanced discussions between my Department, the Department of Primary Industry and the Department of Transport to plan and to bring to the point of execution what was to have been a planning committee but which, with the passage of this legislation, will be an interim council. I hope at a very early date to be able to announce the establishment of an interim council which can then proceed rapidly towards the next step, namely the establishment of a permanent council. At that stage legislation Will be brought before this chamber for much more substantial debate. I hope also at a very early date to announce details of interim financing of the maritime college, because that in itself must be an earnest intent as a first step. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>However, there are a number of matters walking hand in hand. I refer, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has done, to the quite incorrect and untruthful propaganda that was spread in some sections of the Tasmanian media regarding this venture. As honourable senators would know, at this moment consideration is being given in Tasmania to the Karmel Committee report- the secondary committee report. That report having been tabled and provided to both this Parliament and the Tasmanian Parliament the initiative, of course, passed to the Premier of Tasmania to make the primary decisions as to its adoption or otherwise because, under the Constitution, tertiary, secondary and post-secondary institutions are matters for the Tasmanian Government. I acknowledge that the Premier very quickly indicated general approval for the report of the Karmel Committee. Following that approval it was necessary to do an amount of planning, and the Premier of Tasmania set up a committee under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Cosgrove,</inline> Q.C., and that committee is currently active. The Government and my Department will await with particular interest the report and recommendations of that committee and the subsequent recommendations of the Tasmanian Government. Of course, the Federal Government has a considerable interest- if not a constitutional one, then a very strong financial one- in the consequences of this matter. </para>
          <para>It must be understood that there arises also a profoundly important consequence of the Cosgrove Committees &#39;s deliberations in relation to this maritime college, because one of the recommendations of the Karmel Committee, as honourable senators will know, was that the Newnham campus of the Tasmanian College of Advanced Education be made an autonomous body called the Tasmanian Institute of Advanced Education. The nature and shape of that institute will have a very significant effect indeed upon the shape of the maritime college. I think all honourable senators who have referred to this matter have suggested that because of the likely proximity of the site of the maritime college to what is now the Newnham campus there would be an intermingling and sharing of functions between the 2 institutions. I hope that will be possible, but it should be understood that if this maritime college is to achieve a quality of excellence, which it must, then, of course, the Newnham campus and the college itself will have to provide between them quite a range of specialist and technical and scientific education. It is well to remind the Senate that some of the categories of people who will take courses in the college are, for instance, deck officers, engineer officers, radio officers of the larger merchant and fishing vessels, fleet managers, marine superintendents, marine surveyors, fishing technologists, fisheries officers, ratings, and fishing boat crews. </para>

I also acknowledge what a pleasant place the Tamar is both for happy existence and for this very purpose. I have read the categories to illustrate the enormous range of educational facilities that we must have from the senior tertiary functions to what might be termed the trade functions in some technical institutes. They are real matters to be considered and we will be looking at them as they come forward. As soon as I received the report of the Committee I wrote to each of the 3 commissions for which I am responsible, the Universities Commission, the Commission on Advanced Education and the Technical and Further Education Commissioninviting them to study the report and to be prepared to give recommendations. Those Commissions will have not only a funding function but also something of an advisory function in this matter. </para>

As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> quite rightly said, this was one of the earliest Bills which we got going. Inevitably we had to wait for the publication of the report but we then set in action immediately the study by our 3 commissions. I commend the Tasmanian Government&#39;s study on these matters. I am hopeful that we can announce soon some funding measures and also that we can announce very soon an interim council. In a climate where in every other respect the Government is being forced into severe economic measures, it is a measure of our sense of priority for the Maritime College and of the significance of Tasmania and its particular and unique capacities to cope with and establish this kind of institution that we have given it top priority. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- At the second reading stage I was a little at sea in that I did not put my name down on the speakers&#39; list. I want to ask a question in relation to clause 6 and the constitution of the interim council. I notice that there is nothing there to signify whether the interim council will be representative of any bodies, but undoubtedly the Government will consider organisations when deciding upon the members of the interim council. I am aware that some federal unions during the debate on where the college was to be established were not in favour of its being established in Launceston. Needless to say, the unions in Tasmania were very much in favour of it and supported those who were seeking to have it established in Launceston. However, by simply referring to just those categories mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> I can see some of the unions that will be involved. </para>

          <para>There is the Australian Institute of Marine and Power Engineers, Professional Radio Employees Institute of Australasia, Merchant Service Guild of Australia, Seamen&#39;s Guild of Australia, and if we are talking of fishing vessels there is the Australian Workers&#39; Union, Federated Shipwrights and Ship Constructors Association of Australia, and the Australian Shipping Officers Association. We can add to that list the marine cooks and marine stewards unions. They are some of the organisations that may be involved. I suggest that consideration be given to making contact with the Australian Council of Trade Unions and its State branch, the Tasmanian Trades and Labor Council, when the interim council and any of its committees are established. </para>

            <para>-As with the Maritime College Bill, the Opposition does not oppose the Bill now before the chamber. Why should we? They were originally Australian Labor Party legislation. In the case of the Roads Acts Amendment Bill there has been a distinct change in emphasis and one notes that the National Country Party of Australia, the minority group in the coalition not even necessary in the House of Representatives but highly necessary in the Senate to keep up the numbers has been able to persuade the majority party to change the emphasis in the Bill. The main purpose of this Bill is to provide an additional $64m in Australian Government financial assistance to the States for roads works in 1975-76. As I proceed I want to point out that although this Bill was first introduced into the House of Representatives in about October last year, because of the purposefulness of the then Opposition in holding up the Budget Bills, the program was never implemented. Now, many months later, the same amount of money has been allocated, in spite of the tremendous inflation that has continued totally uncontrolled under the present Administration. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of the additional $64m to be provided, $ 14.9m is to be allocated to national roads and the remaining $49. lm is to be made available for use in accordance with the Roads Grants Act. The emphasis on the allocation of this additional $64m differs remarkably from previous allocations and this was the point I endeavoured to make earlier. The Labor Party had a distinct national policy on transportation. We did not apply it only to roads but right across the board. We feel that this is a total nation and that everybody needs to be served. Because of the change in emphasis in this field we find that providing one is a member of the Country Party and lives at the end of some long bush track one can even have bitumen on one&#39;s property. Perhaps that is exaggerating a little, but I want to emphasise that point. The people who live in the country, who need to be part of the national road structure, who need to be able to transport themselves from one part of Australia to another, have been totally neglected by the new Government. </para>
          <para>Of the additional moneys, $23m was to be appropriated for national roads and of this sum $ 13.94m was for the construction of national highways, $7. 9m for the maintenance of national highways and $1.1 lm for the construction and maintenance of export roads and major commercial roads. An additional $41m was to be expended under the Roads Grants Act. This Bill proposes an allocation for the development of national roads of less than 65 percent- I emphasise that figure- of the amount proposed by Labor in late 1975. That Bill reached the second reading stage in the House of Representatives on 30 October last year. As 1 mentioned a moment ago, this Bill is indicative of the Liberal-National Country Party&#39;s obsession with keeping Australia from achieving a well planned, well coordinated national highway network. </para>
          <para>Prior to 1972 there was no national transport plan of any sort. In fact, when my colleague in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Charles</inline> Jones, made his trip from Cairns to Brisbane over the Bruce Highway and subsequently submitted a very detailed report on the shortcomings he found on that highway, he was the first Minister for Transport ever to travel over that 1000-mile stretch of road.  His  predecessors in Liberal Party governments used to buy road maps from the Shell service stations to find out where the Bruce Highway was. There is a famous cartoon to which I might make reference. It depicts my colleague in another place, unfortunately in the National Party, the Premier of Queensland. There are other words which I use to describe him sometimes but you might not find them fitting on this occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President.</inline> He was able to use his own aeroplane &#39;Air Force One&#39;, the Queensland air force, to fly from Townsville to Mount Isa. He would point out of the window at the people travelling below, who were sometimes bogged for three or four months at a time while carrying perishable goods, food that was needed by the people in Mount Isa and other places en route, and say: &#39;What the hell are they complaining about? I get to Mount Isa all right.&#39; Of course, he had his own plane, &#39;Air Force One&#39;. </para>
          <para>The road legislation enacted by the Whitlam Labor Government was the first such legislation it introduced, and obviously it will be the last until the next election in 1978 or perhaps, with the way things are going in the coalition at the moment, at a much earlier date. This Government is here for only a very short period. Perhaps then we will be able to return to a decent sort of national program instead of having the ad hoc policies that we see today. </para>

              <para>- That was a very interesting interjection. There is a senator on the Government side who fears the introduction of a national road program because obviously he has his own little cow cocky farm and he wants to use the taxpayers&#39; money to build his gate grid to get into his farm and then have a bitumen road to his mansion which he is able to build from his fertiliser subsidy. That is typical of people on the other side of the chamber who are unable to see beyond their own noses or next week &#39;s salary or next week &#39;s superphosphate bounty. </para>

          <para>For the first time the Federal Government was in a situation where it could ensure that roads were considered as part of a national transport network and not as a means of buying rural votes or pandering to the elitists of this country. That brings me back to the rather inane interjection of the honourable senator on the other side of the chamber, who probably would like to see roads as part of private enterprise. What a delightful situation that would be. It is no wonder we are having trouble with Tel com and other statutory organisations that have been built up over many years. Even some of the honourable senators predecessors were quite happy with them. This conservative Government has a new toy that it calls federalism- in other words, the new two-tax system. I wonder how soon it will be before the States are compelled to raise additional finance for their own roads, because that is part of the two-tax system. </para>

              <para>- If the new lady senator from Tasmania is willing to write out her question and send it across I will be delighted to answer it. This conservative Government&#39;s attitude is obvious not only from its new federalism policy and the double taxation system but also from its reduction of Labor&#39;s proposed commitment to national roads by approximately 35.12 per cent. That is what the Government has taken away from national roads in order to put down little by- tracks into some of the wealthy farmers&#39; properties. It is the Government parties&#39; own Prime Minister who wants the nearest airport to his homestead upgraded so that he can take the My ste re in and it is only because of a public uproar that to date that has not been done. But it will be done, mark my words. In the same way the Prime Minister will have bitumen roads on his own property. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There is to be a reduction in national road financing so that farmers can drive on bituminise roads in their own paddocks. I have no quarrel with that. The people who live in the country areas deserve the best of everything, but the available finance has to be shared by everybody. The people who live in Darwin ought to be able to travel south when they want to and not, as happened only a few weeks ago, have transport carrying essential foodstuffs bogged on the main road and unable to get through. The people of Darwin are screaming for some sort of all-weather north-south road, not the sort of road they have at the moment. But the Government has changed the emphasis by its reduction of more than 35 per cent. That is the way it is thinking because the Country Party tail of the coalition is wagging the Liberal Party dog. In addition to the reduction in national road financing, the present Government is hell-bent on undoing all the good work achieved by the Labor Party during its period in Government, and that was after a period of 23 of Liberal Government. Do not say that the Government is interested in country people. It is not interested in the real country people but only in the small segment of wealthy graziers and farmers who get $5,000, $15,000 or $20,000 from the superphosphate bounty, as my colleague from South Australia has been trying to tell Government senators in this chamber for the last three or four months. </para>
          <para>I refer to the lack of initiative and absence of a statement of policy by the conservative Government on the amalgamation of the Department of Shipping and Transport and the Department of Civil Aviation into the present Department of Transport. In addition, the present coalition conservative Government has given no indication of its intentions regarding future policies, nor has it outlined the probable size of impending grants for the 1 977-79 triennium, assuming that it is still here, of course. It should be remembered that the long delay in dealing with this Bill is a direct consequence of the politicking of honourable senators opposite and that under the Government&#39;s tight-fisted rule- I use those words advisedly- inflation has not abated. In fact, all the things that the Liberal and National Country Parties said in the period leading up to 13 December 1975 have not come to pass. Let us look at Medibank and the way the Government proposes to annihilate it by its projected legislation. Let us look at what the Government did to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Don</inline> Chipp when he said that a levy would be needed to pay for Medibank. He was sacked from the Ministry. I think he publicly used these famous words: &#39;I have been kicked in the guts&#39;. That is what the Government did with him. But at this late stage the Government is going to implement the very levy that honourable senators opposite blocked when the former Government tried to have it passed by this chamber. </para>

              <para>-The Minister may need the services of Medibank in its present form at some future date. The lady senator who was going to send me a question has now left the Senate chamber perhaps to write it out. The Government &#39;s present action is most inconsistent with the statements of the present Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> when he was in Opposition. At that dme, he was most critical of the then Government&#39;s policy. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record shows this. The then Opposition shadow Minister for Transport- the present Minister- had all sorts of things to say about Labor&#39;s policy in relation to the then Roads Grants Bill, the equivalent of the very Bill that is passing through the Senate tonight. Whilst I said at the outset that we are not opposing the Bill, I take the opportunity to criticise the change in emphasis and the manner in which the Government has looked after its friends, the elitists in this country, at the expense of the great majority of the people of Australia. </para>

              <para>- 1 would not ask the honourable senator to withdraw the remark. That is about the only word he has in his vocabulary. The present Minister for Transport and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> have indicated to the State Premiers that they would like the States to postpone claims for $20m of the proposed $64m under the scheme until next financial year. This is a very pious sort of request to make. The Government is asking the States too st pone expenditure and is even asking for the 20m. I say this because this Government has not been able to check the present uncontrolled rate of inflation. It is worse now than it has been for the last 5 years. When this $20m is finally provided to the States, it will have shrunk in value to such an extent that it will probably look more like a $10 note. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There are a few other points I want to emphasise. With the agreement of the Senate, I will shortly have a rather detailed table of figures incorporated in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record. However, I will refer to that in a few moments. One estimate for the year 1976-77 indicates that the probable escalation grant required for this period will be of the order of $235m. I know that the Minister for Education a little while ago objected to my using the example of Medibank. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> you were quite correct when you said that I was making a passing reference to that matter. It was merely an illustration. Road transport costs generally will escalate in exactly the same way as Medibank costs have escalated and will cause the Government the same trouble. When the Bill dealing with Medibank comes before the Senate, we will have a few scandals to bring forward in relation to that scheme. Again, they will be scandals involving friends of the Government- not patients- and the rake-off group of doctors. </para>
          <para>The Budget forecasts by Ministers in the Liberal-National Country Party Government indicate that it is highly unlikely that the States will receive the required escalation grant. This was a strong point of Labor Party policy over the 3 years when we had the administration of this country. In each year, we allowed for the inflationary trends, lt did not matter whether it was in relation to road transport or any other part of the administration of this country. At least we provided in advance to cover likely inflationary rises as they came to pass. However, it is quite obvious that this Government has not even considered inflation, let alone made provision for it. If we consider the sharp cuts in Government spending and the effect that this has in particular on the private sector and the employment levels for road maintenance and construction, it is impossible to reconcile the result with the Government&#39;s policies of low employment and inducement to the private sector. But over the years- to be precise, over the long period of 23 years prior to the end of 1972 and for the 6 months from 13 December 1975 until today, 19 May 1976- we have come to expect ill-considered, ill-planned policies from a Government that is no more than a coalition of distorted ideas and non-policies. </para>
          <para>For a truly national approach to road planning in the country, Federal Government policies, State priorities and national interests must be taken into consideration. It is obvious that this Bill represents the first step by this Government to abandon its responsibilities for road planning and programming. As I said a few moments ago, we now have a nice new name for this. It is known as the new federalism- the 2-tax policy. The Minister has been at great pains to indicate to us that the Government will not require the States to seek Federal approval for the construction of urban arterial roads and freeways that are financed wholly by State funds. If that principle were applied to my State, the only areas that would be financed wholly from State funds as opposed to Federal funds, would be areas south of the Kingaroy line. This is because neither the Premier of Queensland, the Prime Minister nor anyone else in either the State coalition government or the Federal coalition Government is aware of any country that exists north of the Kingaroy line. This is one more nail in the coffin of well-planned, co-ordinated transport networks in this country. </para>
          <para>It is an established fact that inner city freeways do not solve the problems of our cities. The construction of freeways was long looked upon as a possible way to overcome our transport bottlenecks. However, experience and practice have indicated that it is not the remedy. This Government appears to be unimpressed with the problems of urban areas and seems pleased to allow further poorly guided State management of the transport networks. The Government should have learned a lesson when Labor was elected as the State Government in New South Wales recently. The Liberal and National Country Parties lost that election basically because of 3 policies: Their neglect of farming areas, their neglect of the transport system and their institution of the 2-tax system- the new federalism. </para>

              <para>-Of course, they lost also because of their neglect of the pensioners. The Government tried to take away the funeral allowance. As my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, points out the pensioners were the first people to be attacked by this Government. It delayed the payment of pensions in order to save a miserly few million dollars at the expense of the lives of pensioners. The position of pensioners has now dropped by a considerable degree below what it was under the Labor Government. I forecast that there will be further cuts in the immediate future, particularly during the Budget session. As my colleague has pointed out, in addition to the 3 policies that I raised, there is the other great mass of people of concern to all of us but whom the Government has decided to ignore in the hope that they will die or fade away. </para>

          <para>It is no coincidence that the federal transport portfolio is in the hands of the National Country Party. In the coalition Government in Queensland, the National Country Party has been struggling for years to get the Treasury portfolio. It wants to do exactly what it is doing in the Federal sphere, namely, to look after that small group of elitists in the community who contribute most to National Country Party funds. If things keep on the way they are going and the way the National Country Party would wish, I could well believe the old proverb that Australia rides on the sheep&#39;s back. That will be very true because so far as transport is concerned, there will be nothing else for us to ride on. The Minister&#39;s past record indicates his blatant bias at the expense of urban regions, despite the fact that 78 per cent of this country&#39;s population is urbanised. A breakdown of the distribution of funds being provided presents damning evidence of the bias that I have referred to during my contribution to the debate. </para>

I do not mean the ordinary farmer in the bush. I do not mean the ordinary country dweller. I do not mean the people living in the little towns of this country. They are the people whom the Government neglects. It looks after only a selected handful of people. I remember that in days gone by- before 2 December 1972- it was not unusual for tens of thousands of dollars to be spent on putting a telephone line into one farmer&#39;s property. But in the other direction maybe half a dozen small farmers would be told that they could not have the facility unless they were prepared to pay through the neck for it- to pay large sums of money. </para>

              <para>- That is exactly what the Government did. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline> is probably one of the landed gentry on whom several thousand dollars was spent in putting a telephone line into his property. There is no need for him to start crying now because he has already skimmed off the cream. Of the total of $49.1 m committed to the Roads Grants Act- an increase of $ 8.1m on Labor&#39;s proposal- $28.8m or 58.65 per cent of the total will be set aside for rural contingencies, whilst only $ 19.85m or 40.4 per cent of the total is allocated for urban transport networks. This can only be considered to be criminal when one realises that more than 78 per cent- I emphasise that figure, and it does not include the elitist landed gentry- of Australia&#39;s population live in urban areas. Statistically, therefore, this Government is saying that rural people are worth over 9 times more than the people living in urban areas. This reminds me of the gerrymanders that are carried out in two or three States of this nation. That is the way in which the governments in those States value people too. There seems to be a familiar ring about this. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I now turn to the proposed State breakdown of the $64m grant. The total increase in actual funds for each State for both Acts is as follows: New South Wales $ 19.9m; Victoria $ 13.3m; Queensland $13.2m; South Australia $5.8m; Western Australia $8.8m; Tasmania $3m. It is rather amazing that those amounts are in total agreement with those formulated by my colleague in another place, Charlie Jones, the former Minister for Transport. Perhaps the Liberal-Country Party Government has finally decided that its paranoid hatred of anything formulated by Labor is wrong. In fact, this may be the first step towards the re-education, to which I have referred in this chamber many times, of my conservative colleagues. This is apparent not only in relation to the 2 Bills that we will pass tonight because they are both Labor Bills. Judging from Press reports today, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has backed down to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> over compulsory union ballots, or at least has gone a long way down the ladder. There will come a time when public opinion, I hope, and the good sense of honourable senators opposite will force them to accept the sorts of policies that were acceptable to the people of this country for 3 years prior to 1 1 November 1975. Inflation is one of the great problems facing this country. </para>

              <para>- It was brought here in the first place in 1972 when $ 120m was injected into the economy by a panic-stricken Prime Minister and a panic-stricken government. They were the ones who set inflation in train at that time. Some honourable senators on the Government side have not been in the Liberal Party long enough to know that there was a Liberal Government at that time. Some of them in the National Country Party would not know. Nevertheless, if they look back in history they will find that that was the first injection of money into the economy of this country. Taxpayers funds were used to try to save the Government of that time but it failed because the then Prime Minister led the Coalition into the jungle, and the main reason he did that was that he forgot to wear his spectacles. But imitation is the sincerest form of flattery and, as I have stated constantly in the past and as 1 propose to continue to state in the future, I am always an optimist. I always hope that some day honourable senators opposite will see the light at the end of the tunnel and come out of it. Finally, after making that small contribution to the debate, I indicate that the Opposition does not oppose the Bill. </para>

          <para>I present Appropriation Bill (No. 4) 1975-76, in which appropriations, additional to those made by Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1975-76, totalling $161,771,000 are sought for capital works and services, payments to or for the States and other services not being ordinary annual services of the Government. As I will explain in relation to Appropriation Bill (No. 3) 1975-76, these appropriations are required to enable payments to be made, the need for which has arisen since the Budget was prepared, but for which the appropriations then provided were insufficient or for which no provision was made in Appropriation Act (No. 2) 1975-76. </para>
          <para>I now refer to some of the major items for which provision is made in this Bill. An amount of $ 17.5m is sought for the National Capital Development Commission to meet unavoidable expenditure on rise and fall obligations under current contracts for rises and adjustments which have occurred since 1 April 1975. An amount of $ 12.5m is also sought for the Darwin Reconstruction Commission to cover the cost of rise and fall provisions of contracts and for the renegotiation of contracts cancelled following the cyclone. An amount of $25m is for expected payments to the States for expenditure on agreed measures of relief and restoration following bushfires, floods and storms in New South Wales, floods in Queensland and Victoria and a cyclone in Western Australia. The amounts of $8. 870m sought under Division 915 and $40.770m under Division 9 1 7 are for capital and recurrent grants for childhood and associated services which would have been met from an appropriation for the Children &#39;s Commission if the Act establishing the Commission had been proclaimed. The amounts are fully offset by savings under that appropriation. The amount of $6.3m is for payments to Tasmania relating to the Tasman bridge project and $6. 7m is required for payment to South Australia under the Adelaide-Crystal Brook Railway Agreement. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to amend the Customs Act 1901-1975 by replacing the existing provisions relating to the valuation of imported goods for the purposes of calculating ad valorem duties with a new system of valuation based on the internationally recognized Brussels Definition of Value. The existing provisions require that valuation be based, at the f.o.b. level, on the higher of the actual price paid by the importer or the current domestic value of the goods in the country of export. These provisions which have given rise to increasing administrative and legal problems in recent years were the subject of two cases before the High Court in 1974 and 1975. The decision in both cases substantially eroded the effectiveness of the existing system. </para>
          <para>An interdepartmental committee established to review Australia&#39;s customs valuation system prepared a Green Paper in 1975 which canvassed the possibility of adopting the Brussels Definition of Value. The paper was generally well received by industry and commerce and the committee recommended that the Customs Act be amended to provide for the valuation of goods in accordance with the Brussels Definition. The Brussels Definition was developed by the Customs Co-operation Council- an international customs consultative body- and forms the basis for the valuation systems of over ninety countries throughout the world including most of Australia&#39;s major trading partners. The Definition is set out in annexes to the Convention on the Valuation of Goods for Customs Purposes. These annexes are reproduced in the Schedule to the Bill. </para>
          <para>The central feature of the Definition is the notional concept that the value for duty of any imported goods is the amount which those goods would fetch on the open market between a buyer and a seller independent of each other. It is a concept for general use irrespective of the terms under which the goods are imported. When the goods imported are the subject of a genuine open market sale the invoice price will generally be regarded as a valid indication of the value for duty. </para>
          <para>The substantive clauses of the Bill cover the usual machinery matters and repeal those provisions in the Customs Act relating to the existing system of valuation. In addition sub-clause 4(3) provides for a number of modifications to the Schedule which adapt the Definition to Australian conditions. The most important of these are to be fond in paragraphs (d),  (0  and (h). Paragraph (d) modifies the definition in the Schedule to provide that imported goods be valued on an f.o.b. basis. The wording of the modification is taken from a protocol to the Convention which is awaiting ratification at the Customs Co-operation Council in Brussels. Paragraph (f) provides that outside packages, with certain specified exclusions, will form part of the dutiable value of the goods which they contain. This is a change to existing valuation practice recommended by the interdepartmental committee which considered that such a change would considerably simplify customs entry procedures and be more in keeping with commercial practice. Paragraph (h) maintains a concession extended to Canada in the Canada-Australia Trade Agreement of 1960. This concession allows valuation of Canadian exports as if they had been exported from the port of exit in Canada nearest to their place of origin. </para>
          <para>The Green Paper to which I referred above considered the tariff implications of a change to the Brussels Definition of Value. Available statistical information did not permit exact calculations but the committee was able to conclude that any difference in total Customs duty payable following the implementation of the Definition was likely to be negligible. However the committee recognised that in particular cases there could be significant variations in amounts of duty payable leading to adverse effects on local industries or importers. The Government has decided that where such significant variations do occur with adverse effects to local industry or importers provision will be made for the Industries Assistance Commission to consider possible tariff adjustments for a period of 6 months after the implementation on 1 July this year. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the Bill is to correct what are essentially technical deficiencies in the Foreign Takeovers Act 1975 and to remove the interlocking provisions between the foreign takeovers legislation and the Trade Practices Act which, in the past, have been thought to give preferential treatment to foreign corporations in their merger applications to the Trade Practices Commission, An outline of the legislation proposals was given by me to the Senate on 1 April 1976 in a statement on foreign investment policy. Briefly, this Bill, which does not materially alter the substance of the Act, is designed to overcome the technical deficiencies in the following manner: Firstly, the wording in the present Act may restrict, relative to the now repealed Companies (Foreign Takeovers) Act, the range of control situations caught by the Act. Clause 5 of the Bill closes this possible loophole. Secondly, the Act does not exempt share or asset acquisitions consequent upon proposals which were approved by the Government prior to the commencement of the Act but which had not been effected by that date. Clearly, once approval has been given by the Government, it should not be necessary for the parties to notify the proposal again. Clause 6 of the Bill exempts such proposals from the ambit of the Act. </para>
          <para>Thirdly, persons who are required to compulsorily notify a proposal under section 26 of the present Act cannot implement their proposals until the expiration of the 40 days period laid down in that section. This applies even when, within the 40 days, the persons concerned have been advised that the Government has no objections to their proposal. This situation was never intended and clause 7 of the Bill will correct the anomaly. Fourthly, the effect of the present section 26 is such that parties cannot engage in any negotiations, with a view to acquiring or increasing a substantial shareholding in an Australian corporation, without leaving themselves open to the possibility of committing an offence against the Act unless they first notify the Treasurer and wait the prescribed 40 days. This requirement inhibits normal commercial behaviour. It was not intended that the Foreign Takeovers Act should create such difficulties. Clause 7 of the Bill is designed to rectify the situation. </para>
          <para>Finally, the wording of the present section 38 of the Act is such as to raise doubts whether transactions, made in contravention of section 26 would be valid at law. It was not intended that such transactions should be invalid and the Government regards invalidity as an unnecssary harsh penalty. The Act contains adequate penalties for non-compliance and clause 10 of the Bill will remove invalidity from the sanctions of the Act. As these amendments are of a technical nature and as persons may already, unwittingly, be in breach of the Act, we intend that the Bill should correct the identified anomalies in the Foreign Takeovers Act retrospectively to 1 January 1976, the date on which the Act commenced. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the second matter with which this Bill is concerned, that is, the relationship between the Trade Practices Act and the foreign takeovers legislation. We have for some time been concerned that the foreign takeovers legislation may have provided foreign-owned companies with an advantage over Australian-owned companies in respect of merger applications before the Trade Practices Commission. On behalf of the then Opposition the Treasurer expressed concern about this matter during his remarks on the Foreign Takeovers Bill on 20 August last year and the need for legislation in this area was foreshadowed in the foreign investment policy issued by the Coalition Parties in October 1975. </para>
          <para>On 4 May, the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs introduced into the Senate the Trade Practices Amendment Bill which provided, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> for the discontinuation of the special treatment under the Trade Practices Act that may be said to have produced this advantage. Clauses 3 and 9 of this Bill complement that legislation. Their combined effect will be to remove the interrelationship between the Foreign Takeovers Act and the Trade Practices Act so that foreign owned companies will no longer be able to obtain automatic approval for the Trade Practices Commission for merger proposals consequent upon approval under the foreign takeovers legislation. All companies- both foreign and domestic- will, from now on, be treated in the same manner under the merger provisions of the Trade Practices Act. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">The object of this Bill is to obtain the approval of Parliament for ratification by Australia of the United Nations Convention on Psychotropic Substances and to make legislative provision to give effect to control in terms of the Convention over consignments of certain psychotropic substances which enter Australian ports or airports in the course of consignment from a country outside Australia to another country outside Australia. &#39;Psychotropic substances&#39; is a term used to refer to substances that have the capacity to produce a state of dependence and central nervous system stimulation or depression resulting in hallucinations or disturbances in motor functions, thinking, behaviour, perception or mood and, in respect of which, there is evidence of a likelihood of abuse so as to constitute a public health and social problem. The aim of the Convention on Psychotropic Substances is to bring about international control of those drugs of dependence which fall into the category of psychotropic substances in a similar way to the international control now operating in respect of narcotic drugs in accordance with the provisions of the Single Convention on Narcotic Drugs 1 96 1 , to which Australia is a party. </para>
          <para>Like the Convention on Narcotic Drugs, the Psychotropic Convention provides a comprehensive code for international control which limits the manufacture, movement and use of the drugs concerned to medical or scientific purposes and imposes an obligation on parties to combat the illicit traffic, punish offenders and make provision for the medical treatment, care and rehabilitation of drug dependent persons. Drugs covered by the Convention are graded according to abuse potential and controls range from a virtual embargo on substances such as LSD and mescaline to less strict requirements applicable to minor barbiturates, tranquillisers and stimulants. </para>

Provision is made for regulations to: (a) exempt from the control preparations containing a psychotropic substance (other than a Schedule I substance) compounded in such a way that risk of abuse or of recovery of the substance in a quantity liable to abuse is negligible; and (b) add substances to, or delete substances from, a Schedule or to transfer a substance from one Schedule to another in pursuance of advices received from the Secretary-General of the United Nations or the Commission on Narcotic Drugs of the Economic and Social Council of the United Nations, as the case may be.

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>so that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and others may go home on time at 1 1 p.m., I utilise this procedure of speaking on the first reading of this Bill to raise 2 matters. Normally I would have dealt with them in the course of the adjournment debate. The first matter concerns overtures that I have had from the Australian Conservation Foundation. These followed my action in raising with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> a question concerning the Concorde. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> is an extremely busy Minister at the moment as he is handling additional portfolios. I simply wish to put on the record the grave fears of the Australian Conservation Foundation that there has been a tendency in recent times for Service aircraft to fly at excessively high altitudes to condition people to sonic booms so that, whatever happens with regard to the Concorde, the argument may be put that people as a whole are not making many complaints about sonic booms. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This is one of those matters which confronts the Government at present with a very difficult decision. The Australian Conservation Foundation is of the opinion that, wittingly or unwittingly, the Royal Australian Air Force has become a party to certain experiments of this nature. I am sure that when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> reads the report of my speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> tomorrow morning he will take appropriate action to inquire into this question. </para>
          <para>The second matter that I raise concerns the separation of the former Department of Labor and Immigration under the Labor Government into two separate departments. I know that the viewpoint of the Government is the separation of the 2 elements of the former department into 2 portfolios will result in a speedier servicing of specific questions and grievances. One matter which is causing some concern in the Sydney ethnic community, I feel, is the apparent lack of universal procedures in respect of people seeking tourist visas to come to Australia. On the one hand it is the accepted practice in central Europe and eastern Europe for the applicant to visit the Australian Embassy for an interview. I do not cavil at that, nor do the various ethnic clubs that have raised the matter with me. On the other side of the coin, apparently people from other continents have come here on a tourist visa. They were not interviewed. </para>
          <para>I instanced the case some months ago of the 2 Thai bar girls who were arrested in Sydney for soliciting. They were part of a prostitution ring. I have been waiting since 1 7 February for a very simple answer to a question. In the changeover of ministerial functions, the Department of Foreign Affairs became responsible for passport control and the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has the function of interviewing tourists. What I am putting is not a hypothetical case. In essence what I am putting is this: If a Yugoslav who wishes to visit Australia has to journey over 500 kilometres to front up to the Australian Embassy in Belgrade, how were these 2 bar girls able to bypass our Embassy in Thailand, come here and become part of a vice ring? I know that vice or virtue is not the prerogative of anybody, whether it be a Liberal or Labor senator. </para>
          <para>I want to take the matter a little further. I am perturbed that this evil first surfaced on 17 February. I am referring to the discrimination in relation to the way in which visas are issued. 1 simply say this: It should not take that long to obtain an answer. I can imagine that a please explain went to our Embassy in Bangkok, to find out how these 2 brown eyed women were apparently able to charm people. I wish <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> was present. We know that a Slovenian girl was given the reverse treatment. She had to wait for hours at the embassy in Belgrade. In the latter case I was told: &#39;We expect to see everybody. It was just unfortunate. If she had said she wanted to be interviewed at 10 a.m., arrangements could have been made&#39;. The original objection remains- the lack of uniformity in relation to the way we interview various applicants for tourist visas. In case I sound as if I am making an unfair judgment in the case to which I have made passing reference about the bar girls, I point out that a Sydney magistrate agreed with my evaluation. So I am on sound ground as to the lack of uniformity. I believe that the people who brought in the innovation of severing the Department of Immigration from the Department of Labor felt that we would get quicker service. Frankly we are not. The feedback which we are getting is not good enough. I do not make carping criticism. This applies to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr MacKellar).</inline> It applies equally to the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock).</inline> I know he has an assistant, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> I raised this matter on 17 February. I do not mind whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> comes up with an answer or, conversely, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> who represents <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Michael</inline> MacKellar, does. I think the Senate will appreciate that there is a feeling of discrimination. There may not be discrimination, but I think we are entitled to answers. </para>
          <para>I believe the Foreign Affairs Ministry could move a little faster. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> a question yesterday. As I usually do, I gave advance notice of what was in my mind. I simply wanted a concise statement on the sum total of Australian aid in relation to the recent earthquakes in Italy and Yugoslavia. I was not talking about migrant intake. I was disappointed today when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> did not come up with an answer. Therefore I leave it to the Senate and to the appropriate Ministers to see that the matters which are recorded tonight are duly answered, I hope tomorrow. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir MAGNUS</inline>CORMACK (Victoria) (10.55)- I am breaking a record tonight because it is the first time I have spoken on the first reading of a money Bill. I feel I can follow no finer senator than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> in trying to save the time of the Senate by speaking on the first reading of a money Bill rather than on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate. I hope that this reform which has now overtaken <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> will continue. However, I am concerned at the problems that are presented when senators properly seek information from a Minister representing a Minister in another place. The Minister in this place who is asked a question has to rely on information from the office of the Minister who is embedded in the </para>
          <para class="block">House of Representatives. I have been very concerned about matters concerning the Department of Health. That portfolio is held by a Minister in the other place. There are 2 things that irritate me about Departments of Health, wherever they are. Firstly, there are the medical administrators in the Departments of Health. They are bad enough. They are generally failed doctors. They know nothing about administration. The second thing is the laymen who become sort of pox doctors clerks. They think they are experts on medical matters. </para>
          <para>My complaint is directed fairly and squarely at the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> who is in another place. It relates to the system pertaining to vaccines and preventative medicines, particularly the vaccine for the influenza virus mutation now present in Australia. There is a vast shortage of this serum in every State. I am aware of that shortage because a month ago I went through the system to find out where all the serum is. This afternoon I made a spot check in Canberra because I thought that was a reasonable place to make a spot check. This is the most favoured place among the bureaucracy. If there is anything going around the place, one should find it in Canberra first up. </para>

              <para>-I have some stories I could tell about that, but this is not the occasion. From the information which I obtained from various advisers to the Minister for Health in another place, the problem of the lack of vaccines is a problem of distribution. The problem comes up, very interestingly enough, in the case of Canberra. Canberra has a warehouse which indents upon the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories Commission&#39;s laboratory in Sydney which, I assume, indents upon the Commission&#39;s laboratory in Melbourne. There is at present a deficiency of 6000 vaccine serums in Canberra. Today the Canberra warehouse was promised 6000 serums from Sydney. None arrived. No explanation has been given by the Minister for Health for the administrative and scientific botch-up in the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories. I have heard honourable senators opposite praise the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories and say that it should be the nationalised system from which any preventive medicine should be obtained. Since February this year the Commonwealth Serum Laboratories has failed abysmally to provide the serums required. </para>

              <para>-I must say, with all due humility, if it were not for the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> produces eggs we would get no vaccines. So there is some justification for his interest. I consider that when a senator asks for information from a Minister who is embedded in another place, the very least that that Minister can do is produce factual information. If I do not get factual information tomorrow I shall take those steps which are open to a senator to obtain information and get an explanation from the Minister for Health as to why his administration has failed so abysmally in the production of serum for the people of Australia. </para>

            <para>- I simply take this opportunity to refer to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack with regard to the supply of the vaccine which he mentioned. The matters which have been raised by him are of concern to us all. I have some information from the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> which I feel it would be appropriate to give at this stage. It is a brief report. I should like to have this information placed on record at the same time as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Magnus Cormack &#39;s comments. The Commonwealth Serum Laboratory supplies the vaccine to each State in response to orders which are placed by wholesalers in each State. These orders are made in response to orders made by chemists on wholesalers. Administration and supply of the vaccine to individuals must be by prescription supplied by a medical practitioner. The decision to administer the vaccine to any individual or group therefore rests ultimately with the medical practitioners. There is no power under any Act by which government is able to determine a medical practitioner&#39;s decision in any case. </para>
          <para>Following the advice of the National and Medical Research Council, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Advisory Committee recommended that the pharmaceutical benefits would be paid only for restricted groups of people, namely, children under 5 years of age, pensioners, and people with chronic respiratory or cardiac disease. This means that people in the categories mentioned above are able to obtain the prescribed vaccines at a cost of $2. People who require the vaccine and who are not in the categories mentioned above pay considerably more for the prescription. </para>
          <para>There is no real evidence from the last winter in the Northern Hemisphere that this strain of virus is any worse than most other strains. However, the demand for the vaccine in this country is unprecedented. At 12 May 1976 1 129 000 doses of the vaccine had been distributed by CSL. This is considerably in excess of the total amount prescribed for influenza during the winter of 1975. I will refer the other matters which have been mentioned by the honourable senator to the Minister for Health. If there is further information available I shall see that it is given to the honourable senator. </para>

              <para>Official post offices have been closed on Saturday mornings since February 1974 as a result of direct action by certain staff organisations which instructed their members not to attend for duty on Saturdays. Negotiations with staff organisations to re-open those post offices which previously opened on Saturday mornings were not successful. Against the background of community practice in other areas, detailed studies, involving the staff organisations, were conducted. The studies showed that it was not practicable to provide Saturday morning counter services at official post offices on a five day week basis under any acceptable rostering arrangement whereby the Saturday duty could bc regarded as normal duty with time off in lieu during the week. </para>

              <para>1 ) The directive referred to was a circular letter from the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and was sent to all commercial broadcasting and television stations on 18 December 1975-one week after the Federal Election of 13 December 1975. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The letter did not refer to political material but rather to the respective responsibilities of news editors and management. The circular letter referred to the Board&#39;s inquiry into the coverage by commercial television stations of the Report of the Joint Committee on Prices entitled &#39;Prices of Household Soaps and Detergents &#39; and other matters. </para>
          <para>In particular, it arose from paragraph 27 of the Board&#39;s report and recommendation to the Minister, arising out of the inquiry referred to above. The paragraph in question reads: &#39;The Board has noted the evidence given on behalf of several licensees that news personnel have been clearly instructed that news decisions are to be based on editorial judgment alone, subject to managerial direction only on question of defamation or breaches of the Board &#39;s standards as to taste. It was however obvious at the inquiry that this instruction was not known to all members of staff- even to all members of the news staff. The Board would propose to request licensees to reduce the instruction to writing and convey it to all staff members. It is not thought necessary to make this a substantive condition of the licence, but rather a requirement that should be policed by the Board from time to time in its general inspections of stations. </para>
