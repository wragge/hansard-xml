          <para>Your Petitioners most humbly pray that the Senate, in Parliament assembled, will accordingly take all appropriate steps to publicly declare immediately possible that the calendar year of 1977 shall be treated as &#39;International Captive Nations Year&#39;, in keeping with the world-wide movement amongst free nations everywhere. </para>

In this area you are really in a situation of international law, which is properly the province of the Attorney-General. The benefits that would flow out of international agreements in these areas are things like repatriation of capital in difficulty, royalty payment exchanges, facilitation of trade, payments of debts incurred between one country&#39;s traders and another country&#39;s traders. It is the same general broad Trade and financial pattern internationally as you would get within a nation. It certainly would be an advance in world trade and understanding.

There was evidence of children playing in areas of low radioactivity but they would need to play there for more than 1000 hours in one year to exceed the prescribed limit. One small spot in the area showed the highest level of radioactivity and there are plans by the Mines Department to bury the piles of rubbish there at present. </para>

The matter now seems to be one of engineering concern in determining the methods of cover, but the Atomic Energy Commission has agreed to act in the capacity of consultant to the South Australian Government. We shall keep the Senate informed of further developments in this matter as the Minister for Health receives information. I shall refer the matter of compensation to the Minister for Health or to the appropriate Minister to ascertain whether there is any comment to be made on that. </para>

Even though I do not read even <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I recall this matter being raised. No doubt it was whilst you were abroad on parliamentary business. So the Government is well aware of this purchase because one of your colleagues raised it some time back. Whether the painting is bigger or smaller than <inline font-style="italic">Blue Poles</inline> is not, I think, of great relevance because as I understand things in the art world one does not buy paintings for so much a square inch or a square metre. That was the sort of inference in the last question-that our painting was X metres by Y metres and that this painting was only a quarter of that size and therefore we could arrive at some value for it. But I have never known works of art to be sold by the square foot or the square metre - </para>

            <para>- There has been a great deal of misunderstanding on this case. Natural misunderstanding arose because people looked at a line entry in the Budget and thought they saw that an expenditure of some $20m last year on migrant education had been reduced to $ 10m this year. So a great deal of criticism was engendered which was entirely wrongly based on the thesis that the allocation for migrant education had been cut in half. In fact what had happened was that in the interim essential funding of child migrant education had been passed to the Schools Commission. There is of course an entry of some $20m to $21m, from memory, with regard to the Schools Commission program. The overall situation is that migrant education, rather than suffering is in fact being sustained- and being sustained at very real levels. It is improving in its general content as compared with past years. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security and refers to the decision earlier in the year by the Government not to pay unemployment benefit to school leavers over the long vacation. Is it a fact that 1 S November has been set as the cut-off point beyond which school leavers will not receive unemployment benefit except in exceptional circumstances? Will this not penalise those students who stay on to complete their final year properly? Also, has this policy been extended to university graduates, meaning that university graduates will be unable to receive unemployment benefit until February in the same way as school leavers? Was this decision ever announced by the Government? </para>

            <para>- There was an announcement earlier this year with regard to unemployment benefits for school leavers. Statements were made by the Government that people leaving school generally will not be paid unemployment benefit until the commencement of the new school year. This will be applied having regard to the commencement date of government schools in each State and Territory. Exceptions will be made to meet cases of genuine hardship. With regard to university graduates, a university graduate may apply for unemployment benefit as soon as he leaves the university. Payment will commence from the seventh day after the date of lodgment of his claim. This has been the position in past years and there is no proposal to vary it. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>With regard to university undergraduates, that is, those who are proceeding to a further year&#39;s study, their position is covered by a legal opinion to the effect that undergraduates are not unemployed during the long vacation. For some years now they have not been paid unemployment benefit during that vacation. If a university student who has not completed his course states that he does not intend to resume his studies, it has been the practice not to pay unemployment benefit until his intentions are clear. In other words, he is still regarded as a full time student until such time as enrolment for next year has closed and he has not re-enrolled. This practice will continue but the question more directly referred to graduates. I am able to state that university graduates will receive the unemployment benefit from the seventh day after the date of lodgment of their claims. </para>

Will those people who leave school before 15 November be eligible for the unemployment benefit? Will those who leave after 15 November not be eligible for the unemployment benefit? </para>

              <para>- I think a statement was made earlier with regard to the application of the date of the commencement of the unemployment benefit. I will check that but it is my understanding that those who leave within a month of the end of the school year will be treated differently from those who leave earlier than that. I will clarify that matter for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. My question refers to vocational officers and assistant vocational officers concerned with finding employment for Aboriginals- these officers are employed by the Commonwealth Employment Service in Western Australia- and to the vehicles provided for their use. I ask the Minister: Are further such officers to be appointed to reduce the excessive level of unemployment amongst Aboriginals in Western Australia? I remind the Minister that the present Government reduced the availability of vehicles to such officers when it took office although restrictions were lifted in May. What vehicles were made available to such officers in December 1975? What vehicles are now available? Are there any restrictions applying to their use which were not applicable in December 1975? </para>

            <para>- There are 9 vocational officer and 4 assistant vocational officer positions currently manned in Western Australia. There are 2 vocational officers and 2 assistant vocational officers based at Perth; 2 vocational officers at Kalgoorlie; Geraldton and Northam each have one vocational officer and one assistant vocational officer; Bunbury, Port Hedland and Albany each have one vocational officer. At both Perth and Kalgoorlie 2 vehicles are allocated full time to the Aboriginal Employment Section and at each of the other centres one vehicle is allocated full time, making 9 vehicles in all. Each vehicle has an allocation of 400 kilometres a week averaged over the year, except at Port Hedland where the allocation is 700 kilometres. In December 1975 the Aboriginal Employment Section had 1 1 vehicles with an allocation averaging 500 kilometres. I feel a bit of sympathy for the Department of Defence which is still using miles. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The reduction in allocation has been justified in terms of a rationalisation of visit programs. In centres where assistant vocational officers are stationed vehicles are shared and this takes account of the fact that each officer spends some of his time working in the Commonwealth Employment Service office to which he is attached. There is also the fact that visits to some of the more distant areas can be more effectively and economically performed by using local air services. If the implication in the honourable senator&#39;s question is that vocational officers may not be provided with the travel resources necessary to perform their work, the Minister would like to assure him that his department constantly is monitoring the needs for these resources and is able to make adjustments as necessary. There are 4 vacant positions in the Aboriginal Employment Section in Western Australia. These are now in the process of being filled in line with the Government&#39;s policy of progressively extending the facilities for employment assistance to Aboriginals. When these positions are manned the necessary additional travel resources will be made available. </para>

There may be variations between the document tabled and the book produced because of certain revisions. That is all. Also, computerised typesetting can have an effect on the subsequent presentation of the draft material. But the fundamentals remain. There is every right here and at Westminster for variations to be made. </para>

              <para>-I understand that on Monday the foundations of the main water tank subsided and that the system is now unusable and for the moment this has resulted in the toilets and showers being inoperative. However, I understand that there is an adequate supply of drinking water. The South Australian Engineering and Water Supply Department is taking emergency action to remedy the situation and a health surveyor from the South Australian Department of Public Health is going to the mission today to keep a close check on the health aspect. At present there is no danger to the health of residents of the mission and none is expected. The honourable senator may also be interested in knowing that the Commonwealth Department of Aboriginal Affairs has provided approximately $300,000 for the construction of a water reticulation system at this mission. The construction is scheduled to commence in 2 weeks time and is expected to be completed in four to five months. As far as the dangers from outbreaks of gastro-enteritis are concerned, I understand that whatever precautions have been able to be taken have had attention and the early construction of the new system, we believe, will overcome the difficulties that may have arisen. </para>

            <para>-The question that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> poses is significant. If the matters as stated are correct, there would be a profound potential for alteration of the ecological balance within the Reef area itself. Personally, I am not aware of the extent to which foreign fishing vessels, including Taiwanese vessels, are poaching in the Reef area. I should imagine that the question concerns a number of departments, including the Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development. Because the question is important I will direct it to my colleague the Minister and to any other Minister concerning the poaching aspects and seek a reply. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Treasurer whether it is a fact that new capital spending in the private sector is slower in 1976 than it was in 1975. Does this lag indicate that the investment led recovery claimed by the Government early this year has not materialised and that the Government has now revised its economic strategy to suggest that an investment recovery will not come until the end of 1977? In the circumstances, has the Government considered abolishing the 40 per cent investment allowance and the double depreciation concession for the purposes of reducing the deficit which, as was said yesterday, at present exceeds the deficit as at this time last year? Has a recognition of the failure of this part of the Government&#39;s economic policy led to the credit squeeze announced on Sunday by the Treasurer? </para>

            <para>-I will start from the bottom in this rather tangled web. There is no credit squeeze. There is a sensible monitoring of the money supply. If honourable senators opposite had done this when in government, the disaster that the present Government inherited might have been avoided. A lot of things the honourable senator has said are the sons of things which are said by people who try to run economies on a daily temperature taking basis and so get into trouble. One needs to use a bit more sense and restraint and to look at events on a longer time span. The honourable senator&#39;s question will go on notice. </para>

In view of the facts as enunciated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> showing that the economy has not responded to that investment allowance program, is the Government intending to persist with its assumption that by the continuation of this investment allowance program there will be a response from the business community before demand picks up? </para>

            <para>- I am always as careful as I can be to get accurate information in response to what appear to be sensible queries. Equally, I resist comments which I think are false. If one compares the national account figures at the end of June this year with the figures for the previous June, which I suggest is worth doing, one will see the long term recovery trend clearly established. One will see the investment patterns being established. A large number of surveys come out all the time. I can refer to a number of them. There is the Associated Chambers of Manufactures of Australia-Bank of New South Wales survey; there is the Chamber of Commerce IncorporatedNational Bank of Australasia Ltd survey; there are the surveys that come out from the group headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Ironmonger.</inline> Various people are commenting, for hire, in the market place. When one goes through all those surveys some clear things are established. The profitability trend is up; the activity trend is up; the consumer demand is moving but not at the rate one would like immediately, though the trend line is showing itself about where it ought to be. The economic growth projections of the Budget appear to be working out at this time, based on the June figure. That is about as precise as I can be. I have always been very concerned about Australia trying to run its economy on daily temperature taking. I suggest to anybody involved in this business that constant changes of policy and constant changes of Treasurer do not add to business confidence. </para>

            <para>- Following cyclone Tracy many donations were made to provide relief for the stricken people of Darwin. Of the funds provided, $8,156,353 was received by the Darwin Cyclone Tracy Relief Trust and disbursed by it. The trust fund was established in early 1975. In accordance with the trust deed, regular monthly reports and financial statements have been tabled in the Parliament. I recently tabled reports for the months from February to June 1976. That trust account is now being wound up, the accounts will be subject to audit, and the final report will be tabled in this Parliament. Other amounts were paid by groups to other groups in Darwin which may or may not total the $7m referred to by the honourable senator. These did not go through the trust, and the accountability of these must lie outside the trust and with those parties who handled the moneys. It is known, for instance, that the Herald and Weekly Times Ltd gave about Sim to the Salvation Army. The Red Cross Society received a very large amount. Other bodies, such as Rotary, Lions International and the Returned Services League, all dealt with money through their own organisations. I believe that the final report of the Trust will be quite a valuable document and one of importance. It may be a valuable guide to any future situation arising from such a natural disaster as occurred in Darwin. The Senate will be aware of the first report of the Trust, which indicated a need at the time for all moneys to be accounted for through one trust. This is perhaps one of the lessons which we have learned. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Darwin cyclone was a massive disaster which required a tremendous relief operation. I believe that no one should be condemned for mistakes made with good intent and with good purpose, because the whole of the Australian community rallied to the assistance of Darwin. It is quite easy to be wise after the event, but we have learned that certain things that happened should not be allowed to occur in the future. I am not aware whether the $7m mentioned has been accounted for. It may have gone through an accounting process. If it has not gone through an accounting process, we should not assume that somebody misappropriated it or absconded with it simply because it would have been money outside the Trust and handled in good faith by organisations such as those I have mentioned. </para>

              <para>-Senator Harradine says he made a report, but I have heard a lot about these reports. He most probably made an assertion or allegation. That is somewhat different from adducing evidence. As I have said in this place many times, it is a favourite habit of people around here to get hold of a newspaper assertion or allegation and treat it as a matter of fact. If <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Guy</inline> Powles has information including names of people and so on, I would hope that he would supply it to his own country for passing on to us, because we have a joint interest in this matter. I do not know to whom I should refer the last part of the question about the Pravda correspondent. I doubt whether the Department of Foreign Affairs would be able to provide the answer, but I will ask my ministerial colleagues to see whether I can obtain further information on that matter forth? honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. I preface it by saying that I am well aware of the Minister&#39;s own interest in running regularly each morning and no doubt the Minister is aware of my similar interest. I hope that he does not feel that I have a vested interest in asking this question. Is the Minister aware that athletes were training on the Hobart athletic track in March 1976 but that the track, to which the Commonwealth contributed about $150,000, has not yet been opened for regular use? Is the Minister aware that the track was to have been opened on 30 October last and is he able to say when it will be opened? Is it true that the real reason for the present delay in opening the track is that certain officials of the Hobart City Council are adopting a &#39;go slow&#39; tactic so that they can have a special opening just prior to the Australian championships in March 1977, which will be a full 15 months after the track was due to be completed? Is the Minister also aware that there has been an orchestrated attempt to stop people asking legitimate questions about the progress of the centre and that one Hobart City Council official when questioned said: &#39;You have waited 10 years. Another 6 months will not matter&#39;? Does the Minister agree with that type of attitude? </para>

            <para>- I have to confess to a modest 20-minute jog of a morning, much to the distraction of the local canines I am bound to say. Amongst my papers here I have some information concerning the Domain athletic track in Hob an. As I understand it, the Commonwealth Government made 3 grants towards its construction, the first in 1973-74 of $60,000, the second in 1974-75 of $175,000 and the third in 1975-76 of $105,000, making a total of $340,000. Contributions by the State Government and by the Hobart City Council were to make up the full cost. The Hobart City Council has requested further assistance to help bridge the gap between Commonwealth funds to date and funds apparently available from the City Council, the State Government and Tasmanian Amateur Athletic Association sources. The City Council has indicated several times during the 3-year period the difficulties it has perceived likely to be engendered by escalating costs. I am not aware of the internal politics that the honourable senator has sketched. I think it would be a great pity if the opening of the track were delayed by internal politics. I will direct the honourable senator&#39;s comments to my colleague in another place and ask him to investigate the matter. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications, refers to a statement made by the Minister in the chamber yesterday regarding the restructuring of public broadcasting. There were many alarming and contradictory intentions revealed in that statement, but there is one particularly confusing aspect on which I seek clarification, that is, the intention to legislate for 2 women commissioners on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I ask the Minister: What precisely does the Government intend to achieve by such a provision? Does the Minister agree that the present provision for one woman on the Commission is outdated and discriminatory and does not reflect current attitudes to women in positions of influence? Does the Minister agree that to provide for only 2 women on the Commission would be just as discriminatory in that it would suggest that without such a provision, ungenerous as it is, no women at all would be appointed? Would not such a provision be treated as an upper limit and thus prevent more than 2 able women being appointed to the Commission; or is the provision merely a strategy to enable the Government to sack the staff representative, Marius Webb, and replace him with a partisan female appointment, while making a transparently token gesture towards equality of the sexes? </para>

            <para>-The Government&#39;s attitude is quite clearly that there should be equality of opportunity for women in all aspects of society, and it will direct itself to that end. The Government intends to introduce legislation in the very near future- certainly in this session which will indicate its intentions in these matters. I suggest to the honourable senator that she bides her time and waits for the legislation. During the course of the debate on that legislation she will find the basis of the Government&#39;s policy. Let me make it perfectly clear that the Labor Party has a long history of seeking intrigues in every kind of policy matter. It is now trying to seek intrigues in this matter. This matter is one of genuine reform. </para>

            <para>- I am unable to say whether twenty times as much is being spent in Australia at the present time on research into nuclear energy than is being spent on solar energy. The honourable senator asks about the development of solar energy. I have responded in the Senate previously that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, being the major research institute in Australia, is involved in this field. I refer the honourable senator to a submission made by the CSIRO to the Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources which contains a great deal of information relating to the work that the CSIRO is doing in this field. It should not be taken that the $800,000 which the Solar Energy Studies Unit of the CSIRO in Melbourne is expending this year on solar research is the total amount being expended in Australia. Indeed, under the Australian research grants scheme, which is administered by the Department of Science, grants of some $150,000 were made last year to individuals for the purpose of solar energy studies. </para>

          <para>At the present time the CSIRO is concentrating its resources on the types of research which may produce benefit for domestic water heating, industrial water heating, space heating and cooling, power production and heat storage distillation, controlled environment horticulture heat storage and the production of energy from crops, forests and other organic materials, which is of particular importance in Australia at the present time. If there is any other information that I can bring to the honourable senator and he places a question on notice, I shall secure it for him. </para>

All other States have signed the agreement with the Federal Government and as soon as Victoria signs the agreement the funds can be made available to that State. I am unaware of the detail or of the areas subject to dispute between the Victorian Government and the Federal Government but I shall check with the Minister for Health and ensure that the honourable senator is given the answer. </para>

            <para>-I should like to reply to a question asked yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> about the River Murray Commission&#39;s annual report. I have information on a piece of paper in front of me, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> and I hope it makes sense to you because it does not altogether make sense to me. It says: &#39;River Murray Commission, 300 copies&#39;. I do not know whether 300 copies of the report I tabled were printed or whether the River Murray Commission received 300 copies. I think, in fact, there were 300 copies of the one tabled. Of those, 28 deposit copies were put in public libraries and university libraries. There were 60 copies put in the bookshops for sale. The parliamentary paper version will be ready in about three to four weeks and provision is being made in it for 7 1 8 free issues and another 100 copies for sale through the bookshops. As a matter of interest, so far only one copy of the report has been sold and that was in the Albury-Wodonga area. I hope that answers most of the honourable senator&#39;s question. </para>

I offered to clarify the position for him. I would like to add to the answer that I gave earlier that where a student ceases school within 28 days before the end of the school year the view is taken that he should continue to be treated as a student for unemployment benefit purposes. Thus he is not placed in a better position than a student who continues at school until the end of the school term. Where a student claims that he terminated his studies more than 28 days prior to the end of the school year and that he intends to join the work force, it is necessary to look at the circumstances of the individual case to establish whether he has ceased to have been a student. </para>

            <para>-This report deals with 32 proposals to vary the plan of layout of the city of Canberra. It is the sixty-second such series of proposals to be referred to the Committee by the Minister for the Capital Territory. The Committee has been asked to deal with a large number of proposed variations during this current period of sittings. For instance, we reported to the Parliament on the sixtieth and sixty-first series only on 5 October last. We were requested to deal as quickly as possible with the present series to enable construction work to proceed on some of the items early in the new year. This has meant that we have not been able to give the detailed consideration to some of these proposals that their importance seems to warrant. In particular, we were asked to approve a number of variations that would have the effect of converting sites previously designated for development for medium density housing to permit development of those areas by the construction of standard detached housing. The Committee takes the view that it should obtain more information from the National Capital Development Commission on the Commission&#39;s long-term policies for medium density housing in Canberra before it signifies approval to 3 proposals presented in the current series. The proposals in question involve a change in land use from medium to low density in areas close to shopping centres in Wanniassa in Tuggeranong, the Kippax Centre in Holt and at Latham in Belconnen. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Committee has adopted a similar approach to a proposal put forward in this series for a new road to link the Campbell Park office complex with the Russell offices. The Committee is not satisfied that the new road is necessary or that the new office blocks could not be served by modifications to existing roads. In our report we request that implementation of these 4 proposals not proceed until we have examined them further and reported on them to the Parliament again. We would expect to do this early in the autumn sittings of 1977. We have requested that the Minister postpone the action he would normally take on receiving our report, which is to table the instrument of variations in both the Houses of Parliament, until the Committee has had the opportunity to give further consideration to these particular matters. </para>
          <para>I should also mention two other proposals of importance contained in the series now before the Senate. We were asked to approve a proposal for an access road off Canberra Avenue to serve a site for a tannery and other as yet undetermined industrial uses in the Jerrabomberra district. This is near the existing abattoirs. In the long-term it is proposed to site other works in this area- of about 9 hectares- which like the tannery have the potential to cause some environmental problems. The Committee was satisfied that the selected site is sufficiently distant from land-users likely to be affected by the tannery. We were assured by officers of the Department of the Capital Territory that in the construction and operation of any plant to be developed in the area, laws for environmental protection would be rigidly enforced. We expressed some concern that the Clean Air Ordinance is still only in draft form and has not yet become law. We recommend in our report that development of the tannery not be approved until the ordinance has come into force. Other proposals contained in the current series which will be of interest to senators are those that will permit the development of the Belconnen Town Centre- in particular the proposed major shopping mall and the commencement of work to improve substantially parts of the Monaro Highway. </para>
          <para>Finally, I should add something about the procedures we adopt when considering variations. When notice is given by the Minister for the Capital Territory of his intention to vary the gazetted plan, members of the public have 12 days in which to lodge objections to any proposal. It has been our custom when examining the proposals to call before the Committee those persons who have made formal objections. By this means the Committee can inform itself on community attitudes to proposals. On this occasion we facilitated an exchange of views between objectors and officers of the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Capital Territory. This seemed to us preferable to the procedure adopted in the past of discussing the objections separately with the official witnesses and the objectors themselves. We will adopt this practice in future whenever the importance of a particular matter would appear to warrant such a procedure. We have also asked the Minister to consider a new procedure that would ensure that, in future, consideration of variations by the Committee can be regularised so that they would come before us twice a year- once in the autumn sittings and once in the Budget session. This would obviate some of the problems which have occasionally arisen in the past with the Committee being asked to hurry its consideration of variations to meet planned development schedules. I commend the report to the Senate. </para>

Kim Beazley, MP, who is  Deputy Chairman  of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee. The principle of the statements was agreed to by the Committee. The statement is as follows: On 2 November the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> presented a petition to the House of Representatives on behalf of a number of Australian citizens concerning alleged harassment of Jews residing in the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and of Jews who seek to emigrate to Israel.

      <para>I now inform the Senate that the Committee has considered this request and agreed under section la of its terms of reference to undertake an inquiry into the subject. Owing to commitments on current inquiries the Committee cannot undertake this investigation immediately but anticipates that it will be able to do so early in the coming year.

A joint press statement was issued by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Maori</inline> and the Acting Minister for Overseas Trade following signature of the Agreement on 6 November. The Agreement will come into force when notes are exchanged between the Government of Australia and the Government of Papua New Guinea notifying compliance with their respective legal requirements. Trade between Papua New Guinea and Australia has always been an important feature of the special relationship which exists between the 2 countries. Since 1926 Australia has accorded special duty free entry to Papua New Guinea products. In 1950 Australia obtained waivers from the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to accord extensive duty free treatment to Papua New Guinea primary and processed primary products. At the present time 95 per cent of Australian imports from Papua New Guinea enter free of duty. </para>
          <para>Papua New Guinea is an important market for Australian exports. In 1975-76 Australian producers exported approximately $170m worth of goods to Papua New Guinea. This represented 49 per cent of Papua New Guinea&#39;s total imports. Papua New Guinea is Australia&#39;s eleventh largest market for all exports and the third largest market for manufactured goods. Until the Agreement just signed comes into force trade relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea will continue to be governed by the Memorandum of Understanding relating to interim trade and commercial arrangements. The Memorandum, which was signed in December 1973, was intended to cover trade relations between Australia and Papua New Guinea in the period between self-government and independence. It was extended in April 1975 to cover the period between independence and the conclusion of a more permanent trade and commercial relations agreement between the 2 countries. </para>
          <para class="block">Objectives of the Agreement </para>
          <para>Most of the trade between Papua New Guinea and Australia has traditionally been free of duties and other restrictions. It was therefore appropriate that both countries should enter into a free trade agreement. The Agreement was drawn up on the basis of the following 3 aims: To continue and extend the duty free and concessional conditions of access for Papua New Guinea exports into Australia; to allow the Papua New Guinea Government to develop new industries and to protect them from import competition; and to enable the Papua New Guinea Government to pursue its social and economic objectives through the encouragement of capital inflow consistent with its investment guidelines. It was recognised by both countries that Australia, in entering into this Agreement, should retain the right to protect its industries where it is considered that they are threatened with serious injury by imports from Papua New Guinea. It was also recognised that the Agreement should accord with Australia&#39;s GATT and other international obligations. </para>
          <para>Consistent with the aims outlined above the objectives of the Agreement are: To further the development of the area through the expansion and diversification of trade; to further the development and use of the resources of the area in accordance with the respective social and economic objectives of the member states; to further the development of the area by the promotion of direct investment which is consistent with the foreign investment policies and priorities of the recipient member states; to promote and facilitate commercial, industrial, administrative and technical co-operation between member states; and to contribute to the harmonious development and expansion of world trade and to the progressive removal of barriers to it. Accordingly the Agreement provides that a free trade area is established consisting of Papua New Guinea and Australia and that subject to certain exceptions specified in the Agreement trade between the member states should be free of duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce. </para>
		  <para>Safeguards for Australian Industry</para>
        <para>At present Papua New Guinea&#39;s exports to Australia consist mainly of foodstuffs and raw materials. However, Papua New Guinea has indicated its intention to establish new industries. Australia can assist in this development by allowing the products of Papua New Guinea industries to enter Australia duty free provided adequate safeguards are available to protect Australian industry. The Agreement, therefore, provides that Australia accord duty free entry to imports from Papua New Guinea on all but some 270 highly sensitive items. In addition there are 210 items, which are specified in the agreed minutes attached to the Agreement, and in respect of which Australia may take unilateral protective action if damage is caused or threatened to an Australian industry producing those goods. In those items where duties on a wide range of industrial and other products have been eliminated for Papua New Guinea, safeguards to protect Australian industry are included in the Agreement where serious injury is caused or threatened. There are also special provisions covering rules of origin, deflection of trade, dumping or subsidised trade and the suspension of obligations in exceptional or emergency circumstances. </para>
        <para class="block">The Australian Position under the Agreement </para>
        <para>Whilst the Agreement meets the requirements of the free trade provisions of the GATT it is not the intention of the Australian Government to ask the Papua New Guinea Government to discriminate in favour of Australia as against third countries. Australia will receive no better access than any other country. The Agreement provides no special conditions in relation to Australian investment in Papua New Guinea. In this respect the Agreement is similar to the Lome Convention under which the European Economic Community grants non-reciprocal tariff preferences to a large number of developing countries and to which Papua New Guinea has received approval from the Council of the Economic Community for accession. At the same time Australia&#39;s most favoured nation position in Papua New Guinea is protected under the Agreement by the provision pursuant to which each Government agrees to accord the other treatment no less favourable than that accorded to any third country. </para>
        <para class="block">Trade with Third Countries </para>
        <para>Any diversification of trade affecting third country suppliers to the Australian market will be gradual and will take place over a long period of time. Papua New Guinea is not expected to move in the foreseeable future to develop industries other than those based on its traditional exports. With regard to developing countries, nothing in the Agreement precludes Australia from continuing the liberal access it has already granted developing countries through its generalised scheme of preferences, or from making a positive contribution to the development of international trade through the GATT. </para>
		<para>Other Matters</para>
        <para>Other matters covered by the Agreement include, inter alia: </para>
        <para>Consultation on the contribution of direct Australian investment to the social and economic development of Papua New Guinea in accordance with that Government&#39;s foreign investment policies and priorities; </para>
        <para>Industrial, technical and administrative cooperation; the promotion of trade; consultations on the supply of scarce essential commodities; the encouragement and facilitation of commercial contracts; the association of other States with the Agreement; and the periodic consultation and review of the operation of the Agreement. </para>
        <para class="block">The Acting Minister for Overseas Trade has arranged for copies of the Agreement to be placed in the Library for the reference of honourable senators. He intends to table the Agreement in the House in the near future and he understands that legislation will be introduced in the House as soon as possible to amend the Customs Act, the Customs Tariff Act and the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act. Once this legislation is passed through both Houses the Australian Government will be in a position to exchange notes and thereby to bring the Agreement into force. </para>

              <para>- This general matter was referred to in detail in an urgency motion debated in this chamber yesterday, after I gave notice of motion at the commencement of proceedings yesterday. As is well known and as was explained yesterday, there is a social and economic crisis in the Queenstown area on the west coast of Tasmania, arising out of the operations of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd and its proposal to retrench some 400 of its employees. Many suggestions have been made as to the causes and the possible solutions. The facts appear to be somewhat confused. There has been considerable politicking in relation to it. I believe that an all-Party Senate select committee will provide an opportunity for all those involved to state their views and to state their case, which will enable the Committee to find the facts and to assess the prospects of measures which may alleviate the social and economic dislocation of the area. The establishment of this committee will enable the interests of the people in the area to be protected, free from the political football aspects which appear to have been developing in relation to the matter. I am delighted that this motion will be supported by all honourable senators. </para>

              <para>-I am glad to hear the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> because it is important that this committee take a completely apolitical and objective approach to its findings on this matter. I know from past experience with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> on Senate committees that that has always been his approach. I am sure that that is the feeling of the Senate as a whole. The last thing we would wish to see would be any select committee demeaned by an individual Party approach which might in some way cloud the objective judgment of the committee in the report that would eventually be brought back to the Senate. Paragraph (8) refers to the committee meeting during the sittings of the Senate. I place on record that the Opposition has some reservations about that. We are not opposing it on this occasion because of the urgency of the matter raised. We make it clear that we would not regard this as a precedent, nor do we believe that it is a good practice that committees meet at the same time as the Senate is meeting. On this occasion we believe it is warranted in view of the nature of the inquiry. </para>

              <para>- In view of the fact that both sides of the Parliament will come together in a decision to set up a select committee to inquire into all facts, questions and matters related to the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd, and in the light of the human question involved- that is, the tragedy to so many people in the mining area of the west coast of Tasmania I put the suggestion, in which there may be some merit and for which I hope there may be some acceptance, that in view of the fact that the committee will go into action immediately, that the company, for the time being, not persist with the issue of the dismissal notices for these 400 people. I presume that the committee will go into action immediately. We will expedite the work of the committee to the maximum degree. I make a plea in the Senate that the company not proceed with the issue of the dismissal notices. That would allow us to examine the matter without any question in the back of our minds that immediately, and even before the committee goes into action, 400 workers, their families and other sections of the community will be affected. In other words, much of the work and value of this committee, I think, would be destroyed if the company were to proceed with its announced intention to dismiss 40 per cent of its work force. I put that suggestion. I hope somebody might pick it up and give it further consideration in view of the fact that we are approaching Christmas time, the time of the year when people tend to have a greater regard for human relationships and human feelings. Perhaps we can inject that thought into the whole question. Maybe we can prevent this disaster from taking place. The committee, in the light of a cool, clear, deliberate examination of all the questions, could make a proper judgment of the situation and a report to the Parliament which would adequately cover the situation. </para>

I referred to the notice of motion which was moved yesterday by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae.</inline> I asked what was the use of establishing a Senate committee when probably the earliest that it would report back would be in 6 months. I did not know at that time that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> intended to move a further motion which would contain a requirement that the committee report back by 9 December. I support the formation of the committee. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> statement that it should be free from politicking. I notice that an Independent is to be appointed. I certainly will be nominating. </para>

          <para>-  When the Committee adjourned last night I had raised a matter about a question which I put to the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> on 24 August this year and an earlier question about general relationships and communications between his Department and the Natural Disasters Organisation. The question arose from a report in a newspaper on 23 August. It referred to the second earthquake tremor in Darwin. My question was: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The article stated that the Bureau of Mineral Resources in Canberra did not learn about the tremor until yesterday because its telegraphic equipment connecting Darwin with the Bureau in Canberra had not operated since the Darwin cyclone. Is the Minister able to bring us up to date on these matters? Will he look again to ascertain whether the Natural Disasters Organisation has the best equipment possible to enable it to perform its national duties? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The Minister promised to give the information. He later said it was a matter for another Minister. He referred it to another Minister. On 19 October he sent me a letter which seems to prove that the Press report was correct. If it was correct and that situation still applies, something should be done about it urgently. The letter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> wrote to me is as follows: </para>

          <para>You will recall your question without notice on 24 August, and my answers both then and on15 September, relating to the Natural Disasters Organisation. Copies are attached. </para>
          <para>Subsequently you asked me to seek a reply from the Bureau of Mineral Resources to that pan of your question dealing with channels of communication between Darwin and theBMR. </para>
          <para>I am now able to advise that the seismographic recorders at the Bureau&#39;s Darwin office had to be removed after Cyclone Tracy damaged the office. They were re sited at Manton Dam, some miles from Darwin. </para>
          <para>Previously, the reading equipment only was sited at the dam, and readings were telemeter by telephone line to Darwin and recorded there. Under this arrangement readings were visually available immediately in the Darwin office. </para>
          <para>Now, officers have to travel to the dam daily to check the readings, and this accounts for the delay you referred to. 1 am informed that the intention is to return the recorders to Darwin when the office there has been repaired. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I appreciate that this matter is not the responsibility of the Minister, but it would appear that the Press report is correct and that presently, unless there has been some alteration recently, records are not available immediately to the organisation in Canberra as they should be. The Minister would have been made aware of this matter last night. He may be in a position now to advise whether the situation has changed. I understand that the dam in question is some 40 miles from Darwin. This matter is fairly important and should be considered as such. </para>

          <para>- I refer the Committee to the reference made by Estimates Committee E to division 460 on page 4 of its report. I wish to make brief reference to one component of this vote for $600,000. It was explained that something of the order of one half of this sum was intended for a contingent liability due to a suit in the Supreme Court of the Northern Territory with regard to consultants fees but that the other half was due to be used for a back-up of town planning because the Department of the Northern Territory, which normally has a sizeable town planning force, was not able to support the Darwin Reconstruction Commission in its activities. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>It was explained that it was found that the consultancy work that was intended to be contracted out could be provided by the Department of Construction. Therefore the Committee reported that it was of the opinion that there was every justification for reducing this vote by $600,000, on the basis that $300,000 was for consultancy work which would be done by the Department of Construction and so relieving the necessity for that liability, and that the other half of the $600,000 was premature inasmuch as no judgment has yet been entered in regard to the writ to which I have referred. </para>
        <para>I bring this Committee&#39;s attention to page 22 of the Estimates Committee &#39;s report. It sets out a further communication that was received from the Commission by Estimates Committee E and supplements the information that I have tried to summarise. It states that when estimates were prepared by the Commission it was proposed to place a number of projects involving town planning with consultants because of staff limitations. Fees for these projects with other tasks alsoroposed for consultants were estimated at 600,000. 1 mention that because it seems to be a subject of some doubt whether the Committee was correct in deducing that $300,000 was the correct figure to attribute to the work that has been taken over by the Department of Construction. Reference is made to the writ, and the communication concludes by saying: </para>

          <para>- Estimates Committee E was well aware of the great interest shown by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in this matter. The type of scrutiny in which he engaged should be acceptable to honourable senators. I think the question in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> mind arises out of the method by which an estimate is prepared. Let me quote for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> a Treasury directive as to the general principles which shall be observed by departments in preparing estimates. It states: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <list type="loweralpha">
          <item label="(a)">
            <para>Estimates for all items of expenditure shall represent a realistic assessment of the sum that is expected to be spent having regard to the information available to the department at the time of preparation. Estimates for supplies and services shall be based upon current or known costs and in no circumstances shall any provision be made for possible rises in costs. Where an item is for a type of recurring expense, e.g., office services or travelling and subsistence, it is appropriate to budget on the basis of experience. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(b)">
            <para>Estimates shall not include amounts in respect of proposals which are so far from firm that it is not possible to form any real estimate of what payments, if any, will be made. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(c)">
            <para>Estimates shall be furnished under the heads of expenditure and items used in the annual Appropriation Acts and the Estimates of Receipts and Summary of Estimated Expenditure of the then current financial year or as otherwise approved by the Treasurer or his delegate, i.e., where new or additional appropriation is required. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">I will not quote point (d). I inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that the proposition of expenditure being proposed in an estimate which at the time of our investigation is found to be not required should be applied to that criterion which I have mentioned and some forgiveness made to departments that include amounts which, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> correctly pointed out, should not at this stage be included. The answers given by the officers to Senate Estimates Committee E and indeed the answers which the Committee found wise to publish in its report of October 1976 to the Senate point out why those amounts were included. I have received a letter from the Minister for Northern Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann,</inline> which reads in part as follows: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I have read the relevant transcript in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of evidence given by the General Manager of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Arch Jones)</inline> and a separate explanation which he has submitted to me . . . <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones</inline> has explained to me that on the basis of his understanding when the Budget bids were submitted to Treasury for scrutiny, town planning personnel needed to give effect to section 8 of the Darwin Reconstruction Act 1975 were not available either in the Department of the Northern Territory or the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. Accordingly, funds were sought, and provided for in the Budget, in order to commission private consultants. Subsequently, the DRC was able to locate personnel with appropriate town planning qualifications in the Department of Construction and, of course, the services of these officers will be utilised rather than having recourse to outside consultants. However, an amount of $64,000 for consultancy work has already been committed and a further $30,000 for specialised work contributing to the planning activity will be required. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In relation to the second point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> raised again I have a note from the Minister. It states: </para>

            <para>- It may have been, but apparently the egg was not fertile, because we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> today being very moderate in his remarks. I asked by way of interjection whether he had the numbers. I knew all along, of course, that he was only blowing off steam. Last Monday when returning to this place by way of Commonwealth car I noticed an advertisement at one of the petroleum stations in Glen Osmond Road. It was advertising Golden Fleece petroleum and it reminded me of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> when he made his remarks last Wednesday.

Perhaps he would be prepared to explain what has happened in the meantime to change his mind. </para>

          <para>- I would like to make one or two points. The first relates to division 457, Northern Territory Legislative Assembly Executive- Staff and Services, item 01 of subdivision 2- Salaries and allowances. It is disappointing to see that no allowance has been made for a superannuation scheme for members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I take this opportunity to air the situation briefly. Some 18 months ago the Remuneration Tribunal went to the Northern Territory and made very firm recommendations that members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, like other members of Parliament, should have a superannuation scheme and a disablement allowance. Honourable senators may not realise that members of the Assembly have for many years received little by way of salaries and privileges. One of the things that has been most marked has been the lack of a superannuation scheme. As I said, the Remuneration Tribunal made a very firm recommendation to the Government that a scheme should be brought in as quickly as possible and that it should be back-dated. To date nothing has been done. I attended at the Remuneration Tribunal some 2 weeks ago, and its members were rather surprised that no action had been taken, seeing that a very firm recommendation had been made. As this is a firm recommendation, I would like to see the members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly given the right to have a disablement and superannuation scheme. I would like to see something done about it immediately. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I refer now to division 459 which relates to Northern Territory Police and in particular to subdivision 1 dealing with salaries and payments in the nature of salary. As I said before when the Committee was discussing the matter with the officers of the Department- I repeat it now- I believe that the standard of law and order in the Northern Territory is insufficient. I do not intend going into the whole story of the establishment and so on, but I make the remark that the establishment of the Northern Territory police force must be reviewed along the lines of the Mckenna report, which was the result of an inquiry into the Northern Territory police force some two or three years ago. Very few of the recommendations contained in that report have been carried out. One of the main recommendations that he made was to the effect that one-man police stations in the Northern Territory must cease to exist and that the police force strength must be increased to allow for one-man police stations to become 2-man police stations. That recommendation was made because of better means of communication, better roads and so on. But in the Northern Territory, like anywhere else these days, there is increased violence, and it is most unfair to ask a man and his wife to endeavour to keep law and order in some of these isolated areas. It is an impossible task. Also in these isolated areas which have only one policeman the occasion often arises when he has to leave his post. That occurs for very many reasons. I can assure the Senate that when that happens, in many places all hell breaks loose, and that is the only way in which to describe the situation. So I am once again airing the situation. Despite across the board cuts, and despite the fact that some people may think that the standard of law and order in the Northern Territory is sufficient, I say that most definitely it is not. </para>
        <para>I think we have to recognise the isolated communities of the Northern Territory. I refer to such places as Bathurst Island, Oenpelli, Elcho Island and other places which have communities of some 800, 1000 or 1200 people. They have no police protection. It has been their plea to the authorities for the last two or three years that police posts be established in those places to give them some semblance of law and order. I say some semblance of law and order&#39; because places like Oenpelli are in a very poor state. AH forms of violence take place there, because of the lack of control over liquor and so on. The result is that many people are injured, women are bashed. If honourable senators want to hear more and see more about this situation I refer them to the report of the committee that visited the Northern Territory recently in which those facts are mentioned. However, I expect and hope to see due regard given to the situation next year. </para>
        <para>I now refer to the situation to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred, namely, the appearance of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jones,</inline> General Manager of the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, before the Committee. I am relating my remarks now to division 460 which relates to the Darwin Reconstruction Commission. There was some misunderstanding during the hearings of this Committee about that amount of $600,000. Following the hearings of Estimates Committee E, a telex has been sent in these terms: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Re Darwin Reconstruction Commission division 460. You asked about $600,000 allocation for consultants. Following information supplements my verbal statement 12 October. When estimates prepared Commission proposed to place number of projects involving town planning with consultants because of staff limitations. Fees for these projects with other tasks also proposed for consultants were estimated at $600,000. </para>
          <para>Subsequently we were able to obtain services of suitable planning staff in Department of Construction thus reducing amount required. However about same time we were served with writ by former consultants Technic 10 for about $700,000 (who have now offered to settle at approximately $300,000). As result of policy decision by Commission the services of this firm and four others were prematurely terminated from 30 September 1975. Claims by others were settled in 1975/76. Having regard to Commissions limited access to additional appropriation and advice from senior counsel it was considered prudent to not reduce the $600,000. We recently offered Treasury reduction in appropriation division 460 from $3,020,000 by $200,000 because of reduced staff ceiling. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">However I would agree with the comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> as  Chairman  of Estimates Committee E that the explanation provided in relation to that particular line of expenditure was certainly open to question.

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Robertson</inline>has asked me to bring 2 matters to the attention of the Committee in his absence today. One matter concerns the small amount of increase in the appropriation for library services. Last year the appropriation was $200,000 while the expenditure was $169,432. This year the appropriation is $180,000 which represents an increase of only about $10,600 over the expenditure last year. Apparently during the inquiry of the Estimates Committee <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> asked some questions. He was told that the estimate aimed at one book per head of population, whereas the national average is 2.S books per head. There is provision for a very slight increase in funding. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> has informed me that the cyclone hit the library in Darwin very hard and there is a great need for books in remote areas as well as in Darwin itself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> would like some assurance from the Minister that something can be done to remedy the problem that exists. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The other matter he asked me to raise is along similar lines to that raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff.</inline> He asks that something be done immediately to increase the personnel m the Northern Territory police force. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson&#39;s</inline> behalf in making the request that urgent consideration be given to making the lot of the police in the Northern Territory much easier by giving them sufficient staff to enable them to carry out the duties which they are obliged to perform. </para>
        <para>The other matter with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> is concerned is this: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> had asked by way of question on notice: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>What steps are being taken to allocate funds to the Department of the Northern Territory so as to enable the Department to give financial assistance to victims of bush fires in the Northern Territory? </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The answer he received the other day from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Adermann,</inline> was in these terms: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>No funds are provided to the Department for bush fire relief, nor have any requests for special financial assistance for damage or loss resulting from bush fires in the Northern Territory been received by either my Department or myself. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I understand that the Northern Territory has suffered some very serious bush fires in recent weeks and months. Perhaps it is too early yet for the people who have been affected by them to make some claim for compensation or assistance. I ask the Minister, if he can, to make some funds available so that when those claims are made in the near future there will be no undue delay in meeting them. </para>

          <para>- I shall deal with the matters in the order in which they were raised. First of all, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> raised what I think is more of a political matter when referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> comments. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> should feel quite pleased with the effort he made in attending Estimates Committee E. I do not think he was a member of that Committee but he was present during a great deal of its hearings. It is my belief, as it is the belief of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> that he played an important part in drawing attention to matters of general concern to the Senate and to members of Parliament in their responsibility to the public. Those matters have been brought forward in the report of Estimates Committee E. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I do not think that criticism of any comment that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> may have made is valid. He played a very full pan on behalf of the Government in bringing forward matters that required attention. Indeed, his satisfaction is noted in the answers that I was able to provide for him and for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> concerning the control of quite sizable appropriations which appeared in the estimates of the Department of the Northern Territory. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> mentioned one or two matters which I think I have answered satisfactorily. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> commented on 3 areas. One related to the provision of a superannuation scheme for members of the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory. That matter has been noted in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> I will ensure that the Minister receives a copy of the comments. The honourable senator has vast experience of the Assembly of which he was a member. Since he has been a senator he has demonstrated his interest in members of the Assembly. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> instanced problems relating to the Northern Territory Police Force. If my memory serves me correctly the evidence produced to Senate Estimates Committee E was that there has been quite a large turnover of staff in the police force since the cyclone due to accommodation shortages and probably unattractive conditions. There is extreme difficulty in obtaining recruits because of accommodation at the present time. Staff ceilings have to the best of my knowledge had no immediate effect on the recruiting of staff. In short, the staff ceilings on the police force in the Northern Territory are not restricting police staffing at the present time. That matter will be brought to the attention of the Minister for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Adermann).</inline> Both honourable senators referred to the fact that all people in the Australian community have not the same level of service. When various members of the Senate attempt to show that there should be equality in various areas even if it relates to voting- they should pay attention to the fact that has been raised here this afternoon, that is, that all citizens in Australia have not the same facilities available to them at government level. </para>
        <para>The other matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> I think on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson,</inline> was the lack of library facilities in the Northern Territory. My understanding is that there is no permanent building for a library in Darwin and at the present time there is an acute shortage of staff. We would all hope that that situation can be overcome in the near future. Whilst I cannot state the number of books per head of population that should be aimed at in the Northern Territory there are certain factors relating to the proportion cited by the honourable senator which ought to be considered. I shall ensure that the attention of the Minister for the Northern </para>
        <para>Territory is drawn to the comments that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> has made relating to library facilities. </para>
        <para>I do not accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren&#39;s</inline> comment that money should be held in reserve until such time as bushfires occur in the Northern Territory. If I remember correctly, an earlier answer to the honourable senator from the Minister for the Northern Territory was to the effect that no applications had been received by him for assistance for anybody who had been adversely affected by bushfires within the last few months, but I shall bring to the attention of the Minister the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline></para>

          <para>- I refer very briefly to the Darwin Reconstruction Commission under division 255. As the Committee would know, this Commission has a short life. It is expected that in the next year or two it will have fulfilled its responsibilities and it will be absorbed into other organisations- I hope into a single housing construction authority incorporating the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, the Northern Territory Housing Commission and Department of Housing and so on. The point I make is that although this organisation will be short lived it attracted in its first year of operation a tremendous amount of criticism. It had a most difficult job. Today we can see the results of the efforts of many dedicated people who have been assisting in the rebuilding of Darwin following cyclone Tracy. It was indicated I think in answer to a question in the Senate a few weeks ago that under the rebuilding program the Commission is producing about 6 to 8 houses a day 7 days a week. I just take the opportunity to point this out because the DRC has had tremendous troubles with staffing and criticisms. In fact I think it was rather a top heavy commission to take on this job in the first place and was not quite necessary. The job could have been done by Territory departments. Despite that, the Commission has done a tremendous job. With the rate of progress in construction being carried out by the DRC we can see in Darwin many houses being made available. As I have indicated, it is no mean achievement to see about 40 to 50 houses or more now being handed over each week. It is to the Commission&#39;s credit. </para>

          <para>- In view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff&#39;s</inline> remarks about the Darwin Reconstruction Commission I would like to join with him in congratulating the Commission on the work that it has done but I would not join with him in the criticism he has made of the setting up of the Commission in the first place. I well remember the problems we had in this chamber when Labor was in office and we were trying to get through legislation to set up the Commission. I think it was vitally necessary, and it has proved to be so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> said that probably some of the departments in the Northern Territory could have carried out the work just as successfully as the Commission has done. That is where he and I differ, because I do not think they could have done anywhere near the job that the Commission has done. I want to be placed on record as differing with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> who said there was no need to set up the Commission, because I think it was a piece of legislation that was well worth while and it has proved to be successful. </para>

            <para>- My remarks are general and they apply to both of these areas. I should like to take this opportunity to make the point that the allocation for government housing and for finance for housing in the Australian Capital Territory is inadequate in the present climate. I should also like to express my criticism of the measures introduced by the Government to increase revenues from rental housing, from mortgage payments by people with Commissioner for Housing mortgages and from the increase in rates. The combined effect of the increase in rental the increase in interest rates and the increase in rates has caused hardship to many Canberra families. It is hardship which is not offset by the present Government&#39;s making available once more the sale of government houses. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>These measures have led also to a great deal of unemployment in areas related to home building. I should also like to point out that the allocations for government housing in the Australian Capital Territory have not been adequate in providing for special needs in housing such as emergency housing. There has been a decline in the number of houses allocated to families in distress and a tightening up of guidelines which has meant that many families in distress and seeking emergency housing have not been able to qualify for this housing. The evidence for the problem of homelessness in the Australian Capital Territory is quite substantial. The cases of women who go into women&#39;s refuges, for example, are usually complicated by the women&#39;s inability to get rental housing at a rate they can afford to pay. Other decisions by the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> such as the closure of a number of low-cost government hostels including the closure of the only truly low-cost accommodation facility- Reid House- have meant that many people on low incomes now have great hardship in finding adequate low cost accommodation. </para>
        <para>With regard to the increase in rents, the Minister took an across-the-board decision which has caused many anomalies. I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to some of those. Although I have no argument with the proposition that new brick houses going on to the market now should be rented at rates that relate to market values, I am very critical of the increase in rents on very old government houses, some of which are 40 years old, some of which are fibre or weatherboard and which have had very little maintenance done on them in the last few years. Such houses are often occupied by tenants who have more or less paid off the value of the house in their many years of tenancy. Of course the tenants are now faced with rents similar to those being charged on new brick houses. </para>
        <para>I have had a very large number of complaints brought to me by constituents. I should like to draw the attention of the Senate to a few of them. One low income family with 6 children had a rent increase from $19.40 a week to $29.40 a week. Honourable senators may be aware that the income barrier for rental accommodation is $197 a week with no allowance for dependent children. So we have a very low income family with a lot of children which is faced with a 50 per cent increase in rent. Single people with low incomes who live in old bed sitters have had their rent increased from $14.35 to $25.90 a week- a 60 per cent increase. Another low income family earning $126 a week with an unemployed husband has had its rent increased from $16.20 to $32 a week- nearly a 100 per cent increase. There are many other cases in the same vein. The rents on 8800 houses and flats have been increased. The increase ranged up to $ 1 5 or $ 1 6 a week. Apparently there is an expected increase in revenue from government rentals of $2. 35m. </para>
        <para>I suggest that the increase in revenue is not compensated for by the hardship caused to families who, without much prior warning, and certainly with no prior warning by the coalition parties before the last general election, have to face these vast increases. Similarly with interest rates there has been a drastic increase for a number of families. There would have been an increase for more families if the Department had not backed down with respect to some mortgage agreements because the Public Service union- the Adminis.tative and Clerical Officers Association- threatened to take legal action on the grounds that the increase in certain mortgage agreements was illegal. The Department did back down. Nevertheless, there has been a drastic increase for some people. An estimated $ 1 .72m is expected to be gained for revenue by the increase in interest rates. I point out that in one particular case where interest rates had been increased from <inline font-style="italic">6lA</inline> per cent to 9% per cent, the monthly repayment has risen from $66.52 to $93.45. On a 45-year loan of $12,000 the increase in the total repayment is $13,000. </para>
        <para>There has also been a decrease in the number of houses available for rental by people in the Australian Capital Territory. I cite figures from the Department which show that in September 1975-76, 169 houses were available for sale. A year later, 97 houses were available. Similarly, with rental allocations in September 1975-76 869 houses were available and in the following year only 697 were available. So not only has there been an increase all round for tenants and home owners in the Australian Capital Territory, but there has been a decrease in the number of houses available. </para>
        <para>I should like to make a few remarks on the effect this has had generally on the building industry and the people employed in or apprenticed to that industry. There has been a serious decline in the number of apprenticeship positions available. I shall cite figures from the Master Builders Association of the Australian Capital Territory on intakes into the group apprenticeship scheme. From 1970 to 1973, 100 per cent of the applicants were placed. In 1974 this figure fell to 70 per cent; in 1975 it fell to 50 per cent; and in 1976 only 13 per cent of applicants for the group apprenticeship scheme could be accepted. </para>
        <para>We have also had the new phenomenon of apprentices in the Australian Capital Territory being retrenched. In this year 61 apprentices have been retrenched and of&#34; these 2 1 were in the building trades. Unemployment of people working in the construction industry has been particularly high. Again, I would relate this to the Government&#39;s general attitude to rental of housing and to interest rates which have been so high as to prohibit a number of families who intended to build this year from being able to proceed with their intentions. </para>
        <para>I conclude my remarks by saying that I do not consider that the increased revenues which will come from these extremely severe conditions imposed on rental dwellings, on Commissioner for Housing loans and on other mortgages held by the Department of the Capital Territory will compensate for the hardship, the disruption, the unemployment and the lack of apprenticeship training possibilities that have resulted from the Government&#39;s general housing policy in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

Indeed, it is not the wish of this Government that interest rates are as high as they are now. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> will be readily aware that the escalation in interest rates occurred during the past 3 years when the Government, of which she was an interested party, was in office. </para>

            <para>-Senator McLaren is raising another matter. I think the points that were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> dealt mainly with economic measures which have taken place- indeed of necessity- during the last few years. I say again that it would not be the wish of any government or any government senator that such measures should have to be implemented. I feel that some of the comments made by the honourable senator may not be appropriate but if they are I hope that she will hasten to advise <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> of the things she has said. For instance, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> said that families in distress have not been able to qualify for housing. If she has details of particular instances of this occurring, I hope she will refer them immediately to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley.</inline> I am quite sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> would be extremely anxious to know of such cases. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> referred to the allocation of houses. The fact is that basically expenditure on housing loans, for instance, is well below the previous pro rata figure, mainly because insufficient applications have been received, thus not enabling the money to be allocated. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The honourable senator referred to emergency housing which is allocated on a needs basis and the criteria, as I understand it, have not changed since the Emergency Housing Committee was set up some 3 years ago. I understand that the Emergency Housing Committee examines all applications for emergency housing which the department refuses. I am given to understand that the committee is composed mainly of private citizens. If the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> are valid I hope that she will immediately draw the attention of the Minister to them. In fact, I would be pleased to receive the information in this Senate and to convey it to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley.</inline> Another matter raised by the honourable senator was the increase in rents. My understanding is that the rents have been based on a market value and all rents have been structured well below the actual market value of any particular house. Again I say to the honourable senator that if she is aware of any instances where that is not so I would be pleased to convey them to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Staley</inline> and to the department to be examined immediately. </para>
        <para>I am advised that rents have been increased on the basis of rental valuations of samples of houses. The rentals fixed have been assessed by discounting the valuers&#39; figures to a level which will allow government rentals to still be below the ruling market values at the present time. Whilst the rental increases may appear to be steep, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> mentioned, an adequate rebate scheme operates. I understand that the scheme is more generous than any provided by the States, particularly the rebates for this year. I hope I have dealt with all the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan.</inline> I should like to reiterate that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> played a full part in drawing the attention of the Estimates Committee to many of those points which are noted in the Committee&#39;s report to the Senate. </para>

          <para>-Senate Estimates Committee E had to refer to several items in its report and I propose to ask this Committee of the Whole to consider three of them. The first concerns an item for consultants&#39; fees in the tourist industry. It is division 210.2.08, referred to on page 2 of our report. There it appears that consultants&#39; fees have been expended to the extent of $ 120,000 in obtaining reports on basic material as to tourist factors in the Australian Capital Territory. It was proposed to ask in this appropriation for $19,000 for a further consultancy fee for the examination of those reports and then interpretation to the Department. We pointed out that in the annual report of the Australian Capital Territory Advisory Board on Tourism it had been stated: </para>

        </quote>
        <para class="block">The other matter I raise is a bit more contentious. It deals with the city omnibus division. The same Committee, when examining the Estimates in May, pointed out that the Government subsidy to the Canberra omnibus service increased from $1.8m in 1973-74 to $3.6m in 1974-75. It is proposed to ask for a subsidy in this appropriation of no less than $5.4m. So the appropriation goes up by stages of a neat $1.8m a year. If that were simply associated with the astronomical inflationary figures that we have been experiencing in the last 3 years it would be bad enough; but as we pointed out in May, we were informed of the alarming fact that timetables proposed to ensure economies in the bus service were not able to be implemented because of an industrial dispute which had resulted in a loss of savings of $600,000 in the year. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy Chairman,</inline>I am not here to invite your arbitration as to any industrial dispute, nor am I an advocate for either side, but we both should weep to think that a cost of $600,000 is being inflicted upon the taxpayers- fellow unionists- to increase the exorbitant amount of $5.4m as a subsidy for the Canberra bus service. It is no answer to me to be told that other metropolitan bus services are wasting money to the same degree. I volunteer the fact that to my complete surprise the Tasmanian metropolitan bus transport body last week produced its annual report in which the loss was stated as $5.5m for Hobart, Launceston, Devonport and Burnie. That sum transplanted to Queenstown at present would be very useful. When I advocate economy I have these matters in mind. I am sad to note that the Department of the Capital Territory has advertised for extra drivers, which I believe is to yield to the union demand. That, on all the facts as I see them, will require an expenditure of $600,000 for the year. </para>
        <para>I come to the third item. I shall be brief. I am advised that this comes under division 214. It refers to the escalation of capital works prices. Firstly, I deal with the astronomical increase in the National Gallery program. It started <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> years ago when the original contract sum was $13. 168m. We are told that the rise and fall clause to July 1976 has increased the cost by $1 1.2m, and fixed costs associated with the extended period of contract amount to $3m. The total cost to date that the Parliament has to provide for this job is $27.368m. I know the difficulty of exciting any interest in this matter but there will be less money for parliamentarians&#39; salaries in the Northern Territory and elsewhere if this sort of thing goes on. A project began not 3 years ago at an estimated $ 13.5m will now cost $27m. It is an absolute tribute to the inflation that was created; or else complete irresponsibility. </para>
        <para>There is another factor about it and that concerns the integrity of government accounting and records. The works program that was presented to our Committee showed under the column Amount Authorised&#39; the amount of $26.4m. We went back to previous annual reports and the report of 1973-74 showed the amount authorised as $ 13.2m. The following year the amount authorised was shown as $ 15.1m and the following year- that is to say the present year, the year for which the records will stand as holding the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> and the Government responsible, 1975-76- the amount authorised is shown as $ 13.2m and the increase as $ 13.2m. Does the Minister see the significance of that, a val an ching the whole increase into that year and saying that the amount authorised was $ 13.2m? </para>
        <para>But when we come to the works program that we were asked to consider the figure stated as the amount authorised is $26.4m. That is an inaccurate and untrue record unless the document is to receive an interpretation which does not occur to me upon its plain reading. So the integrity of the record has to be looked at and then the completely outrageous increase from $ 13m to $27m for this building in 3 years be token ing either outrageous inflation or unjustified irresponsibility. In view of that, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Minister,</inline> I am going to ask you, through the  Deputy Chairman,  to state that you will provide this Committee, before the Parliament rises in December, with a short statement from the responsible body indicating what are the justifying factors for this huge increase. </para>

          <para>- I shall deal with the three matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> which are of importance. I shall do my best to respond to him. It may be noted that the information that appears in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> generally gives the response of the Department of the Capital Territory to those matters which have been instanced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> as not being satisfactory. Those matters have been raised in the report of Estimates Committee E. It is now for the Committee of the Whole to further investigate them. This is the proper place in which they should be debated because, as I have said, they are mentioned in the Committee&#39;s report. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I turn to division 210.2.08 which deals with consultants&#39; fees. As I understand it the Estimates Committee does not dispute the need for the study. The amount of $ 1 9,000 included in the Department&#39;s estimates for 1976-77 is for the employment of a consultant to undertake stage 2 of an on-going study of the needs of visitors and of the tourist industry in the Australian Capital Territory. The amount of $19,000 represents the minimum amount required to provide specialist assistance to departmental officers in undertaking stage 2 of that study. It was always envisaged- this was brought out at the Estimates Committee hearing, as the honourable senator will know- that significant officer involvement would be required to undertake this stage of the study. The severe staff restraints imposed on the Department have forced the modification of stage 2 to a minimum study with the use of consultants to provide the specialist skills not otherwise available. </para>
        <para>Without the ability and finance to obtain these specialist skills to assist in the development of the modified stage 2 work, the stage 1 data will rapidly become unreliable and will not be able to be used because essential linkages and continuities will be broken. The Estimates Committee has recommended that the suggestion that the work might be done by an intradepartmental group be adopted. Of course, this was one of the alternatives suggested by the A.C.T. Advisory Board on Tourism and was no doubt intended to be helpful and certainly reflected its view that stage 2 was essential. However, it was made without knowledge of the Department&#39;s position under staff ceilings. Because of the effect of ceilings and of the need for specialist skills, resources are available only to carry out stage 2 on a modified basis but, nevertheless, on a basis which will ensure that the benefits of the earlier work are not lost. I am sure the honourable senator would not want the benefits of that earlier expenditure to be lost. </para>

The Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> is conscious of the Government&#39;s policy regarding the use of consultants, and he assures that he will explore every avenue to carry out the work in the most effective and economic way.

        <para>The next matter that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> raised on his own behalf related to division 210.3.10- City Omnibus Service, loss on operations (for payment to the Australian Capital Territory Transport Trust Account). There was a great deal of debate on this matter in the Estimates Committee hearing. I wish to speak on this matter only so that I can verify and support the comments which the honourable senator made relating to the expenditure in this matter. The level of subsidy requested by the Canberra bus service recognises the need to provide a public transport system offering a standard of service attractive enough to encourage more people to use this mode as an alternative to the private motor car, particularly for the journey to work. This approach is consistent with world-wide trends. By placing more emphasis on public transport there will be less pressure for more road capacity and more money and land for car parking space. I believe that these things have to be taken into account, and that the honourable senator would acknowledge the wisdom of this. Improvements in frequency and route coverage and the introduction of new services, it is believed by the Minister for the Capital Territory, are long overdue. The bus fleet has been built up to enable these changes to be made and drivers need to be recruited to put the changes into effect. The level of subsidy is not inconsistent with levels elsewhere, and the honourable senator acknowledged that point. Likewise, it is believed that costs are comparable. However, the level of revenue needs to be lifted, and to achieve this fares were increased responsibly in September last for the second time in 12 months. Fares for school bus travel were reintroduced in September to give an estimated saving of approximately $500,000 in a full year. By offering a more attractive bus service and by giving better bus service information it is hoped to lift the level of revenue still further. A definite attempt is being made by the omnibus service to do that, and to do it responsibly. </para>
        <para>The bus service is an area where labour costs represent more than 70 per cent of the expenditure, and industrial disputes involving stoppages can effect both expenditure and revenue. These can result in a loss of patronage as people are forced to change their travel habits, and often it takes some time to win back passengers after normal services are resumed. Thus, there can be a further impact on revenue. Consistent with the Government&#39;s aim to rein in the growth of expenditure in the public sector, the amount sought by the Department in 1976-77 was subject to specific scrutiny by the Government, and the endorsement by the Government of this subsidy of $5,410,000 recognised the need to pursue a balanced transport strategy for Canberra. A reduction could distort that strategy and put in jeopardy moves to prevent saturation of the road system and the town centres by private motor cars. The Estimates Committee in its report stated that it is of the opinion that the full amount of the subsidy requested is not justified and that some reduction should be made. However, the Committee does not state by what amount the estimate should be reduced nor on what basis it should be reduced. I am advised that the Minister for the Capital Territory has fully justified this estimate to the Government and that the Government is satisfied that the amount requested is needed. Therefore, in the opinion of the Government the estimate should stand. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>has asked for a specific response from me to the points he made regarding the National Gallery. I assure him that I will attempt to give that response. I believe that when I read in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> what he said I will find that he wants a 3 page or 4 page statement relating to the cost escalation that has occurred in the building of the National Gallery. Although the figure of $26,368,000 has been derived from information given to the Estimates Committee, the actual situation as at 30 June was that the original contract in April 1973 was for $ 1 3,263,000. Rise and fall adjustments add $8,755,000 and adjustments to provisional quantities add $4,461,000 making a total of $26,479,000. The rise and fall adjustments reflect inflation. I am advised that the building industry cost increases as applicable to buildings-that is not civil engineering- in 1970-71 were 6.148 per cent; in the following year they were 1 1.566 per cent; in 1972-73 they were 9.501 percent; in 1973-74 they were 16.856 per cent; in 1974-75 they were 16.47 per cent; and in 1975-76 they were 15:6 percent. </para>
        <para>I turn now to the average wages on the Gallery work. I think these figures indicate the intense interest which the Department takes in attempting to see that costs are controlled. On 19 April 1973 the average wage was $109.01 a week. On 30 June 1976 the average wage was $215.44 a week. In those figures there is somewhat of a justification for the escalation in cost as applied not only to wages but also to materials. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that material increases as per the cost index in that same period were in the vicinity of 68 per cent. I shall attempt to obtain the information that the honourable senator requires.  His  comments in drawing attention to the requirement to control expenditure do a service to the Committee, to the Department and to the Public Service. </para>

          <para>- I want to comment on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> statement about the City Omnibus Service. If my memory serves me correctly, he said that one of the problems being faced by this Service was the fact that it was being held to ransom by the unions. That seems to be typical of the attitude of honourable senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is always to the forefront. Whenever there is an industrial dispute he and his colleagues endeavour to lay the blame at the feet of the unions. There are always 2 parties to any industrial dispute. One party can never be held totally responsible. The unions particularly cannot be held totally responsible. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> on that matter. I think the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> has given him an adequate answer as to why that extra expenditure is required. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The Minister has answered <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> &#39;s question about the Department of the Capital Territory advertising for 49 extra drivers. The thing that should be uppermost in the Department&#39;s mind is the safety of the passengers that the Service carries. We should not be trying to economise by cutting down on the number of drivers or on the service. It is all very well for members of Parliament to criticise public transport. Very few members of Parliament ever use public transport- in this city anyway. They would not have any idea of the inconvenience of the travelling public in getting around this city which has no railways and no trams, such as other cities of the Commonwealth have. All Canberra has is a bus service. All governments are of the opinion that we should be encouraging more people to use public transport and so get more private cars off the road. I hope that governments are successful. I venture to say that perhaps within the next 25 years all public transport will be free. That will be a very low cost to the community if we can get private motor cars off the road. </para>
        <para>I want to deal with another avenue of transport in the Australian Capital Territory. I have raised in the Senate many times the use of taxis in lieu of Commonwealth cars. Can the Minister say whether the Department of Administrative Services is to take over the control of the Commonwealth car fleet in Canberra? If so, is it correct that the number of cars in the fleet is to be reduced to 40? Is it also correct that the Department of the Capital Territory has issued another 10 hire car permits? Is this the reason for the decision to cut down on the number of cars in the Commonwealth car fleet? What check does the Department have on hire car permits to see that the car which is licensed to carry passengers for hire is the only car used for the purpose and that not more than one car is used by the permit holder to carry passengers who are charged for their carriage? </para>

          <para>- I refer to division 210, subdivision 2, item 08. My comments refer to a study of tourism and tourism in Canberra city. There was quite a discussion about tourism in Canberra with officers of the Department of the Capital Territory at a meeting of Estimates Committee E some two to three weeks ago. I have a tourist industry background. To me it appeared that if more interest were taken in tourism by authority in Canberra perhaps there would be a much bigger return to the city than it is getting now. I was quite surprised to learn from the discussion with the officers that the revenue- the money from the Budget- and the expenditure came very close to balancing. The only point I make is that now the Government is becoming more and more aware of the advantages of tourism in Australia there is a necessity to encourage Australians to see Australia and there is a necessity to encourage Australians to see Canberra. I suggest that there is ample scope in the system here to encourage more people to come here. Perhaps there would be a better balance of payments, if we wish to put it that way, if it could happen. Tourism in Canberra has every right to be encouraged. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I refer now to the City Omnibus Service. I tried the service a few times in the last few weeks. I found it an excellent bus service. I suppose one could say that it is one of the better services if not the best service in Australia. It is disconcerting to see the tremendous cost of public transport to authority these days. Officers of the Department who appeared before the Estimates Committee were no doubt endeavouring to contain costs as much as possible. The subsidy this year is about $5.4m. No doubt next year there will be an increase. One can agree with their concern. The problem in Canberra, as far as I can see, is that there is an extremely difficult situation. It is a matter of passenger coach transport- public transport- versus the private car. There appears to me at the moment to be some sort of balance. If one wants to encourage a greater use of public transport certain things would have to be done. The public car parking areas in Canberra are on very valuable land. The revenue from parking fees would in no way compensate for the lost rental from this valuable land. However, I believe the transport problem here is a most difficult one. To me it appears to be in some degree of balance at the moment. An endeavour to take away the car parking spaces will have complications. The main point on which I wish to speak is my concern, similar to that of the  Chairman  of the Committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> about the erection of the National Gallery and High Court buildings. Once again there was considerable discussion with the officers of the department. As the  Chairman  of the Committee indicated, the original contract sum for the National Art Gallery was $13. 168m, and the total cost is now up to $27.368m, which is an increase of some 100 per cent. The rise and fall provision added $ 11.2m and the fixed costs associated with the extended period of the contract added $3m. The cost of the High Court building was originally estimated at $ 1 5m. When it went to contract it was $ 1 9m. The estimated cost now is $28.084m. This is once again a tremendous increase. We realise that in these days the rise and fall variation within contracts has increased tremendously because building costs in the last 2 years have risen astronomically. </para>
        <para>There are one or two points about the whole matter that need airing. I think I am correct in referring to the fixed costs associated with the extended period of contract for the National Art Gallery. It is my understanding that last year, when the Australian economy suffered severely from Budget cuts under the previous Government, a lot of government works were slowed up, curtailed or cut out. Slowing up the work on the National Art Gallery caused inconvenience to the contractor and the sub-contractors for the simple reason that it disrupted the work. A penalty rate was charged by the contractor. If I remember rightly- I do not have the figure in front of me- something like $4,000 a day was charged because of the slowing up of the job. In my estimation this added something like $750,000 to the cost of the project. If my figures are incorrect, I would like them to be corrected. </para>
        <para>Since I spoke to officers who appeared before the Estimates Committee I discussed a week or two ago with officers of the Department of Construction the estimated cost of a project. The original contract sum for the National Art Gallery was $13m, but over a period, for various reasons, the contract price increased. It is not the fault of the officers of the National Capital Development Commission, but I suggest that what is happening in many cases is that the client department asks for additional fixtures and fittings and for changes in the contract which are extremely costly. One can see that evidence in the High Court building. This evidence was given to Estimates Committee E: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>When we let the contract it was a little more than $19m. Since then there has been rise and fall on the job and there have been some significant additions to the contract. One, for example, is the security of the courts- the security provided around the buildings. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">My understanding is that that was an extremely costly addition. If I remember rightly, security measures were taken with the windows up to a height of 60 or 80 feet. It appears to me that a lot of the fault arises because once the original contract price is fixed there are so many additions to the contract that the price increases tremendously. </para>
        <para>I presume that the projects to which I have referred went before the Public Works Committee as they were to cost over $2m. I presume that in evidence before the Public Works Committee it was indicated that the estimated contract sum for the National Art Gallery was $ 1 3m. It has increased to $2 7m. It is completely wrong that a project should go before the Public Works Committee- I am only supposing this; I can be corrected if I am wrong- for confirmation by the Government for the funding of some $13m and that eventually it should be necessary to increase that sum by 100 per cent. If a project goes before the Public Works Committee there should be provided an estimate as close and as firm as possible of the cost of the projects so that the Committee can make a recommendation to the Government and the Government can know exactly what it is up for. You cannot tell me that projects would then be allowed to slip through which cost some 100 per cent more than the original estimate. As I said, it is an interesting point I would like the authorities in government to take up this point. I am suggesting that in some cases when a project is put forward only a basic price is given. In the case to which I referred it was 13m. When the initial application was made for funds, was the Government told that so much more money would be required? I doubt it. From talking to Department of Construction officials in the last fortnight it is my understanding that the Department of Construction is looking at procedures whereby a project budgeted for at a certain amount will have to be constructed at that amount and no additional funds will be available to client departments if they want to add this and that. This situation warrants the scrutiny of government to ensure that large projects like those I mentioned do not get out of hand. I suggest that this is what has happened. </para>

          <para>-As a member of Estimates Committee E, I think I ought to make some comment about the matters that have been reported to this Committee of the Whole arising out of the examination by Estimates Committee E of the estimates that came under its purview. In regard to division 2 10.2.07, which relates to the cost of computer services, I raised in the Estimates Committee the question of the advisability of doing a cost-benefit analysis of the results of the installation of computers. I understand that this may have been commented on some days ago. I have a recollection that the matter had an airing somewhere or other. I believe- I am sure the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> can answer this very quickly- that in fact a parliamentary committee or an interdepartmental committee has been set up or is to be set up to do an analysis of the cost of the installation of computers. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>We have had them for three or four years in the various departments. Some are hired and some are shared by a number of departments. Others, one assumes, have been installed for the exclusive use of a particular department. Quite frankly, I have not been able to identify clearly the particular benefit that is derived from the installation of these machines. I can remember somebody telling me some years ago that the great benefit was that whereas previously a piece of paper would float around for 6 days it would float around now for only 24 hours; but I could not relate that to any particular benefit in terms of the efficiency of the administration of the Government. I think it is good if there can be a reduction of 5 days, but there must be some ongoing benefit or some more clearly identifiable benefit. I am sure the Minister can answer the question which I posed in the Estimates Committee and which I now raise again as to whether in fact some detailed and special analysis has been made of the value of computers and the relationship that exists between the various departments using them to ensure that the maximum efficiency is being obtained from the installation of these machines. </para>
        <para>I pass to division 2 10.2.08, which relates to the engagement of consultants to do the final phase of the analysis of the tourist study that was undertaken. We find that the item of $19,000 is approximately 15 per cent of the original sum. In other words, we have now expended 85 per cent of what would be the total sum on an analysis of tourism in the Australian Capital Territory. I do not have any really strong views about this matter but, whilst I support the view of the Estimates Committee, I believe that, if we can find within the Public Service the people who can carry out this final study, that is well and good, but I would hate to see the situation arise where, if that were not possible, the whole study would collapse for the sake of the expenditure of that final 15 per cent of the total sum. It may even be less than that, but on my very quick calculations it comes to about that figure. When one considers that 2 million tourists pass through this city one realises that this is a very important program. We ought to know all that we can possibly know about the subject which presumably will be an ongoing benefit not only for this city but also for other cities. </para>
        <para>I turn now to subdivision 3, item 10- City Omnibus Service. Even taking into account the fact that industrial disputes accounted for $600,000 of the total loss of $5,410,000- it represents approximately 1 1 per cent of the total- the cost to the taxpayer of the operation of the omnibus service for Canberra equates reasonably with comparable situations in other parts of Australia and other parts of the world. That being the case, one must accept that the system must have operated more efficiently than has been the case elsewhere. That is really just a comment on the side. Canberra is certainly the best planned city in Australia and it is one of the few really well planned cities of the world. From my experience as a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory I have seen the quality of planning not only of the layout of the city of Canberra but also of the services that go with it. So one expects that the bus services for the city have been planned in equal detail and with an equal study of the benefits to be gained. </para>
        <para>I think we have to be tough where this problem arises, not only here in Canberra but elsewhere in Australia and elsewhere in the world. I think that we are pussy-footing with this public transport problem. Here we have a city with well planned services- I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> that there are excellent vehicles on the road- and we have an under-utilisation of public transport. As I see it, at the present time we do not have an over-capacity of buses but an under-usage. I think that this city, as other cities, is being cluttered with private vehicles. Canberra is an affluent city and I suppose that its proportion of vehicles per head of population is equal to anywhere in Australia. It is natural and convenient for people to hop in their motor cars and go anywhere they want to go but they should not expect the taxpayer to provide parking areas and to provide for sufficient development of the road systems. If a public transport system is provided it ought to be used. It is time that we here and elsewhere in Australia got tough and said that public transport services must be used and that people should park their private vehicles outside the city so that the whole place does not become cluttered up with them. There has to be found some other means of ensuring proper and full utilisation of the system that is provided here. </para>
        <para>It is all right to criticise the planners from time to time, but they plan according to what they anticipate to be the needs of the city. The Parliament in its wisdom might bring down some legislation to prevent private vehicles from coming into the city but unless the development of these services has been planned we will be in trouble again. So the planners have ensured that there is an adequacy of bus services. As I said before, we have to take steps to ensure that the people use those services. </para>
        <para>The only other comment I want to make is in regard to the item to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referredthat is, the National Gallery. The escalation of its costs reminds me of the FI 1 1 aircraft. I take issue with the use of the word &#39;authorised&#39;. In my study of this matter and from the replies which I received from the departmental officers- I want to put on record that throughout they were very courteous and helpful- I cannot for the life of me accept that the figure that was put before us under the heading of &#39;authorised&#39; had been authorised in the generally accepted sense of the word, such as authorised by the Parliament or by some authority having the power to authorise. The point was made fairly clearly during the meeting of the Estimates Committee that this was a rather extravagant use of the word authorised&#39; and that perhaps in future we may find a different expression used. It could be confusing to anybody picking up these papers and seeing that this amount has been authorised. As I said, I found it very difficult to accept. I know and it was explained to me and to the other members of the Committee that that terminology has been used over the years, but if we are to have a correct appreciation of the subject another expression should be used. </para>

          <para>- As a senator for the Australian Capital Territory I thought that the Committee stages of the consideration of this Bill would be an appropriate time to discuss in some detail the question of Australian Capital Territory bus services since it has been raised in debate and in the report of Senate Estimates Committee E. I would like to add something to what has been said by a number of other honourable senators, including the Minister for Science, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> I think it has to be recognised as fundamental to any discussion of this question that Canberra and the &#39;new towns&#39; of the Australian Capital Territory represent a new and relatively rapidly developing city. Only now are we beginning the development of a comprehensive public transport system in the Australian Capital Territory. Planning was first undertaken for this major development in the early 1970s. It was only in July 1974 that the Department of the Capital Territory and the National Capital Development Commission agreed on a transport policy and the objectives that ought to be pursued. This was published in summary form, and for completeness of the record I ask that that summary of objects of the transport policy for the Australian Capital Territory be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>- It is because of the development of a more extensive public transport system for the Australian Capital Territory linking Canberra and the new towns of Woden, Weston, Tuggeranong and Belconnen that the subsidy has risen very rapidly in the last 3 years. One has only to look at the figures to concede that the operating deficit has grown rapidly. This is explained by the fact that this is a rapidly developing city in which the infrastructure is being established and the population is relatively dispersed. I make the point also that this is occurring at a time when we in the Australian Capital Territory are trying to encourage and ensure in the future greater use of the public transport system. Special bus lanes have already been established on a couple of main roads and a rapid transit system of roads will commence operating in the near future. At present about 18 per cent to 20 per cent of commuters in the Capital Territory use the bus service. Our aim is that in the not too distant future about 40 per cent of commuters will use those buses. As I have mentioned, a rapid transit system is planned. We have extended our bus fleet and we are increasing the number of drivers, and this is essential if we are to effectively serve the newer areas of the Capital Territory such as Tuggeranong and Belconnen. I think it has to be remembered that all of this development has important implications with respect to urban development in the Capital Territory, the environment, the use of motor vehicles, the need for roads and parking areas, and the maintenance of those roads and parking areas, and that buses are in fact the sole basis of our public transport system in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I think it is also worth noting in this context that in the 3 years between 1973 and 1976 the number of commuters using the buses in Canberra has increased from 10 per cent to 20 per cent, which in fact is a very substantial increase and represents a rate of increase which we hope might continue. It will mean that many more people are using the public transport system and are thereby relieving the pressure on our roads and parking areas. It is worth noting also that in the year between 1974-75 and 1975-76 the number of passenger journeys in the Capital Territory increased from roughly 12 million to 14 million. So community acceptance and community use of the public transport system is increasing rapidly. I think this helps to explain or to justify, if you like, the increase in the operating deficit that is occurring as we get the public transport system established here. I leave aside, because I do not think there is any need to mention them, the other important questions that affect the deficit, including inflation and the capital costs involved in providing new equipment and in establishing the important economic infrastructure that goes with a public transport system, such as new roads, bus stations and so on. </para>
        <para>I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> has reiterated this afternoon and done so very effectively- some of the points that he made on that subject during the hearings of Estimates Committee E. I would like to read to the Committee what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> said during the hearings of Estimates Committee E: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>There appears to be nothing available in the future that can take the place of the bus transport system. The vote is a difficult one inasmuch as I see no alternative. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>He went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>From what I have seen of the situation, the departmental people are running a show to the best of their ability but they just cannot win, so under the circumstances I see no alternative. The money is required. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I think that also reflects what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> said this afternoon. It is an eminently reasonable assesment. During the hearings of Estimates Committee E the departmental officer concerned provided a good deal of relevant information in regard to subsidies for bus services. I wish to read just one statement that was made to the Committee: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>I think public transport is one operation that has traditionally become a public sector operation because the private sector can no longer meet it, and the question is whether you provide it at all. If you reduce services, then the most depressing effect is upon the captive rider who has no other means of travel and who therefore is immobilised in the community. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I simply want to emphasise the context in which the increase in the operating deficit in the Canberra buses has occurred. This is a rapidly developing city with a relatively rapidly increasing population. While we are establishing an infrastructure and a new rapid transit system for buses, and while we are seeking to meet the problems of a relatively dispersed population located in the &#39;new towns&#39; of the Capital Territory, we have to make the effort to ensure greater use by the community of the public transport system. As has been observed by many people, that is a problem which is common to almost every major city in the world, and of course, to Canberra. Given the stage of development in Canberra and in the Australian Capital Territory and given the importance in a rapidly growing city of this kind of an effective public transport system, I do not think that the rate of increase in the subsidy or the level of the subsidy is surprising. </para>

              <para>- The Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority Ordinance has been passed by the Executive Council and I shall table it in the Senate as soon as possible after it has been gazetted. In the meantime, the Government has announced a number of changes in the arrangements for primary and secondary education and for technical and further education in the Australian Capital Territory. The Government has decided that there should be greater community representation on the permanent Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. The new body will have 15 members compared with the present Interim Authority&#39;s 10 members. The Government believes that up to now there have been limited opportunities for the wider community to contribute to the Interim Authority&#39;s decision making, and to date many sources of information and ideas have not been available to assist in the administration of education in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Schools Authority Ordinance will operate from the beginning of 1977, and the composition of the new Authority will be as follows: Fourteen part-time members nominated as follows- three by the Australian Capital Territory Teachers&#39; Federation; two by the Australian Capital Territory Council of Parents&#39; and Citizens&#39; Associations; one by the Canberra Pre-School Society; two by the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly from its elected members; six by the Minister for Education; and one full-time member who will be the Chief Education Officer. </para>
          <para>Changes in the composition of the Authority will strengthen the basic philosophy of education in the Australian Capital Territory in having even more community involvement in the decision-making body administering the Australian Capital Territory government school system. A high degree of community involvement was proposed in the 1973 report entitled <inline font-style="italic">A design for the Governance and Organisation of Education in the A.C.T.,</inline> prepared by a panel which was chaired by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Philip</inline> Hughes, who is  Chairman  of the Interim Authority. In the 3 years since that report was made the Interim Authority has confirmed that philosophy and it is the Government&#39;s intention to further it through the provisions of the Schools Authority Ordinance. From the beginning of 1 977 the Authority will have broad functions in relation to the establishment and conduct of government preschools, primary schools, high schools and secondary colleges in the Australian Capital Territory and in the provision of related services. </para>
          <para>Other provisions in the Ordinance will ensure than any proposal affecting staffing standards, procedures and overall numbers of professional teaching staff will be introduced after consultation with and the approval of the Minister. The Department of Education will continue to be responsible for relations with and policy concerning non-government schools in the Australian Capital Territory. The Interim Authority will continue to function until the end of 1 976. </para>
          <para>The second major issue with which I wish to deal is that of arrangements for further education in the Australian Capital Territory. In accordance with the Government&#39;s policy of decentralisation of decision making and community participation in education, the major feature of the new arrangements would be councils for the four further education institutions which the Australian Capital Territory will have in 1977. These comprise the Canberra Technical and Further Education College, Bruce Technical and Further Education College, Canberra School of Art and Canberra School of Music. The Councils will have both managerial and advisory responsibilities, and will include representatives of staff and students. Substantial responsibility will be devolved to the institutions, where the community-based councils will operate. The terms of reference and composition of each council will be announced shortly. </para>
          <para>In addition the system will include adult migrant education which will be integrated within the services provided by the Canberra TAFE College and the Bruce TAFE College. The Department of Education will be responsible for the administration of Further Education in the Australian Capital Territory. To co-ordinate present activities and future developments a Director of Further Education will be identified within the Department. He will be supported by a small administrative unit. Changes in the administration of technical and further education have been made necessary by the decision of the Commonwealth Government to assume wider responsibility in this area. For many years the New South Wales Department of Technical Education has administered the Canberra Technical College, in conjunction with the Commonwealth Department of Education. The Government appreciates the services which the New South Wales authorities have provided and the long association between the Commonwealth and New South Wales departments will not be completely terminated as the New South Wales Department will continue to supply various services in the next few years while the new Australian Capital Territory system is in its developing stages. There is also a need to provide for new institutions such as the Bruce TAFE College to be established in 1 977, and for the Canberra School of Art, which became a separate institution earlier this year. The Canberra School of Music will also be included in these new arrangements. Developments overseas and elsewhere in Australia indicate a growing need to co-ordinate the administration and operations in the post-compulsory and further education areas. Such an approach is particularly necessary in the Australian Capital Territory because of the current growth of the system and also its relative smallness. </para>
          <para>A standing committee on further education will be established to co-ordinate the activities of the councils and to deal with some of the wider aspects of further education. The standing committee will be convened by the Department of Education and will have responsibility for advising it on the operation of the further education system. The standing committee on further education will include the  chairman  of each council and the principal or director of each of the 4 institutions. There will be representation from other areas involved with further education including the relevant activities of the Australian Capital Territory Schools Authority. For broad planning purposes in Australian Capital Territory education, the Department will develop consultation arrangements involving other educational agencies including the Australian National University and the Canberra College of Advanced Education and the non-government schools, as well the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly, the Department of the Capital Territory, and the National Capital Development Commission. </para>
          <para>Arrangements are being made for teachers in the further education field to have the opportunity of transferring to the Commonwealth Teaching Service and to work in a satisfactory professional career situation. The employment of teachers under the Commonwealth Teaching Service Act will allow the flexibility needed to meet the diverse needs of teachers in further education. The conditions which will operate for further education teachers from 1977 can be regarded only as a beginning. The councils of the institutions, the Commissioner of the Commonwealth Teaching Service, the Department of Education, and the Australian Capital Territory Teachers Federation will continue to explore the requirements of further education staff and develop conditions which are most suitable for the institutions and staff&#34; working in them. Teachers in the School of Music and nonteaching staff at all institutions will continue to be employed under the Public Service Act. </para>
          <para>The Government has recognised the need to provide adequate funds for further education in the Australian Capital Territory and will continue to give this priority consideration. As an indication of what has happened in this area expenditure on the defined government further education system in 1976-77 will total about $16m compared with $ 14m in 1975-76 and $8m in 1974-75. 1 present the following paper: </para>

            <para>- This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> referred to the difficulty of comparing operating deficits or subsidies for various cities. But I believe some comparisons can be made between other capital cities and Canberra. These indicate quite clearly that the operating deficit in the Australian Capital Territory is not substantially greater in any case, and in some cases it is less than in other capital cities. If one takes comparable cities such as Hobart, Launceston and Burnie- those figures have to be taken together and Perth and Canberra then I think it is quite clear that those cities have public transport systems with similar operating deficits. The figures for Sydney and Melbourne, as I indicated earlier in the Senate, in fact are higher than the per capita subsidy in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

              <para>-I think that aspect has to be kept under review. As to the operating deficit, if savings or reductions can be made, I think they ought to be made. But as a senator for the Australian Capital Territory I have to make it clear that I oppose any action which would jeopardise the efficient and effective development of the public transport system in the Australian Capital Territory to serve the people of the Territory. I believe that the arguments I have presented and the figures I have presented indicate that the public transport system here is not unduly subsidised and that is does in fact face special problems. Any reduction in the subsidy might only mean substantial additional costs for roads, parking facilities and other related facilities that go with the development of alternative means of transport. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>In conclusion, I turn to a related but essential question. I refer to comments made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> last week when he offered the Senate &#39;a few thoughts&#39; about Senate procedures. He referred particularly to section 53 of the Constitution in that respect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> concluded by saying that there is nothing in our system of government &#39;that would prevent the development of a practice in this Senate of requiring objectionable items in Appropriation Bills to be reconsidered by the Government&#39;. He went on to say that the Senate should consider &#39;its undoubted constitutional power of request for amendment to be exercised on the appropriate occasion&#39;. I agree that the Senate should indeed consider those matters. But having said that, recognising that Senate Estimates Committees are a vital part of the operation of the Senate and indeed of the Parliament, it raises a very important issue. If any Estimates Committee are to suggest reductions in presenting reports, they will have to present detailed arguments and evidence lying behind the suggestion for a reduction. The hearings of committees will have to be held in such a way that those appearing before the committees- public servants- are given an opportunity to present every aspect of a case even if it means that the committee goes back to a particular subject subsequently. I think in such cases there is also a need for the Committee to give some indication of the scale or the amount of the suggested reduction and some indication of the extent of the over-expenditure or the overestimate of the appropriation as proposed. I raise that point only because it relates essentially to the role of the Estimates Committees in this Senate and to their significance in the parliamentary system and because I think it is an important aspect relating to the comments made by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I think that all of us in the Senate have to consider such factors very carefully. </para>
          <para>I noticed earlier that the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> indicated with respect to earlier comments on the Canberra bus system that the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> has in fact re-examined this proposed expenditure and believes that it is justified. I simply conclude by saying that I agree. </para>

Senator Knight</inline> in his last comments, indicated what may be required by an Estimates Committee in the future. It is interesting for the Senate to note that Estimates Committee E perhaps more than any other committee so far as I know took an initial interest in the activities within the A.C.T. which has not been taken before. Under <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> chairmanship, before Estimates Committee E met formally, it toured the developing areas of the Australian Capital Territory and made itself familiar with the general problems and the developments of this capital city. That was an innovation which ran before the general discussions of Estimates Committee E. </para>

As we have come back into the Committee of the Whole I do not know whether we have seen any particular moderating influence in the volume of debate.

              <para>.

              <para>In addition the Government requested the Interdepartmental Committee on ADP to investigate the potential for rationalisation of computing resources throughout the Service. This formidable task, which involves a number of senior departmental officers, is currently proceeding. The Government also directed that a special Interdepartmental Committee examine the question of the rationalisation of computing resources in the Welfare/Health area- the work of this Committee has been finalised. </para>

In this context the proposed usage of computers by the Department of the Capital Territory was examined and supported by the Id. </para>

              <para>Of significance also is the fact that, in 1974, the Public Service Board made available draft guidelines to departments on the approach to be taken on cost/benefit analyses of ADP systems.

The first such review is currently under way in the Bureau of Meteorology and it is planned to carry out two such reviews each year.

              <para>-Senator McLaren raised several points and I will attempt to answer them. He queried whether responsibility for transport could be transferred to the Department of Administrative Services. I am advised that at the present time a move is under consideration to place control for transport in another area- that means the Department of Administrative Services. This is purely under consideration. In mind are the general moves that are being made towards self-government in the Territory. There is no suggestion of any reduction in the size of the car fleet at the present time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> referred also to hire car plates. For his information, I indicate that 10 additional car hire plates are to be balloted to Australian Capital Territory residents in December this year. The decision to issue these plates is to meet the demand from private sources. It is not for the purpose of taking up any government work. The Department of the Capital Territory does police the limit but, of course, is restricted because of the staff ceilings that are imposed. I am advised that the department is aware that loopholes exist by which some operators function but these are being examined at the present time. I think that I have answered the main questions raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren.</inline></para>

            <para>- I thank the Minister for the answer he has given me. In response to his reply I should like to ask him whether the department could implement some strict safeguards to ensure that the permit holders for hire cars do not in any circumstances use more than one car for the carriage of passengers. If these people are caught using more than one car there ought to be a penalty whereby they lose the licence for the permit they hold. </para>

            <para>- I should like to make a few comments. Prior to the suspension of the sitting I was interested in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> said. He referred to the Public Works Committee and its approval of construction of various works for the Commonwealth. He raised the question of whether it was proper, when the Committee had approved the construction of the National Gallery at an estimated cost of $ 13m, for the cost to rise to over $26m. I am not competent to answer that question but I think it needs some consideration by the legal luminaries in this Senate to determine the actual legal position. The requirement is that all projects costing more than $2m have to be submitted to the Public Works Committee and, of course, they cannot be proceeded with unless they have the Committee&#39;s approval. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Accordingly the Public Works Committee meets to examine the whole project and decides, for example, that it will approve the building of a school, say, at Katherine at an estimated cost of $13m. If that cost escalates to $26m I do not think that it is a project which the Public Works Committee has approved. If the Committee had been aware at the time of its investigations that the project would have cost $26m it may well have been that the Committee would not have approved the project. If that is the correct legal interpretation of the powers of the Government and the operation of the Public Works Committee, it could well be that many projects undertaken and completed in Australia have been undertaken illegally. Perhaps it is a question which the Auditor-General could pick up on the expenditure that has been incurred on a project which required expenditure exceeding that approved by the Public Works Committee due to the fluctuation in cost. Perhaps this matter will never be questioned legally simply because no-one is sufficiently interested in it, even having the power and authority to take it to court. The Government has done something which does not comply with the Act. </para>
          <para>I think it is important to politicians who have agreed to establish a committee that when the committee makes its findings after considering all relevant evidence, those findings should be adhered to. Having made its findings and approving a project costing $13m I do not think that could ever be interpreted as the committee &#39;s approving the project at double the cost. If the original estimate of the project increases I do not think it can be claimed that the Public Works Committee has given its approval for the project. Has the Minister any legal men advising him now who could indicate to the Senate what the position is when we find an escalation in cost, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> has mentioned, and whether the Government has any justification for going on with the project? </para>

            <para>- I rise in response to the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> I recall that when I was Minister for Works and had the responsibility of piloting a new Public Works Committee Act through this Parliament it was then attempted by me to embrace statutory construction committees within the jurisdiction of the Public Works Committee. But that failed and the interpretation that was insisted upon with regard to the ambit of the Public Works Committee investigation was works which were directly undertaken by the executive government of the Commonwealth as distinct from their statutory authorities. This National Gallery having been constructed by the National Capital Development Commission, it escapes the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. It simply goes into the bloc vote of the National Capital Development Commission and, therefore, has no upper limit that is authorised. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is not to be taken from anything that I have said that I agree with the implication of illegality that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> put forward as to a project that undergoes the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee and is approved at $ 13m and can be constructed only at a cost of$26m. In my view, speaking instanter in response to that suggestion, it would be the fact that the increased money would not be authorised except by an Appropriation Bill such as we are passing and then it would become authorised. With regard to the escalation of costs as to particular items both in the Darwin Reconstruction Commission, which has a bloc vote, and the National Capital Development Commission, which has a bloc vote, it may be taken into account in discount of the tedium that I have inflicted on the Committee that we take some credit for having hand spiked out of these bloc votes particular items that do demand scrutiny. A vote beginning at $13m, increasing at this stage to $26 m or $27m- and before it is finished I will guarantee it will be $35m- is an excellent illustration of unpardonable waste of people&#39;s money. </para>

            <para>- I take a little further what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has been saying and ask the Minister: Is $26m a realistic estimate? I ask this because there was considerable speculation last year- more than 12 months ago- that the cost had risen at that time to about $26m. Because of the way this particular project has been proceeding, I find it hard to imagine that a realistic estimate is not perhaps closer to $30m at this stage. When was the estimate of $26m made? </para>

            <para>- Just quickly in response to the points that have been raised, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> &#39;s queries were in general answered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> Projects of the National Capital Development Commission are not scrutinised by the Public Works Committee. The NCDC is a statutory authority and therefore it is exempt from the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. I noticed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright&#39;s</inline> words in relation to a guarantee that the cost will escalate much further. He stated that he views the increases as being quite unpardonable. I doubt very much whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> could hold to that view. I think it is appropriate that he makes the point. But <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> question and my earlier answers which now appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> indicate that the original figure of $ 13m was a 1 973 figure. It is most regrettable that to 30 June 1 976- if I may prompt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> in his question the figure had risen to $26.479m. I had earlier read into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that the original contract in April 1973 was for $ 13.263m, rise and fall adjustments have amounted to $8. 755m and there have been adjustments to provisional quantities. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe another senator commented on the extra work that was required which further increased the figure by $4.46 lm. Earlier this afternoon I indicated to honourable senators the actual increases that had occurred year by year in relation to inflationary tendencies. If my recollection serves me correctly I indicated that inflation alone had raised the figures by 75 per cent or 78 per cent and indeed that since the job had started wages had actually doubled. I suggest that there is good reason to suppose that any work that was running over the same period could well draw the same comment from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> in relation to cost increases being unpardonable. But unfortunately we have that inflationary factor in our society at present. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> knows, the present Government is attempting to alleviate that situation. I thank honourable senators for their comments relating to the Australian Capital Territory. </para>

            <para>- I want to take this matter a bit further because the discussion has not clarified it in my mind. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> raised what I thought was a most interesting point. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> explained that because the National Capital Development Commission is a statutory authority its projects do not come under the scrutiny of the Public Works Committee. This does not fit in with my ideas of what the Committee should be examining. But leaving aside the projects of statutory authorities in which the Public Works Committee does not have a say, there is an Act of this Parliament that states that any work in excess of $2m cannot be proceeded with unless it receives the approval of the Public Works Committee. Take the instance of a school- if we relate the figures <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> used- at Katherine. </para>

              <para>-Take it to be at Canberra as long as the school is built by the Government. This would confuse the issue because it would be built by the statutory authority here, and I like Katherine better than Canberra. Take the case where the Government wants to build a school at Katherine. As it will cost in excess of $2m the project has to go to the Public Works Committee and the school cannot be built unless it receives the approval of the Public Works Committee. That Committee considers the facts. If it has before it a submission that the school would cost $26m it may say that the building of the school does not warrant that expenditure and therefore it would reject the project. But if the Committee had a proposal that the school would cost $13m it may agree to the erection of the school at Katherine at an estimated cost of $ 13m. At no time would the Committee have agreed to the erection of a school at Katherine for $26m. Because the actual cost of erecting the school will be $26m the question I raise is: Did the Committee ever approve of that project and can the project proceed? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> suggested that because the Committee approved of a project costing $ 13m, when it is discovered that the cost will escalate and be much more the approval to proceed comes when we vote the additional appropriation for the project. But I doubt whether that gets over the authorisation of the Public Works Committee. Of course if we did not vote the additional amount at what stage of the construction, after having spent $13m, would the project cease? Before the roof is put on? But the question is whether the project should ever have been commenced. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I can imagine that a department keen to establish a project could underestimate the cost of the project for the purpose of getting Public Works Committee approval. After receiving approval initially, if the project can be proceeded with at any cost that is defeating the purpose of the Public Works Committee Act. There is also the other question: Having received the approval of the Public Works Committee for construction, how much can the department enlarge upon the plan or build additions to the plan without it becoming an unlawful construction? I think this needs serious consideration as to whether it is a legal construction as it would not comply with the project originally approved by the Public Works Committee. I think we should consider whether we need an amendment to the Public Works Committee Act to ensure that construction proceeds only to the extent approved by the Committee. </para>

The example that I am giving of course is that of the Australian National Gallery and the High Court building. The point I am making is that I believe that in the estimating of costs of projects it should be on a fixed cost basis so that when the project comes before the Public Works Committeegiving it a little give-and-take of course- the Committee and the Government should have a somewhat realistic figure for the project. I have given this example only as an indication of why I think the whole matter should be reviewed. </para>

            <para>- I am reticent to cross swords with a former Minister for Construction who undoubtedly would know the situation quite well.  His  views are accepted by this Senate on many occasions. I do not have a copy of the Public Works Committee Act with me, but in retrospect my recollection is that there are probably 2 areas of wording in the Public Works Committee Act which relieve the situation to some extent. I doubt whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> was correct in what he was saying. The Public Works Committee Act refers to proposed work. The very fact that the Committee deals with proposed work means there cannot be a finalisation of costs until the work is completed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other major factor- I am advised by the officers with me that the situation is controlled by the words &#39;work of the Commonwealth&#39;- is that the provisions of the Public Works Committee Act apply to the work of the Commonwealth, and that is generally considered to be work of the executive government and statutory authorities do not not fall into that category. As the expenditure being considered is expenditure by a statutory authority it does not come under the jurisdiction of the Public Works Committee. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> said that if, for instance, at this time we are estimating the cost of a particular work we should be able to envisage what increased costs in the next 3 years or 5 years will do to the price of the contract for that work. I believe that the Department of Construction or whichever authority is attempting to estimate the value of the work would find it impossible to envisage what the additional costs would be in the next 3 years or 5 years. Also, it is a general requirement of Treasury that we should deal with the cost factor as it is known at present. </para>
          <para>We should remember that 5 years or 6 years ago there would have been a small escalation in costs with the rate of inflation running at 2 per cent, or 3 per cent or 4 per cent. Inflation has been running at the rate of 15 per cent, 16 per cent and 17 per cent, and I note that in Britain today there is an inflation rate of 25 per cent. With inflation running at such rates one could readily say that it would be impossible to give an accurate figure for the cost of work which is to proceed for 3 year or 4 years. I suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> that we must deal with the factors as they are known today. When the work on the National Gallery was commenced in 1973 the estimated cost was $13m. With the escalating costs and the additional work involved, the present figure that I have given does not seem to be a long way out of line. </para>

            <para>- I accept the Minister&#39;s advice on this matter, but the point I am making, as I did before, is that there is a client department. To me it seems quite wrong that a client department can come in after the cost of a project has been given and ask for variations to be made to the project. Let me take as an example the Canberra court building. In that case there was a request for security provisions. I do not know what the cost was, but I am sure that it must have run into hundreds of thousands of dollars. All I am suggesting is that when a project is being put forward the whole cost should be indicated. It should not be open to a client department to come forward later, after a project has been funded and commenced, and ask for variations to the project which cost a considerable sum. That is what I am complaining about. </para>

            <para>- I still disagree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> that it would be possible to achieve the situation which he has suggested. I understand that for all works costing more than $6m the contracting authority accepts a rise and fall provision. When the cost rises we may be unhappy, but when it falls we may be happy. It may be of interest for honourable senators to note that prices for contracts which are coming in at present are very much below some government estimates for the work. There is a real return to competitive tendering at present. </para>

          <para>I doubt whether I can answer accurately the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt.</inline> He asked at what point a particular work was authorised. One would be inclined to say that authorisation comes when the appropriation for the particular work is made by the Parliament. It must be realised that a general works program is approved. After a particular work has been authorised to commence and in fact has commenced, undoubtedly our financial authority, the </para>
          <para>Treasury, would keep control over reasonable increases in expenditure that would occur. However, it would do this taking into account the fact that Parliament had authorised to an extent the works program that was to be undertaken. One of the documents supporting the Budget deals with the works program. If I can obtain any further information on this particularly interesting point which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> has raised I will attempt to do so. </para>

          <para class="block">In speaking briefly to that motion I refer to the fact that this is a matter with some not inconsiderable history, and I believe it would be useful to retrace it. A few years ago, but not very long ago, the Senate decided to establish Estimates Committees. I think that in the belief of the majority of the members of the Senate and of the public the Estimates Committees have fulfilled a useful task. They have served a role which has been developing. It has been rewarding in the total way in which the Senate can fulfil its function of scrutiny of government expenditure. When the Estimates Committees were established they did not extend their examination to the special appropriations. Their examination related only to the ordinary annual services appropriations which now appear in the Appropriation Bills and constitute a fraction under 40 per cent of the Budget. The special appropriations constitute just a fraction more than 60 per cent of total Commonwealth expenditure. At the moment that 60 per cent of expenditure is not subject to any form of scrutiny by the Senate. It is clearly the Senate&#39;s constitutional responsibility to exercise scrutiny of that expenditure. It is the opinion of Estimates Committee F, as expressed in its report to this Committee, that the Senate should consider expanding the role of Estimates Committees to enable them to fulfil their constitutional duty. </para>
          <para>I refer to the fact that the Joint Committee on the Parliamentary Committee System was set up by the Parliament. That Committee considered, among other things, the role of the Senate Estimates committees and recommended in accordance with the motion which I have moved. I refer also to the Coombs report which made a similar suggestion. So the position is that there is a series of recommendations by people who have given consideration to the role of the Parliament, the role of this chamber and the need for an expanded scrutiny of the expenditure of the Executive that this sort of move should be undertaken to give the Estimates committees a full time function, some full time staff, a power to examine the special Appropriation Bills and a power to examine the statutory authorities which are not departments of State. </para>

              <para>-I will take bids for a while. There is a very large number. I think the number is something like 120 at the moment. Most of them, while subject to audit, are not subject to scrutiny by the Parliament. Therefore, the situation is that while there may not be matters which are in breach of Treasury Rules or which are in breach of auditing practice there is no way for this Parliament to know whether the taxpayer is getting value for money or whether the policy adopted and implemented by those statutory authorities is in the best interests of the people or is providing a reasonable return for the taxpayer&#39;s dollar. There is a variety of types of statutory authorities. I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> when debating this matter a few days ago, referred to the different types. This matter has been discussed a number of times during the course of the proceedings of Committee F. I do not propose to deal with it at greater length because I believe that there have been indications not only from the Leader of the Government in the Senate but also from other senators on both sides of a general support for the expression of an opinion that we should now proceed, in the development of the Senate&#39;s role, to the stage of ensuring that Estimates committees are able to undertake a much fuller role than they have so far undertaken in their developmental period. </para>

            <para>- I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> motion. We have had ample evidence of concern expressed on both sides of the chamber about the Estimates with which the Parliament deals. It is quite incredible that roughly SI 1.5 billion escapes the particular scrutiny of Parliament. I believe that we are protectors of the taxpayers. For that amount of revenue to escape the attention and close scrutiny of the Parliament, I think, is quite inexcusable. It is high time something was done about it. The motion requests the Committee to endorse the principle that the Senate should expand its role to examine the special appropriations and to examine in far greater detail the expenditure of statutory authorities. I was a member of Senate Estimates Committee F. We drew attention, in a fairly mild way, to the Auditor-General&#39;s report. Page 2 of our report states: </para>

I believe the Standing Orders Committee has a responsibility to examine the matters raised in this motion. I hope that it would bring back a report to the Senate fairly quickly. I am looking forward to that report. I am anxious that the motion be supported by the Standing Orders Committee and that something constructive be done to ensure that this incredible amount that goes through the Executive&#39;s hands comes under more direct scrutiny of the Parliament. </para>

            <para>- There has been general agreement with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> proposed in the Senate on a previous occasion and with what he formalised by way of a motion tonight. If the motion is adopted it will lead to a substantial extension of the role of the Senate. For that reason we believe that the motion ought to be the subject of substantial debate in the Senate. The second paragraph of the motion states: </para>

          <para class="block">That will allow for substantial debate on the proposition. In the meantime we on this side of the chamber can collectively discuss the matter. </para>
          <para>If there are any differences of opinion we may come to a common decision on the matter. It would not be feasible to adjourn the Committee proceedings. Besides, we do not wish to adjourn debate on the proposition. However, we could take some steps after the Committee reported. Even that would be inclined to hold up what we consider to be a proposition worth while discussing and considering. The Opposition agrees with the substance of the proposal. We perhaps do not agree with the detail that may flow from it, but surely the Standing Orders Committee will put us on the right track. </para>

          <para class="block">I have experienced difficulty during the Estimates debates in getting information on government expenditure on official establishments. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> was able to give a breakdown on some of the establishments; yet when I pursued the matter on the Estimates Committees I was told by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> that it was the policy of the Government not to give a breakdown. So we have a conflict. Another matter on which I sought clarification was the Governor-General&#39;s office. I also asked whether funds were made available to the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation out of a special trust account. I was not told anything. I was not given any answers. The Leader of the Government in the Estimates Committees said: No answer&#39;. I hope that when the Standing Orders Committee looks at the motion it will be able to recommend that the Parliament ought to be able to investigate all avenues of expenditure as has been set out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> in subparagraph ( 1 ) (c) of this motion. </para>

            <para>-The Government is interested in and attracted by the proposition that is contained in the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> and supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> and many other senators, including apparently Opposition senators, in broad terms. There can be no doubt that the Senate has the power to engage in the investigation of special appropriations or of the funding of statutory authorities and commissions. As the Estimates Committee F report clearly points out, it has already established that right, if indeed there was any doubt about it. The only question that arises is whether the resolutions setting up Estimates Committees should be expanded in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> proposes in the motion. </para>

              <para>- I think the fact remains that the Committees as they are now would have to be changed either by a change in the resolutions setting them up or by a change in the Standing Orders. It is appropriate that the question should be referred to the Standing Orders Committee in the first place. There may well be some practical difficulties in regard to certain aspects of the motion, but they can be considered by the Standing Orders Committee, which of course will report to the Senate. There will be the opportunity for the full debate in the Senate which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> believes- I am sure we would all agree- is appropriate for such an extension of the activities of the Estimates Committees. </para>

          <para>In my view the Estimates Committees have proved to be one of the most notable initiatives that the Senate has taken in recent years. It is an initiative which is not fully appreciated outside the Senate. Other activities of the Senate, particularly our standing committees and select committees, have attracted far more public attention; but in my view the greatest exercise of responsibility on the part of the Senate is and has been portrayed in the Estimates Committees. Despite some doubts in the minds of some members of the Senate when these committees were first step up, they have undoubtedly proved to be most effective. The scrutiny each year has proved more extensive and more valuable, and in my experience the reports of the Estimates Committees each year have proved themselves in their content and their penetration. The reports of the Estimates Committees on this year&#39;s Appropriation Bills are clear proof of what I am saying. I cannot remember such depth of consideration of the Estimates being revealed before as it has been in these reports. The proposal that has emanated from Estimates Committee F and now is embodied in the motion before this Committee is one which summarises the advances which has been made by the Senate through the Estimates Committees. </para>
          <para>The proposition is one in which I have said the Government is most interested. It believes that it would be quite suitable for the proposition to be considered by the Standing Orders Committee. Hopefully some valuable extension of the Estimates Committee &#39;s work will emanate from that consideration. However, that is perhaps taking matters a little beyond the present motion, which simply seeks to express a broad opinion of this place. As I have said, the Government will support the motion and it will look forward with interest to further discussion of the matter in the Standing Orders Committee and in the Senate. </para>

Such authorities include the Australian Industry Development Corporation, the Australian National Line and even the Commonwealth Bank, which have received Commonwealth Government funding. They fall within the general definition of &#39;Government funded authorities&#39; whether they are receiving funding each year or not. They have been established by and receive some funding or some funding support from the Commonwealth Government. As I understand it, that is what it means.

            <para>- I rise tonight on a very serious matter on which I hope the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> will be able to provide prompt information. I have been approached by the staff employed in fire control duties at the Concord Repatriation Hospital. They are concerned that because of what I deem false and dangerous economy 5 extremely competent fire control officers are to be absorbed into what is known as a patrol and gatekeeper&#39;s section. Four of them have had ample training from the New South Wales fire brigade. The fifth member would have received the same experience in the Royal Australian Navy. Due to some peculiar concept of economy, it is not impossible that in the event of an outbreak of fire at 2 o&#39;clock in the morning the particular fire officer, who until now used to be completely specialised and would be in the control office at the entrance to the Concord Hospital- I believe that the Minister is aware of the geography of the hospital- could be on mortuary duty and a corpse may have to be moved in the early hours of the morning. That shows how stupid this matter is. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I will take it a little further. I am sure that many honourable senators have seen the very effective film <inline font-style="italic">The Towering Inferno.</inline> If it proved nothing else, it showed how a minor malfunction if unattended could create a complete inferno. It would be wrong to say that, with a modern sprinkler system and relatively modern wards, that could not happen at that hospital. I have here a map of the hospital. I know that it is not possible to incorporate it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> but it shows the auxiliary buildings in red. It is no use honourable senators who sit behind the Minister trying to brush these matters aside. I live in the area. I know the genuine fears of the patients and staff. The fact is that from 0600 hours to 2030 hours this particular fire control will not be manned. Let us get this matter into its right perspective. Nobody has suggested that these S specialists would be able to control a fire on their own. The control centre communicates with the New South Wales fire brigades in the various adjacent western suburbs of Sydney. It is not a question of being like a slips fields man and staying there all afternoon without a catch. If one looks at the statistics one finds that they had to investigate a total of 132 calls. Some were false but 23 calls were genuine. They could be merely a matter of a fuse fire or something like that. This is a difficult situation where probably the Hospital Employees Federation is an all grades union. I do not doubt that a small specialised unit within that union may not have the full concern of the union because it has to look after all its members who are defined as patrolmen. </para>
          <para>Without reflecting on anybody&#39;s physical fitness, I say that you cannot make a Melbourne Cup winner out of a Clydesdale. The fact is that the other men there are not fit. I do not want to jeopardise anybody&#39;s job but some of the men who may have to operate a fire tender do not have a car licence. They are a mixture and one can hope that one of those men will exhibit some aptitude to handle the situation. As I understand this particular establishment, there are numerous hydrants to examine. There is a host of other appliances to be looked after. I would like to know what the Government thinks it will save in the event of a tragic fire. Honourable senators should reflect on the statistics: There are 600 portable extinguishers, 109 external hydrants, and there are fire tenders and other equipment. I say respectfully that it would not matter if one of those officers on the entire shift from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. according to the roster did nothing. Perhaps in the slips field analogy he is waiting there. The nearest I can get to that using a railway analogy is that if there is a pilot locomotive standing by ready for an emergency it may be argued whether its using fuel is economical. I say that it is not. </para>
          <para>I know that discussions were held today. We know from experience all over the world that some minor neglect can create a major disaster in a hospital. There have been fires in this hospital and it has been the expertise of these men that has kept them to a minimum. But there is a much more sinister implication in all this. I am not going to name him, but one senior officer is alleged to have said- honourable senators will notice how legally minded I have become as that phrase is often tossed around by Ministers- that he agrees that what those particular fire officers say does jeopardise the hospital but he says: &#39;Do not worry because when it comes out in the Press the New South Wales fire brigades will have to provide greater protection&#39;. I hope that this matter will get into the Sydney newspapers tomorrow and will stir bureaucrats of the Concord Repatriation Hospital. I do not intend to remain silent. If there is any demarkation dispute between the New South Wales Fire Commission and an establishment like the Concord Repatriation Hospital I do not want to see a fire of the dimensions of the <inline font-style="italic">Towering Inferno</inline> film which I am sure some honourable senators have seen. So I make this appeal to the Minister. I know he has said that he does not want to interfere too much with his subordinates, but we are dealing with a fire risk. These dedicated officers have proved their efficiency in the past. I leave the matter to the Minister. </para>
          <para>I now want to turn to the matter of employment and industrial relations. Honourable senators are aware that on the Estimates Committee where I substituted for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> I raised the question of whether arbitration inspectors were being effectively deployed. I give credit to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack-</inline> I always give credit where it is deserved- for supplying me very smartly with an answer to the allegations I made about the wrongdoing of a certain concessionaire at the Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport. I refer to the duty free gift shop. The department, in its own very cool language, conceded that $25,000 was involved in under-payment of wages. This matter has a long history going back to the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robert</inline> Cotton was the Minister for Civil Aviation. I mentioned to him that I had suspicions about certain concessionaires, and he assured me as late as today that on that occasion he had told all concerned to make sure there were no award breaches. I know that some honourable senators will ask: &#39;What is the trade union doing?&#39; I say this to honourable senators that if that happened in the mines, the railways or the building industry they would know in the first 48 hours or earlier whether a man was a member of a union within the industry. In the context of civil liberties, I know that if a girl started working at a kiosk there selling newspapers for a newspaper agency, if the union approached her within the first hour some honourable senators would say that that was trade unionism gone mad. The difficulty is that there are unscrupulous employers who are able to do these things. </para>
          <para>In fairness to the response which the Minister gave me I should say that the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> picked up the story on the Monday, and my phone has been running hot with all sorts of people giving me the inside story. I asked a further question yesterday and was told about the magnitude of the operations of the inspectors. If a person a bit short of cash were to pinch a Club chocolate or something from the counter he would be in court in Sydney the next day and his name would be in the newspapers. I will not have that man who is running the duty free shop being wrapped up in cotton wool, because my telephone informants tell me that he has a Melbourne connection and a Perth connection. If I were sitting where <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> is sitting I would have had the man in front of me in 48 hours and I would have called the Minister for Transport, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> in with him. I would have said to the chap: &#39;If you do not pay that money in the next 48 hours your concession is finished&#39;. As a matter of fact, before I am finished with this case I am determined to know the name of this man who has bled people white over the last few years. I say to the officers sitting behind the Minister that it is not good enough for them to give me this claptrap and tell me that there are so many thousands of people working under Federal awards. Arbitration inspectors know and I know that if those people were effectively deployed you would get to the root of the trouble. During the hearings of the Estimates Committee I said that any arbitration inspector who operates in those manufacturing industries which have trade union representation and shop stewards is not being gainfully employed. </para>
          <para>I have another fear. I think it was <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> who referred to certain arbitration inspectors being grounded in Tasmania. I was told late today that something similar had occurred in Newcastle. Because of staff ceilings and general economies the inspectors were not kept at their desk. I think the Senate will agree with me when I say that, as far as this matter is concerned, I am satisfied that when the Department says that an amount of $25,000 is involved in fact a larger sum is involved. I do not blame <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> personally. I am determined to see that the name of any person who pinches a newspaper or a block of chocolate at an airport has his name recorded at the central police court hearings. I am determined that the name of the man who has this concession is brought to light. Just today we dealt with a motion seeking to set up a select committee to look at Queenstown. That is a very laudable proposal. It may be necessary for me to move to set up a select committee to look at whether those people who are successful with their tenders for government establishments know their obligations to society. I leave the Minister with a very serious point. Amongst the mass of information that I received was the report about a very honest accountant who worked for that particular concessionaire. </para>

            <para>- I refer the Committee to division 526 which deals with repatriation hospitals and other institutions. I was a member of the Estimates Committee that presented this report. I would like to inform the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> that since the Committee met I have been informed by some wives of ex-servicemen in South Australia, who have a disability caused by psychiatric conditions, that in South Australia there is a reluctance on the part of the repatriation hospital at Daw Park to admit such ex-servicemen. In discussing the matter with the families concerned, I put forward the view that perhaps it is due to the fact that new concepts are held by the medical staffs who currently argue that such people, as far as possible, ought to be accommodated in community environments and conditions. Nevertheless, they have told me that they intend to send me evidence of particular cases in which they think that because of family circumstances an ex-serviceman should have been admitted by the medical officer immediately, as was the case formerly. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am not sure whether that practice is a new trend, but I put it to the Minister in order that he might tell us whether he can make a general observation that a new procedure has been adopted by the medical staffs of the hospital wherein they may say that those people can be left in the community for a longer period. If that is the case, I think we ought to be told about it. I inform the Minister, in case he requires me to produce particular instances, that I have been told of the cases I have mentioned by the organisation comprised of the people concerned. Perhaps the Minister might indicate to the Senate whether perhaps any new procedure along the lines I have mentioned are currently being observed and whether those procedures are satisfactory. We probably have to see how they operate over a period of time. But at least I can tell the Minister that the wives of these ex-servicemen are very concerned because their husbands could not be admitted to the hospital as quickly as they have been in the past; they were returned to their homes. I would be pleased to hear the observations of the Minister after he has consulted with his officers about that matter. </para>

            <para>- I shall deal first of all with the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill.</inline> I must say that the honourable senator could not have gone further in attracting my goodwill than by raising these matters at this stage rather than during the adjournment debate later this evening, as he knows my reluctance to stay here beyond the appointed hour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Mulvihill referred to the fire officers at the Concord Repatriation Hospital. The position is that some discussions have been held with those officers by departmental officers in Sydney with a view to considering some extension of their duties in regard to the mortuary, but not to the extent to which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> perhaps believed they were to be extended and it was certainly not intended to extend them in the sense that he conveyed in his remarks earlier this evening to the Committee. </para>
          <para>The position is that fire officers are employed at that hospital. I think there are 5 of them in all. A very important service is provided at the Concord Repatriation Hospital in Sydney and also in the Repatriation General Hospital at Heidelberg in Victoria. I understand that this service is not commonly provided even in major hospitals, and that it is rather a special service which is provided, because ordinarily local fire services provided by state fire brigades are available to perform these types of duties. However, as the Senate would know, as part of general government policy in relation to staff ceilings, we intended to nave a hard look at the utilisation of all public servants, wherever they may be employed. That, of course, includes people employed by those hospitals run by my Department. Therefore those areas in which some saving in staff could be effected were matters for consideration. It was simply that type of review which led the departmental officers in Sydney to have regard to the actual duties that were being performed by these fire officers at Concord. It was thought that some extension of their duties might well be possible, entirely consistent with the discharge of their major responsibility as fire officers. </para>
          <para>The proposal put to them in the form of a request, I understand, was whether they would be prepared to open the mortuary and to record the names and details of the bodies being entered into the mortuary. No other duties were required to be performed by them. There was no suggestion that they would be required to take any further action in regard to bodies after they were entered. That was a matter for discussion. As I understand it, the discussions are still going on. I think the question that was raised was how far people employed as fire officers might be expected to perform duties of that kind. That is the long and the short of the matter. </para>
          <para>If people on duty are not apparently fully engaged in the duties for which they are primarily employed and if they are prepared to do other work, of course, that could be and would be beneficial. However, that is as far as it has gone and the matter is still under consideration. I have no further information at this stage. </para>
          <para>As to the matter of a concessionaire at Sydney (Kingsford-Smith) Airport, in reply to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> yesterday I did give a good deal of general information about the Commonwealth arbitration inspectorate generally, the problems it faces and the methods it adopts in trying to cope with its very extensive responsibilities in policing the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. In giving that general information I hope I did not convey to the Committee any cavalier attitude at all in respect of the specific matter at the Sydney airport. I am sure I said- and if I did not I certainly want to emphasise it now- that close investigations are being conducted in relation to alleged breaches at the airport. As I said yesterday, I am not in a position to identify anybody although it may be that certain people, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> says, are well known to him and to others but I do not wish to identify anybody publicly because the investigation has not been completed. The Committee would appreciate that quite a deal of information has to be obtained from various people, time sheets have to be checked and so on. </para>
          <para>I was interested in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> &#39;s comment that an accountant who had been employed by a person who was under investigation had been to see him. I would suggest to the accountant and I would suggest also to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> that the accountant should make such information available to the proper authority, namely the inspectors who are conducting the investigation. As far as I am concerned I have confidence in those investigations and I certainly would not expect the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> himself or his colleague, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> to start becoming involved in such investigations as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> seemed to be suggesting. Certainly once those investigations are completed I will make the information available to the Senate but at this stage there is nothing further I can say in relation to the matter except that the inspectorate is specifically concerned with the problem and is endeavouring to complete its investigations as soon as possible. </para>

              <para>asked whether there has been a change in policy concerning the admission of psychiatric patients to the Repatriation General Hospital at Daw Park in South Australia. Apparently some complaints have been made to him by the wives of such patients who believe there may have been a change in policy. I am not aware of any change. Certainly none has been brought to my attention for my consideration. I have checked with one of my advisers who is present here this evening and whom I would have expected to be in a position to know if there had been a change in policy and he is not aware of any, but of course I shall have the matter fully investigated and hopefully be in a position to make a statement in a day or two. </para>

            <para>- I have just a brief observation because I know my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> up at the other end wants to get a strike. I have 2 points. I want the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> to appreciate that. I do not want this question of the fire fighters to be dealt with in the dimensions of the Concord Repatriation Hospital. The Minister referred, too, to the hospital at Heidelberg. There is virtually no industry adjacent to that hospital. The big fear of the people at the Concord Repatriation Hospital is that a fire at the hospital could coincide with a fire at any of the S major industrial factories located within 2 miles of the hospital. I live in the area. It is the Parallax subdivision of the Lowe electorate. The factories include Imperial Chemicals at Homebush Bay, a timber yard, Berger Paints, the gasworks, Gordon&#39;s Cranes- a foundry. They are the fire dangers outside the hospital. </para>

            <para class="block">REPORT OF FIRE PROTECTION MEASURES AT RGH CONCORD AND PROPOSED AMENDMENTS TO SAME </para>
            <para>On Wednesday the 3 November 1976 a meeting of Hospital Patrol Officers and Fire Officers was convened. The Hospital Management, at this meeting informed those present that it intended to integrate the Fire Control into the Patrol and Gatekeepers Section. </para>
            <para>In our opinion this would be a retrograde step, as at the present the Fire Control is manned by  S  experienced men. These being 2 Senior Firemen, 1 Captain, 1 Second Class Fireman all of whom received their training with the N.S. W. Fire Brigade and 1 Naval Fireman who received training in the RAN. These men maintain over 600 portable extinguishers, 109 external hydrants, a fire tender and other equipment in first class order. They also continuously man the Fire Control Watch room, where the Fire Alarm Console is situated, this console automatically contacts the state brigade as well as alerting the Hospital Fireman and indicating to him the position of any fire. Under the proposed new scheme the Watch room would be unmanned from 0600 until 2030 hours daily. The (Fireman Patrolman) being on gate duty 120 metres away. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>A real danger of loss of life by fire exists at this establishment due to the large number of patients and living in staff housed in weatherboard buildings. At the present time after the receipt of a call we are in attendance in a few minutes and although the N.S.W. Fire Brigade respond with all speed, the time lag through no fault of their own is too long. There are a number of factors to be considered, the local station may be elsewhere, they could be involved in an accident or have mechanical trouble etc. </para>
          <para>If as proposed the two sections are amalgamated the Hospital Fire Officers would be expected to tram the Patrol Officers as Firemen, some of these men are over 60 years of age, others are approaching 60 while others do not have a drivers licence. Yet they at times would be in charge of fire fighting operations. Since the 1 January 1976 the Fire Control has attended 97 calls, 14 of which directly involved fire. The remainder were a combination of false alarms, or investigations of smoke, smells of burning, etc. All fires in this hospital have been extinguished by the hospital fireman before the arrival of outside assistance, a number of these most certainly would have taken hold only for the alarm system alerting the fireman on duty and his immediate response. </para>
          <para>Under the new system a fully trained man may not be on duty at all. The hospital has the largest fire alarm system in the Southern Hemisphere, incorporated in this is a Reich el Thermal Detection System with approximately 9000 Detectors, Smoke detectors a Minerva CO2 system and a Sprinkler System. </para>
          <para>We would like to point out that with the exception of the Sprinkler and CO2 System that the main system in this establishment only give a warning of fire. Without a continuous vigil in the Watch room this is nullified. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition opposes this Bill with more enthusiasm than I would have thought the Senate could have mustered tonight. It is a most complex piece of legislation involving amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act dealing with rules relating to elections in trade unions. The Bill has been introduced both in the House of Representatives and the Senate, accompanied by a great deal of noisy rhetoric about the desirability of having democracy in trade unions. That has become like motherhood- a cliche in all industrial debates in this Parliament. It has been used with great abundance by the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> in his second reading speech. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The amendments which the Bill basically proposes deal with the question of elections of officers of trade unions and employer organisations. They make changes to the definition of the term &#39;office&#39; as it appears in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The essential feature of the legislation is to introduce a system of collegiate voting as an alternative to the present direct system of voting for union officials who are appointed on a full time basis. There are a number of quite peculiar features of the details of this legislation to which I shall refer in the course of my remarks. </para>
          <para>The whole exercise in terms of an amendment to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act displays yet another example of the Government&#39;s shooting from the hip in its industrial relations policy. Its accompaniment of pious statements of intent with sloppy legislation I believe does not even achieve the result which the Government sets out to achieve. In this case, quite clearly the Government has bowed to minority pressure groups in the trade union movement- minority pressure groups which the Government correctly believes would be supporters of the Government in any political situation and would only criticise the Government for its shortcomings of conservatism. In addition, the legislation displays a confused and weak policy. It ignores the real issues of industrial relations which, for example, were raised very directly by the Premier of New South Wales yesterday as reported in today&#39;s newspapers. The real issues of industrial relations in Australia are not necessarily the methods of election of union officials or catering for the wishes of minority interests in trade unions. They are the issues of a unified system of industrial relations, the Commonwealth industrial relations power and union amalgamation. These are more important questions than the questions the Government has attempted to grapple with in this much heralded legislation. Since this Government came to office, we have seen a number of attempts to exorcise what the Government believes to be the devils of the industrial relations system, namely, militant trade union officials. We had the secret ballot legislation earlier this year the effectiveness of which, in our view, will be very doubtful. It was legislation which really just attacked false objectives in order to give some impression of activity in the area of the conciliation and arbitration system. </para>
          <para>With regard to the question of union elections, the present system of voting for office holders is by direct vote of members of the union in respect of the election of full time officials. I think that is a simple and correct statement of the effects of the existing legislation introduced in 1973 by the Labor Government. That system has never been tested in any real sense because the unions which were required to alter their rules to introduce a system of direct voting for their officials had until the end of November this year to carry out the necessary alterations to their rules. A lot of them had done so with very little complaint and a lot of them had done so with some degree of complaint. I agree completely with the Minister when he says in his second reading speech that of course there are differences of opinion in our community. There are differences of opinion within the trade union movement and within employer organisations operating in the industrial field as to the desirability of alternative systems of voting for the election of officials. It is interesting to note that in 1973 when the Labor Government introduced the legislation providing for direct election of officials, it was not voted against or opposed by the then Opposition which now finds it a subject of condemnation and necessarily requiring change in the year 1976. In the 1973 debate in the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> the present Prime Minister, said, referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron, the then Minister for Labor: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Minister is going to a very considerable length to see that union officials are properly elected- democratically elected- by their unions. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That was the view of the present Prime Minister in 1973 of the existing legislation. All through the election campaigns which followed in 1974 and in 1975, references were made by people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and later by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street</inline> to the desirability of membership control of trade unions. The secret ballot legislation which was introduced in June of this year, poorly drawn up as it was, was put forward as another example of the Government&#39;s intention and concern to introduce a greater degree of democracy into the affairs of trade unions. Now we have a further attempt. As I said earlier, it is of course justified by a great deal of empty rhetoric. For example, the Minister, in his second reading speech, begins with these words: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>All members of the Parliament are, I am sure, committed to democratic control of trade unions and employer organisations. The cornerstone of democratic control is membership participation. The essential question is how to provide for the fullest participation of membership in a manner which recognises the structural diversity of organisations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Now it all sounds very fine, I must admit. All of us are in favour of all that and share that view, but when it is analysed, of course, it means nothing. When it is analysed in terms of the legislation now before the Senate, it means even less than nothing if that be possible. As I said earlier, we can all argue the merits and demerits of various systems. There has been lobbying, of course, on all sides for various systems to be introduced. It has been common knowledge in industrial relations circles in this country for a period of about 6 months that it was the Government&#39;s intention to reintroduce as an alternative to direct election a system of collegiate elections. Union officials have told me that. Union officials have openly discussed that fact because some of them have been told by representatives of the Government that this would happen. Of course, it has happened at the death knock, in November 1976, right at the time when the 3-year period for alteration to rules expired. </para>
          <para>I should like to give some attention to specific matters quite distinct from the statement of intent which the Minister makes in his second reading speech. It is our contention that not only is this legislation sloppy and ill conceived but also it will in fact achieve results which are directly contrary to that past statement of intent which I read from the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. I should like to take up one point of clarity. It is not even clear from the legislation whether the provisions which the Government now seeks to introduce apply to the election of branch officials. It is not clear because in different parts of the legislation- I will refer to this at the Committee stage- the word &#39;organisation&#39; is used and in other parts the word &#39; branch &#39; is used. It is not clear whether the principle which the Minister enunciates applies both to elections for organisations and for branches themselves. We can deal with that at the Committee stage. </para>
          <para>The first fundamental criticism we make is that by denying or offering an alternative system to direct rank and file elections of full time officials, the Government is not only going back on its stated intentions but it is also catering to a rather 1 890-ish view of how trade unions operate because it is expressed by the Minister that the fear the Government has is that the majority of members of a union situated in one State might in fact control the committee of management of that union to the detriment of its members in a smaller State. I find that an extraordinarily interesting contention which is totally unsubstantiated by evidence. Nowhere in the course of debate in the House of Representatives, nowhere in remarks the Minister has made as yet and nowhere in my experience has there been a situation of a trade union in which the committee of management was controlled entirely by representatives of a State which had the largest membership to the exclusion of members of the committee of management from a smaller State. Nowhere have I struck an organisation in that situation and nowhere has one been referred to which can justify the contention which has been made. </para>
          <para>We see the proposal as fundamentally undemocratic in terms of the sort of intentions which the Government itself has stated in the past. We were told only a few months ago how important it was to have a secret ballot for all members of trade unions. The important emphasis which was stressed by Government Ministers at that time was the involvement of the members of the union themselves in those elections. It seems to us strange that at this stage in a variety of ways the members of the unions will no longer be directly involved in the election of their officials. True, they will participate in the election of an electorate college in some circumstances and that itself is subject to qualification. The second point that I want to make in specific terms is the alteration to the definition of &#39;office&#39; in the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. </para>
          <para>The word &#39;office&#39; has been the subject of much debate and interpretation in the Commonwealth Industrial Court and, indeed, in a different context in the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. The danger that we see in the alteration which is now made is that under the proposed alteration an appointed administrative officer of a union will be able to operate and, in fact, perform almost identical functions to the functions which are performed by an elected officer. It is one of the grave difficulties which an elected officer of a trade union faces and one of the grave responsibilities which he assumes that by virtue of his office and his election he is entitled to do certain things; indeed, he is bound to do certain things. But to arrive at a definition of the word office&#39; which in fact allows an appointed administrative officer to perform many of the functions which are now exclusively reserved for an elected officer in our view is fraught with dangers in terms of the much vaunted democratic principle which is enunciated in the second reading speech. </para>
          <para>It is interesting to note, of course, that the second reading speech is very different from the one made in the House of Representatives. When this legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives the Government had not made up its mind about it or, rather, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Santamaria</inline> had not made up the Government&#39;s mind about it. It was during the course of the debate in the House of Representatives that various additional amendments were moved at the instigation of certain sections of the trade union movement. Amendments were introduced in the House of Representatives halfway through the debate and it is to these in particular that I wish to refer. On page 3 of the Minister&#39;s second reading speech reference is made to the constitution of the electoral college which will elect officers of an organisation. This provision which might be described is a self-perpetuating provision may have had great appeal to the Hapsburgs and may, indeed, have great appeal to the National Civic Council. But in terms of democratic elections and the dynamics of an industrial organisation, it is a most extraordinary provision. The reason given by the Government for abolishing multi-tier elections seems to us to be totally inconsistent with this provision which is now included and referred to in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. What is that provision? It is stated by the Minister in these terms:  . . the Government&#39;s policy is to ensure that management reflects rank and file views. </para>
          <para class="block">That is a good statement. It is unobjectionable. The Minister states further: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>What the Government proposes, therefore, is that current office holders from time to time can be members of the college which elects persons to those offices for the following term, provided that those office bearers do not constitute more than 15 per cent of the members of the college. Those office bearers must have been elected originally to the college and by the college to those positions or, alternatively, to those positions by a direct voting system and must have held office continuously, though not necessarily the same office, since being first elected to office. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That provision is designed to protect current office holders in certain unions, such as the Federated Clerks Union. For example, if one looks at - </para>

              <para>- Well, senator, it is not absolute rot. It is absolute Jack Maynes. I will tell <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> about him if she wants to say that he is rot. He has been on the federal council of the Federated Clerks Union for 22 years without having had to face an election. If you, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters,</inline> want to get up afterwards and tell us that it is rot or alternatively, that it is democratic or alternatively, that it is consistent with the Government&#39;s pious statements of intention about democratising- if that is the correct word -industrial organisations, then I will be very glad to hear about it. But it is not rot. It is a fact and it may be, if we have to persist with the word used by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters,</inline> that there is something rotten in the state of Denmark, or in the Federated Clerks Union, which this Government wants to protect. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> will be a party to that no doubt when she puts up her hand at the appropriate time. The point I am concerned to make, which has apparently stirred <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> to some extent, is that this provision gives 15 per cent of an electoral college to persons who fall within the Government&#39;s stated description of being current office holders who reflect experience and so on. The Government has expressed its concern by introducing at a late stage this amendment in the House of Representatives. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The next point that should be made is that by the amendments to section 17  ID,  to which the Minister refers, the Government has embarked on a restrictive course in relation to the powers of the Commonwealth Industrial Court following a reconstitution of what is described in the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act as an in validly constituted organisation. The Senate may recall that following problems which developed in the case of <inline font-style="italic">Moore</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Doyle</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Sweeney was appointed as a committee of inquiry into industrial organisations. He made recommendations which led to section 17  Id  being included in the legislation. The purpose of that was so that in determining a matter where an invalidity had arisen, the Industrial Court could make certain orders about the system of elections which unions should have. By this amendment- we will discuss it further in the Committee stages- the Court would be restricted in doing this. I should make the point in passing of course that the section to which I have referred recently survived a challenge in the High Court. </para>
          <para>But more significantly the point about this amendment- it is a similar point to the one which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters,</inline> who has lost interest in this debate, described earlier on as rot- is that its effect has a direct bearing on a case currently being dealt with by the Commonwealth Industrial Court in which a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Egan</inline> features, I understand together with a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Harradine</inline> who now, wearing his second hat, appears in this chamber tonight. The effect of that amendment to section 17  Id  is to have a decided influence on the possible outcome of the case before the Industrial Court. It is to our mind a matter of great regret that the Government has seen fit to yield to the pressures which have undoubtedly been put upon it in relation to that matter. </para>
          <para>I reiterate our fundamental objections in these terms: The legislation seeks, in the terminology of the Minister, to introduce more democratic systems of elections into trade unions. The system which exists now has not been properly tried. The system which exists now was supported by this Government when it was in Opposition. The Government now seeks an alternative system as an alternative to direct elections and it seeks to make a number of changes which are not of universal significance to the trade union movement. They are not of universal application in the level of their significance but are clearly the results of advice being given to the Government from certain quarters and a failure to look at the whole question in an objective, across the board way. </para>
          <para>It is quite glib for the Minister to say in his second reading speech that the peak councils of the trade union movement have also been informed of the Government &#39;s proposals. I say it is glib because I know that they were informed; they were told what was going to happen. But they were not consulted in any sense about this matter. As an excuse for that, the Minister told us that when he discussed the question last May- if you please- with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke, Mr Hawke</inline> pointed out that there was a division of opinion in the trade union movement on this issue and he could not put a monolithic trade union view. In the same paragraph the Minister said that the peak councils have been informed. Of course there are other peak councils beside the Australian Council of Trade Unions. There has been no proper consultation about the legislation except with a certain section of the trade union movement whose views are reflected in certain specific amendments which are made by this Bill. </para>
          <para>I said earlier that the difficulty about this sort of piecemeal, <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc,</inline> exorcist legislation which the Government keeps introducing in relation to trade unions is that it really does not grapple with the basic issues. I share the Minister&#39;s view about the desirability of the highest level of democracy in trade unions. However I do not share the sort of view which he put in the Senate a week or two ago in answer to a Dorothy Dix question about political strikes. The Government has made a little fuss about this question of political strikes but I am not prepared to accept the Government&#39;s frame of reference on this question. I am not prepared to accept the premises from which it starts. I agree that there should be democracy in trade unions to the utmost possible degree. I believe that if trade unions are to engage in what are sometimes called political strikes the members of the trade unions concerned should be consulted as much as possible about those decisions. The Government says in this glib sort of 1930 vintage way that there is an area of things which trade unions are legitimately allowed to be concerned with; namely, wages and working conditions. Of course when they do strike about wages and working conditions the Government says that they should not do that. Then to say that there is another area, which we please to call political strikes, which involves things which trade unions should not be concerned about, is both superficial and glib. </para>

              <para>- If you possess your soul in patience I will tell you. The fact of the matter is that all sorts of bodies in our society make decisions which have political consequences. I live in the City of Melbourne and for years insurance companies have been making decisions which have destroyed my city. Collins Street, Melbourne, is no longer the place it used to be because decisions have been made in board rooms in New York, London, Melbourne and Sydney which have completely changed the environment of the city in which I live. Those decisions presumably were made by men in grey flannel suits who were responsible to nobody except their shareholders. However, when I go to the Sydney Opera House I like to look at the Moreton Bay fig trees outside the Sydney Opera House. They are a living tribute to political strikes. Those Moreton Bay fig trees would not be there today but for the activities of unionists like Jack Mundey. That is a fact. They are there as a result of a political strike which involved the exercise of power by a group in this community to achieve what it regarded as important social community results.

It may be that many people in this community who expect to gain a lot in terms of money from nuclear power will support that proposition, but many people involved in trade unions will oppose that proposition because they do not see it being in the interests of their society, their children or the community in which they live. </para>

          <para>When we talk about democracy in trade unions I think it is very important that we should try to put a little substance in to the rhetoric, a little flesh on the bones of the Minister&#39;s second reading speech. It is for these reasons that we say the Bill is sloppy and inadequate and will not achieve the sorts of results which it is piously hoped it will achieve. It will not achieve those results because it just does not grapple with the real issues of industrial relations in the 1970s in a dynamic society, if we still continue to be a dynamic society- and of course there may be room for doubt about that. The Government&#39;s policy in this area is in disrepute and we oppose the legislation. </para>

            <para>- The Senate is debating the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976. Although it is a matter of the greatest importance, I do not intend to take up very much of the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Senate &#39;s time in dealing with it. I regard the matter as important because it reaches into the very heart of the affairs of every individual trade unionist. The basis of this Bill is the very question of the human rights of every unionist. Firstly, I should like to refer to one or two points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> He referred to collegiate voting as though it were some sort of a sinister scheme that apparently has been thrust on the unions without any concern. He said that there had been very little consultation on the matter, yet I clearly remember that in the Minister&#39;s second reading speech on the secret ballots legislation which was introduced in May this year the Minister specifically referred to this matter. Indeed, there was a great deal of debate in this chamber on the very question. I see that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> has left the chamber, but I hope that he reads some of the speeches that were made at that time and brings himself up to date on the matter. </para>
          <para>The basis of this legislation hangs on 3 great principles. The first is the common objectives of the worker in achieving his individual welfare, and that, of course, is the fundamental thing that brought persons together in trade unions in the first place. That is an objective which we all on both sides of the chamber will strive to uphold. The second principle is related to that matter and describes the rights and powers of individual unions to pursue their own objectives in their own way; to ascribe their own rules and to pursue them that way. The third principle relates to the freedom of association of individual members of unions and the manner in which they express that freedom as members of unions. The restrictions that can be placed on them through arbitrary means, by the way in which the laws of unions, that is their rules, are interpreted and read at the highest councils in unions, have the greatest effect upon their ability to express themselves and to become objective citizens in a free society to which we as a nation that upholds this sort of a parliament aspire. </para>
          <para>I believe that the rights of the individual worker are absolutely paramount. There are examples today throughout the community where this is not the case. It is a question of whether an individual should submit himself to the machine or describe himself and put forward his own views in the way that he sees best. It is interesting to note that in his speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran&#39;s</inline> comments today that the answer to trade union problems lies in unification and amalgamation. In other words, again the solution to all problems lies in centralisation. </para>

              <para>- If the honourable senator looks at the rules of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union he will find that they hardly give the individual worker the opportunity to express himself. The approach which the Government has adopted in regard to this legislation is one of total flexibility. This is demonstrated by the Government&#39;s approach to the legislation dealing with secret ballots which was introduced earlier this year. Certainly the issue of collegiate voting was raised at that time. In clause 13 (3) of that secret ballots legislation there was reference to the exemption of organisations in particular circumstances. That is a clear example of the approach which the Government adopts in regard to these matters and is at the core of giving rights to individual workers. In that legislation it was provided that individual unions could decide for themselves the system that they would select for the election of office bearers. That is at the core of providing rights for individual workers. It has been followed in this legislation by providing in 3 circumstances for the election of full-time office bearers, a system whereby a union can decide upon a direct vote, or through a one-tier collegiate voting system. An option exists. The Government is flexible in this matter. It has provided that unions should have the right to choose themselves which way they will act. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Part-time unionists are to be selected in another way at the option of the union, in addition to the 2 other methods. It is provided that there could be a multi-tier collegiate voting system in that circumstance. The final point which seems to me to be of great importance in this legislation, and which of course would lead to greater efficiency in trade union affairs, is that the definition of &#39;office&#39; has been amended in order to provide for appointment rather than election. I have had a great deal of experience in various organisations where this provision has proved to be of great benefit. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> made the point that because such an officer would not be submitting himself to election, in some way this would detract from the rights of individuals to get their views across to him. In fact, it is my experience in various organisations that the reverse position applies. An individual who is appointed in that way reacts better and more fluidly to the circumstances around him than do persons who are selected and kept in power by a clique. </para>
          <para>The other point that has been raised concerns the provision that the college can comprise, to the extent of 15 per cent of the total college, persons who have been previously office bearers in the organisation. This I believe to be a very sound principle. I might mention for the benefit of honourable senators that the Liberal Party in South Australia adopted this principle some 3 years ago when amending its constitution, for the very purpose that we are providing it in this legislation today- to provide a more democratic means to let people get on with the job in their organisation without continually having to watch their backs. This is a principle which I believe is worthy of incorporation in this legislation. </para>

              <para>- It is not by appointment, it is by election. These people gain their positions by election. In this circumstance they will come up for election at the proper time, and of course they can be removed from office. It is not by appointment at all. I believe that the figure of 15 per cent is quite reasonable and in proper relation to the size of the rest of the college. It is not as though that clique will be able to run the organisation from such a power base. I believe that that sort of consideration is of basic importance in protecting the rights of individual workers. </para>

          <para>I have said as much as I want to say on this subject but I want to reiterate the importance of making sure that this legislation gains proper acceptance in the eyes of the community. I was somewhat distraught after the passing of the legislation which provided for secret ballots that a number of constituents were not aware that this important Bill had been passed. It has taken some three or four months, in South Australia at any rate, to bring that matter to the attention of individuals. I hope that this legislation will have wide promotion by the Government so that people can properly understand its background, what it is designed to do and, I am sure, what it will achieve. I support the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I am very pleased that tonight <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> supports the principle of the trade union movement. He referred to what Neville Wran, the Premier of New South Wales, said today about the trade union movement and about strikes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> said that there ought to be fewer unions with larger membership. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> said that this was centralisation. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Messner</inline> ought to look at the DGB which is the West German trade union movement. There are 16 unions in West Germany. Each of those unions has a huge membership. West Germany has the lowest rate of strikes of any country in western Europe. It certainly has a centralised union system. The system was set up after the occupation of West Germany by the Allied Forces. The British trade union movement was consulted at the time. It was asked to set up what it thought was a perfect system. Time has proved the British trade union movement right. There are only 16 unions for the whole of West Germany. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This legislation seeks to amend the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in respect of the method of electing officers of registered organisations- both trade union and employer organisations. This Government proposes to reintroduce the collegiate system for the election of officers as an alternative to the direct vote of the total membership. We believe that this is a retrograde step. We in the Opposition oppose these amendments as they are at variance with our commitment to a proper democratic control of trade unions and all organisations, whether they be employer or employee organisations. We stand for the right of the rank and file trade unionists to elect their full time officials, because these full time officials represent the interests of the rank and file in the work place, in the arbitration courts or in their meetings with government. The full time officials are the administrators of the trade unions. Surely they should be the people responsible to their own rank and file, not people espousing what could be a minority view imposed on the rank and file by some form of collegiate voting. </para>
          <para>The previous Labor Government&#39;s commitment to democratic control of trade unions prompted the amendments to the Conciliation and Arbitration Act in 1973 which have been referred to and which provided direct election of full time officials. It is interesting to note, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> brought out in his speech, that the then Opposition did not raise objections at the time. No criticism was made of the method of electing trade union officials then. The present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Fraser)</inline> who was then the Liberal Party spokesman on industrial relations, acknowledged the commitment to industrial democracy which was in our 1973 legislation. In fact, the relevant clause of the 1 973 legislation which provided for the direct election of union officials was agreed to by the Opposition in the </para>
          <para class="block">Committee stage in both Houses- I stress this without debate. </para>
          <para>However, a lot has happened since 1973. Firstly, the present Government went on a union-bashing campaign during the last election campaign. It said that secret postal voting for trade union officials would destroy communist militants&#39; influence in the union movement. We remember the advertisements at the time. It was said that the careers of the Halfpennys and the Car michaels would be finished. This was despite the fact that many unions in this country have had secret postal ballots for years and still elect persons who are, in the eyes of the present Government, left wing militant trade union officials. One should look at the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia, for example, and at the percentage of members who vote in that union&#39;s elections. It is very high indeed. The present Government did not realise that the people who were really opposed to secret postal ballots were people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maynes</inline> and other National Civic Council trade union officials who were scared that they would lose their positions. </para>

          <para>Earlier this year, John Grenville advised me that when he was elected he was not a member of the Clerics&#39; Union and was not eligible to run. The Victorian Branch records were falsified to secure his election. I have not made these allegations, nor has your Branch of the Union. They were made by a long term member of the National Civic Council. His allegations are important in that they run to the validity of decisions made by meetings in which he participated. Grenville went a step further and identified John Maynes, the Federal President of this Union, as being the person responsible for this falsification. </para>
          <para>As your Branch Secretary, and as a member of the Federal Council and the Federal Executive of this Union, I have raised this matter on a number of occasions with Terry Sullivan who purports to be the Federal Secretary of the Union now. I have asked him to investigate the allegations. I have not prejudged them, but they clearly and obviously require investigation to determine their truth or otherwise. I have had no practical response from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sullivan.</inline></para>
          <para>With the full support of your Branch Executive, I have referred these very serious allegations to the Commonwealth Attorney General, the  Hon.  R. J. Ellicott, Q.C. At the time of writing, I am waiting for a reply. </para>

              <para>- You will have your opportunity tomorrow. The NCC has lobbied the Federal Government intensively this year to retain the collegiate system of voting. We saw all sorts of vested interests also in employer organisations because they wanted a collegiate system of electing officials. Together these powerful forces obliged this Government to change tack and to reintroduce collegiate voting for industrial organisations. If this legislation achieves this, it will mean that minority groups, often of extremist leanings either to the Left or to the Right, will be able to exercise control over important industrial organisations without ever being subject to the democratic pressure of rank and file elections. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>This is where we come to the joke of the whole situation, because the collegiate system of voting serves also to entrench communist militants such as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carmichael,</inline> who on 5 May this year in the communist newspaper <inline font-style="italic">Tribune</inline> drew attention to the fact that the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union might opt for the collegiate system. He said that if the union did this the national  president  could be elected by 0.02 per cent of the membership. So much for union democracy. In fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said earlier, with the 1 5 per cent proviso now <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Carmichael</inline> will probably never have to face election again from the rank and file. </para>

              <para>- I now turn to another union and a reverse situation. I think even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> would say that the New South Wales branch of the liquor trades union would be described as a moderate trade union. In 1970 the New South Wales State executive of that union was controlled by Communist Party members and their supporters. This situation was changed by a court-controlled ballot after a 31 -day court case established that falsified ballot-papers were used in a previous election. In fact, the present Premier of New South Wales, Neville Wran, and my parliamentary colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, acted and appeared for the Australian Labor Party members led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Morris in that court case. Those people subsequently took control of the union. Previously a union member who wanted a vote had to apply for a ballot-paper and prove that he could not attend the meeting where the voting was to take place, with the result that some elections for the New South Wales branch were held and decided by under 200 members, not under Electoral Office control. After the John Morris team took over that union the rules were changed. Every member received a ballot-paper and the Commonwealth Electoral Office controlled the ballot. Union membership in New South Wales grew from 24 000 then to approximately 60 000 this year. In 1973 the union changed its rules at a federal level under the legislation that was brought in by the Labor Government, and now all paid federal officials are voted for in a rank and file Australia-wide ballot. There are approximately 80 000 members of that union who now get a ballot-paper. What could have happened if the union had not changed its rules? A collegiate body of 20 could have elected the officials. If a collegiate system of 20 existed over 50 per cent of the membership could have been given no say at a federal level. This might not have happened, but it could have happened. I wonder who among honourable senators opposite would have wanted a situation in which the 60 000 members in New South Wales did not get a say because of a collegiate system. </para>

          <para>It is quite obvious from what has been said in other places that this Government went to great lengths to protect the NCC in the trade union movements. It knew that the NCC influence in the trade union movement could be destroyed if its candidates were forced to face a direct voting system. It would also appear, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said, that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maynes</inline> knew well in advance of the introduction of these amendments that his position would be protected by collegiate voting. He said as much to the Industrial Registrar in the middle of this year. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Maynes</inline> has a great deal at stake in ensuring the continuance of collegiate voting. The Government is protecting his privileged position, but at the same time it is entrenching the very militants whom it was attacking in its election campaign. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline>also made the point that this legislation permits appointments of officers without recourse to rank and file ballots. I submit that this serves to further entrench controlling factions, whether they be to the Left or to the Right. Therefore it preserves the position of those union officials about whom this Government is always complaining. One only has to look, for example, to somebody who wins a minor position in a union, say an assistant secretary&#39;s job, who does not like the general secretary so he gets the numbers and appoints somebody as an administrative officer, a clerical assistant or whatever and takes over the union because of this loophole that has been left. The legislation does not provide for rank and file choice of the system of voting which is to be used in electing its officials. This decision is made only by the leadership of the unions. Again, so much for democratic control. Therefore this legislation runs counter to our commitment to full rank and file participation in the affairs of the trade union movement. The rank and file should decide the system of electing its officials. After all, the unions are their own organisations. </para>
          <para>The introduction of this legislation makes a mockery of the Government&#39;s commitment to consultations with trade unions when industrial legislation is mooted, because the unions were not given prior warning of the introduction of this legislation, nor were they given time to consider its ramifications. The unions were merely informed that the legislation was going through. Three days later the Government brought the Bill into the Parliament. There was no consultation. </para>

          <para>The Opposition rejects this legislation for a number of definite reasons. Firstly, the Opposition considers the collegiate system which the legislation allows has the effect of depriving trade union members of electing their union officials by direct voting. Secondly, the collegiate system is open to abuse and manipulation by minority extremist groups in unions to entrench themselves and therefore remain permanently in control of those organisations. Thirdly, the Government&#39;s action in ensuring that such a system is retained reveals the emptiness of its commitment to internal trade union democracy. Fourthly, the Government&#39;s real concerns, as evidenced by this legislation are two-fold. Firstly, it is concerned to shore up the position of ultra right wing cliques in important unions such as the NCC and to place a buffer zone between them and rank and file ballots. Secondly and more importantly, it is concerned to preserve the position of those left wing union officials whom this Government likes to kick. This Government needs them so it can kick the whole of the trade union movement and bring it into disrepute. The Government&#39;s commitment to industrial democracy as shown by this legislation is nothing more than a sham. Like so many of its promises in the industrial relations field they are designed only for short term electoral support and not for the benefit of the workers of this country and the members of the trade union movement. </para>

            <para>- I rise briefly to support the Conciliation and Arbitration Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976. 1 intend to stick to a general consideration of the matters involved in this most important legislation. I do not intend to involve myself in a discussion of personalities. But I find it necessary to refer to one or two things that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> said in his opening remarks which I found a little disappointing. He referred as being empty rhetoric references to democracy, to the minority interests, to the involvement of the mass of the people in the establishment of those who represent them, whether it be in a union, some other organisation or association or in the Parliament itself. I do not believe that on reflection <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> would think that that sort of matter was merely empty rhetoric. Perhaps he had forgotten involvement that he has expressed from time to time with the principles of democracy. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I recall that he referred to conversations with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> some months ago in which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> talking about the establishment of a trade union conciliation and arbitration amendment Bill, said- I cite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> words referable to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke-</inline> that there was no monolithic trade union view. If that is so, I assume that the legislation which the Government promotes is extremely reasonable and responsible legislation. If there is no monolithic trade union view, how sensible and reasonable it seems that in producing legislation in this area we should look to cover the widest possible range of involvement and the widest possible range of problems that occur within the trade union movement, as indeed they occur within any movement or association in our community. I feel that I should reiterate that the Government does not actually condemn the direct method of election. It is not a question of condemning that sort of election of a trade union representative or of any other representative. All we seek to do is to suggest that there may be circumstances in which methods other than the direct method fit the circumstances better. Therefore our legislation basically seeks to give to the trade union movement as a whole a real measure of choice, a real measure of adopting that particular view or that particular method that seems best to fit the circumstances as the membership should see them. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline>suggested later when he approved of democracy and the methods and philosophy of democracy that management should reflect the rank and file views. I hope that he meant that it should reflect as near as possible 100 per cent of the rank and file view. If he did mean that, I wonder how he views a circumstance in which I understand that in one union, which is perhaps the biggest trade union in Australia, less than 2 per cent of the membership elected its leaders. I do not quite understand how that fits the circumstances as promoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> that it would be ideal that the leadership should represent the views of the rank and file of a union movement or, as I have said before, of any other association or organisation. It seems to me that the membership participation, that the involvement of the great majority of the people in a trade union or in any other organisation, should most certainly be those people who elect or produce those who are to lead them, who are to negotiate on their behalf on all the hundreds of important issues that come before those organisations. That is the very essence of democracy. It is not empty rhetoric. It is a circumstance that can be applied only in the sort of community, in the sort of society, in the sort of political orientation, in the sort of parliamentary control in which we in Australia find ourselves. </para>
          <para>The difficult proposition is to answer that question, to find the best method by which a measure of real democracy can be called upon to result in the election of those people whom the great mass of the unionists require to lead them. That leads me to wonder how sincere is the resolution of the antagonists of this legislation, how sincere is their involvement and their concern for what is truly a democratic circumstance. I wonder whether they are more concerned with the political philosophy which they promote from time to time in most places, which sees the state as the master of the people, the controller and the owner, and not merely as an entity whose chief performance of duty is to prevent exploitation, whether it be of resources, material or mankind itself. </para>
          <para>I seem to think, as I look at this legislation and as I listen to the opposition to it from the Australian Labor Party in the chamber tonight, that it highlights a problem which I believe is basic to the problems which confront Australians and certainly to the problems that confront parliamentary democracy in this country. It seems to me that there is a tendency to want to establish a circumstance in which the left wing or the radical element of the political entity in this country becomes totally associated with the promotion of the union official, the promotion of leadership within the union itself. The tragedy of this is that if we allow that sort of thing to continue we are going to develop an immense gap between the basic political philosophies, between the major entities in the Australian parliamentary scene. My concern is that if we allow this sort of gap to widen we are laying the foundations for the destruction of the parliamentary system, because that sort of gap if allowed to grow to virtually unmanageable proportions will ultimately lead us to some son of dictatorship of the Left or the Right. I suggest that if we are led through this son of circumstance to a dictatorship of the Left or the Right- whether it be the Left or the Right is purely a matter of academic interest- it is a dictatorship and it must above all things be avoided in the circumstances of the Australian community. I make those comments quite sincerely because I think that it is a great shame that the opposition to these particular conciliation and arbitration amendments is an opposition which relates itself to support by the radical left wing trade union element supported by the radical left wing political element in the Australian context. </para>
          <para>Consequently, the promotion of the amendments that are in this Bill become of even more significance than one may have imagined. I am convinced- as a prelude to this particular legislation there has been considerable discussion and months of investigation- that the only way in which we can survive as a total economic and social community is by a proper measure of recognition of the inter-relation between all the spheres of operation in this country- between trade unionists, between management, between governments. If we are able to establish that circumstance we believe that these amendments go some way towards establishing that circumstance then we have achieved the necessary foundation for the continuation and development of a democratic circumstance in Australia. We have to recognise that only by discussion, only by recognition of the problems across the board, only by recognition of the interdependence that exists between every section of the community are we to establish a measure of real permanence in the solutions which we seek. I might say in reference to those thoughts that probably the American circumstance fills considerable numbers of Australians with a measure of envy, for it does appear that there is not the sort of vast ideological gap between the major political entities in that democracy. </para>

          <para>The second part of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop&#39;s</inline> question relates to whether, if major revision has been made, it should be for the Senate again to give assent to the printing. It has been the practice for the  Clerk,  as he acknowledges in his statement, to up-date and revise each edition after the Senate has ordered its printing, and no subsequent order for printing has been made. </para>
          <para>I repeat what I said earlier in the day, that I have the greatest respect for the integrity of the  Clerk. His  integrity and dedication to the Senate are beyond question. He has, at all times, been a strong and sincere defender of the powers of the Senate. </para>
          <para>I sought the indulgence of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Scott</inline> to make that statement to the Senate. I said that I would call on him to resume his speech when I had finished my statement. I propose to adhere to that procedure. </para>

              <para>- I take a point of order. The first thing that ought to be clarified is the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh. His</inline> point is that, although the Senate has resolved that this matter be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting, it is not on a notice paper because a notice paper has not yet been printed and therefore he is entitled to speak tonight on that matter. This is a very narrow point and I think it ought to be resolved before we go much further. I would have thought that the carrying of that motion makes it an order of the day for the next day of sitting, not the publication of that decision in a notice paper bearing tomorrow&#39;s date. I am not trying to be difficult. </para>

I maintain that attitude now. Your ruling is that it is not in order for me to discuss your paper tonight as it will be discussed tomorrow, I hope. It would be out of order to discuss it tonight and therefore I do not want to do so. I want to discuss something that happened at question time today which has caused me much concern. I was toying with the idea at that time of seeking to make a personal explanation but it seems that requests I make for leave to make personal explanations are not considered favourably and possibly I would have been refused leave to do so. Nevertheless I was concerned about your answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> You seemed to speak in angry or emotional tones and you were very much concerned about questions this day which seemed to cast some doubts about the integrity of the  Clerk  of the Senate. The only other question which might be considered in any way to relate to the  Clerk  of the Senate was the one that I asked. I could gather from your reply only that you had the impression that I was trying to cast some reflection on the integrity of the  Clerk  of the Senate. That was never my intention. There were certain things that I wanted to find out but could not find out through normal processes. So I was seeking from you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> some answers to questions. </para>

          <para>If, when a question is answered, it is taken as a reflection on someone I think it is a very sorry day. It is unfortunate that a statement has now been made which I think must cast a reflection on someone. I do not say it casts a reflection on the Senate. However, the position is worse than it was previously. I hope I can get the indulgence of the Senate tomorrow for the purpose of contributing to the debate on this question because the statement shows many vital areas that should be cleared up by the Senate. </para>

            <para>- On 5 October <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> asked certain questions without notice about the siting of the proposed Omega station. He asked whether Macquarie Island had been considered as a site but had been rejected because the State Labor Government was opposed to the siting of an Omega station within Tasmania. In my reply I indicated that the station should be sited in the south and the south-east area of the Australian continent and that Macquarie Island had been considered. I undertook to seek clarification on whether the Tasmanian Government had responded in the negative to the prospect of the Omega station being sited on the island. </para>
