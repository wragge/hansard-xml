            <para>-The honourable senator mentioned a number of issues but he really did not get to the real issue, that is, that until inflation is brought under control none of the things which anybody in this community wants can be achieved. It is not a matter of holding to a hard line at all; it is a matter of holding to a sensible line. It is a matter of holding to a line which will work. Until inflation comes down the level of unemployment will not come down. I know there are a lot of theorists about who talk about all sorts of odd things which the Government could do. The fact is that inflation is coming down. The fact is that unemployment is starting to come down. The other fact is that business activity is starting to pick up. It is all very well for people to pick out little bits of information here, little bits there and little bits somewhere else.

It is remarkable that the countries which are doing best are those which have the lowest inflation rate and the countries which are doing worst are those which have the highest inflation rate. We are determined that this country will be the best in the world and therefore we are going to get the inflation rate down. </para>

              <para>-There speaks one of the great economists who cannot even catch up with metrics. He is still talking in dozens. The Government is well aware that the Medibank levy will flow on to the consumer price index for the December quarter. It is quite well aware of that. The decision was taken quite consciously months ago. Anyone would think that all of a sudden the Leader of the Opposition has discovered this startling fact. That fact was known when it was decided to apply the Medibank levy. What has to be looked at is the performance of the economy over a period-a period of not less than 12 months. I repeat that, although the Government may not yet have got inflation down to the level that it wants, it is certainly falling and I thought every Australian would be applauding that. </para>

I preface it by reminding the Minister that certain safeguards have been written into the law to protect the investments made by way of payments of premiums on insurance policies on the lives of persons who insure with all insurance companies registered in Australia. Is the Minister aware that this policy is apparently not adhered to by a company known as Invincible Life and General Insurance Company Ltd which is incorporated in New South Wales? Are agents of this company allowed to solicit new business by advising prospective clients that premiums are repaid <inline font-style="italic">in toto</inline> on a whole of life policy after a qualifying period of 2 years?

Is the Minister able to compare unemployment in Tasmania under the Neilson Labor Government with unemployment in those States which have Liberal governments? Does Premier Neilson now preside over Australia &#39;s worst unemployment?

            <para>- I was somewhat interested in and a little intrigued by the visit of the Premier of Tasmania to Canberra today to see the Prime Minister. It seemed that it was being somewhat stage managed, because it is fairly obvious that already he has taken a decision to hold an early election. In specific answer to the questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley,</inline> I have the percentage unemployment figures for the end of October 1976. They reveal the following facts: In New South Wales the unemployment rate was 5.20 per cent of the labour force; in Victoria, 3.70 per cent; in Queensland, 4.3 1 per cent; in South Australia, 3.37 per cent; in Western Australia, 3.63 per cent; and in Tasmania, 5.22 per cent. Those figures would bear out the concern expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> that Tasmania has the worst rate of unemployment in Australia, followed by another Labor State, New South Wales, with 5.20 per cent. </para>

By way of preface I refer to a statement made by the Assistant Commissioner of the Australia Police, Superintendent J. Davies, in respect of the letter bombs which were sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser, Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr during the course of the last Federal election. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Davies</inline> was reported as stating on 20 November last year that there would be an &#39;all-out law enforcement effort to find the culprit&#39;. It will be recalled also that on 19 November last the Australian Postal Commission offered a $20,000 reward for evidence leading to the conviction of the person who sent the letter bombs. I ask the Minister: As nearly a year has elapsed since these events and in view of the widely held belief at the time that the letter bombs were not intended to harm those to whom they were sent, since notoriously such personages do not open their own mail, but to harm the Labor Party, has there been any outcome of the &#39;all-out law enforcement effort to find the culprit&#39;, or was the matter quietly dropped after the election? </para>

            <para>-The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is involved in research on the use of a variety of measures for primary producers. In the current economic climate a particular task for the CSIRO is to look to the most efficient use and application of superphosphate. So far as I am aware, presently research is being undertaken in Western Australia and New South Wales, at least by the CSIRO. I have been advised that in Western Australia studies by the CSIRO have indicated that a heavier application of superphosphate on some crops has made the stubble, which is the residue of the crop, more attractive to stock and that indeed during drought conditions it may be a more profitable application of superphosphate. During this past weekend I have been visiting a property named Chiswick at Armidale in New South Wales, which is one of the research stations of the CSIRO. For a period of 10 years researchers on that property have been carrying out an evaluation of various uses of superphosphate and indeed an evaluation of residues in the various areas. I shall ascertain what progress has been made in this area and I shall contemplate, in the time that is available to us between now and the end of the session, whether a statement should be made. </para>

            <para>-I have been informed in the last half hour that in view of the publicity that has been given to the events in Queenstown on the coast of Tasmania the Premier of Tasmania has sought an interview with the Prime Minister today to deal with the situation. Therefore my question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Is it a fact that the Premier of Tasmania has sought an interview with the Prime Minister of Australia? Is there any likelihood of the Senate being informed of the outcome of those deliberations and discussions? </para>

            <para>-Senator O&#39;Byrne evidently knows quite a lot of what is going on. He said that they will be meeting at 3.30 p.m. I thought they were meeting some time this afternoon after question time concludes in the other place. Yes, it is a fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> is here. As I understand it, his visit is not simply because there is to be an election in Tasmania on 4 December but also arises out of other matters. The honourable senator may have seen Press reports that during the Constitutional Convention in Hobart <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> had produced his 24-point plan- I think there were 24 points in it- and the Prime Minister said then that the Commonwealth Government would give serious consideration to the matters raised by the Premier and, having studied them, he would be prepared to discuss them with the Premier of Tasmania. I therefore assume and hope that the Premier&#39;s visit here arises out of the discussion between the Prime Minister and the Premier in Hobart and not simply out of some desire to have an election on 4 December next. </para>

An advertisement in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> of 8 November calls for an investor to develop in the Northern Territory a large international hotel complex, including a casino. The advertisement claims that local government assistance in the project is assured and says that the results of a feasibility study, together with Federal Government correspondence on the matter, will be made available. As the Lotteries and Gaming Ordinance of the Northern Territory does not make provision for casinos, will the Minister explain to the Senate the Federal Government&#39;s involvement and table the correspondence referred to in the advertisement? </para>

Will the Minister please comment on 2 matters? The map on pages 28 and 29 shows Canberra as the centre of the world, whereas I have been told that Perth deserves that honour. The second matter is that distances are shown in miles. Does this mean that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> whose feelings on metrication are well known and who is the senior senator from the home State of the Minister for Defence, has more influence over that Minister than does his ministerial colleague, the Minister for Science, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> or does it mean that the Minister for Defence insidiously is trying to restore furlongs to the racetrack? </para>

I will even have to look at the map. If the publication is produced from Canberra I have no doubt that officers think that Canberra is the centre of Australia. I suppose if one did not use Canberra what would one use? Perhaps one could use the geographical centre of Australia which is Alice Springs, or close enough thereto. I will have a look at the map and I will draw the honourable senator&#39;s comments to the attention of the Minister. I have no idea why miles have been used instead of kilometres. I will also obtain that information from the Minister. </para>

The Minister will recall that a number of questions have been asked, including questions asked by me, about the February 1976 review which took from the free benefits list a number of important pharmaceutical items, particularly those relating to allergic and hypertensive conditions. Since that time, representations have been made to the Minister. As it is now some 9 months since that review and as representations to senators from associations and people have been continuing, will the Minister ask the Minister for Health whether some current review might now be conducted? </para>

I am advised that an amount of $0.6m has been made available by the Commonwealth this financial year under division 940- Payments to or for the States- item 05. This is to match the grant of the Tasmanian Government towards the construction of the rehabilitation centre as a joint CommonwealthState project funded on a 50-50 basis. The amount of $0.6m was made available by the Commonwealth Government to match the amount made available by the State Government. This is an example of Commonwealth and State co-operation.

The extreme conditions led to the temporary loss of local communications when the central exchange building was damaged by wind and water. However, limited Post Office technical operating circuits which are part of the microwave system were working at all times and Darwin was never completely isolated. </para>

            <para>-The information I have is quite slight. The fact is that aerials are always vulnerable to damage by flying objects in a storm, and the aerials in Darwin were no exception. This information deals with the defence aerials, not the Post Office aerials. That is why we are answering with respect to 2 different sectors. I am further advised that since the cyclone a new receiving transmitter has been finished at Shoal Bay and a new transmitter is being built at Humpty Doo in a more protected area. It is expected that these will not suffer from the disabilities of the previous defence equipment. </para>

          <para>The primary functions of inspections under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act are to secure observance of the Act and its regulations and of federal award provisions, provide technical advice and information and bring to notice defects in and abuses of awards. There is no precise information available on the actual number of respondents to federal awards, which are those which are the subject of investigation from time to time, but it is estimated roughly that the number of employers bound by federal awards would exceed 200 000. On the other hand, the Commonwealth arbitration inspectorate has fewer than 100 inspectors available for the conduct of routine inspections, and it receives about 4000 complaints each year in regard to possible breaches of an award. Consequently, whilst it seeks to cover all federal awards, it gives special attention to those awards breaches of which are generally the most common, and to industries where routine inspections or complaints suggest there may be relatively widespread non observance of awards. It should be borne in mind that the Conciliation and Arbitration Act does not restrict award enforcement to arbitration inspectors but allows a registered organisation or a member of a registered organisation affected by an award to take enforcement action. Of course, this is a very important responsibility and an activity of the union movement. As far as the particular matter at the Kingsford-Smith Airport is concerned, the inspectorate&#39;s investigation into alleged underpayment by the employer is proceeding and the extent of it is in some doubt. Until that inspection is completed I will be unable to give the Senate any further information on that particular investigation. </para>

            <para>-A total of 23 private civil marriage celebrants have been appointed by the present Government. Their distribution throughout the States and Territories is as follows: New South Wales 7, Victoria 5, Queensland 5, Western Australia 4, South Australia nil, Tasmania 1, Australian Capital Territory nil and Northern Territory 1. The purpose of these appointments is to provide convenient facilities for civil marriage for those people who desire a satisfying alternative to a registry office ceremony. Honourable senators will note that this Government has proceeded with some proper caution in regard to the numbers appointed, and I make no comment at all on one notable appointment that was made by the previous Government. By way of contrast, while saying nothing of the appointment of the Leader of the Government in the Senate to this office, in the latter half of 1973- the first year of the scheme&#39;s operation- the Labor Government authorised 13 civil marriage celebrants, in 1974 it authorised 85 and in 1975 it authorised 109, a total of 207 in less than <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> years. The Government&#39;s policy has been to make these appointments only after the most careful consideration of the likely demands for the celebrants&#39; services, his or her personal qualities and the number of celebrants already providing a service in the area concerned. </para>

Will officers of his Department make inquiries into the situation with a view to preventing any repetition or extension of the problem? </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Treasurer. I remind the Minister of a question I asked on 9 September relating to the rate of Budget deficit which at that time had reached $1,45 6m. In reply he said that expenditure runs in variable patterns and revenue accumulates in a variable style. In view of this, can the Minister explain the resent circumstances of a Budget deficit of 2,859m announced for the first 3 months of 1976-77? Will the Minister confirm that this is $250m in excess of the Budget deficit for the same period in 1 975-76? Finally, can the Minister outline the measures the Government intends to take to overcome the Budget deficit, keeping in mind the comments made by the Liberal and National Country Parties when we were in government to the effect that that rate of Budget deficit was irresponsible? </para>

            <para>- The Government has produced a Budget which stated a certain deficit. It is the Government&#39;s intention to hold to that Budget deficit pattern, which will emerge as a final result in June of next year. The honourable senator will recall that last year we were criticising his Government&#39;s then Budget deficit and saying that it was in the process of being doubled as events passed, which I think proved to be the case. The balance of the honourable senator&#39;s query will best be satisfied when the Government&#39;s financing transactions statement as at the end of October is issued. It will illuminate the scene for all of us. I shall obtain a copy of it for the honourable senator. </para>

Advertisements were placed in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> in October and later, calling for applications from voluntary organisations. I understand that some consultations took place between the Office of Child Care and some of the applicants last week. The Office of Child Care will be considering the applications and shortly will make recommendations for grants for the next school vacation period. It is hoped that these projects will be of assistance to children in the Australian Capital Territory, in particular those children of working parents, single parents and others who require this special service. I hope to make an announcement in the near future of a more general nature regarding holiday projects. I will see that the honourable senator is advised accordingly. </para>

            <para>-I must say that I am unaware of any increasing concern in the Public Service about public sector expenditure cuts or staff ceilings or of any suggestion of low morale. If ever there was low morale in the Public Service it was evident some 12 to 15 months ago. That is when the low morale was about. As far as one is able to judge, the Public Service has never worked better and with greater heart than it has done during the last 12 months. Any announcements as to what the Government does about the economy will be made by the appropriate Minister. </para>

            <para>-I will attempt to define the general usage of the terms. In general, the term tertiary education has applied to universities and to colleges of advanced education. It has applied specifically to those 2 kinds of institutions. Post-secondary is a term which has applied to those forms of education which follow upon secondary education. Upon completion of year 12 at a matriculation level a person may go on to tertiary education but, alternatively, after leaving school he may go to a technical college or a community college. So post-secondary would be inclusive of tertiary education but would include also institutions such as technical colleges, community colleges or colleges of that nature which do not necessarily require a matriculation pass for entry to the college. Having said that, I have no doubt that many experts will contradict me. </para>

If not, will the Minister study <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pringle</inline> &#39;s call for a reassessment of the cyclone warning system with a view to scaling down warnings for certain degrees of cyclones or for cyclones situated well off the coast?

            <para>- I am not aware of recent comments by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr James</inline> Pringle of the need or otherwise to review the cyclone warning system in Queensland. I can say that the matter of cyclone warnings has in recent times been something to which the Bureau of Meteorology has given quite a deal of consideration. The honourable senator will recognise that there is a difficulty in deciding what should be adequate warning in this most difficult area in which it is not possible basically to predict the course which a cyclone may take. Of course one must always err on the side of alerting the public to the possibility of a cyclone and the hazards that follow it. The Bureau has been active in relation to the suggestion of scaling down warnings. I hold some reserve in my mind as to whether there is wisdom in that suggestion. I undertake to do as the honourable senator requests. I shall take up the matter immediately with the Bureau of Meteorology, shall draw its attention to the comments by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Pringle</inline> and shall attempt to give an answer to the honourable senator in due course. </para>

            <para>-Is the Minister for Education aware of the generally held view that children with mental deficiency should be treated in special school situations with less ambitious goals, later starting ages and less sensory input than normal children? Is he able to inform the Senate whether he has become aware of any experiments which seriously challenge these beliefs? Can he detail some of the quite incredible educational goals being achieved by certain children with Down&#39;s syndrome at a special school in Sydney? Can he advise the Senate whether the unit at Macquarie University which is carrying out this work enjoys funding support from the Department of Education or any other Federal department? </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Baume</inline>raises what is, I think, a matter of growing importance and of very considerable significance in special education. The first part of his question focuses on the fact that until quite recently it was thought that those with limitations in mental capacity, as those with limitations physically, necessarily must be put in special schools and must be treated as special people away from their peers. I am happy to say that there is a growing belief that those with handicaps should be kept as far as possible amongst the children of their age groups in ordinary schools. It may well be that from time to time they should be taken and given special instruction and brought back. The general tendency today is to recognise as far as possible that all have handicaps but that some have more marked handicaps than others and should be treated in the way I have mentioned. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> is referring to an experiment that I have seen at the special education unit at Macquarie University and which I think all honourable senators would find quite remarkable. There, as one example, the staff have taken young children of, I think, 4 or 5 years of age who have Down&#39;s syndrome- that is, they are mongoloid, having a genetic aberration. Where normally one would believe that those children could not be trained in the routine basic skills of literacy and numeracy, it has become quite clear that with the application of special training they are making remarkable progress. I commend that work. I commend the institute itself. Yes, it has been funded federally. But more importantly, I commend what I suspect the honourable senator is referring to, that is, an attitude of mind which is no longer defeatist but takes the training of persons with even severe handicaps as a challenge, advocates public acceptance, and as far as possible aims to restore all such people to the community of their peers. </para>

            <para>- I ask of either the Minister representing the Minister for Overseas Trade or the Minister representing the Minister for Defence a question which refers to the situation at Port Pirie. Was not the plant at Evandale, Port Pirie, built for the purpose of treating uranium from Radium Hill to supply the requirements of the United States and the United Kingdom Combined Development Agency? Although it was an agreement between other countries, would not the Commonwealth be involved to some extent? Did not the Commonwealth of Australia, together with Canada, become a party to the Combined Development Agency for the purpose of providing atomic power? Does Australia have an involvement in this plant? The complications could be serious. Illness has been reported and there have been other occurrences. </para>

            <para>- Although I am very familiar with the Broadcasting and Television Act, section 32 does not come readily to mind. So I confess that, except for what the honourable senator has said, I do not know what its terms are. There is no question whatsoever that anything that this Government may do by way of reform with regard to the whole of the framework of the broadcasting and television industry will in any way threaten the integrity of those institutions. On the contrary, the Commonwealth Government is determined that there shall be set up and maintained statutory bodies which not only have freedom to carry out their work but also have an objectivity of purpose to bring about what the Broadcasting and Television Act says is their major task- that is, the provision of adequate and comprehensive programming. That is, I think, constantly forgotten by the Labor Party which looks to the end in itself of a body having freedom but which does not look to the purpose of the freedom. The freedom that any body is given is for the provision of comprehensive and adequate programming. As to the methodology of implementing the reforms, that has been stated by the Minister concerned. I will be tabling a copy of his statement. As to the particular persons who will serve on the Commission, that will be a matter for future Government policy in the light of the statements concerned. I am aware that there are certain rumours in public. There is no basis at this moment for the rumours because no policy matters have been stated in this regard. So I suggest that the honourable senator wait until the statement is published. </para>

        <para class="block">Major-General Alan Stretton has said, on both the Australian Broadcasting Commission radio program <inline font-style="italic">AM</inline> and last night&#39;s ABC television news, that I, along with some of my Cabinet colleagues in the Whitlam Labor Government, went to Darwin at the time of cyclone Tracy merely to obtain publicity for ourselves, and also, so far as I was concerned, that when I was in Darwin I attempted to control the news stories coming out of Darwin. Both of these statements by General Stretton are wilfully and maliciously false statements. I went to Darwin at the request of the then Acting Prime Minister because the ABC transmitter had been put completely out of action by the cyclone. Under sections 6 1 and 62 of the Broadcasting and Television Act only I, the Minister for Media, was empowered to approve of expenditure in excess of an amount of $100,000being incurred by the ABC. It was felt that immediate expenditure of more than that amount might be involved and the Acting Prime Minister requested me, the Secretary of my Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oswin,</inline> and the General Manager of the ABC, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duckmanton,</inline> to proceed immediately to Darwin. I might add that only the officers of the ABC would know of the tremendous efforts put in by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oswin</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duckmanton</inline> to help restore communications to the Darwin area. </para>
        <para>The fact is that, along with others of my ministerial colleagues at the time who may have had to approve immediate expenditure by their departments, I went to Darwin on the first plane on Boxing Day 1974 because it was felt that immediate expenditure might be involved and that I, not General Stretton or anyone else, was the only person who could give immediate approval for that expenditure to be incurred. It was also for that reason that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duckmanton</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oswin</inline> accompanied me- to give their expert advice. As to the newspapers that are now criticising me and my Cabinet colleagues- as also apparently is General Stretton- for going to Darwin, had I not gone and had the ABC not got back to air as as soon as it did, I would have been assailed by the same critics for spending the festive season at home. Again, so far as the media were concerned I was placed in a no-win situation. </para>
        <para>I also understand that General Stretton said last night on the ABC news that whilst I was in Darwin I had wanted to control the news outlets and that that would have been disastrous. That is another maliciously false statement on the General &#39;s part. The facts are these: Darwin had been ravaged and completely shattered by cyclone Tracy. People were missing. Rescue and recovery operations were proceeding. The police were searching all destroyed premises, particularly to see whether missing people could be located. The evacuation of Darwin was beginning to take place. Internal transport communications were acute, to say the least. Roads were blocked. Water mains were burst. Movement from one part of Darwin to another was hazardous and protracted. The ABC transmitter, when we got it back on air, was operating only intermittently because of the overheating of the transmitter. When operating, it was doing so on only a very limited signal. </para>
        <para>Journalists in the Darwin area naturally were covering all facets of the cyclone &#39;s destruction. It was impossible for all of them to be in the one place at the one time waiting for a Press conference to be held. The first Press conference that I saw Major-General Stretton hold was convened in a lane way behind police headquarters. It was held there because it was impossible to get everyone inside the building. A number of journalists complained to me personally that they could not be at the airport or with police officers on search missions and, at the same time, hang around police headquarters awaiting a Press announcement by the General. It was the journalists themselves who suggested to me that perhaps Press releases could be issued on an embargo basis for everyone to obtain and then, if necessary, General Stretton could issue further comments either on the ABC which he was using for broadcasting purposes to the community in any event, or privately. At the request of the journalists I put it to the General that the sole officer of my Department who was in Darwin could assist in coordinating arrangements with the pressmen. General Stretton would not co-operate. He insisted on having his own Press conference. Indeed he is rezoned in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> to have said that he was spoken to by my departmental officer. The officer who was in Darwin at the time spoke to me on Thursday last. He said: &#39;I made no approach to General Stretton as he asserts in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin.</inline> I did not even speak to him. It was a Press officer from the Department of the Northern Territory who gave me what was virtually an army communications form with a scribbled instruction on it.&#39; </para>
        <para>I have already complained to the Editor of the Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror,</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Mr Galvin,</inline> about the inaccuracy of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oram&#39;s</inline> statement in last Thursday night&#39;s edition. I have explained that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Oram</inline> was one of the first people to approach me when I arrived in Darwin to obtain assistance for printing machinery to be obtained from the south for <inline font-style="italic">The Northern Territory News</inline> which, of course, was one of the Murdoch group of papers. At this stage I restrict my comments to these few matters. I intend commenting on these and other matters in detail in a later debate. However, it distresses me to think that a man of General Stretton &#39;s reputation is lending himself to this let&#39;s kick the politicians&#39; attitude in order to get cheap publicity for himself and his book. I suggest that this is a sentiment that is all too ripe in  the Australian community, particularly amongst some small time petty journalists. I have also complained to the General Manager of the ABC about the attitude being adopted by some of the Commission&#39;s journalists in obtaining a story from one source without affording the other side of the case to be put. Those people do the ABC and their profession a great disservice. </para>

            <para>-Perhaps I should change that but I will not on this occasion. The honourable senator can put it down as one he will hold against me at a later stage. It was suggested to me that since a commercial flight was leaving Brisbane and as this would be the first flight into Darwin I should go to Darwin on behalf of the Minister to see what assistance I could give. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Katter,</inline> the honourable member for Kennedy, and I were two of the first people into Darwin on that commercial flight. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Katter</inline> went his own way to assist the people of Darwin. I endeavoured to do my best to assist in the very tragic situation. I participated in two or three meetings of the very excellent committee which was set up by the citizens of Darwin and which assisted Major-General Stretton. </para>

        <para>Major-General Stretton makes a couple of remarks in his book which seem to indicate that I grafted myself to him, that I took a very paternal interest in his welfare, and that at one stage he ordered me out of Darwin. (That challenge I took up and suggested he should try.) He realised that he did not have either the authority or the power. Nor was it just in the circumstances to do what he threatened. My paternalism towards General-Stretton was prompted by the fact that in the few days that he had been in Darwin he had had very little rest. He had reached a stage of exhaustion. I made a suggestion to him, as did some of his military advisers, who played an excellent role in the Darwin tragedy, in spite of what General Stretton says, that he should get some sleep, that he had reached the stage of complete exhaustion and was in danger of an  emotional breakdown. Subsequent events proved that to be correct. </para>
        <para>Major-General Stretton also mentions that I came into conflict with him and had some very strong words to say. This came about in this way: My role and that of many other politicians who were there- I remember in particular <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Dawn</inline> Lawrie, one or two other members of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, and the honourable member for the Northern Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Calder)</inline> were there- was an important role. It was a liaison role to see that the people of Darwin were assisted. We were able to carry this out effectively, because members of Parliament have an authority and facilities which they were able to use to assist the evacuation that was taking place. In the meetings that took place with the Acting Prime Minister at the time, Jim Cairns, and with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Snedden,</inline> it was agreed that the pressure on Darwin should be relieved by evacuation of the women and children, the infirm and the ill. To Major-General Stretton &#39;s credit, he entered into that exercise with great enthusiasm. In fact, he was able to set in operation one of the massive evacuations of modern time. But the guidelines were set down that only women, children and the infirm were to be evacuated and that Darwin was not to be stripped of its work force. The <inline font-weight="bold">Major was</inline> quite wrong. On the third day all the women and children who wished to leave - </para>

            <para>- I think the matter is a little more serious than I am allowing it to become, so I should concentrate on what I am saying. The Major-General insisted that the evacuation should continue and that the work force of Darwin, able-bodied men, should also be evacuated. It was at that point that we had a disagreement. All my time had been spent at the airport and the instructions were that only women and children should be evacuated. We were assisting in that evacuation. It was when the men began to arrive seeking to evacuate that I decided to discuss the matter with Major-General Stretton It was then that we had the disagreement. </para>

        <para>Major-General stretton carried out a very difficult exercise in a very extraordinary way, and no credit should be taken away from him in the performance of that exercise. But I believe his recollection is faulty and he is doing an injustice to many people, including <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. He is doing a great disservice to those people who gave their best to the effort without seeking any credit for themselves. The greatest of credit should be given to the Army personnel in Darwin and to the pilots who flew the Hercules aircraft. They carried out a very difficult exercise, at great danger to themselves, flying around the clock. It is not to Major-General Stretton &#39;s credit to diminish their role in any way. </para>
        <para>I now come to the conclusion of my personal explanation. I take great offence at an article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> written by Jim Or am. Jim Or am implied that I sought to take advantage of the tragic situation in Darwin to obtain some personal credit. I do not even remember Jim Or am. He manufactured a conversation and reported it in inverted commas. I consider that to be highly offensive. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> is one of the News Limited newspapers. I understand that the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> is the newspaper which carries the banner for News Limited. There was at that time in Darwin a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Evans who was the Editor for Queensland for the <inline font-style="italic">Australian.</inline> Some weeks after the Darwin disaster he wrote to me. I will read the letter into the record because it gives the lie to Jim Or am. David Evans wrote: </para>

          <para>I would like to add that I was extremely impressed by the way the National Disaster Organisation, and in particular General Stretton, coped so magnificently with the problems of Darwin. I feel no government, anywhere, could have done more under the circumstances. </para>

Through this personal explanation I also seek to remind Jim Or am of this letter which was sent by an editor of the company for which he writes. Many politicians, both from the Government and from the Opposition, rendered tremendous service in Darwin. It is quite extraordinary that some journalist should take the opportunity, on the initiative provided by Major-General Stretton, to denigrate politicians. Politicians have a particular role to play in such disasters and I think that they should continue to play that role. They should not in any way be inhibited by scurrilous comments such as those made by Jim Or am in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror</inline> of last Thursday. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">I would like the Senate to know that Queenstown faces a crisis. The cut of 40 per cent in the work force at the Mount Lyell mine is of great concern to Queenstown and the adjacent areas. Queenstown and Gormanston in Tasmania, with a combined population of 5500 people, are virtually solely dependent on the existence of the Mount Lyell mine. From speaking to the people of Queenstown on Thursday and Friday of last week I know that the announcement of the cutbacks has caused a crisis which is causing heartache and havoc in the area. It will cause more problems further up the line. </para>
          <para>This is my first urgency motion in the Senate. I realise that urgency motions take precedence over Government Business; so it is not my intention, since I want the Government to act and to act urgently, to speak for very long in this debate or to draw out the debate. I have taken the unusual step of moving an urgency motion because I believe that action is urgently required to overcome the specific problem and crisis which the </para>
          <para class="block">Queenstown, Gormanston and Zeehan areas will face as a result of the cutbacks. We are not talking of a mining township just recently established; we are talking about a well settled area, settled since the latter pan of last century. I will distribute pictures of Queenstown to honourable senators from other States so that they can see, as my colleagues from Tasmania know, that Queenstown and the surrounding areas are well settled and beautiful areas. </para>
          <para>By virtue of hard work the people in the area, the pioneers of the area, built the Mount Lyell mine into what was described recently by Kerry Pink of the <inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> as &#39;the doyen of west coast mines and amongst the great veterans of the Australian mining industry&#39;. Not only did the workers contribute with their sweat and labour to creating a mine of this status but also the company poured millions of dollars into development of the mine. The new company, Consolidated Gold Fields Australia Ltd which took over the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd in 1 964, has spent many millions of dollars developing the mine. In late 1960 the company began a $50m program to develop new underground mines. The mines that have been worked until now are the Prince Lyell, the Lyell Thar sis, the Crown Three, the Twelve West, the Cape Horn, and the &#39;A&#39; Lens. </para>
          <para>To put the situation into perspective, last year the mine produced 2 215 412 tonnes of ore for the recovery of 83 254 tonnes of copper concentrate. Most of that went in exports- exports to Japan were 71 270 tonnes- and 19 601 tonnes went into local consumption through Port Kembla. Last year Mount Lyell also produced 102 135 tonnes of pyrite concentrate for Northwest Acid Pty Ltd. The mine is not short of ore reserves, which are currently proved at more than 27 million tonnes assaying at 1.46 per cent copper. By far the biggest ore body- more than 24 million tonnes- is in the Prince Lyell mine. So, here we have mineral reserves which are able to be extracted if action is taken urgently. The people are there, the community is there and the social and economic infrastructure is there. All that is required is some urgent action by governments to give a breathing space to the operation so that when the good times of higher copper prices come or when sterling improves, not only Queenstown and Tasmania, but also the whole of Australia will reap the benefit. </para>
          <para>Against this backdrop, the announcement that was made to the men last Thursday, 4 November, came as a shock. People will say: They saw it coming&#39;. A number of people thought that something had to be done, but the magnitude of the cuts- 40 per cent of the work force- was not envisaged. The company said in a statement to the employees, which was phoned through to my office by the secretary of the Australian Workers Union on Thursday morning: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Drastic steps are required to safeguard the future of Queenstown and operations at the Mount Lyell company. It has been decided that production will be reduced significantly with an even more significant reduction in operating costs . . . North Lyell Mines will be closed in the course of the next few months and early in the New Year the mill will reduce to a 5-day working week. At the same time the overhaul and some other sections of the West Lyell Workshops will be transferred to the main workshop area and the West Lyell Workshops closed. Other economies will be effected through closure of the sawmill, Apprentice Training Centre - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Which subsequently the State Government has decided to continue-  single men&#39;s and single staff quarters, and a general reduction in total manning in line with the reduced scale of operations. In total some 400 staff and award employees will be retrenched, leaving an operating establishment of approximately 600 persons. </para>
          <para class="block">It is a very savage blow indeed. But need we accept it? The mining company consistently over almost the last 2 years has brought to the attention of the Government the problems that it expected to arise. I will enumerate to the Senate the approaches that have been made so that it is a matter of record. At the end of January 1975 <inline font-weight="bold">Dr J.</inline> F. Cairns and other then Government members visited Queenstown and had discussions with company officials. On 11 March 1975 a letter was sent to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ron</inline> Davies, M.H.R.- which he subsequently forwarded to the Treasurer- outlining the company&#39;s problems as discussed with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cairns.</inline> It instanced low copper prices, the high cost of production and the heavy tax payments as a result of the removal of concessions by the Government. During 1975 the company prepared a comprehensive submission for the Industries Assistance Commission, and I will deal with those submissions and the results of the IAC inquiry in a moment. </para>
          <para>On 12 December 1975, which was the day before the election of the Fraser Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brian</inline> Massy-Greene, who is  chairman  of the company, visited the Department of Minerals and Energy. The acting Secretary of that Department, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Townsend,</inline> suggested that the company should await the result of the IAC inquiry before taking further action. On 15 December 1975, the  chairman  of the company wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> Scully, the Secretary of the Department of Minerals and Energy, outlining factors responsible for the financial difficulties- the need for capital to complete No. 1 shaft complex to keep the mine operating; lower copper prices, actuals and forecasts; and inflation and its effects on costs. He also pointed out the effect of mine closure on Queensland and elsewhere, including Gormanston and Zeehan, and on the Emu Bay railway, the North- West Acid Pty Ltd and the ER and S refinery at Port Kembla which refines the copper. On 19 December 1975 the  chairman  of the company and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> P. Land rig an, met the  Deputy  Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony,</inline> who was advised that the mine could close in the absence of government assistance. Cabinet considered these submissions during January and February and in February announced that no assistance would be forthcoming. </para>
          <para>I am informed by the company that in April 1976 the State Opposition Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Max</inline> Bingham, wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> suggesting that he should visit Queenstown. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> subsequently declined the invitation on 4 May 1976. During April and May 1976 the company pressed the Federal Government for time to pay $1.3m income tax which became payable on 30 April 1976 as a result of the withdrawal of taxation concessions by the Whitlam Government. Despite representations on behalf of the company by the Premier of Tasmania, the  Hon.  W. A. Neilson, to the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, the Commissioner of Taxation was not authorised to remit payment beyond 30 June 1976. The company and the workers have kept the Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson,</inline> fully informed of the state of affairs at Mount Lyell. The Premier and members of his Cabinet, as well as members of the Opposition, have visited Queenstown on a number of occasions during the last 12 months. Then on 3 November 1 976 the  chairman  of the company, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brian</inline> Massy-Greene, visited <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon</inline> to inform them of the proposed retrenchments. </para>
          <para>I mentioned that the company had made submissions to the Industries Assistance Commission. The Commission forwarded its report to the Special Minister of State on 14 November 1975. It had been commissioned to make a report in accordance with a reference made on 17 September 1975 under section 23 of the Industries Assistance Commission Act. The submission of the company is summarised in appendix 6 of the report. I do not propose to go into it because all honourable senators have received copies of the report, but I wish to refer to a couple of matters that were mentioned in the report. On page 10 the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The mines of witnesses with higher costs are remote from other centres of either mining or industrial activity. As a result, any downturn in mining activities at those locations will have much more significant implications Tor other businesses located nearby than would be the case were other major industries also located at the towns involved. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Later the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>For Mount Lyell the effect on employment and business activity at the associated townships of Queenstown and Gormanston would probably be more dramatic as there is virtually no alternative industrial employment in the area. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is the reason that I have raised this matter of urgency. Because of the effect that closure of the Mount Lyell mine will have on the small communities of Queenstown and Gormanston, I believe that there is a particular case to be made out for Mount Lyell. When I first came into the Senate I was advised that the Senate was a House designed not only to uphold the rights of the States but also to protect smaller communities and the rights of minorities. I think we all are aware of the situation regarding the small communities of Queenstown and Gormanston. The people in those communities have contributed by their hard work and labour over many years. There are workers with the company whose fathers worked with the company and whose fathers before them worked with the company. They go back to 4 generations. We see that the axe has fallen and some of these workers will need to uproot their families and move out of the area in which they have lived for many years. </para>
          <para>What is the answer? I believe the answer is that urgent action should be taken to give a breathing space. The Industries Assistance Commission recommended that the Government should offer to guarantee trading bank or other commercial borrowings arranged for this purpose, that is, for the purpose of giving a breathing space. The Commission also recommended that the guarantee should apply to both principle and interest. Anyone looking at that knows that it is completely inadequate. The Commission, as it stated, sought to devise a means which would make fewer claims on public funds than a subsidy but which would afford the operators of mines the opportunity of remaining in production if they consider that they have a viable future in the industry in the long term. Certainly the company and people with a bit of common sense know that the Industries Assistance Commission recommendation on its own will not save the situation as far as Mount Lyell is concerned. The result of the cutback will be that the mine instead of producing 22 000 tonnes of copper per annum will be reduced to producing 1 5 000 tonnes of copper per annum. </para>
          <para>The reason for the difficult position facing the mine is mainly that the price of copper has fallen to below $1,000 a tonne. It has risen to approximately $2,000 per tonne in the last 10 years. The price has fluctuated severely in that time, but at the present moment it is below the cost of extracting and producing a tonne of copper. So we have a situation in which production will be reduced from 22 000 tonnes to 15 000 tonnes of copper. </para>
          <para>I suggest that the Government should implement a program to buy the difference between the 22 000 tonnes currently produced and the 1 5 000 tonnes that is projected to be produced per year, and that it stockpile the copper concentrates at Burnie. The only alternative is to relocate and readjust the 400 workers, their families and their dependants somewhere else in Tasmania or elsewhere. Because of the employment situation in Tasmania many of those workers just will not get a job. The latest figures on unemployment which were released last week by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street)</inline> snowed that for every job vacancy in Tasmania there are 10 job seekers. The position is that the workers who are bound to go from Mount Lyell will find it very difficult to get a job and the Government will have to sustain them and their families by paying the unemployment benefit and adjustment assistance. The Government will not receive the income tax it receives from the workers at the present time. The municipalities will not receive the rates that are paid at present. In short, the workers and their families, instead of being strong contributors to the economy, will become a burden on the economy. </para>
          <para>I have been doing some analysis of the figures in respect of these matters. I have some pages of figures and am having them checked at the present time. Therefore I am not in a position to table them in the Senate. On a rough cost benefit analysis my proposal for the Government to buy the difference between the tonnage that was produced last year and the tonnage produced this year, thus saving the jobs of the 400 workers is far preferable than paying the costs of sustaining the workers who will be put out of work. Of course the copper would be the property of the Government. The Government would not be giving a grant to the company. The Government would own the copper. It could sell the copper on the international market whenever the price goes up. Some people might say that is a long wait but let me quote what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brian</inline> Massey-Greene said in an interview with the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He was asked: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>You say in your projections you do see a substantial price increase in copper at least in the long term. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The answer was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Yes, we do. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He was also asked: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>What sort of increase do you see? </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The answer was: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>We would expect that the 1978-79 price of copper would be somewhere in the bracket, expressed in terms of Australian dollars, between $ 1 ,700 and $ 1 ,800 a tonne. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government could buy the copper from the company now at the cost to the company of producing and the maximum the Government would have to pay would be in the vicinity of about $1,500 a tonne. If the Government stockpiles the copper until 1978-79 it will make a profit and it will keep people in jobs. In order to keep up production the company would have to continue with its development plans. That is where the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission could come in- that is to say, the recommendations relating to the provision of guarantees for borrowings arranged for the purposes of development. On page 1 5 of the IAC report it does say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>An administrative problem associated with the guarantee proposal will be to decide what items of expenditure and revenue should be included in calculation of a cash breakeven position. For example, if a producer wished to include essential development work - </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise the words &#39;esential development work&#39;- in his cash costs there would seem to be no reason to object, but a different view might be taken of a major new capital investment. </para>
          <para class="block">We are talking about essential development work. As recommended by the IAC there would be a guarantee on which the company could fall back for essential development work to keep up its production which is required to maintain its workers in employment. </para>
          <para>I have taken this opportunity to move an urgency motion for the first time. I believe there is a way out of this problem. I hope that the discussions which will take place today will prove that urgent action is needed and that it will be taken. I do not believe that a Senate select committee as was foreshadowed by one honourable senator today will solve the problem. I suppose the most sanguine of people would not expect to have a report from a Senate committee within a period of 6 months and in that time the people who will have been given notice of termination of their employment will have gone down the road, will have been dislocated and dispersed where to, we do not know. Of the number of people to go it is interesting to see that a large number are technical and skilled workers. These are the people who, once they go from the mining area, will be hard to get back into this area. The Government should recognise it costs a lot of money to train such people. This also is an investment which I believe should be preserved. It is one of the investments that I mentioned in the terms of the urgency motion, which I commend to the Senate for support. </para>

Perhaps it is only coincidence that this urgency motion has come this afternoon right at the very moment when discussions are taking place between those 2 gentlemen. Perhaps it is also coincidental that the Premier of Tasmania, I understand, said that if his 24-point plan were not accepted by the Prime Minister today he would call an immediate State election in Tasmania. Perhaps all this is but coincidental. One would really like to think that none of this was coincidental but that the whole purpose of the debate this afternoon was about the plight of both the company and the people employed on the west coast of Tasmania. </para>

          <para>What has been overlooked in the debate so far is that what is happening in Queenstown is that the people there are but reaping the tragic whirlwind of the Whitlam Government&#39;s inflation. I shall give some figures which will show the extraordinary position that has developed. Something has been said here about copper prices. I should like to list these copper prices: In 1 97 1 -72 the average price of copper was $A927 per tonne; in 1972- 73, $999; in 1973-74, $1,615; in 1974-75, $998; in 1975-76, $1,063; and to 3 November this year, $996. In 1971-72 wages cost the company $7,913,000; in 1972-73, $8,258,000; in 1973- 74, $10,407,000; in 1974-75, $12,481,000; and in 1975-76, $13,052,000. In 1971-72 the price of copper was $927 per tonne and wages amounted to $7.9m. This year, when the price of copper is $996 per tonne, wages amount to $ 13.052m. </para>

              <para>-I am just saying that this is the burden of inflation. I turn to the employment figures. In 1971-72, 1433 workers were employed; in 1972-73, 1375; in 1973-74, 1384; in 1974-75, 1332; and in 1975-76, 1072. Employment has been falling. But if one looks at average earnings one sees that in 1971-72, when copper was worth $927 per tonne, average earnings were $5,522 a year. In 1972-73 the figure was $6,006; in 1973-74, $7,520; in 1974-75, $9,370; and in 1975-76, $12,175. I repeat, the price of copper at the commencement of the period was $927 and average wages were $5,522 a year per worker and the total wages bill was $7. 9m. Five years later, the price of copper is $996 per tonne- a marginal movement- the total wages bill was $ 13m, and average earnings were $12,000 a year. Honourable senators wonder why the company is in problems. I turn now to look at State government charges. </para>

              <para>- Yes. In 1972-73 payroll tax charges were $205,000; in 1973-74, $412,000; in 1974-75, $650,000; and in 1975-76, even with the rebates, $639,000. In 1972-73 copper was worth $999 a tonne and the company was paying $205,000 payroll tax. This year copper is worth $996- $3 less- and the company is paying $639,000 in payroll tax. I turn to workers compensation payments, a matter which is entitled to be taken into account. In 1971-72 these payments cost the company $300,000; in 1972-73, $418,000; in 1973-74, $448,000; in 1974-75, $1,400,000; and in 1975-76, $1,200,000. </para>

              <para>- What I am getting at is that if honourable senators take 1972-73- they are more comparable figures, that being the last year of our previous administration- when copper was worth $999 per tonne, and this year when it is worth $996 per tonne, and then if they look at what inflation has done to this mining company in that period, the wages bill having risen from $8m to $13m and the price for its product being the same, its payroll tax payments having risen from $200,000 to $600,000 and its workers compensation charges having risen from $418,000 to $1,200,000, they should not wonder why the company is going broke. </para>

              <para>- Why is it going broke? It has nothing to do with free enterprise. It just shows the wickedness of the policies pursued by the previous Labor Government which have bankrupted a company, ruined a State and are now putting the employment of the workers which Labor purports to represent in jeopardy. In fact their employment is almost destroyed. Members of the Opposition will have the cheek to go to Queenstown and shed their crocodile tears about how they sympathise with the workers in the town and how sorry they are for them. Effigies of members of the Opposition ought to be burnt at a public meeting by the citizens of these towns. It is not just Queenstown that this has happened to ; it has happened in my own State to the gold mining industry in Kalgoorlie. Place after place around Australia was ruined by 3 years of economic mismanagement with the mad, lunatic policies pursued by the previous Minister for Minerals and Energy who appeared to devote most of his energies to borrowing $4,000m from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Khemlani</inline> rather than getting on with protecting the jobs and livelihoods of the people within Australia. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>That is really what this debate is all about. It is of no use members of the Opposition coming in at the eleventh hour with proposals. The previous Government set out on a deliberate path to milk or to make the rich mining companies pay. What about the things the Labor Government said. It said that all miners were hillbillies and that the Government ought to have no sympathy for them. What is the end result of the policies of the Labor Government? Mines are closing down and people are losing their employment. All of a sudden Labor Party members say that that is the trouble with the system; that is the trouble with capitalism. The trouble with the system, of course, was the enforcement of the stupid socialist policies of the previous Government. Labor Party members can talk as much as they like; that is where the blame lies. They must pick up the blame for it. </para>
          <para>The Tasmanian Government, of course, is now very worried about all this. It has an election to be held on Saturday, 4 December. Evidently everybody in Tasmania knows that, except the Tasmanian Labor senators. As I understand the position, halls are being booked, newspaper space is being booked, and all the things that normally are done before an election campaign are being done. Nobody appears to be in any doubt that Saturday, 4 December, is the day. So everything is being orchestrated for the election to take place on that day. The Premier of Tasmania is in Canberra today hoping that he can obtain an excuse to say: &#39;I really did not want an election. I would rather have waited until next year. But because the Prime Minister has been so wicked to me I must go back to Tasmania and hold an election right away&#39;. As my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack,</inline> said at question time, the whole thing is being stage managed. But it is being stage managed in such a blatant manner that even those people who normally would support the Labor Party in Tasmania ought to wake up to what is happening. </para>
          <para>One can quite properly ask this question: If the Tasmanian Government believes that it ought to be in government and that it ought to be allowed to govern, what is it doing about the problem of Queenstown? It is no use the Tasmanian Government saying that it is short of money because, as my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> has said in this place a number of times, the Tasmanian Government is literally rolling in money. It has $ 1 7m left over from last year and this year under the federalism plan it is receiving $4m more than it would have received under the Whitlam formula. So, carrying forward last year&#39;s surplus, this year it has an extra $21m to spend. In what areas is it going to spend that money? It complains that we will not get on with establishing the Maritime College in Launceston, but at the same time it will not give us some Crown land so that we can use the money which we otherwise would have to spend on land on commencing the site works. </para>

          <para>I suppose the greatest condemnation of the Neilson Tasmanian Labor Government is that now that there is freight equalisation northbound there are vast opportunities for the Tasmanian Labor Government to get off its tail and to encourage industries to go to Tasmania, because there is no longer the freight disadvantage which has existed right up almost to this year when freight equalisation was introduced, and that Government is not doing that. Why will industry not go to Tasmania? It will not do so because it does not want to receive the treatment that the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd received during those years when it saw its payroll tax treble in 4 years and its workers compensation costs treble in three to four years. These are the matters which the Tasmanian Labor Government ought to be bending its mind and energies, if any, to correcting rather than its Premier coming to Canberra and expecting to be rescued 3 or 4 weeks before polling day. </para>

              <para>-The days when the Federal Government printed money are gone. We also need to remind ourselves of another matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> mentioned in his speech, and that is the recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission that the Government guarantee repayment of principal and interest on trading bank or other commercial borrowings to bring copper-producing companies to a cash break even position from January 1976 to June 1977. That recommendation was accepted by the present Federal Government on 17 May of this year. The interesting thing is that the Mount Lyell company has not approached the Government for assistance following that decision. </para>

              <para>- At one moment in this place the IAC is having praise heaped upon it for its hard-headed, sensible economic approach to these things. I have not heard any honourable senator complain about that decision of the IAC. Evidently it was arrived at after public hearings and after submissions were put to it by people from a wide range of fields including, I assume, the Labor Government of Tasmania. The Industries Assistance Commission came down with a report on 14 November 1975. As I recall the situation, that recommendation was accepted by the Government on 17 May 1976, and the Government&#39;s acceptance of that recommendation was announced by the Government. Since 17 May, the Mount Lyell company, for reasons best known to itself, has not approached the Government for assistance following that decision. I think that in itself points up the fact that the Mount Lyell company does not have much real confidence in its own future. </para>

He ought to be ashamed of himself. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne,</inline> who has been in this chamber for a long time, is saying to me: &#39;I intend deliberately to take pieces out of your speech, to take them out of context, and to use them around Queenstown&#39;. Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O&#39;Byrne,</inline> I am delighted to hear your admission. I think there is nothing in the motion itself to which the Government takes exception. Of course there is an urgent and immediate need for governments to act to preserve human and economic investment, not only in Queenstown but also in all towns. We do not mind the wording of the motion. The Government does understand the problems associated with the possible retrenchment of more than 400 people and the consequent dislocation of their families. Do honourable senators opposite think we on this side of the chamber are not concerned about it? Do they think governments are not concerned about it? </para>

              <para>-One would think that if the honourable senator were concerned about these matters he would be doing other things to help. One would think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> would be trying to get some sense into the waterside workers and the maritime unions that have almost ruined Tasmania through their industrial actions in the shipping trade during the last 30 years. We do not hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> making speeches about that. All these other problems flow from industrial unrest. The disabilities which Tasmania has suffered have arisen not so much from the fact that it is an island State as from the fact that so many people from Tasmania on the other side of the chamber have never been prepared to deal with the real problems, the real issues and the real disabilities which face that State and which fall into 2 categories, I suppose. The first category is that Tasmania has had 30 years of Labor government, which is one of the real disabilities. </para>

              <para>-There has been a Labor Government in Tasmania for 39 years and that is perhaps the greatest disability which the State has suffered. The second category is the industrial turmoil which no State Labor government and certainly no Labor senator or Labor member from Tasmania has ever been prepared to talk about, let alone been prepared to tackle. This matter has been raised at a late hour. As I said, the Prime Minister and the Premier of Tasmania are discussing these matters this afternoon. I give <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> the benefit of the doubt that he is not playing politics, but I imagine that honourable senators opposite who will follow me in this debate will be playing politics and one can almost anticipate and debate what they will be saying. I assure the Senate that the Government is concerned about this problem. It is concerned about the problem because it has been brought to the Government&#39;s attention by honourable senators and honourable members who sit on the government side of the Parliament. The Government will not oppose the motion because it is concerned about the matter and it is using its best endeavours to alleviate hardship. I hope that honourable senators opposite will take much the same view and that they will be concerned also to alleviate hardship and not promote the fortunes of the Tasmanian State Labor Government for 4 December next. </para>

            <para>- I should like to be associated with this motion and indicate that the Labor Party is supporting the proposal before the Senate. I want to address my comments principally to this matter today on the basis of my experience as one who has actually lived and worked in the community of Queenstown on the west coast of Tasmania. Unlike the previous  speaker  in the debate, the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> who seemed to be preoccupied with statistics and various elements of economics, I should like to make some observations on the human tragedy that is inherent in the situation that is arising on the west coast of Tasmania. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I went to Queenstown shortly after the war in 1946, despite the warnings from many people who said: &#39;It is cold, it is wet, it is isolated, it is rugged and living is difficult&#39;. I guess there was a good deal of truth in that. They failed to tell me about the qualities of the people who lived there. This applies to generations of people. It applies to the pioneers who went into the rugged west coast of Tasmania, opened up the mining areas, established the little villages and provided the elementary and basic services which were required to sustain them in those days. Through the years they saw through their own efforts and cooperation with the management of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd the development of the towns and centres which provided the way of life for the people in the remote and rugged areas of the west coast of Tasmania. I learnt to live with those people, to share their experiences and to engage in sport and various cultural activities with them. I learnt the qualities of the people who seemed to gravitate to the mining areas and who found enjoyment, happiness and contentment in the sort of conditions that obtained there and who brought up their families in those areas. It was fascinating to me, as one newly arrived in an area such as that from the rich agricultural country of the north west of Tasmania, to note that people who had lived on the west coast and who had given their services to their country by working in the mines- because they could not actively participate in the Armed Services- to produce those basic materials of war that were so necessary, shortly after the war decided that they would go to live somewhere else. It was remarkable how many people came back to Queenstown to live and said: &#39;There is no place like this. This will do us. There is something that we can get out of life here that is not available to us anywhere else&#39;. It seemed to become part of the life of the people. The way of life in Queenstown was deeply ingrained in them. They are the sort of people about whom we are now concerned. In his opening remarks on this matter <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> said that Queenstown is a community of about 5000 people who are wholly dependent on mining, as distinct from many other mining areas that one can recall throughout Australia where, when the mine was worked out, the people were able to engage in some other sort of activity. That cannot happen in Queenstown because there is no opportunity for any other type of human activity in that area. </para>
          <para>I am conscious of the fact that I have only a few minutes in which to address my comments to the Senate. I can remember the mines on the west coast of Tasmania- at Queenstown in particular providing during the depression years employment which was not available to people anywhere else. I can remember- I was reminded by the comment made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradinethat</inline> the industrial relations which have existed at Queenstown, and particularly in Queenstown, since 1927 have been very good. In 1927 there was a serious industrial upheaval at Queenstown but ever since then the mine management and the employees, through their unions and representatives in the various industrial areas, have come together at regular intervals to work out a system of operation between management and the employees which has led to a very happy relationship. I think it is unique in the history of Australian industrial relations that Queenstown has been able to sustain such a happy industrial situation. I am quite certain that the feelings of the employees at this time are shared to a very substantial degree by the management of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd. </para>
          <para>I knew 2 general managers of the Mount Lyell company who, I think, were born on the west coast, who certainly grew up there, who went away and studied mining engineering and who later came back as general managers of the Mount Lyell mines. There is a good relationship between the management and the people who worked in the mines. For instance, I have seen the general manager of Mount Lyell mine spend a whole Sunday umpiring cricket. That is an example of the relationship that has always existed between the people throughout the whole community. It has been a co-operative effort and it has been a splendid, wonderful and commendable effort. As one who has worked and lived with the people in Queenstown I find it sad to observe what is happening at the present time. As I said earlier, generations have contributed to the solvency and the development of the mine, and to the development of the capital that has enabled the mine to invest in so many other activities. It has been able to invest its funds in other activities from the profits of the operation of the Mount Lyell mine in years gone by. This has enabled it to carry on through various vicissitudes and economic difficulties that have confronted it from time to time. People from the English speaking world, people from the Welsh mines, people of Irish origin, German, Italian and many other ethnic origins work happily together on the west coast as part of a happy community. </para>
          <para>The question that has arisen is that 400 people will be retrenched. An important point to realise is that not only 400 people are involved. The number involved is 40 per cent of the total west coast community. The mine is everything in Queenstown. If 40 per cent of the employees of the mine are dismissed and have to go elsewhere the impact will be not only on those 400 people but also on their families. I should like to refer to an article in the Tasmanian Press today which stated that one man with 10 children has been affected by the retrenchments and has to go to some other part of the country to find himself a job. Where does a miner with special skills find employment suitable to his qualifications and earn an income commensurate with the sort of income he has had in the past? If he does not obtain employment he falls back on social welfare benefits. He and his family then have to be sustained from the public purse anyway. It is appropriate that governments should be involved. In a television interview the other night the general manager of the company said that the Tasmanian Labor Government could not have done more than it had. He said he regretted that he could not say the same for the Federal Government. </para>

              <para>- If it is a lie the honourable senator can tell him that. The people of Tasmania accepted it as the truth of the situation coming from the top executive person in the community. Implicit in the proposition that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is to put tomorrow is his suggestion that we should do certain things- in particular, we should determine the nature of assistance from the Commonwealth Government which is both practical and warranted and which will alleviate the social and economic dislocations of the Queenstown area of Tasmania. That is what we are about. But do we need to set up a Senate select committee to determine that? Implicit in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> proposition is an acceptance of the social and economic difficulties of that area. If the Tasmanian Government can weigh in why cannot the Federal Government do so? When Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd was in trouble the Federal Labor Government of the day said: &#39;You have a special short term problem. We will help you. We will make provision to meet the interest charges on the money that you borrow&#39;. I think the amount needed to see the company through its difficulty at the time was $660,000 or thereabouts. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>There is a human problem in the Queenstown area. We talk about economic problems and statistics; I am talking about human beings. I am talking about people with families and communities of people who have learned to live and work together. It is not a one-way street. I have seen and been involved with the people of the west coast of Tasmania in the co-operative effort that saved the mine there in 1947. Every man jack worthy of his name in the town turned out on the night of the great fire of 1947. One man with 8 children in his family went in to the powder magazine. He said: &#39;I will go in there and I will stop any fires that start there, because this is my livelihood. This is where my family grew up. I am bound as generations before me have been to do all I possibly can to sustain this industry so that men in future can have employment here. &#39; I saw others risk their lives when the sawmill caught fire 3 times that night. Thousands of gallons of chemical reagent could have exploded at any time and wiped out the whole area. This is the sort of involvement people had and still have in the west coast mines. I venture to say that if a similar situation arose today those same people would turn out and do the same thing again. </para>
          <para>Those of us who are familiar with the history of the west coast will recall the tragedy of 1912 when 42 miners lost their lives. Their brother miners went into the mine and risked their lives they were duly rewarded in due course- to save their fellow workers. This is the sort of spirit that obtains on the west coast. They are strong and rugged people. I know that because I lived with them and engaged in the daily activities of normal persons in the community. I lived the life of those people. Over the years people have invested in property in the town. They have bought homes. What happens to those? Nobody will want them if the mine becomes insolvent. Who will buy homes in a town which has no other industry and nothing else to sustain the local populace? There are the makings of a human tragedy unless governments- only governments can do this- step in and help to alleviate this great problem. I was delighted to read in the Press the other day that during the course of the previous day the 2 opposing parties in the Tasmanian Parliament came together despite even the impending election. They were so conscious of the problem that they were prepared to come together, sink their political differences, and endeavour to arrive at a solution to the problem, which is a human problem before anything else. If it is not the function of governments to help and sustain people and communities I do not know what is. </para>
          <para>We have talked about the particular skills of people in the mining industry, skills developed over a great many years. There is a great love of mining. It somehow gets into the blood of people. When it gets to them that is their life. I remember a story concerning the general manager of the Mount Lyell copper mine who has become very well known in recent years. I want to tell this little story because it has a relationship to the feeling and spirit that exist in that community. There was a need to remove a substantial rock area of overburden. The company put in what was called a Tap drive. It drove into this overburden which had no copper in it and loaded it with 1000 cases of gelignite. When the general manager, who was a competent engineer, was asked whether it would be a great spectacle, he said: &#39;No, I do not think it will be. Firstly, my engineering knowledge tells me that it will not be a spectacle. The purpose of this will be to explode the hill and break it up so that it can be moved off with bulldozers. Secondly and more importantly, the experienced miners I have on the staff tell me that they will come up out of the mine and will sit on the top of it and eat their crib while the explosion of 1000 cases of gelignite takes place.&#39; I observed this incident, as many people in the community did. In fact, the miners were dead right. They had such a knowledge and understanding of the mining industry that they were able to tell the engineer who had planned the explosion according to the engineering skills he had acquired what would happen. </para>
          <para>That is part of the picture which I think we must bear in mind when we look at the total scene in this mining community. Another problem that the Mount Lyell copper mine has to face is that for the last thirty or so years it has worked in a very low grade ore. In fact, the flotation process which takes copper out of the crushed ore is so refined that it works on the basis of a recovery of 0.5 per cent to 0.75 per cent of the ore treated. When it gets over the quality of 0.75 per cent there is a loss of copper. The trouble is that when working with such low grade ore there is a need to process such a substantial quantity of ore. This does not take place at Bougainville where the miners are working on rich ore. When we talk about economics and the wage factor let us also take into account the physical properties of the area itself. So much low grade ore has to be treated to enable the mine to run on a proper economic level. I can see that my time has almost expired. I hoped at the outset to draw attention to the human problem, to the wonderful relations that have always existed, apart from a very brief period in 1927, between the management of the mine and the people in the community, to the co-operation that has always existed between those people and to the fact that the management has acknowledged the wonderful contributions of the State of Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- I commence by indicating my general support, along with that already indicated by the Leader of the Government in this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> for the general tenor of the urgency motion. It is a matter of urgency and great seriousness. It arises as a result of no fault on the part of the people most directly concerned, that is the people of Queenstown in Tasmania. In the remarks I propose to make I do not want it to be forgotten at any time that I am totally supporting the raising of a concern in relation to this matter as I have done in the past and will continue to do. But I wish to make this point at the start: There appears to be a blatant, cynical attempt by the State Labor Government in Tasmania to make political capital, to gain political kudos out of stunting in relation to the lives and futures of the people of the west coast. So blatant is it that I have no doubt that the amphitheatre-like open cut at Mount Lyell will be renamed the Neilson grandstand. </para>

              <para>- If it saved the mine, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> says, it would be a good thing, but let us look at the facts. The facts are these: First, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson,</inline> who now expresses his concern, was told on Friday, 29 October, of the impending action to be taken by the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd. He sat on that information for 6 days. The company sat on it too before it eventually got round to telling the Federal Government. When it did tell the Federal Government about it, it did not request any assistance. In fact, it indicated that it wished the closure, to the extent to which it was programmed, to go ahead so it could relieve itself of what it appeared to regard as an unwanted part of the work force. So great was <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> &#39;s concern that he sat on the information he had for 6 days, doing nothing but preparing to use it in an election campaign stunt. He did nothing about the real problem, which is the problem of what is to happen to the people to whom reference has been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> and others this afternoon. I regard that as being about as cynical as one can be. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>It is quite obvious that the company believes it can be viable only if it can reduce the work force and that it decided quite some time ago to reduce it by 400 people. It is quite obvious that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson,</inline> the Premier of Tasmania, and the General Manager of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Co. Ltd, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sawyer,</inline> have been in close consultation for many months. Notwithstanding an agreement which was made between the Federal and State governments to monitor what was happening at Mount Lyell in case a crisis situation should arise, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> did nothing during 6 days to inform the Federal Government of his knowledge of what was pending at Mount Lyell. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> talked about an urgency motion. It is made all the more urgent by the cynicism of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson.</inline></para>
          <para>In the short time available to me let me go on to make some other points. There have been at least 6 occasions on which the honourable member for Braddon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ray</inline> Groom, to whom reference has already been made, has had discussions with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sawyer.</inline> On each of those occasions he was told that there was nothing the Government could do and that the company was not seeking assistance from the Government. The most recent of those discussions was on 23 October. It is suggested by some, in particular it is suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sawyer,</inline> that the Commonwealth Government has in some way let the company and the people of the west coast down. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Groom</inline> is able to confirm and state the exact times and places of the conversations which he has had repeatedly throughout the year in the course of his job of looking after his electorate of Braddon, in which this west coast area falls. On 23 October, as I mentioned, there was a discussion at which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Groom</inline> was again informed that the company was not asking the Government for anything but that decisions might have to be made depending on what happened with regard to copper prices. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> said that copper prices had fallen and that they were below $1,000. I do not think he has done his homework in that respect because in fact they are rising. The price is now $ 1 ,045. </para>

The next point I would like to make briefly is that since the current crisis arose no request has been made by the company to the Commonwealth Government. Notwithstanding that, on an Australian Broadcasting Commission program in Tasmania <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sawyer</inline> made a statement which I wish to quote.  His  motives in all of this must be suspect. He has a record of being manager of companies which get into trouble and wind down. He is the one who seems to close them down.  His  record may be regarded as having some significance to the statement he made. It was blatantly political. He said: </para>

There is not an inconsiderable degree of concern and even suspicion amongst residents of Queenstown as to what has been going on with this multinational corporation reorganising its affairs perhaps to its best commercial advantage- something which it is entitled to do. In what has been going on with the share sales and the share reorganisation, why has it been so tough and so harsh with some of the shareholders as it has been with a resident of Queenstown, whom I shall not name? He is a retired man with a few shares in Mount Lyell. He was ill with the flu during the period when the share transactions were taking place. As soon as he was better, which from recollection was about 2 days after the closing date for applications for additional shares, he applied to take up his entitlement. He was refused.

              <para>- I am talking about when the reorganisation with the sale of Renison and Queenstown Investments was taking place, together with the buy back of Mount Lyell and all the other transactions which took place. I will not use any more harsh words at this stage. Let me simply indicate that there is far more in relation to this and the operation of the activities on the west coast than so far has been put forward in the Press or in the chamber. In no way am I denying the importance of the people of the west coast or the opportunity of the Mount Lyell company to continue to operate. I will support wholeheartedly any measures that can be taken by the Commonwealth Government. I have played a part in suggesting a number which can be taken, and I hope they will be taken following the discussions which have been taking place this afternoon between the Tasmanian Premier and the Prime Minister. But I regard it as unfortunate when a company starts to play politics in such an obvious way as this company has. I pay tribute to the work which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ray</inline> Groom has done over the past few days in particular. Following the announcement concerning Mount Lyell he spent 3 days in Tasmania investigating the matter fully and preparing a full report for the Commonwealth Government. Since he became a member of Parliament he has been constantly in touch with the Mount Lyell company. </para>

          <para>I would like to know, for instance, why that company has been pushing so hard the policy of selling to its employees their houses. This is another aspect which is of importance. The company is selling to its employees their houses. In normal circumstances this would be a good thing. But the whole time retrenchments have been steadily taking place and the work force is now down to less than half of what it was not very long ago. Many of the people who have bought the houses have invested their life&#39;s savings in them and will now face the risk of losing their life&#39;s savings rather than perhaps the company losing its investment in the houses which it has been selling off. Queenstown happens to be a peculiar mining town. Over 70 per cent of the houses there are privately owned. This is just one further aspect of the incredible problem of relocation of retrenched workers if this is to be pursued as policy. Who is going to buy the houses? Are the people to leave, to walk out, to just forfeit their savings? Or will they find themselves in a position where they have no real option but to stay there, residing in their houses and drawing unemployment benefits until such time as the mine can take on further employees again? </para>
          <para>If the attitude which apparently has been displayed by the mine management is any indication, one wonders whether it will ever expand its employment. Why is it that the mine has not sought any government assistance? Why is it that the mine wants to play politics on this issue? Why is it that the mine has been engaging in a number of aspects of reorganisation which at least require some explanation, such as the hedging operations, from which it profited by $8m in 1975 but which have not been explained in the company reports, and the situation whereby it does not pay any mining royalties and pays precious little tax but makes plenty of money? I suppose that that is a good operation. </para>
          <para>As to the future of copper, it is necessary to bear in mind that some 2 million tons of copper is stockpiled around the world- a large part of it held by speculators who are being forced to sell copper which they bought at higher prices, thereby artificially depressing the price of copper on the world markets. How long it will take to sell that 2 million tons of copper is a matter for speculation, but it appears that it will take quite some time. In summary, I express my sympathy and, I am sure, the sympathy of all members of the Liberal and National Country Parties for the individual people of the west coast area who have been affected. We will do what we can to overcome the problem. But the situation will not be helped by grandstanding by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson;</inline> nor will it be helped by political attacks by the general manager of the company. </para>

            <para>- I am pleased to support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> &#39;s urgency motion concerning the problem which has arisen at Queenstown. I have found this debate interesting in 2 regards, in listening to the 2 speakers from the Government side this afternoon. I thought that we were to have a debate on the problems of the people of Queenstown, the problems of the employees of the Mount Lyell Mining and Railway Ltd, and what we as a Parliament and the Government might be able to do for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> spoke for half an hour and listed carefully the problems that are arising at Queenstown. He listed carefully the dates of the approaches by the Mount Lyell company to the Government. He summarised carefully some of the recommendations in the Industries Assistance Commission report. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>He was followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> who did not seem at all concerned about the people of Queenstown or the people of Mount Lyell. I remind honourable senators that the first thing <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> did was by implication to accuse <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> of staging this debate for the purposes of the election of the State Labor Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> smiles. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> smiles. I am not surprised. That was an extraordinary accusation to make about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> who found out about this case on Thursday and went immediately to Queenstown to see what he could do about it. He is now accused of staging a debate and requesting the Senate to express its concern for the people of Queenstown and Mount Lyell for the purposes of re-electing the State Labor Government. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> said, quite contrary to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said, that he could not see why this urgency motion was being moved, because for a long time the Government had been aware of what was happening at Mount Lyell and could see this situation coming. The Government&#39;s spokesman on this subject in this House, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> said that the Government could see this coming for a long time. Yet now 400 people- 40 per cent of the work force of this mining company have been given notice, and the Government still has not done anything. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> then proceeded to quote endless figures to show that the last Federal Labor Government was responsible for all the problems of the </para>
          <para class="block">Mount Lyell mine and that those problems were compounded by the policies of the State Labor Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> then told us that the company running the mine is in cahoots with the State Government and that this is a political stunt to re-elect the State Government. I ask honourable senators opposite to get together and make up their minds about what is happening at Queenstown. If they can make up their minds, perhaps then they can decide what can be done to help those 400 people- perhaps there will be more later- who have been put out of work. </para>
          <para>Some of the things which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> said about this multinational company may well be true. I questioned and trade unionists in Queenstown have questioned the policy of the company over the last 3 years of encouraging its employees to buy the company houses. But I believe that the malicious and vicious personal attack on <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sawyer,</inline> the general manager of the mine, was unnecessary and was not supported by any evidence. Remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> told us that the mine was suffering from the Tasmanian Labor Government&#39;s evil actions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> told us that the mining company was in cahoots with the State Labor Government. I can understand <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> sensitivity because a report in the <inline font-style="italic">Examiner</inline> of 6 November had this to say: </para>
          <quote>

It sent Ministers here yesterday, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> has personally taken a great interest in our problems over the past 1 8 months - not 6 days. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sawyer</inline> was reported as saying: </para>
            <para> I wish I could say the same for the Federal Government. </para>

          <para class="block">I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> listed the number of occasions on which the company has approached the Federal Government for help. </para>

              <para>-Mr Groom could not remember a conversation that took place 2 hours ago, let alone 6 days or 6 weeks ago. I point out that Queenstown, like all mining communities, is a cohesive, socially knit community which sticks together. This social .cohesion is made all the more important and all the more strong by its isolation. Despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers&#39;</inline> remarks, Queenstown and the Mount Lyell mining company have a record second to none in this country as far as industrial disputes are concerned. </para>

          </continue>
          <para class="block">The unions involved in the Mount Lyell mine get together, talk together and bury their differences. </para>
          <para>Last Sunday morning I happened to chair a meeting of the combined mine unions associated with the Mount Lyell mining company. The unions involved included the Australian Workers Union and the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union, which in Tasmania in the past have been known to have differences, the Federated Engine Drivers and Firemen&#39;s Association of Australia, the Electrical Trades Union of Australia, the Federated Ironworkers Association of Australia and the Building Workers Industrial Union of Australia- unions which in the past have not been noted for getting together as well as they should. But at that meeting there was a unanimity of opinion, there was careful discussion, and there were no fights and no arguments. They were concerned, as the unions in mining towns generally and in Queenstown in particular are, to look after the 400 people in Queenstown who have been removed from their work. </para>
          <para>This disaster in Queenstown- that is what it is- was unexpected. We understand from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> that it was unexpected by the Government, although we understand from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> that the Government has seen this coming for a long time. It certainly was unexpected by the workers at Mount Lyell, and we have the word of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Sawyer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brian</inline> Massy-Greene that it was unexpected by the company. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has evidence to the contrary he should produce that evidence and point out exactly where the company had been deluding the Government, the workers and the people of Tasmania. This disaster that has happened to this mining town will affect not only Queenstown and the Mount Lyell mining company but also the railways which take the ore, the business people in the town, towns as far away as Burnie and the whole north-west of Tasmania. We are concerned. I will concede that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> too is concerned, but I will not concede that in the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> spoke this afternoon he showed any concern for these people. Instead of showing concern he spent half an hour rubbishing the previous Labor Government, rubbishing the State Government and carrying on as though the State election had started and the election campaign was on. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline>dragged the Mount Lyell company into it and accused it of playing politics with this issue. The mining industry is an uncertain industry, as are many other industries in this time of world economic trouble. We have had industries that have got into trouble in Tasmania before. In fact, when we were in government we had difficulties with Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd when it could not get rid of its paper. The Government of which I was a supporter decided that part of the paper on which the telephone books in this country were printed should be purchased from App to help with its overstocking and a loan was made to App. This may not be the best way to solve problems in normal economic times but these are not normal economic times in this country or in the world and we will not have them for a long time. Electrolytic Zinc Company of Australia Ltd also had difficulties and came to the Government and got short term help. Employees retrenched fom the textile industry, partly as a result of tariff reductions, were also assisted. These were short term solutions but were aimed at helping the people who were affected and at alleviating the evil social effects of situations like this. </para>
          <para>Here we have a mining company that is an efficient mining company and one whose workers are loyal to it and who demonstrate this loyalty by their low record of industrial disputes. It is a mining company which has ore reserves of some thirty or forty years. It is a mining company which has a future. Yet we have a downturn in the world copper price bringing difficulties for this company, and all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> is asking and all that members of the Opposition are asking is that some help be given to tide these people who are suffering from the disastrous social effects of being off work over the problem they are in and to tide this town over the problem it is in. I have no glib solutions and shall present no glib solutions, nor do I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> presented any. It is up to governments which have at their fingertips experts to investigate this sort of problem. It is up to governments which have at their fingertips the information to sort out this problem. It is not up to me as an individual or up to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> or anyone else to solve this problem in a glib way on his feet in this chamber. </para>
          <para>If the Government has been aware that this has been coming for a long time it should be prepared to solve this problem. If the Government has not been investigating this problem for a long time it should be willing to come up with short term solutions to tide these people over until it has sorted out the problem. I have no personal objection to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> &#39;s motion to set up a Senate select committee to investigate this issue but in view of the record of Senate select committees in the past, including the King Island shipping inquiry and the three or five Senate select committees on Tasmania&#39;s transport problems, I have no great faith in the ability of Senate select committees to look into this problem. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> aim is that the select committee should look into the son of accusations he has made about this multi-national company, I am very much in favour of that sort of solution. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae&#39;s</inline> accusations are true I believe that the company should be brought to book about them and I will be interested to see what sort of solution <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has if he finds out that his accusations are true. </para>
          <para>However, the immediate problems of this town are the social problems affecting the miners and technical people who are being put off work. The immediate task is to remove the anxiety and the social problems which will inevitably arise if the Government does nothing. I offer no glib solutions. This motion expresses concern and asks for government action. The Government has the facilities at hand to find a solution to the problem, even a long term solution, but if the time is not available to sort out the long term solution I suggest that the answer is a short term solution to tide the people over until the Government has made up its mind. Then the people of Queenstown will have removed from their shoulders this anxiety which undoubtedly is affecting them now. I commend the motion. </para>

            <para>- I support the motion moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> in this chamber to express this chamber&#39;s concern for the predicament for the community of Queenstown, and it is laudable to notice that he puts it in positive terms of preserving the investment, both human and economic. I do not stay long on the question of human values but I support everything that has been said in praise of the community of Queenstown, a remarkably coordinated community and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> has mentioned, one that has an undoubted record of freedom from wasteful industrial disputes. It is because of the isolation of that community which is dependent solely upon one company that the problem becomes of unique significance. We are not nursery maids here. We are responsible representatives commanding the Treasury of the country by rejection or request in respect of legislation if need be and seeing to it that those who are required to pay taxes get public justice. However, one cannot form a judgment on a situation without having a look at the causes of the situation, </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Firstly, we remember the vendetta of the Whitlam Government- the Grimes Governmentstripping the mining companies of every justifiable deduction for income tax so that last year this company with a deficit on trading of about $2.5m was required to pay income tax of $1.6m or $1.3m. We should just consider that. Secondly we should notice the wage cost which was so inflamed and deliberately inflated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron while he was acting for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes.</inline> The salary costs were stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> These costs grew from $5. 5m in 1971-72 to $12.1m in 1975-76. Then there was the unfortunate fact that copper prices remained almost static. The figures are set out in a table which I have here, and in a moment I shall ask that the figures in detail be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> For my purpose I indicate that during the period copper prices remained static at an average of about $1,000 a tonne, although there was one upsurge to $1,615 a tonne in 1973-74. </para>
          <para>It is totally unjust for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> to wash his hands in the nursery where he is purifying the health of the community and to say that all this sympathy has developed in this political chamber, because there is a little electoral electrification of the atmosphere in Tasmania. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> has arrived in Canberra- of course totally unbeknown to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes-</inline> to hold a conference with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser. Mr Neilson</inline> has already invited the television and news media to be at his suburban residence in Belle rive at 9 o&#39;clock tonight to take home this great news so that it is impregnated with that political cunning which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Grimes</inline> seeks to disclaim but understands pretty well. </para>
          <para>The Neilson Government in Tasmania has helped along the situation concerning the Mount Lyell mine by trebling the rate of payroll tax between 1972 and 1976. The amount paid in workers&#39; compensation in the same period trebled from $300,000 to $ 1 .2m. That is a fantastic increase in workers&#39; compensation in one period for one company. Then to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> is full of the milk of human kindness and has no serum of the Connor poison to inject into the mining industry, let us go back to September last year when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> stoutly insisted, as if for once he was going to attitudinise as a statesman, that his Budget proposal of a 2 per cent turnover tax on gross production should be imposed. The Liberal Opposition kept up its battery of criticism about the absolute nonsense of a turnover tax of 2 per cent on minerals on top of a Federal income tax increased by Whitlam on top of a payroll tax increased by Neilson. In 6 weeks Neilson- perhaps it was nihilism- amended the impost so as to impose a tax of 2 per cent on gross turnover, or 5 per cent on profit, whichever was the less. The Mount Lyell mine escaped the impost only because on a proper adjustment of all the figures it had no profit. After it was subjected to the viciously-manoeuvred income tax scale of Connor when it was deprived of all its deductions, it was faced with an income tax burden of more than $lm. In 1972 the total ore produced was 2.4 million tonnes, and in 1976 it was 2.2 million tonnes. The average assay remained about the same. The total realisable copper produced decreased from 22 000 tonnes in 1972 to 20 466 tonnes in 1976. Gross receipts from sales increased from $2 lm in 1972 to $30m in 1976. 1 ask that the details in those statements to which I have referred be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

              <para>-That being the benefit that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Neilson</inline> applied to the company, it is truly appalling that he can be represented through the media as the saviour of the company and not the predator of the company, as experience has shown him to be. I conclude by saying that it would be altogether premature to offer solutions to this problem here on the floor of the chamber when dealing with a matter of urgency, especially as practical matters are being debated in the corner of this building by the responsible Ministers- the Tasmanian Premier and the Prime Minister. It has been suggested that a solution similar to that which was applied to the problem facing the Associated Pulp and Paper Mills Ltd should be applied to the problem concerning the Mount Lyell mine. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland, who applied that solution to the problem facing App at the very start of his term as a Minister, said that it was an <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> solution and that it would never be repeated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has made a suggestion about stockpiling. It has been suggested that relocation assistance and travel assistance should be provided. It has also been suggested that ordinary social services should be provided. One honourable senator has suggested the use of money which would otherwise be taken up as unemployment benefit to provide an assistance fund for the workers so that they can be employed for another 3 months or while it is ascertained whether the present position regarding copper prices might pass.  1/ <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> has put forward a valuable suggestion.

This report details the rationale behind the distribution and the amounts of Commonwealth funds to be received by individual authorities in 1976-77. There is a shortage of copies of the report. The Leader of the Opposition has one. There will be one, of course, in the Senate records office. I suggest that honourable senators may make use of those copies. </para>

        <para class="block">Before the debate is adjourned I want to pass a number of brief remarks concerning what I suppose will become known in history as the Hiatt report. It will be recalled that the Australian Labor Party in government set up the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee and there was much criticism from people in the Opposition at the time. I believe that the Hiatt report, as did the Hay report, has vindicated the activities of the Labor Party in government in establishing the initiatives, so far as Aborigines are concerned, that were covered by the Hay report and those that are now covered by the Hiatt report. </para>
        <para>It is not possible to speak at length on this report until such time as we have had an opportunity to peruse it. However, I note that among the recommendations is one which suggests that there be greater representation for tribal people in those areas of Australia where the Aboriginal and Island peoples are concentrated. It is unlikely that the Opposition will oppose that aspect of the report. However, I question the next recommendation which suggests that plenary sessions of the Acc be held only once a year with State branch and national executive meetings to be held four times a year. I hope that that matter will be reviewed by the Government, with the possibility of there being more frequent meetings of the total number of electorates represented on the Acc. Incidentally, it is recommended that the number of electorates be increased from 41 to 46. An election for representatives on the Acc is now long overdue. Most of the delay has been caused by the change of government as at 13 December last year and also by the fact that the Hiatt Committee was established to conduct an inquiry into the role of the Acc. The next recommendation probably will not receive a great deal of opposition, if any opposition at all, from the Labor Party because it suggests the sort of thing to which we were directing our attention at the time. </para>
        <para>I want to pay some tribute to the people who worked so well on the Committee, even though it was established by the present Government. A number of its members were highly qualified to conduct such an inquiry. I think the greatest vindication of Labor Party policy is the fact that the Acc will remain in operation, even though there will be a number of modifications in relation to its role. I hope that this report will become the subject of debate at a later date, both in this chamber and in the other place, and that we will be given an opportunity to study the report properly so that our Party will have an opportunity to go into the report in detail and then, if necessary I assume this will happen- be able to make the necessary legislative amendments in some cases. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

          </motion>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to authorise arrangements under which revenue from Commonwealth personal income tax collections is to be shared between the Commonwealth and State governments. The tax sharing arrangements with the States represent a central element of the Government&#39;s federalism policy. They replace the financial assistance grants which the States received under the States Grants Acts. The present Bill, accordingly, provides for the repeal of that legislation. In addition to the arrangements for sharing personal income tax collections with State governments, a share of Commonwealth personal income tax revenue is to be provided as untied assistance for local government. A Bill in relation to the arrangements for local government will be introduced immediately after the Bill before us now, and I propose that the 2 Bills be debated cognately. Federalism policy and the tax sharing arrangements central to it were, of course, the subject of Premiers&#39; Conferences in February, April and June this year. The Premiers welcomed the concept of a genuine, wholehearted federalism. </para>
          <para>Support of federalism means, of course, support of the Australian system of government, with each sphere of government- Federal, State and local- fulfilling its rightful role. Support of federalism means support of a proper distribution of powers and functions of government between these 3 spheres so that government may be responsive to the needs and preferences of the community and of individuals. Such a system of government can benefit from the input of local knowledge and talent and provides protection against excessive concentration of power. The centralist philosophy of the former Whitlam Government was, of course, directly contrary to this. The high objective of the Government&#39;s federalism policy is, therefore, to assist effective and responsible government in the Federal, State and local spheres. </para>
          <para>The tax sharing arrangements represent a significant step towards ensuring that the States and local government will have improved resources and greater flexibility with which to meet their responsibilities. This is not to say that the arrangements provided for by this Bill, and the Local Government Bill to be introduced hereafter, will complete the restructuring of financial arrangements between the spheres of government in Australia. For one thing, the policy, in fact, provides that the States should not be tied immutable to any one tax or set of taxes as their main source of revenue. If there are significant changes in the pattern of taxation, the States and, indeed, local government will be free to argue for appropriate changes in the arrangements. </para>
          <para>Under the tax sharing arrangements with the States provided for in this Bill the States will receive a specified proportion of the personal income tax collections made under Commonwealth legislation. On the basis of current estimates, the effect of the arrangements will be this year to provide the States&#39; with $643m or almost 2 1 per cent more than they received as financial assistance grants in 1975-76. On the basis of the same estimates, the States&#39; entitlement in 1976-77 would be $89m more than the States could have expected to receive this year under the old financial assistance grants formula. As the economy grows, the States&#39; revenue under these arrangements will, of course, also expand, as is the case, for example, with State payroll tax and stamp duty. Moreover, the tax sharing arrangements, which in the second stage will provide for State surcharges and rebates, will increase the States&#39; flexibility in determining the pattern and level of their revenue resources. </para>
          <para>The basic elements of the tax sharing arrangements for which this Bill makes provision may be summarised as follows: </para>
          <para>Each year, commencing in 1976-77, the States are to receive 33.6 per cent of a base amount- referred to as the &#39;base figure&#39; in the Bill. </para>
          <para>The base figure is to be net personal income tax collected in the year excluding the revenue from the Medibank levy and any other special surcharges or rebates which might be applied, in appropriate circumstances, by the Commonwealth. </para>
          <para>Irrespective of what the base figure may prove to be in any year, the Bill provides for guarantees that the States&#39; Stage 1 entitlements in any year will be no less, in absolute terms, than in the previous year. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for further guarantees that the States&#39; Stage 1 entitlements will be no less in any of the first 4 years, that is, the years 1976-77 to 1979-80, than the amount which would have been yielded in that year by the financial assistance grants formula as laid down in the States Grants Act as last amended in 1975. </para>
          <para>The total entitlement for all States is to be divided between the States so that the States&#39; per capita entitlements will bear the same relationship to one another as the relativities in the financial assistance grants in 1975-76. </para>
          <para>The arrangements as a whole are to be reviewed at some time before 30 June 1981, that is, before the end of 5 years from the commencement of the new arrangements. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the clauses of the Bill. Clause 4 sets out the definitions and is, of course, basic to an understanding of the Bill. In particular the definitions set out in clause 4 are central to the concept of the base amount to be shared with the States. Net personal income tax is, of course, defined as net of refunds of personal income tax made during the year and excludes company tax and withholding taxes on interest and dividends. Net Personal Income Tax&#39; as defined in the Bill is the same as the revenue item &#39;Income Tax- Individuals&#39; shown in Statement No. 4 attached to the Budget Speech and in other Budget Papers. Clause 5 provides the machinery to deal with special Commonwealth surcharges or rebates and reflects agreements between the Commonwealth and the States that the yield or cost of special surcharges or rebates applied, in appropriate circumstances, by the Commonwealth will not be included in the base figure from which the </para>
          <para class="block">States&#39; and local government entitlements will be calculated. This aspect of the arrangements is designed to protect the States from fluctuations in their shares which might result if, for reasons of financial management, the Commonwealth should decide to introduce a surcharge or rebate after, say, the States&#39; Budgets have been framed and their expenditure commitments made. As the Treasurer has already emphasised, clause 5 of the Bill would certainly not be applied without proper consultation with the States. </para>
          <para>Clause 6 provides for the Commissioner of Taxation to determine the &#39;base figure&#39; for each year, while clauses 7 and 8 authorise the payment to each State of its share of 33.6 per cent of the base figure, or the guaranteed entitlement, whichever is the greater. In clause 7 the Bill employs the term &#39;adjusted population figure&#39; in relation to each State as defined in sub-clause 4(1). This concept is used to calculate each individual State&#39;s share of the total entitlement for all States as prescribed under clause 7. Honourable senators may find helpful in this regard Table 6 in Budget Paper No. <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> &#39;Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities 1976-77&#39;. Clause 9 provides for the determination of State populations by the Australian Statistician. Clause 10 provides that the Statistician&#39;s determination in this respect and the Commissioner of Taxation&#39;s determination in regard to clause 6 shall be conclusively presumed to be correct. Clause 13 of the Bill makes provision for review of the tax sharing arrangements as a whole before 30 June 1981. The advances and appropriation authority provided in clauses 1 1 and 12 respectively are of a machinery nature similar to those in other legislation providing for financial assistance to the States. </para>
          <para>There are some points of understanding between the Commonwealth and the States relating to the tax sharing arrangements which appropriately are not specifically provided for in the Bill. These are documented in the Budget Paper No. 7. They include, importantly, agreement that the 4 less populous States will continue to be free to apply for special assistance grants on the recommendation of the Grants Commission in addition to their entitlements under the tax sharing arrangements. The Commonwealth has also given certain undertakings in relation to reviewing the arrangements when there are changes in Commonwealth tax legislation which have effects on the States&#39; entitlements of such significance as to warrant such a review. I should also mention that it is intended to make legislative provision for arrangements to periodically review the relativities between the States in their </para>
          <para class="block">Stage 1 entitlements. The precise nature of these arrangements is currently subject to further report by Commonwealth and State officers and consideration by governments. It has already been agreed, however, that advice in relation to this review will be sought from an independent body and that the first such review will be made before 30 June 1981. </para>
          <para>There are some general points I wish to make before concluding. The benefits to the Statesman local government- of the tax sharing arrangements are already apparent. I have referred to the very large increase in general revenue funds which the States will receive under the provisions of this Bill- almost 2 1 per cent more than the amount of comparable funds in 1975-76. General revenue assistance for local government under the tax sharing arrangements the subject of a further Bill- will be 75 per cent up on comparable funds in 1975-76. Overall, payments to the States and local government in 1976-77, including the State governments&#39; Loan Council programs, are estimated to total $9,077m. This represents an increase of 12.6 per cent over 1975-76 after taking into account hospital prepayments, or 14.6 per cent after excluding non-recurring payments made for unemployment relief in 1975-76. As honourable senators will know, that rate of increase substantially exceeds the planned rate of increase in the Commonwealth&#39;s own outlays as proposed in the Budget presently before the Parliament. </para>
          <para>State and local government funds from Commonwealth Budget sources are estimated, therefore, to increase overall by a significant amount in real terms this year. Importantly, and in keeping with the Government&#39;s federalism policy, the general purpose funds, which are increasing relatively fast this year, are available to the States and their authorities to allocate according to the priorities which they themselves determine. Unlike our predecessors we have and will emphasise general untied assistance for the States and local government. We entirely reject the notion of the Whitlam Government that Canberra knows the business of the State and local governments better than those governments themselves. </para>
          <para>In concluding I wish to record the Government&#39;s appreciation of the co-operative and constructive attitude which Premiers have brought to the discussion and development of the tax sharing arrangements which are embodied in this Bill. I believe the very considerable progress in the implementation of the total arrangements which this Bill represents is in large part due to the understanding and flexibility which Premiers have shown in their approach to the matter. It is a demonstration that federalism can work. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The purpose of this Bill is to provide for the sharing of personal income tax collections between the Commonwealth and, through the States, local government. It is, therefore, complementary to the Bill, which has just been introduced, which provides for the sharing of income tax collections with the States. As I said in connection with the other Bill, the tax sharing arrangements to apply between the Commonwealth, the States and local government were decided following extensive discussions between the Commonwealth and the States this year, and represent a central element in the Government&#39;s federalism policies. State Premiers were sent a copy of the Bill when it was introduced into the House of Representatives. Following comments which the Government received from the Premiers, several amendments were made to the Bill which clarified the effect of certain of its provisions. In particular clause 6 ( 1 ) (b) of the Bill was amended to make it clear that the Commonwealth has no wish at all to exercise a power of veto over the distribution of local government assistance recommended by the States&#39; local government grants commissions. </para>
          <para>Under the new arrangements provided for in this Bill, the Commonwealth will provide $ 140m in untied general purpose assistance grants to the </para>
          <para class="block">States in 1976-77 for distribution to local government. This is an increase of 75 per cent above the level of general purpose assistance provided to local government in 1975-76. In the present difficult budgetary circumstances, this large increase is clear evidence of the Government&#39;s determination to do what it can to ensure that local government authorities throughout Australia have sufficient funds to effectively carry out their important functions. </para>
          <para>In 1977-78 and each subsequent year the amount of general purpose assistance provided to local government authorities will constitute a given percentage of the previous year&#39;s personal income tax collections so that the level of general purpose assistance provided to local government in any year will be known with certainty very early in that year. Very importantly the amount of such assistance will grow as personal income tax collections grow. The percentage of 1.52 per cent included in the Bill flows from the arithmetic, and was obtained by expressing the level of assistance provided in 1976-77 as a percentage of 1975-76 personal income tax collections, in line with the agreed arrangements. </para>
          <para>I want to emphasise, however, that the Government regards the figure of 1.52 per cent as a minimum percentage. It is subject to review. I also take this opportunity to announce that, although it is not provided for directly in the Bill, the Commonwealth has decided it should provide a firm guarantee that the total entitlement of local government authorities as provided under this BUI will, in any year, be no less in absolute terms than in the previous year. This guarantee is, of course, similar to that provided in the States&#39; Entitlement Bill. I believe it will be greatly welcomed by local government authorities in Australia. The $140m of general financial assistance to be provided to local authorities in 1976-77 will be distributed between the States on the basis of the distribution recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission and agreed to by the Commonwealth and the States at the June Premiers&#39; Conference. Details of the amount to be provided to each State for on passing to local government in 1976-77 are set out in clause 5 ( 1 ) of the Bill. </para>
          <para>The percentage distribution recommended by the Commonwealth Grants Commission will also form the basis for allocating the assistance among the States in years subsequent to 1 976-77. Details of each State&#39;s percentage allocations in years after 1976-77 are set out in clause 5 (2) of the Bill. Clause 12 (2) of the Bill, however, requires that before 30 June 1981 the Commonwealth Grants Commission be asked to inquire into and report to the Government whether any change is desirable in these percentage allocations. The details of how the general purpose assistance is to be distributed to local government are set out in clause 6 of the Bill. The assistance to be provided will consist of 2 separate components, a weighted <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> componentcommonly referred to as element A- and an equalisation or &#39;topping up&#39; component- commonly referred to as element B. The weighted per capita component- element A- is required under the Bill to comprise a minimum of 30 per cent of each State&#39;s allocation of the total level of assistance, though each State will be free to distribute a greater percentage in this form if it so desires. The States are also free to decide whether to distribute this portion of the assistance as a straight <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> grant or whether to include a weighting for other factors such as area or population density. The equalisation component of the assistance- Element B- is to be distributed having regard to the recommendations of the States&#39; local government grants commissions or their equivalent; the Bill requires in clause 6 (3) that local government grants commissions be established in each State by the end of 1977-78. </para>
          <para>Clause 4 (b) of the Bill further requires that local government should be represented on each of these commissions and, on matters relating to the distribution of Commonwealth assistance to local government under this Act, that local government bodies be able to make submissions to the commissions, that the hearings of the commissions be held in public, and that their reports are to be public documents. The Bill provides in clause 6 (2) (b) broad guidelines for the operation of local government grants commissions and for assessing equalisation grants. In the final analysis, however, it will be for the States themselves to determine the detailed criteria to be adopted in the assessment of the equalisation grants to individual local government authorities. </para>
          <para>Clause 12 ( 1 ) of the Bill requires that there be a review of the arrangements I have outlined above before 30 June 198 1. In this regard I mention the overall review of the tax sharing arrangements between the Commonwealth and the States provided for in the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Bill 1976. A further matter which needs to be emphasised is the arrangements for the payment of the assistance to local government authorities. Clause 6 (I) of the Bill states that these monies are to be provided to a State for on-passing to local government in the form of a single lump sum when that State has notified the Commonwealth of the detailed allocation of the assistance to individual local governing bodies, and that the allocation has been made in accordance with clause 6 of the Bill. </para>
          <para>These arrangements should be of great assistance to local government authorities; they should result in a substantial increase in their funds early in their financial years, this being a time when their liquidity is traditionally tight because the bulk of local government rates payments occur in the latter half of their financial years. Many local government representatives have raised this matter with myself and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> and I feel sure that they will endorse the payments arrangements that are provided for in the Bill. </para>
          <para>Some further details of the legislation to which I would direct attention are, firstly, that the definition of personal income tax collections is the same as the definition used in the States (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Bill 1976 and, secondly, that a &#39;local governing body &#39; is defined in clause 3 to be a local governing body established by or under a law of a State, other than a body the sole or principal function of which is to provide a particular service, such as the supply of electricity or water. This definition is consistent with the definition used by the Commonwealth Grants Commission under the previous arrangements which applied to the distribution of general purpose assistance to local government. </para>
          <para>I also take this opportunity to draw to the attention of the Senate the improvements in the status and financial standing of local government which have taken place since this Government came to office. I have already outlined the provisions which will apply under the Local Government (Personal Income Tax Sharing) Bill 1976, which is now before the Senate. As mentioned previously, under this scheme local government will receive in 1976-77 an increase of 75 per cent over the level of general purpose assistance provided in 1975-76. Furthermore, the assistance to be provided to local government under these new arrangements will be known in advance, which will assist local authorities with forward budgeting, and it will be untied, which will allow local government authorities to allocate resources in accordance with their own assessment of priorities. The inclusion of local government in the new tax sharing scheme accords it the status of a genuine partner in our Federal system. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>This Bill is to amend the Air Navigation (Charges) Act which imposes charges on aircraft for the use of aerodromes, airway facilities, meteorological, and search and rescue services, which are provided, operated and maintained by the Commonwealth. The main purpose of the Bill is to increase the rates of charges by 15 per cent &#39;across the board&#39; with effect from 1 December 1976. This increase, which will apply to all operators, both domestic and international, will ensure that the current level of cost recovery of services provided by the Government to the air transport industry is maintained and progressively improved. </para>
          <para>In the year 1975-76, the cost of providing air transport facilities exceeded the revenue received from the users of those facilities by over $70m, with a cost recovery level of only 60 per cent. The Government has been concerned at the level of costs involved in providing facilities and services but is seeking to keep any increases in charges within economically acceptable levels. The increase of 1 5 per cent provided for in the Bill is expected to increase revenue by about $4m in 1 976-77 or $8m in a full year. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for the introduction of a revised scale of charges for scheduled international flights arriving in, or departing from, Australia. The Government is concerned to see these charges proportioned more directly to the services provided by the Commonwealth. The change will adopt a charging principle endorsed by International Civil Aviation Organisation in that the costs incurred by the Commonwealth in the provision and maintenance of airway facilities, as distinct from airport facilities, will be recovered in proportion to the distance flown. </para>
          <para>I want to make it clear that the revised scale, in itself, is not designed to increase total revenue from international flights. The scale sets a lower charge for shorter flights in Australia&#39;s area of responsibility, while longer flights will attract a higher charge than under the current arrangements. The impact upon each international airline will therefore depend on its mix of flights to Australia. For instance, those airlines who predominantly fly across the Australian continent with flights from Melbourne and Sydney direct to South-East Asia and Europe, will be required to pay higher charges than those who operate predominantly from the Australian eastern seaboard to destinations across the Tasman and the Pacific. The proposed adjustments to the scale will have the effect of placing the charges for international air services on a more equitable basis. </para>
          <para>I must point out that before setting the revised scale of charges, discussions were held between the International Air Transport AssociationIATA and the Department of Transport. On 5 August, the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> discussed the matter with a visiting Data group of some 11 representatives, together with a representative of the non-Data airlines serving Australia. At the meeting, he indicated that if Data could itself propose an alternative scheme to the one put forward in this Bill and if all the airlines concerned were in agreement he would put their proposition to the Government. The Minister has recently received advice that the international airlines are unable to reach agreement on an alternative charging scheme and, under these circumstances, the Government is implementing the scale of charges originally proposed. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will be aware, of course, that the air navigation charges scheme is kept under constant review. If it is found that there is a need for further modification to the proposed scale of charges for international flights, or in respect of any other provision of the Act, appropriate amendments will be introduced by the Government at the appropriate time. The Bill also contains several procedural amendments which are designed to update and facilitate the administration of the air navigation charges scheme. These include a provision for an interest charge of 10 per cent per annum on overdue accounts which is designed to encourage the prompt payment of charges by those aircraft owners who are slow in meeting their financial commitments. The interest charge will only be imposed when the payment becomes 45 days overdue. The Bill changes the existing provisions relating to the departmental adjustments of charges in cases where a change in the ownership of an aircraft occurs. It will now be left to the seller and the purchaser of an aircraft to arrange an adjustment between themselves for any prepaid charges. This is similar to the procedures adopted by State governments in levying motor vehicle registration fees. These and other more minor amendments contained in the Bill will lead to a reduction of the administrative work load within the Department of Transport and will contribute to a more equitable and efficient operation of the charging system. I commend the Bill. </para>

              <para>-The purpose of the Bill now before the Senate is to extend the operation of the nitrogenous fertilizers subsidy scheme for a further year until 31 December 1977, but at a rate of subsidy reduced from $78.74 per tonne of nitrogen content to $60 per tonne of such content. Honourable senators will recall that in the context of presenting on 17 August 1976 the Budget Papers and outlining to the Senate the Budget proposals the Honourable the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> stated that the Government had considered the report of the Industries Assistance Commission which recommended the phasing out of the subsidy over 3 years and had agreed in principle that the subsidy should be phased out. As a first step in this direction the Bill proposes that from 1 January 1977 to 31 December 1977 subsidy will be payable at the reduced rate I have mentioned in respect of nitrogenous fertilizers of local production which are sold for use in Australia as fertilizer and also in respect of imported nitrogenous fertilizers which, during that calendar year, are either so used by the importer or are sold by the importer for such use in Australia. The level of subsidy to apply after 31 December 1977 will be considered by the Government in the light of economic circumstances prevailing nearer to that time. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

              <para>-Today the Government tabled the report of the Green Committee on Australian broadcasting. The Minister has also made a statement in this House which purports to be conclusions of the Government reached as a result of that inquiry. A statement was made last Thursday in the House of Representatives. There are one or two matters to which I want to draw the attention of the Senate at this stage although I hope that in the spirit of the statement itself the <inline font-weight="bold">Senator will</inline> have a full opportunity to debate it at a later stage. Some extraordinary things have emerged from the statement by the Minister. When the inquiry into broadcasting and television in Australia was appointed in April of this year it was asked to report in a specified time and the inquiry was left in the hands of officers of the Postal and Telecommunications Department. That, in itself, was an extraordinary and unique situation. For example, Lord Annan in Britain has been given 2 years to inquire into and report on a broadcasting system which is infinitely less complex than the broadcasting system in Australia. One of the most bizarre results of a departmental inquiry into broadcasting and television is that the inquirer not only proposes but also disposes. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The inquiry recommended in its report the disposal of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and takes upon itself the powers and functions which were previously vested in the Broadcasting Control Board to a very large extent. The Department which conducted the inquiry into broadcasting and television recommended the establishment of a broadcasting council to advise on broadcasting policy on which the Department will have 2 representatives. During the time of the Labor Government a lot of criticisms were made of the Department of the Media. Methinks that the present Government doth protest too much on this whole issue because we have been continually told by Ministers of the Government throughout this year that our major concern is to get broadcasting out of politics and politics out of broadcasting. If ever there was a result of an inquiry or conclusions such as those which appear to emerge in the somewhat garbled fashion in which they were stated by the Minister, which put politics right into broadcasting, the Government could not have worked harder at producing such a result than it did on this present inquiry and its consequences. Some of the specific conclusions in the statement by the Minister indicate that it is quite wrong in principle in terms of governmental practice that a body should be established to investigate a situation in which it has a particular vested interest in respect of the accretion of power, the enlargement of its own activities and so on. </para>
          <para>There has been a constant clamour in the community throughout this year for a public inquiry into broadcasting. There has been a constant clamour for more freedom of information and more public debate about the broadcasting situation in this country. The Minister said in his statement that the question of self-regulation will be decided- that is for the commercial broadcasting industry- only after full public discussion and debate. When the Minister announced this inquiry in April this year it was called a public inquiry. I suppose it can be said to be public in the sense that any member of the public could write to the inquiry and put his views. That does not make it a public inquiry in any sense. In the Green report which is a substantial document there is not one section dealing with evidence before the inquiry because no evidence was given before the inquiry. There were 600 submissions from all sort of individuals. But anybody can write to anybody else. That is our right. That does not make a situation public. </para>

              <para>- That is correct. The postal union to which the honourable senator refers comes within the province of the same Department. After all the trouble <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and his colleagues took to win government they are now in government. They are responsible for running this country with the postal union and all the rest of the unions thrown in. That is an unfortunate and unpalatable fact which they must face. But the fact is that this was, in no sense, a public inquiry. There were no public hearings. There were, of course, a few private discussions with members of the Federation of Australian Commercial Broadcasters, the Federation of Australian Commercial Television Stations and officers of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. That does not make it a public inquiry. One fact which emerges from the Green report is that very little attention was paid to the interests of the consumers of radio and television. Very little interest was paid to their articulated wishes for an open, frank and public discussion on the situation of broadcasting in Australia. There is still very little intent on behalf of the Government to deal with the situation in that way. The sickening thing is the series of pious statements that have emanated from Government Ministers about their concern for a frank discussion of broadcasting in Australia, about their concern to preserve the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and so on. These statements have been made on a number of occasions and were made again by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> tonight. </para>

          <para>The tragic fact, of course, that we have to face up to is that the conservative political parties in this country construe bias as being something which is not totally favourable to them. Over the last 12 months there has been a series of quite significant and hysterical attacks on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This is a subject with which I want to deal very briefly, but it is a very important one. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> the Leader of the Government in this chamber, has made some vitriolic attacks on the Australian Broadcasting Commission and its integrity. The Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Nixon)</inline> has made similar attacks in other places. The unpalatable fact for the Government Parties, in respect of which they now seek retribution against the Australian Broadcasting Commission, is that in the 1975 election campaign it was only Australian Broadcasting Commission interviewers who asked the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> questions which should have been asked by any intelligent political interviewer anywhere in the world. They asked questions such as this: What are your policies, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser?</inline> What is the situation going to be as a result of these policies in 12 months time?&#39; They asked questions to which every Australian was entitled to know the answer. It was because people such as Richard Carleton asked those questions that the Commission became the subject of quite vitriolic attack by Ministers in this Government. I do not say that all Ministers in this Government are like that and I do not say that all members of the Government Parties are like that. Many of them appreciate the great service which the Australian Broadcasting Commission has given this community and the principles which underlie the operation of a free and independent public radio service. But there has been that sort of background. </para>
          <para>This statement, as it relates to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, really is an extraordinary document. One begins to wonder whether the whole Green inquiry, as it was called, was nothing more than a farce to get the Minister off the hook in a debate in which he was involved in April 1976. What emerges quite clearly- I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> will have heard about this today- is that neither the commercial radio section, the commercial television section, the Australian Broadcasting Commission nor the consumers of broadcasting services in this country are happy about what has happened in the last few days. They are not happy about it because this Government, in typical form as revealed in the last few months, commissions inquiries to look into various things such as broadcasting. It makes up its own mind before the reports of such inquiries are published, announces its decision and then a few days later gives us the benefit of the reports. It is to the decision of the Government as revealed in the statement that I want to direct some comments. First of all, the Minister has told us that the Government has been engaged in major initiatives concerning the administration of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I do not know what that means, because there is nothing major about it. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board has been abolished and its functions are to be given to another body. There is nothing particularly significant about that, one would think. We are told that a new structure is to be set up and industry participation is to be encouraged. There is nothing particularly revolutionary about that. Licensing is to be made the responsibility of a new statutory authority. That, of course, was a function of the old Broadcasting Control Board. We do not regret that it is to be put into the hands of a new statutory authority. We would like to understand a little more clearly what it is all about and what is in the Government&#39;s mind. The statement certainly does not reveal that. </para>
          <para>The statement says that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to be subject to regular inquiry every 7 years. We do not object to that as a matter of principle. The statement is quite unclear as to who is to conduct that inquiry. Is it to be conducted by the tribunal which is to be established or is it to be an independent public inquiry as it would be in any other democracy comparable to this? Which is it to be? The statement is quite unclear. One suspects that just as this Government has made a mess of ethnic radio, which is of great concern to many people who are consumers of ethnic radio, a shocking mess has been made of this inquiry into broadcasting and the conclusions which have been drawn from it We are told that the Government proposes to set up a new broadcasting council to advise the Government on broadcasting matters. It is very unclear what the powers of that council are to be. We are told that it will be representative of the various sectors of the industry. We are told that it will have an independent  chairman,  but in the Minister&#39;s statement there is nothing specific about any of those matters. </para>
          <para>We are told that the first inquiry will concern self-regulation of Australian broadcasting. Self regulation, it is said, will be decided only after public debate. Why are we to have public debate about self-regulation in the commercial sector of the broadcasting industry when no public debate has been allowed about the national broadcasting service, the Australian Broadcasting Commission? Why is there this sudden concession to the principle of public debate in relation to self regulation of the commercial sector? That seems an extraordinary inconsistency which is followed by further ones later in the statement. </para>

              <para>-I am talking about broadcasting. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> did not mumble I could answer what he says. The Minister said that broadcasting planning would be undertaken by his Department and that he would appoint a broadcasting council made up of certain interests. For the first time in the history of this country we are told that a department of government, not an independent authority, is to be responsible for broadcasting planning. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who interjects here tonight and who has great enthusiasm for the great democratic traditions which we have inherited from Britain and elsewhere, no doubt will applaud that as a unique development; but it is the first time in the history of this country that broadcasting planning has been put directly in the hands of a department. The Minister went on to say: </para>

          <para class="block">By way of explanation of that, the Minister says that there will be a public inquiry every few years. It is not clear who is to conduct that public inquiry. He then goes on to say that the commissioners, who will be nine in number, will be representative of each of the 6 States and at least two of the nine will be women. We can only infer from that that it is the intention of the Government to restructure the Australian Broadcasting Commission immediately in a way which is suitable to the Government. There is no reason, first of all, for the criterion of having a commissioner from each State. After all, we are not dealing with a piggy bank. We are dealing with a national broadcasting service, and what we should be seeking is the best available talent to serve on the Commission of that broadcasting service. If new federalism is so rampant in the mind of the Government as to cause the Government to regard it as necessary that there be a representative of each State on the Australian Broadcasting Commission, that is an extraordinary thing. </para>
          <para>The other extraordinary thing is this nice token gesture of having 2 women on the Commission. It is not necessary to write that into the legislation. We could have 6 women on the Australian Broadcasting Commission now. Those of my colleagues who are more expert in these matters than I am would be able to tell the Senate that that form of tokenism is regarded as reprehensible in some circles where it is believed that the same result can be achieved without written positive discrimination in favour of women. </para>

              <para>-Let us stop mumbling about trade unions for a while. The point is that at least three of the present commissioners come up for replacement next year anyway. The significant part of the statement is the failure of the Government to say that a representative of the staff of the Australian Broadcasting Commission will be a commissioner. That seems to me to be quite inconsistent with numerous statements made by the Government on the question of representation of employees on government bodies and especially on governing bodies of statutory corporations. It is a quite extraordinary departure from that principle and a quite reprehensible omission. It is to be hoped that the Government will reconsider that matter. </para>

          <para>In the same statement the Minister went on to talk about the importance of staff relations in the national broadcasting service, the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Really there has not been very much of a problem with staff relations in the Australian Broadcasting Commission until this year when the Government made very savage cuts in its budget and when it appointed <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland, that master of industrial relations, to the chairmanship of the ABC. From then on it has been a continual, debilitating and embarrassing squabble. As I understand it, good staff relations involve co-operation and each side knowing where they are going, a community of purpose and a number of things of that kind which are totally absent from the ABC at the moment. This situation will become worse if the Government persists with its apparent course of removing the staff-elected commissioner from the ABC. The major concern about this question of the apparent threat to the position of the present commissioners was very well expressed as long ago as 1958. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> will remember this. </para>

              <para>- If I tell the honourable senator what it is all about he can tell me whether it is important and he can tell his colleague whether it is important. In 1960 a Liberal Government amended the predecessor to section 32 of the Broadcasting and Television Act for 2 stated purposes. The first was to give continuity of service to members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the second was to ensure the integrity of the ABC. That amendment of 1960 flowed directly from suggestions made by the honourable member for Mackellar, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth,</inline> in a statement in the House to which I wanted to refer the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> can tell me and tell <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline> whether it is important.

          <para>A number of other matters in the Minister&#39;s statement are far from clear, as are a number of other matters to which he referred as being matters which are being given further consideration. I totally commend to the Government the concept of giving further consideration to what it is doing or seems to be doing in relation to the situation of broadcasting and television in Australia. One suspects that all this tale full of sound and fury really signifies nothing except perhaps an expression of bias and an expression of retribution against certain people in the Australian Broadcasting Commission and a desire, contrary to every expressed statement of the Government, to involve the Government in broadcasting and television in Australia in a very real way for the first time in the history of this country. It seems to me to be a most dangerous precedent. I speak not as a member of the Opposition but as an Australian citizen when I say that it seems to me to be a most dangerous precedent and one which should be examined closely by thoughtful members of the Government parties. I hope that that will be done and I hope that the question of further consideration, which is referred to in the Minister&#39;s statement, will be pursued with great vigour by members of the Government parties. </para>
          <para>Probably what we all want to see in this country is the best possible service that can be provided for consumers of broadcasting. That can be done by effective competition. The Opposition is not averse to that notion. It can be done by constant encouragement and better standards. It cannot be done by cosmetic changes to the structure of broadcasting and by the interference of a government department. It is those matters which we condemn. Right from the beginning we see this inquiry as being positively misconceived, as a smokescreen, as an inquiry conducted by the wrong body, in haste and in desperation. We believe that the results have been seen in the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> tonight. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>

            <para>- In this debate on Thursday night I was referring to division 334, Northern Territory Hospitals, and to subdivision 1- Salaries and Payments in the nature of Salary. I do not want to make a second reading speech on this matter but I insist that the matter of the establishment of the Department of Health in the Northern Territory be looked at with some urgency. I indicated that the present staff ceiling of the Department is 2299 and that the actual number of people employed is 2274. 1 indicated that I felt that the authority was aware of its responsibility but perhaps not aware of the demands on the Department of Health now and in the future. Perhaps it is out of touch. I indicated the new facilities throughout the Northern Territory, at Alice Springs, Tennant Creek, Katherine and Darwin. One that I did not mention was Papunya. </para>

          <para>There has been much publicity in the Press about the health of the Aboriginal people. Professor Hollows is presently in the Northern Territory carrying out a survey on the health of the Aboriginal people, particularly of the children, in relation to trachoma and other conditions of the eyes, ears, nose and chest. As I have said before, the state of health of the Aboriginal people, particularly of the children, is alarming. Evidently this is due to contact with Europeans and did not occur before. Nevertheless, there is a tremendous demand on the Northern Territory Health Department and I doubt whether it is geared to accept its responsibilities and carry out its duty to bring about better health. </para>
          <para>In the last week or two I received an answer to question on notice No. 1075 which I asked the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I asked about rural health centres in the Northern Territory, how many were being constructed, how many were in the planning stages, where the centres were situated, whether there were any staffing problems, what Aboriginal staff were being employed, whether any Aborigines were being trained and so on. The answer indicated that in the Northern Territory now there are 35 localities with health centres, either departmental or subsidised missions. These health centres are scattered over some 520 000 square miles. How can some 2000-odd people who have responsibilities throughout the Health Department and hospitals really be sufficient to handle all these health centres in extremely isolated areas? These 35 localities can be in places such as Alyangula, Amoonguna, Angurugu, Areyonga, Ayers Rock, B amy i li, Borroloola, Croker Island and elsewhere throughout the Northern Territory. In addition there are 1 8 other health centres on pastoral properties. </para>

              <para>- Yes, and I hope that the Health Department servicing the Northern Territory can be everywhere too, but I have my doubts. There are 1 8 health centres on pastoral leases. Additional or replacement health centre facilities are being constructed at 9 localities Daly River, Docker River, Hooker Creek, Oenpelli and so on. One can see that the scope of the demand for health services in the Northern Territory is immense and it is impossible for the Health Department to service these various facilities in the Northern Territory while endeavouring to live within it establishment. I point out to those authorities and the Health Department that in answer to a question last week in which I was being rather critical of across the board cuts in the Public Service, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> indicated that any department or Minister who had reason to believe that within that department there was lack of efficiency through lack of numbers had every right to go to the Public Service Board or to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> to ensure that within the establishment of that department there were sufficient people to carry out the duties of the department in an efficient manner. </para>

          <para>I make one further point before I sit down. While speaking on the establishment of health centres in the Northern Territory, it concerns me to see that there are 107 Aboriginal staff employed in departmental rural health centres and 68 employed in health centres. The answer to my question on notice states that of the 107 staff, 77 are formally enrolled in training programs. The point I want to make, and I believe it is legitimate, is that while there are 107 Aboriginal staff employed in the Northern Territorycertainly they do a very good job- on missions and settlements, if they resign, leave or are sick they are not replaced because of the across the board cuts. Under the regulations now operating any person who goes on leave, becomes sick or for any reason leaves his position is not replaced. I suggest that whilst we are trying to find employment for Aborigines in the Northern Territory, encourage them and assist them in education and health, gradually their numbers in the Northern Territory are dwindling and the across the board cuts in the Northern Territory are a washout, are not working and are not good for the health of the Northern Territory community. </para>

            <para>-That is the first friendly statement that the honourable senator on the other side from the Northern Territory has made about Aborigines since he has been here and for the first time I support him. That will probably shock him too. The statements which have just been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> are factual. For months I have been trying to find out about the supplementary program ranging up to $200,000 for Aboriginal children. I have asked question after question in this chamber but there is a great veil of secrecy. This Government is living in secrecy. It has no information about anything at any time. I was promised this information but have not been able to get it so far. I specifically refer to division 813 dealing with the Aboriginal Advancement Program under the heading &#39;Payments to or for the States&#39;. In the financial year 1975-76 there was an appropriation of $40.79m and expenditure of $39,003,968. For the current financial year this has been cut back, in round figures, by $10m. That is a very large sum of money. This bankrupt Government cannot find that amount of money for this area of Aboriginal affairs. </para>

              <para>-We discussed these things in the Estimates Committees. I happened to be 6 minutes and 30 seconds, to be precise, late back from dinner one night and in that time the Committee had passed an appropriation of $29.82m. That is the fastest spending I have seen in my life. I want to know where this money under the heading &#39;Payments to or for the States&#39; went to. I would like to know how much has been allocated to Western Australia and under what headings and how much has been allocated to each of the States, particularly Queensland, and under what headings. </para>

          <para>In north Queensland there is a place known as the Gorge. It is a tiny Aboriginal settlement not far from Mossman where, comparatively speaking, a large number of Aborigines live. There is no electricity and the houses are in a very dilapidated condition. In the days of the Labor Government an appropriation was made to enable these people to live in better class homes but the Queensland department dug in its toes. There are only 60 acres on the reserve and this tribe was transported to the reserve from the Daintree River tribal lands a long time ago back in the middle 1930s. The old people who came into the Gorge area died very rapidly of hookworm. It is a hookworm infested area. There are 60 acres of reserve in this very picturesque area about 2 miles from Mossman. Negotiations were entered into between the Australian Government and the Queensland Government to purchase a small area of land outside the reserve so that proper homes could be built for these people, but the Queensland department, with its very good eye for real estate, decided to buy it in advance. I want to know where that money has gone, who is holding it and what is happening to it. I have written to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> and have endeavoured to get information but have not been able to do so other than to be told that he is looking into it. Of all the Ministers in this Parliament <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner</inline> is becoming the most expert; he is always looking into something. He probably would come second only to the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> in looking into things. We never seem to get the real, solid information that we require. </para>
          <para>There is one quite substantial home on the reserve. The white people who live in it are ashamed of the fact that they live in it with electricity, refrigeration, fans and so on. The people who are forced to live in these huts know that money has been made available to build proper homes for them and that they are not able to get these homes. If land rights were ever required the onus would be on this Government to take on the Queensland Government and at least to claim this little reserve of 60 acres. The points made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> concerning Aboriginal health in the Northern Territory are dead right, and I hope that he adopts the same attitude when the land rights legislation comes into this place. </para>

              <para>- I thank the honourable senator very much. If he comes in on the same basis when the land rights legislation is before us, this will be a somewhat happier Parliament. The situation in the Northern Territory is becoming drastic. Prior to the Labor Government taking office the death rate among Aboriginal infants under one year of age was about 140 to 150 per thousand live births. After 3 years of somewhat better government that number was reduced to 50.1, which was still a disgraceful figure. If this Government is allowed to proceed with its cutbacks in the fields of employment, housing, education and medical services, I forecast now that by this time next year the death rate amount Aboriginal children under one year of age will be at least 100 per thousand live births. It is not good enough. I believe that there is a tremendous responsibility on the Australian community to ensure that people, regardless of race, colour or creed, have the same standard of living wherever they reside in Australia. </para>

Recently I received a letter about the miniBudget which went through this chamber last May. Then the letter did not give the information that I required. What recourse do I have? How can I kick back? There is a tendency in the Treasury and other places to hide things under the carpet, and it is just not good enough.

            <para>- I do not know whether anybody has any purpose in regulating the order of speaking, but I try to follow a pattern that is convenient to the Committee and, in particular, to the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> who so graciously is in charge of the business before the Committee. So that she will be able to provide information, if there is information which will justify a response, I direct her attention to paragraph 3.1.2 of the Auditor-General&#39;s report. Some honourable senators are inclined to think that the Auditor-General&#39;s report is beneath notice. I choose to refer to about 2 per cent of its total content. I wonder whether the Ministers in totality refer to the report even to that degree. </para>

          <para>I remind the Minister that during the infamous days of the Labor Government one of the first essays into administration was in the field of Aboriginal affairs. It concerned some crocodile and turtle farms in Torres Strait. Honourable senators will recall that such was the mess that the Auditor-General saw fit to bring in a report specially on that subject in March 1974. It was quite apparent that there had been wholesale maladministration, unauthorised expenditure of money and wasteful expenditure of money, and the matter was never cleared up. I am alarmed to think that we would have a government that would receive with passivity a report by the Auditor-General pointing out that he had been asking for inquiries under the heading of turtle and crocodile projects and that the Secretary of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs had advised him as follows: </para>

Last week the question of legal aid services came in for comment from about 4 honourable senators, and all the comment was adverse. On page 145 the Auditor-General&#39;s report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The detailed guidelines on the provision of legal aid services, referred to in earlier Reports, have not yet been issued. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The comment in the report which sends the Senate, the Parliament and the Ministry to sleep is this: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Department advises the draft guidelines are being reviewed. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Any Minister who knows that guidelines have not been issued for a month and who does not sack the head of his department who pretends to run the department without guidelines is not responsible. </para>
          <para>On the same page the report refers to the question of the hire and construction of hovercraft. I referred to this question in my speech during the second reading debate, but I wish to bring out a few particular points now. The first is this quotation from the Auditor-General &#39;s report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Studies by the Department of the operations of the hovercraft have established that an air cushion vehicle is neither the most suitable nor the most economical means of transport in the Torres Strait area. Departmental records show $264,950 as expended on hire and operational costs. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I want to know, firstly, whether that expenditure has been examined and whether there is any corruption in it, as I suspect there is; secondly, whether there is any breach of Treasury regulations or proper authorisation in it, as I expect there is wholesale; and, thirdly, who in the Department continued that thoroughly wasteful expenditure? Then there are other points. Notwithstanding that conclusion as to the unsuitability of an air cushion vehicle for that area, the Department entered into an agreement for the construction of such a vehicle. That was done on a consultancy basis. Who are the consultants? What report did they give? Has the Minister examined the question whether there was negligence in giving a report? If so, is the country to recover damages, because usually one employs consultants to prevent one from launching into wasteful expenditure. An amount of $28,065 has been paid to these consultants. The processes of law should indicate that that amount at least should be repaid if there is negligence, and also that there should be recovery of the expenditure incurred on the faith of a negligent report. But responsibility does not end there. The Department, having satisfied itself as to the unsuitability of the air cushion vehicle, has some responsibility as to whether it enters into a contract for construction. So abysmal was the contract that there has now been total cancellation of the construction contract involving $1 15,699, including $ 18,000-odd compensation for the termination of the contract. What officer within the Department is being asked to pay back to the Treasury his share of the taxpayers&#39; money paid out on such an absolutely absurd and unjustified proposal? </para>

            <para>- In the debate last Thursday I spoke about the provision of legal aid services for Aborigines. I said I wanted to make some more remarks about the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee under the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has entered into this debate and he relies on the report of the Auditor-General without knowing the facts. I feel that I am taking over ministerial responsibility by trying to show that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> simply does not know what he is talking about. Last week there was a debate in this place on turtle farming when 2 honourable senators on this side seemed to be in disagreement about the value of turtle farming. I do not know where Rip Van Winkle was on that occasion but he has now awakened to the fact there is something on turtle farming in the Auditor-General&#39;s report for last year which explains that information could not be disclosed in relation to payment by the Department to the Australian National University of a sum of money approved by Parliament for research work. </para>

              <para>- The senator has just woken up to something that was explained in this place last week. The Department thought in all sincerity that, having allocated the money for research work, it was up to the people administering the research funds to find out where the money was being spent and whether it was spent properly. The money having been paid out for research work, that was the end of it so far as boo keeping for the Department was concerned. It was only when last year&#39;s report of the Auditor-General said that it was not sufficient for audit purposes and that there had to be a check-up on all that went before it that the Department endeavoured to seek from the University information on this question. As honourable senators heard, that expensive bird- <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Bustard-</inline> had flown. He had gone back to Scotland, I believe. Although it was not impossible to find out the details, the expense that would be involved in getting the information would be greater than the amount of money that had originally been involved in the whole transaction. That saving reduced the figure by many thousands of dollars. The secretary to the Department wrote back to the Auditor-General stating that it was not worth following up because of the expense that would be involved. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator will find it in the Auditor-General &#39;s report of last year. I do not have the figure in my head. I never knew it. Possibly the Minister can state the amount. Moving on to the question of legal aid for Aborigines, I spoke on this last week and I admitted that I had not heard what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> had to say on this subject. I put up some defence for someone who I thought would be named and who had been named. That was Paul Coe in Sydney, who, whatever his shortcomings, has an earnest desire to do something for his people. I do not want to denigrate him here, despite the many faults he may have and the many mistakes he has made. I do not dispute anything that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> said last week. The Sydney office of the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service has always been a problem. Firstly, there was no proper auditing. There was no keeping of accounts until such time as we insisted on this and we made the office employ an accountant for the purpose of keeping accounts. But of all the Legal Aid offices, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> brought up the Sydney office only as an example which he said was discrediting the whole Service which in his opinion was doing a good job throughout Australia. Although the Minister responsible has not yet overcome the problems at the Sydney office, that office nevertheless is providing a great service to the Aboriginal people in Sydney who require legal aid when appearing before the courts. </para>

              <para>-That is not denied. So we are all in agreement on that. There are some difficulties to be overcome at the Sydney office and these difficulties will be overcome. The difficulties may be the birth pains that go with the provision of a new service, but honourable senators must not take away the credit due to Paul Coe who initiated the formation of the Sydney office when there was no Government subsidy. There is always this sort of problem. The Whitlam Government promised that no Aboriginal would have to go before the court without counsel, whatever the cost. Because the Legal Aid Service offices we set up could not supply counsel for all Aborigines appearing before the courts, rather than employ additional lawyers full time, if they were available, and keeping them on the staff to be employed only at some time or other, there was always the problem that the Department could never budget for the amount required to pay for counsel briefed outside the Legal Aid Service. The Legal Aid Service was authorised to brief counsel when the need arose. Although it had a limited budget for this the occasion frequently arose when there would be a need to go outside the budget because an Aboriginal who was a defendant in court needed legal aid at a time when the appropriation had been expended. In the provision of all legal aid services I think there is an accumulation of accounts from outside solicitors. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>I raised last week the desirability of employing outside legal services in cases which in counsel&#39;s opinion would have no hope of succeeding but in which the services are provided for the purpose of providing salaries for outside lawyers rather than out of any consideration for the Aboriginal. The audit guidelines that the Auditor-General said should be drawn up cannot be accepted as a criticism of the Head of the Department. Surely if guidelines are to be drawn up for a service the Minister must be responsible. If after 12 months of Fraser Government the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> has not drawn up guidelines for the administration of the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service his failure to do so should be condemned. The Auditor-General finds it necessary to condemn it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> has gone out of his way to condemn his Minister to a degree that I would not be prepared to do. </para>
          <para>I turn to the question of hovercraft. With my approval and my sanction the hovercraft was commissioned from a British firm for trials. The firm consulted us for the purpose of seeing whether it would be a suitable means of transport in Torres Strait, which is a very difficult area, particularly so far as medical cases are concerned when it is necessary to rush people from the islands which have no landing strips and no means of transport to the mainland. Having had a hovercraft on hire from a British firm for trial, this not being a permanent arrangement, and being satisfied that such a craft was the best means of transport from the Torres Strait we arranged with Taylor craft at Parafield in South Australia to build a hovercraft for the Torres Strait service. After the trial of the English hovercraft had ended all those associated with it commended it. </para>
          <para>I have received well-informed advice from within the Department of Aboriginal Affairs that the Department is not of the opinion that the hovercraft or air-cushioned craft is not the solution for emergency transport from the Torres Strait islands but the contract with Taylor Brothers in South Australia had to be terminated and hovercraft had to cease to be the means of conveyance from Torres Strait islands, firstly, because inflation had increased the contract price and, secondly, because of the curtailment of expenditure on Aboriginal affairs by this Government this year which meant that the Department could not proceed with the project. That is the true reason why there has been a cancellation of the project to provide hovercraft services from the Torres Strait islands. That is the reason why that superior means of transport for that area will not be availed of for the present. </para>
          <para>While <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is concerned for the taxpayers who have to pay tax he has a greater concern for taxpayers who have to pay tax for something to be provided for Aboriginals, which is money not well spent, than he has for taxpayers who have to pay tax for expenditure in the Northern Territory on reconstruction which he finds is not justified but which he is prepared to permit at present rather than embarrass his government on the question. </para>
          <para>I turn to the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee, for which I fought for a long time. This Government was in doubt about its effectiveness and whether it was the best means of providing Aboriginal representation and advice to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. It set up a committee under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hiatt</inline> for the purpose of seeing whether the Committee was the best form of communication between Aboriginals and the Department. I believe that it is now some weeks since <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hiatt</inline> presented his report to the Department. It has not seen the light of day publicly. No one is to know what is in it. Unlike the Hay report, the Opposition has not received a copy before its release. However, we know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hiatt</inline> favours the continuation of the Aboriginal Consultative Committee. Therefore there is no justification this year for depriving the Committee of funds so that it cannot meet. Last year the Committee had an expenditure of $68,610 for meeting expenses. This year the Government has made a provision of $20,000, which is insufficient to hold one meeting on a national basis, with fares and accommodation taken into account. Therefore this elected body, supported by the committee the Government established, is not permitted to meet in this 12 months because the Government has not made allowance for it. </para>
          <para>The main criticism of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee is that some people are dissatisfied with the representation in various areas. Rather than have an election in the wet and to get a proper electoral system I extended the Committee&#39;s period of operation from the 2 years for which it was appointed for a further 9 months. Members of the Committee were due to come up for election, I believe, in March of this year, but we find that there has been no provision to hold an election this year for the </para>
          <para>National Aboriginal Consultative Committee. Therefore, those who are on the Committee, some of whom are unsatisfactory- if one accepts the expressed statements of those they represent -appear to be on the Committee on a permanent basis. The Department is making provision to pay their salaries and for their assistants but is not making provision to let them meet and to let them have an election. So it looks as though they have a permanent job as long as they can do it. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I wish to take a few minutes of the Committee&#39;s time to talk briefly on 2 aspects of unemployment in Aboriginal communities. I speak only briefly because the matter has been mentioned before but I rise because the situation certainly is no better but is getting worse. The first problem I mention is the problem of council workers employed by the village councils people who carry out the normal municipal functions in the Aboriginal communities. I have visited a number of these communities recently. I should like to give an example of one. The smaller communities are in trouble, not the larger ones. The example I wish to give is that of Ngukurr, which is on the Roper River. According to my information the money supplied by the Government will run out towards the end of November and from that time on 54 workers will receive unemployment benefit. I have reported this matter to the Director of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in the Northern Territory and perhaps something has been done. But the general principle remains the same- that the smaller communities are experiencing a lot of trouble. I bring this question to the attention of the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle).</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The larger communities, as I have mentioned, do not have the same trouble. Probably because they have more money they have more flexibility. It is also a fact of course that some of the larger communities have industry, which many of the smaller ones do not have. I think the Minister will be aware of the problem of unemployment benefits in an Aboriginal community. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> has already introduced into this place the phrase &#39;sit-down money&#39;. This is what the unemployment benefit is regarded as. The problems of unemployment will be known to the Minister. Firstly the individual loses dignity and takes part in gambling and excessive drinking and so on. Of course then money is short and, as many people will know, it comes from the child endowment payments and from the age pensioners. When a large number of unemployed people are present within a community, that community disintegrates and lays itself open to that criticism which people are prepared so readily to give to Aboriginal communities. </para>
          <para>Another aspect of general unemployment is the lack of opportunities for young people. On the settlement I mentioned, the  chairman  of the group told me that not one person under the age of 20 years was in employment. This is a shocking situation. I am pleased to see that a working party has been set up to look at the training of Aboriginal people. But this has been done before, and my complaint is that unfortunately once again this is putting the cart before the horse. There is little point in training Aboriginal people if there are no employment opportunities. I suggest very strongly here that the creation of employment opportunities is the obvious first step. </para>
          <para>It has been quite clearly indicated to those of us who have been in Aboriginal communities most honourable senators have- that Aboriginal people can learn trades and can learn them very quickly; but they must see the need for the training. They cannot see the point in training in isolation. Let us face it, why should they? There is no doubt that in the Northern Territory there has been a blueprint for training for Aboriginal people for many years. But I repeat that it is pointless implementing this blueprint unless there are employment opportunities. As we have mentioned before these in the main must be in the community, not away from the community. I do not think I need to go through the arguments for that again. The Department of Education has indicated that it can do its bit. Let us see the Department of Employment and Industrial Relations, the Department of Aboriginal Affairs and the Department of the Northern Territory do theirs. </para>
          <para>I move to the second problem that I want to mention, and that is the problem of the Aboriginal public servant. I have spoken before- I notice again that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> raised this matter tonight- about the inappropriateness of Public Service procedures in the Northern Territory. I do not need to go through the details; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> has mentioned them for the Committee. I use as an example again the community to which I referred earlier. While I was visiting that community the head teacher indicated to me that there was a shortage of teaching assistants, those Aboriginal people who are so vital in the education program and who assist the teachers. As soon as I got back to Darwin I went to see the Director of Education who told me that there were 40 vacancies for teacher assistants but that the applications for those vacancies could not be processed through the Public Service. </para>
          <para>What a ludicrous situation it is that out on the settlements we have a need for these people, the teachers are screaming out for the assistants, the assistants need the jobs to get the money, and yet the procedures have been set up in such a way that these people are prevented from being employed. I ask the Minister for Social Security to ask the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> to look at this Public Service procedure. Surely something can be done. The obvious thing to do is to give authority to the local Public Service inspector to approve of such appointments rather than the cases having to come to Canberra for consideration. There is growing up in the Northern Territory a general feeling that the procedures are a devious device to avoid spending money. Perhaps I am naive, but I cannot believe that that is so. The small amount of money that would be be saved would be saved at a great social cost. </para>
          <para>So I ask the Minister to look at a couple of areas. Firstly I ask him to look at the employment situation in the Northern Territory to get a clear picture of just how critical it is. Then in the short term perhaps some money could be provided to the Aboriginal communities to help to keep them running. That money could be provided in the form of project money, of which the Minister will be aware. Certainly keeping a community running can be seen as a special project when we have the situation of 54 people from a small community such as that on the Roper River being out of work. The Minister has plenty of other opportunities such as those provided by the Regional Employment and Development scheme and other schemes to supply that money. In the longer term, surely we can develop industries among the Aboriginal communities so that there will be employment opportunities for the Aboriginal people. If we are going to have an investigation surely we should investigate that matter rather than the techniques of training. </para>
          <para>I notice that some thought has been given to paying the unemployment benefit in a large sum to the councils on the communities. I would caution the Minister against doing that. It seems to me that it would create too many problems. Surely a direct grant would be a better way in which to handle the situation. However, I know that that matter is being investigated. As a special plea in this area I ask that special consideration be given to young people. No one under 20 years of age is employed from the small community to which I have referred. What point is there in having an education program if there are no employment opportunities at the end of that program? In the second area, I ask the Minister to look at the Public Service procedures and to consider the situation that exists in the Northern Territory. If we need a more unusual example of the problem of the Aboriginal people in the Northern Territory, perhaps I should refer to those Aborigines who move out of their jobs more frequently than others. Perhaps the first step towards overcoming the problems involved in that regard would be to give the local Public Service inspector power to approve the appointment of these people to positions. In conclusion, I support what my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> said about the health situation in the Northern Territory. It is good to see that the wonderful programs initiated by Doug Everingham are appreciated and will be continued. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I want to make a rather small contribution to the Committee&#39;s consideration this evening of the estimates for the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, particularly in the light of some of the criticisms that have been levelled at the Department in relation to the hire or leasing of a hovercraft to service the Torres Strait Island people. I will not go into the pros and cons of whether the Department was unwise in what it did in relation to that expenditure on behalf of the Torres Strait people. What I do feel is that, regardless of whether that expenditure may not have been wisely made by the Department, it highlights, in my opinion, the concern of the Department and the Director of that Department at the lack of transport facilities and means of communication available to the people of the Torres Strait Islands. That matter finds sympathy not only with me but also with members of the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders on which I served for some considerable time and which was looking into the environmental conditions of Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders. Some of those honourable senators who have served on that Committee are in the chamber tonight. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>That Committee found that there is a great need and a very important need in the Torres Strait Islands for better surface transport facilities for the people of the Torres Strait Islands, as well as there being a very urgent and great need for better communication facilities for those people who live on those islands in the Torres Strait and who are isolated from the rest of Australia. Our Committee investigated these problems and brought down a report on them. I believe it is appropriate that I mention tonight some of the recommendations made by that Committee. I refer in particular to those on pages 1 1 to 1 3 of the Committee &#39;s report. </para>
          <para>We found that there was an urgent need in the Torres Strait Islands. We recommended that the inter-island surface transport network be upgraded to provide better direct movement of passengers and of adequate amounts of cargo between the islands. As a result of its investigations the Committee found- I found this also from making several trips to the Torres Strait Islands and by talking to the people up there that there is one government boat that services the communities on a number of islands. I think it services 16 islands all told. Although the boat does go to all these islands, its visits are very infrequent. The accommodation on the boat is not adequate for the island people. While the accommodation for VIPs, such as the Director of Aboriginal Affairs, or the Premier, or the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, who are travelling to the islands may be very adequate and comfortable, that is not so in the case of accommodation for the people who live on those islands. They have to sleep on the deck, They do not have proper accommodation. There is very little accommodation for perishable goods on this particular boat that travels to these island communities. So our Committee recommended that that transport network be upgraded. </para>
          <para>Whilst we appreciate the Queensland Government&#39;s position- it perhaps does not have the means to provide this accommodation- we believe that the Federal Government should make available a subsidy or the kind of finance which will provide that facility for a group of people who are proudly Australian citizens. That fact has been highlighted during the controversy of the change of our border with Papua New Guinea in the Torres Strait. They want to remain Australians. Unfortunately, because of certain circumstances that exist in that area, they are not being treated like other Australians because of the inadequate transport facility available to them and because of many other matters that the Committee looked at. </para>
          <para>Some but not all of these islands have an airstrip, but they are not all weather airstrips. So our Committee recommended that the existing airstrips be improved to strips of all weather standard so that at least some of the islands will be serviced and so that the people who live on those islands will have the opportunity to leave, whether it be a case of wanting to go for a holiday, whether it be a case of need for urgent medical attention, or whether it be some other case. There are a number of recommendations in our report. The recommendations which deal with various aspects of improving conditions for the people on the Torres Strait Islands are numbered from 12 to 20. I thought that I should make some contribution tonight on behalf of the Torres Strait Island people. Although there has been some criticism of the Department&#39;s expenditure of money on a hovercraft, I believe that it was done in good faith and shows the concern of the Director of the Department and of his departmental officers. Whilst we may feel inclined to criticise the expenditure, let us hope that in the future something more constructive will be done in relation to surface transport and communications for the people of the Torres Strait Islands. </para>

          <para>My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> had insufficient time to develop his argument on the hire and construction of hovercraft. Even though we paid- I have made a note of some of the figures- a considerable amount of money, namely $264,950, for the hire of a hovercraft, while that hovercraft was operating it saved a fairly large number of lives. If we value each life at $50,000, or whatever it is worth in terms of the national economy, that hovercraft paid for itself unless honourable senators opposite in these circumstances because these people are black and they value lives in the same way as they did during the Vietnam war- classify life cheaply. If honourable senators opposite do that, then of course it was a waste of money. The hovercraft saved more in lives than we spent in money. If there is corruption- I point this out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> through you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman-</inline> there is corruption at government level again. </para>
          <para>When the previous Government ordered the Australian built hovercraft it did so because it would have been cheaper to run and it would have provided a service which was needed. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner,</inline> a Government senator, points out, there is insufficient transport in this area. Total censorship is imposed by the Queensland Government under 2 Acts. People are not allowed to communicate with each other unless the white officials say they can. If they want to send telegrams from one person to another or from one island to another, the white officials decide, by censorship, whether those telegrams will be sent. The white officials open the mail and they employ every kind of censorship possible. Yet, that is the sort of racist legislation that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and other honourable senators opposite are supporting. It is disgraceful for the Parliament of this country to do so but it is totally in keeping with the Government&#39;s moral attitudes of censorship. This Government washed $ 1 56,28 1 down the drain. That is the amount this Government wasted by cancelling the contract to have the hovercraft built. I said during the Estimates Committee hearing- the departmental adviser was forced to agree with me: &#39;We did the money cold&#39;. He said: &#39;Yes, we did the money cold&#39;. I wish to refer again to the questions I asked during the hearings of Estimates Committee D. I referred to the fact that earlier in the day <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jean</inline> Melzer had asked a question about the hovercraft. </para>

              <para>- I am referring to page 607 of the transcript of the Estimates Committee D hearing on 14 October 1976. The sum that was referred to was $160,000, which is near enough, in round figures, because a few other dollars probably were spent on the side. I reintroduced this matter and I wanted to know the total cost of the hovercraft, how much was paid out and how much remained to be paid. I said at that time that the British hovercraft that we hired was a fairly expensive one. It was expensive to hire but it paid for itself in terms of the lives that were saved. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hogan,</inline> who was the departmental adviser, said: </para>

Then the departmental records were quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malone,</inline> and they are the figures I am quoting tonight. The departmental records showed that $264,950 was expended. This Government had not been in government a month before it cancelled the lease on the hovercraft and sent it back to Britain. What did this Government do a few weeks later? It gave away $156,281 of taxpayers&#39; money because it could not keep the contract. It was a bankrupt Government, politically and financially, and it could not keep the contract. </para>
          <para>There is some slight discrepancy in the figures. The figure quoted to me in the Estimates Committee was $1 15,699. In fact, that was a distorted figure. According to the Auditor-General&#39;s report, payments amounting to $28,065 were made by the Department to consultants engaged for the hiring and construction projects. It is up to the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs to see that the correct figures, not distorted figures, are quoted to Estimates Committees. I do not blame the departmental officers. The figures obviously have been hidden by the Government. The policy of this Government is to keep everything secret and not to disclose any more than it is prepared to disclose in the circumstances. This does not happen only in respect of Aboriginal affairs. It is happening in respect of the Department of Defence and in other areas, where the Government is hiding things under all sorts of other headings. I tell honourable senators opposite that this is a dishonest way of governing. They will not need the Governor-General to dismiss them when their turn comes: The people will dismiss the Government with a 60 per cent vote the other way. </para>
          <para>I wish to refer to 2 more points. I agree with what my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ted</inline> Robertson, said a few moments ago, namely, that the areas of health and education, in particular, will have a big effect on the kids of the Northern Territory. Whether those kids are black or white does not matter. Race does not come into it. We are discussing the appropriation for Aboriginal Affairs. Therefore we have to stick to the matters under this heading. I do not know whether honourable senators know that there are problems in relation to education in the Northern Territory. A new set of guidelines has obviously been laid down secretly by this Government that we shall go back to the old paternalistic system that what the white man thinks is good for the blacks the black man will cop. If one reads some of the reports- I must admit that they are not yet official, but I shall make copies of them available to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs to keep its files up to date- one will see that there are problems in relation to some of the new systems of education which are being introduced or which are about to be introduced in the Northern Territory. Quite frankly, they fall far short of the standard set by the previous Labor Government. </para>
          <para>One of the other things creating grave problems at the moment is the new tendency to establish outstations or to return to the homelands. I suppose the Pitjantjatjara and the Narrabri are 2 tribes which have gone into this extensively and very effectively. Last year they were given some $10,000 by way of establishment grants by the Labor Government to set themselves up in the new homelands to which they wanted to move. This year all money has been taken from them. They will not even be provided with enough money to set up a bore where they have no adequate water supply. No provision is made to teach their kids. But school teachers are prepared to go out under these primitive conditions and teach children. In fact, a couple of experiments are going on which are proving very effective. But the present Government has told these people that there is no money. One of these days, for the benefit of this chamber, I will play a good recording of something which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> said. It is not the telegram which we read out every second day in this place, the one which he eats with his Weetbix every morning for breakfast. It is a very good recording of what he said about land rights which was broadcast over some 27 or 28 radio transceivers throughout the Northern Territory, South Australia and Western Australia. I suppose that some people on the other side of the chamber have never heard of this recording. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> as the shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs was a very shadowy minister indeed while he was trying to pick up votes for the Liberal and National Country Parties. Nevertheless, some time in the next week or two I will acquaint honourable senators with the contents of that tape recording. </para>
          <para>I return to the questions that I posed earlier. I want to know where the Government is spending the money which is appropriated in Appropriation Bill (No. 2) which, if we are not discussing it now, we will be discussing shortly. My question applies not only to Appropriation Bill (No. 2 ), it applies also to Appropriation Bill (No. 1). We have not been given all the details. For instance, I was told that the expenditure for the hovercraft, or the taxpayers&#39; money which this Government lost, was $ 1 1 5,000 when, in fact, it was $ 1 56,000. How many more times has the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> hidden amounts of money in that way, when he will not even let his Department know about them? The Department bears the brunt. It has to make the explanations. Why does the Auditor-General have those figures when the Department of Aboriginal Affairs cannot have them? It is unfair. I hope that tonight, before the debate on the estimates is finished, the Government will come clean about some of the money that it has hidden under the counter in its own corrupt way. </para>

            <para>- Several matters have been raised, some last week when we were dealing with the estimates, for this group and some today. I will reply firstly to matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> last week in relation to the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I can give him information on 2 points. The first is with regard to a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr C,</inline> whom he identified, in Sydney who was asked to obtain a birth certificate from Italy in order that his citizenship application could proceed. The situation is that no positive identification can be made of the person in question from the records existing in Australia. A record is held of a man born 2 years later and with different given names. The department has arranged for the applicant to be called in for a further interview in an effort to resolve the identity problem and to facilitate the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill.</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other matter he raised was with regard to the entry into Australia from Belgrade of the mother of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr I.</inline> Ruskovic. The difficulty in this case arose through the original nomination for the mother being one for permanent entry. It seems that following the son&#39;s visit the mother decided to come to Australia as a visitor only, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruskovic</inline> asked that the application be changed to one for a visitor visa. The normal procedure when permanent entry is indicated is that full migration processing should be undertaken. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruskovic</inline> was told this when he telephoned the Belgrade office. The Department in Belgrade has been in touch with the mother by telegram, and with a relative of the mother by telephone. It has been established that the mother wishes to come only as a visitor. She has been informed that if she forwards her passport to the Belgrade office a visitor visa will be issued immediately. The Department has also explained this situation to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ruskovic</inline> through his brother-in-law. I hope that information assists <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> in the matters he raised. </para>
          <para>Last week and again tonight there was some discussion about staff ceilings for the Department of Health in the Northern Territory. The staff ceiling levels for the Department of Health have been determined for the Department as a whole. In allocating ceiling levels for particular areas due regard is given to the number of staff necessary to maintain essential services as well as to recruitment possibilities. The staff ceiling for the Northern Territory is currently set at 2299. As at 3 November 1976, actual staff totalled 2253. This is a shortfall of 46 on the staff ceiling. The Department makes a continuing effort to recruit medical, nursing and paramedical staff in an endeavour to maintain and improve staffing levels for the provision of health care services in the Territory. Further advertising for staff in these categories is continuing. Recent salary increases for medical and nursing staff have improved this aspect. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> recently stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I remind the House that we have in any restriction on personnel and staff ceiling, emphasised that over the counter services to people- obviously this includes the delivery of health services- are not to be prejudiced as a result of staff ceilings that have been imposed on all Commonwealth departments and statutory authorities. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> mentioned, there is a potential requirement for additional personnel to provide staff for an expansion of activities in the Territory. Should it appear that the ongoing recruitment action will put pressure on the allocated staff ceilings this matter will be reviewed within the context of the overall ceilings of the Department and, if necessary, the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> will take action towards adjustment of the ceiling. </para>
          <para>I have other information with regard to Aboriginal health worker training in the Northern Territory which I believe would be of assistance to the Committee this evening. Advice indicates that currently in the rural areas of the Northern Territory, 180 Aboriginal health workers are either employed by the Department of Health or subsidised by it for employment by missions. Actual employment fluctuates from time to time, with a large turnover. Of the 180 Aboriginal health workers, the number in active training is 77. Most training is provided at health centres by departmental staff. In the urban area approximately 150 further Aboriginals are employed in health institutions in various roles. The Department has now established a task force, under the direction of the health education specialist, comprising a senior matron, health inspector, dietician, personnel officer and a visual aids officer which will be seconded full time to prepare detailed plans for the upgrading and expansion of Aboriginal health worker training in the Northern Territory. This will enable appropriate provision to be included in departmental forward estimates. I hope the information given in those 2 statements assists the senators who are concerned about the standard and availability of health services in the Territory. I assure them of the active interest and consideration of the Minister for Health in those very important matters. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>showed interest during the hearings of Estimates Committee D and this evening in an amount of $200,000 which he specified as originally being made available for Aboriginal children in the Northern Territory. When this matter was raised at Estimates Committee D, I did not appreciate that he was referring to nutritional aspects in the care of the children. Where such considerations are related to health care, they are of course the responsibility of the Department of Health. In this regard I am advised that no separate item has been provided in the votes for that Department, either in the current year or earlier, but additional nutritional supplements considered necessary as part of the treatment have been provided in the past at hospitals and rural centres, and the Minister for Health has indicated that this aspect of the provision of health care should be expanded out of the funds provided in the current estimates. The Minister has directed that expenditure on this activity be regarded as a priority and that he be advised if the provision of nutritional supplements required as part of treatment is inhibited by the fund situation. </para>
          <para>Many matters have been raised with regard to the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. I think I should give information on those matters on which I am able to supply it. It was said last week and again tonight that further information should be provided on the Aboriginal Legal Aid Service. It was said that guidelines had not been provided to the legal aid offices. I inform the Committee that these guidelines were discussed by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs ( <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner)</inline> with legal aid officers earlier this month and that he is to meet with them again in December, as I indicated last week. We hope that these matters will soon be resolved and that the legal aid officers will work in accordance with the requirements of the Government and provide the service of legal aid to Aborigines as we would require it to be provided. </para>
          <para>The matter of the hovercraft referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and others is a matter of some consideration. The Auditor-General, after a thorough investigation of this matter, reported the facts and expressed no opinion in his report. </para>
          <para class="block">The Department of Aboriginal Affairs had entered into negotiations for the construction of a hovercraft on the recommendation of the Department of Transport. A noted expert was retained as a consultant. He recommended the hire of a hovercraft to test the operational suitability of the craft. In the light of that experience, the escalating cost of the construction and the financial situation, the contract for the construction of a hovercraft was cancelled. All contracts were made through the Australian Government Stores and Tender Board or the Crown Solicitor, and there is no evidence or suggestion of any corruption as may have been suggested in some of the statements made this evening. I point out that the contract for the hire of the hovercraft was for a period of 12 months and that this period expired on 11 January 1976. This perhaps supplies the information that was requested when it was said that the Government had been in office only a few days when it cancelled the contract for the hovercraft. The expiry date of 1 1 January this year is the reply and response to that matter as it was raised. </para>
          <para>In a general way other matters were raised with regard to turtle farming and other experiments that may have been undertaken. Whilst this particular aspect of work has been the subject of detailed investigation, I think it should be said that the Public Accounts Committee has also conducted a very exhaustive examination of this matter. As I understand it, the report of that Committee is not yet available. I feel sure that when the Auditor-General stated that he believed that increasing delays in receiving information made it pointless for pursuit of the matter any further, it ought to be said that the Department of Aboriginal Affairs has been subjected to intensive investigation over a period of years by a number of inquiries and studies. If the Auditor-General reached the conclusion he did following some of the probing that he undertook, I can only accept his viewpoint. My own experience as a member of the Public Accounts Committee was that the general work of the Department was being impeded by the intensive investigation and the preparation of material. It would seem that whilst there has been concern about aspects that have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and others, the matter at this stage is still subject to report by the Public Accounts Committee. A great deal of information will be provided in that report on some of the matters that have been raised. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline>referred to the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee.

No funds have yet been provided for an election, again pending the outcome of the inquiry and its recommendations. </para>

              <para>- We now have the report of the inquiry. As I understood it, the Minister expected to table it this week. I had thought that it may have been today. Perhaps it will be tomorrow. That report will be made public and tabled, I suggest, this week in the Senate. If the recommendations are such that there is to be continuity of the Consultative Committee and there is to be an election for the members of it, funds can be provided in the supplementary estimates.

          <para>Aboriginal employment in the Northern Territory has had the attention of not only the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for Health but also myself and my own Department. I believe that the way in which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> raised the matters he did is a very responsible way in which to approach the subject. I would hope that we are able to provide further opportunities for employment and training for Aborigines in the Northern Territory and everywhere else in Australia. I have been concerned about the payment of unemployment benefits and other benefits through my Department and reports that these benefits are not always beneficial to the communities when they reach them. This is a matter that requires our attention and perhaps a policy decision, but I do not believe that it is a matter that has a simple resolution. Things have to be weighed against one another the dignity of work and the right of a person to have his own entitlement in his own name as against perhaps a community developing programs and projects which may benefit the entire community. Several Ministers have these matters under consideration. I hope that we will be able to enhance the employment and training opportunities and raise the standards in general of these people who live in communities around Australia. </para>
          <para>The matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> with regard to the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders will be kept under attention. The transport and communications of those people living in the Torres Strait Islands is a matter of concern to us all. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> raised more than once the items of expenditure under division 813.01, which as I realise are not in the Bill strictly before the Committee at this stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> required detail. I would refer him to the explanatory notes for the Senate Estimates Committees. Pages 66, 67 and 68 give great detail on many of the matters that were raised by him. In particular, on page 68 he will find a breakdown by States and a comparison of this year&#39;s expenditure with expenditure last year under the headings of housing, health, education, employment, welfare, enterprises, town management, recreation and so on. If it suits the convenience of this Committee I suggest that </para>

            <para>- I appreciate very much the full and satisfactory reply of the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> especially to the questions I raised. I take it that the hovercraft that was on hire was kept for the 12 months term of its hire and that the cancellation of the one that had been ordered for construction was caused, as the Minister said, by escalation of costs and financial restrictions and not because, as the Auditor-General said, it was the Department&#39;s opinion that it was not a suitable method of transport for the Torres Strait Islands. I think that statement going unquestioned could do a great disservice to the promoters of the hovercraft, who may desire to recommend its use in Australian waters on some future occasion. That establishes the fact that the waste that occurred through the necessity for cancellation was not the fault of the previous Government. It was an action of the present Minister. There may be some justification for it in the restrictions imposed upon him by the Treasurer, but at least the blame has been put where it rightly belongs. page 68 be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> as a complete answer to the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline></para>

            <para>- I refer to division 540- Administrative. I think that this is the occasion when I should raise a matter which I raised in August of this year and which is still important to me. I have told the Minister for Science <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Webster)</inline> that I intend to pursue this matter which I raised with him early in August concerning his department &#39;s liaison with the National Disasters Organisation in relation to weather reports generally and to other matters. He told me at the time that he understood that the Department was satisfied with the present arrangements. On 24 August, at page 21 1 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I asked him the following question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The Minister for Science will recall that recently I asked him whether or not in his opinion sufficient weather and other information was available to the Natural Disasters Organisation to enable it to perform its duties properly. I refer in particular to this morning&#39;s Press report about the second earth tremor in Darwin. The article stated that the Bureau of Mineral Resources in Canberra did not learn about the tremor until yesterday because its telegraphic equipment connecting Darwin with the Bureau in Canberra had not operated since the Darwin cyclone. Is the Minister able to bring us up to date on these matters? Will he look again to ascertain whether the Natural Disasters Organisation has the best equipment possible to enable it to perform is national duties? </para>

          <para class="block">The Minister referred generally to the question which he had answered before and said that that answer indicated that the Organisation had direct communication with Darwin and, so far as he was aware, did not require any other.

          <para class="block">My inquiries reveal that there are insufficient copies of this report available for all honourable senators. I am disturbed about this because the report contains some vitally important information which will be of great concern to many people who have an interest in the quality of the water in the River Murray. I am concerned not only that there are not sufficient copies available for all honourable senators but also that there may not be enough copies available in the government book selling outlets for people who want to purchase copies. I vividly remember the unavailability of copies of the report of the River Murray Working Party. I hope that the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> can take action to see that sufficient copies are made available. He may be able to tell me why there are not sufficient copies now. I hope that it is not because of economic factors and is not another of the cutbacks in expenditure by the present Government. </para>

              <para>- Victoria has 2 newspapers on the rack. I found that there are no Western Australian newspapers, and that should be of some concern to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> who is interjecting. Also there are no Tasmanian, Queensland or South Australian newspapers. The absence of South Australian newspapers concerns me greatly. I have observed over a long period that the newspapers from all the States which were displayed in the lower corridor until several weeks ago were very popular and well patronised. The removal of these newspapers undoubtedly must place a greater strain on the facilities available on the main floor of the Library. I am concerned that no South Australian newspapers are available for reading in the lower corridor and I would like to be informed of the reason for the removal of the newspapers from that area. I ask whether this is another facet of the Government&#39;s economy drive or whether in the case of the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> it is because the Leader of the Opposition in South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Tonkin,</inline> has described the <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> as &#39; Dunstan &#39;s Daily &#39;. </para>

            <para>- Some days ago I raised in this chamber, during the discussion of an urgency motion on civil liberties, the problem of the Mount Lar com farmers in Queensland. Whilst I do not want to go into a long debate tonight- I am not in the habit of speaking every night in the adjournment debate- there are a number of things I have to raise in order to get some sort of satisfaction. It will be recalled that over a period of time, and particularly during this sessional period, I have raised a number of matters in the hope that some Minister would be able to give me some information about what was likely to happen or what action the Government was taking in regard to them. No information of this son has been given. It is obvious that the Government, in its concentration on the reduction of inflation, has forgotten all about the human side of life. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Mount Lar com incident concerned almost half a hundred farmers and their families, who have been deprived of a living because of collusion between the Government of Queensland and a certain mining company which I have nominated previously. In my view there are 3 steps that can be taken, and perhaps all three will have to be taken. A royal commission ought to be initiated by this Government; the matter ought to be referred to the Trade Practices Commission; and, probably the most logical thing to do, the matter ought to be investigated because it does appear that there might be export of the products from this mining field and this is an area in which the Australian Government can act. If none of these things is done I propose to refer all the documents and everything associated with the Mount Lar com scandal to the Queensland Council for Civil Liberties. Civil liberties groups appear to be the only watchdogs of the rights of individuals in Australia today. </para>
          <para>It is some days since I first raised this matter, so I want to run over some of the points again as background information. The first work carried out in this area by this mining company was back in 1969. The company started construction of the Bulwer Island cement plant in Brisbane early in the 1970s. The plant was completed in 1975. This was well before the final decision on the Mount Lar com mining case was made public. It is pretty obvious that the company was sure, because of its collusion with the State Government, that it would get a cess to this area for mining. The  chairman  of Queensland Cement, which was the company involved, stated in the company&#39;s 1975 report. </para>
          <para>This cement plant was built to take the Gladstone clinker material which would be made from the Mount Lar com material. </para>
          <para class="block">There was a deputation of farmers to the Minister for Mines. Those farmers took along their maps showing alternative limestone localities, but the Minister said: &#39;I&#39;ve got more maps than you- and I am not interested in looking at yours&#39;. That was totally arrogant. Obviously that Minister also was involved in some sore of collusion. The Mines Department has stated that if the farmers did not give all the land to Darra for mining the Department would not give it to any other company but would hold it in trust for Darra which would want it at some future date. In other words, Darra has stated that it has reduced the size of its leases; that it can come back at any time and get the land. There is no reason why the land cannot be sold to anyone else. Of course, if there were an attempt to do this the State Government would step in and prevent it. </para>
          <para>At the mining warden&#39;s hearing, Darra Cement said that it would need all the land, otherwise the project was uneconomical. Both the Queensland Premier and the Minister for </para>
          <para class="block">Mines told the members of the group quite vocally that if they went to the Press any more the Premier and the Minister for Mines would drop them, not do anything for them and leave them to fight their own battles on a miner&#39;s homestead lease. This statement was made to the farmers on 24 June 1976. 1 am taking up the case for these people, not because 1 suspect that there are any votes in it but because human lives and civil liberties are involved. This sort of thing should not go on in this country in 1976, where a major mining company, in collusion with the State Government, can trample on the civil liberties of a group of people in this area. There was a promise at the time that a decision on the matter would not be made until there was a round table conference with the farmers, the mining company, the Department and all other concerned parties. But the farmers at that time were so upset about this matter that in the by-election in the Port Curtis electorate they decided to ban the election. They wrote letters to the Premier, to the Minister for Mines and to the Department, but they did not receive a reply to any of that correspondence. </para>
          <para>Two wells and one bore in the area have started yielding poor returns. All that had happened to that point of time was that a number of holes had been drilled to test the area. The farmers need the underground water supplies. These are the supplies on which they rely to keep their heads above water, to use a phrase that is probably not very appropriate in that context. They need the underground water supplies in order to make their properties reasonably prosperous and so that they can earn a reasonable living. On 20 October 1976 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> and I endeavoured to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a number of documents. The excuse given by the Government at that time for not allowing the incorporation of the documents was that it did not have much money and would not be able to afford the extra size of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> Since then this matter has become a controversy in that some of the documents were hand written. It appears that in future, after the appropriate committee has looked at this matter, we may have to type out handwritten documents before they can be incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>
          <para>Tonight I will ask for leave to incorporate only one letter in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> It is in very clear typing. It would Le quite readable by the people who have to set it in print. I am not blaming the people who have to set documents in print for documents not being incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I think the reason why their incorporation has not been allowed goes much deeper than that, and that is casting no aspersions on you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> This happens to be a case of scandal proportions. A number of honourable senators opposite are ashamed of what has happened. There are people in the Queensland Parliament who hope that the scandal will never get out, because if it does some of them probably will not hold their seats at the next election. In the meantime the welfare and the livelihood of almost 50 families are at stake. Some of the documents were incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and we tabled some of them on the following day. Two-thirds of the documents were incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> either on the day on which the case was presented or on the following day. I am not seeking the incorporation of other documents at the moment. I will do that at the appropriate time. </para>
          <para>The liberty and rights of the Mount Lar com farmers are under continual threat by the Queensland Government and by Darra Mining, which is an offshoot of a cement company which controls nearly all Queensland &#39;s cement outlets. The company fixes its own prices; it has a monopoly in Queensland. I believe that this is a reason why the Trade Practices Commission should properly investigate the company. I hope that when the Government reads in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> what I have said tonight it will do something about the matter. Since being granted the mining leases in the Brace well East End areas earlier this year the mining company has continued to study the area in terms of surveying for roads, etc. Often these surveyors and company officials have shown no thought or courtesy by advising or asking the farmers whether it was all right if they went on to their lands. They have just taken a total liberty in do this sort thing. </para>
          <para>Recently a number of surveyors arrived in Mount Lar com and proceeded to survey the property of a man named Paddy Coughlan without his permission. In other words, they trespassed. When he approached them he found that they did not have a letter of authority from the company or the company&#39;s consultant engineers. In fact, they were trespassers in the strict letter of the law. They left on his request but returned on 20 October 1976 with a letter of authority. This has all happened in the last two or three weeks. The letter is the reason why I raise the matter again because contained within it is certain evidence which suggests to me that it is i Federal issue and that it should be immediately investigated. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as you have already glanced at the letter, and in order to save time, I seek leave now to incorporate the letter in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>-Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> You will note that there are no 4-letter words in it, although I think that some of the people who have had to put up with what is outlined in the letter would probably be using 4-letter words. Those honourable senators who read the letter in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> tomorrow will note that it is headed Joint Venture Gladstone Project&#39;. I was always under the impression that joint ventures had to have the seal of approval of the Federal Government. I do not know; maybe this Government has changed the law. It has changed an awful lot of laws since 13 December last year. It is ignoring some laws altogether as though they did not exist. Of course, it has silently changed other laws when the moon has gone down at night. There is a suspicion that one of the parties in the joint venture may be a foreign company. One would think that the Federal Government would have some interest in it. According to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser),</inline> the Government has an interest in foreign capital. The consultant engineers for Darra Mining are Holder bank, which is a Swiss company. I do not know what the holdings in that company are, but it is the Federal Government&#39;s responsibility to find out. It seems more than a coincidence that a senior management person, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Walker, who incidentally was responsible for most of the ground work in the Mount Lar com area, was recently in Switzerland. We do not know why he went to Switzerland. Maybe he moved around like that other friend of honourable senators opposite, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wiley</inline> Fancher, who travelled about at government expense for a long period. He did not do anything except use government money. Rumours would indicate that the purpose of the visit by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Walker could have been to raise foreign capital for the mining project. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
		  <para>I am very disturbed about happenings in Queensland concerning this matter. I respectfully request the Government to investigate a number of matters immediately. There is no need for me to reiterate them. I think most honourable senators opposite would not particularly trust the Premier of Queensland, and that is not being nasty to him, although I did note yesterday that a well known Minister in Queensland said that the Premier was the only God-fearing political leader in Australia and that he is the only man who works according to the word of God. I think that there are a few Christians in this Parliament. If that Minister had any money I would be prepared to sue him for it, but obviously he does not have any money. So he is getting a little bit of cheap publicity. The matters that startle me and which indicate that things are not what they should be must be investigated immediately by this Government before dozens of families are wrongfully evicted from their land. I want answers to the following questions because at the moment these people are living under a reign of terror. They are being stampeded by the mining company, they are being stampeded by the Queensland Government and they are being stampeded by others who are interested in the venture in an indirect way. </para>
          <para>I pose these questions: What does the term Joint Venture Gladstone Project&#39; mean? The Government ought to be able to come up with replies to these questions. Who are the companies involved? Are any of them foreign-owned or controlled? If they are foreign-owned or controlled, how much Swiss money or capital is involved? Has this joint venture been ratified by the Federal Government? That is right on the doorstep of this Government. Is the Government aware of the many claims by all those concerned that there has been collusion over a long period between the company concerned and the Queensland Government? What is the Australian Government going to do to protect the rights of the farmers if this is true? Is the Government going to intervene? Is it going to lean- to use the difficult political word- on the Queensland Government to make sure these people get a fair go or is it, like a number of other people, running scared of the Queensland Government in case the Premier decides to secede? Can somebody tell me why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Walker</inline> went overseas? Was it to arrange finance for the project or did he go over on a health trip at company expense? If all these things have happened did the Federal Government give them any sort of official sanction? </para>
          <para>These are very important questions. I hope the Government will take them on board. I hope it will have the political honesty to investigate the case of these people. Maybe 50 farmers and their families do not particularly concern the Government. Maybe that is only a drop in the bucket and maybe because they live in the electorate of Capricornia the Government is not going to be worried about them at the next Federal election. But if the Government multiplies this many times- this is happening in a number of other places around Australia- it will see that it will have an effect on the Government&#39;s voting pattern. So I suggest with very great respect that as soon as the Government can investigate this matter it ought to be investigated and the people of this area ought to be told what is going to happen to them. </para>

            <para>- This evening I wish to raise some matters in regard to the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#39;s news services in Queensland since the introduction of daylight saving in the southern States. On 13 October a Government <inline font-weight="bold">Senator asked</inline> a question in relation to this subject and this was of course before daylight saving was introduced. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> gave what was probably meant to be a jocular reply but with all respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> I would say that some people in Queensland who read the reply would consider it to be a flippant reply. This is a very real problem to people in Queensland. In reply to a question about what would happen to news broadcasts when daylight saving was introduced in the southern States <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>Of course, some solutions can be offered. One alternative solution is for Queensland to adopt eastern summer time and then no such prob elms would arise. Assuming the assertion of the right to be different, what happened in the past, as I understand it, is that the radio stations and television stations recorded the programs and rebroadcast them so that in fact the curtains did not have to fade in Queensland and the people heard their programs on time. I am not aware that there is any difficulty with this matter, but if there is any likelihood that the programs will not be readjusted I will bring the question to the attention of the relevant Minister and seek a reply. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There have been some aspects of readjustment which Queensland people have had to face. For instance, the ABC program <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> is now heard at 5.5 p.m. rather than 6.5 p.m. I think this has resulted in a smaller listening audience to the program. Additionally the main radio news service is now broadcast at 6 p.m. rather than at 7 p.m. I am referring to radio news services, not television. A number of people have come to me and said that the new arrangement of having the radio news service broadcast at 6 p.m. rather than at 7 p.m. is not satisfactory. Other people have complained that they are not able to listen to the program <inline font-style="italic">PM</inline> because of its new time slot one hour earlier. The argument has been put, I think, very succinctly in a letter that I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jackman</inline> the Secretary of the Graziers Association of Central and Northern Queensland. Because the argument is so well put I would like to read this letter to the Senate. It says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Resulting from a meeting of the Muttaburra branch of this Association held on Saturday 23 October 1976, 1 have been asked by the branch to forward a copy of a motion adopted at the meeting, lodging the strongest possible protest at the changed times of the ABC Queensland news broadcasts due to commence after daylight saving comes into being in the southern States. </para>
            <para>The feelings of the members of the Muttaburra branch are those of many people in western Queensland and we seek your assistance to have the matter rectified. </para>
            <para>The resolution reads&#39;. </para>
            <para>That complete disgust at the change of news times on ABC be voiced to the appropriate authority- the main reason for objecting to daylight saving on radio by inland country and urban people is that owing to working by daylight rather than by time we don &#39;t always hear the news during the daylight hours, therefore we rely heavily on the evening news. Most people in Queensland are literate and take great interest in current affairs, and as we contribute towards the payment of ABC staff we should have some say in how our programs are run. </para>
            <para>The general opinion is that the news, local, State and national, be broadcast as usual between 6.45 p.m. and 7. IS p.m. Queensland summer time, or normal Eastern Standard Time, and if the southern States elect to change to daylight saving time then may they suffer the consequences by having their news at 8 p.m.&#39; </para>
            <para>I would point out that the majority of the population listening to radio are country people or urban people living in remote towns and therefore by altering the timetable the ABC is discriminating against the majority of the audience. </para>
            <para>Finally I would point out that most country and urban people prefer to work during the cooler part of the daylight hours in summer and therefore 6 p.m. as a news time in Queensland would be wasting the ABC&#39;s time and our money, as there would be little or no audience to hear the program. </para>
            <para>We therefore request the ABC to return to the 7 p.m. time slot as it is a more equitable hour for most people in this State to listen to news broadcasts. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There is little that I can add to what I think is a succinct argument by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jackman.</inline> I would say, however, that it is all very well for people in Canberra to sit here and receive their news broadcasts at 7 p.m. but it would be well for them to think of the people in the western areas of Queensland who do have the problems which were expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jackman</inline> and would like to have the ABC news which was previously received at 7 o&#39;clock to be broadcast still at 7 p.m. rather than 6 p.m. So I ask the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to take my comments as serious comments and give them due consideration and to give due consideration to the points that have been put by the people who are being disadvantaged now in Queensland because of a re-allocation of program times in that State. </para>

              <para>- That is a straightforward and an earnest attempt to deal with the matter. The simple fact is that what the honourable senator has not said is that as regards television and television news the Australian Broadcasting Commission television station has adjusted. They record and hold and transmit at 7 p.m. Queensland time. So what I have foreshadowed before is happening with television. The honourable senator now says that it is not happening with radio. He has put forward some information concerning a cross-section of people who hold the view that 6 o&#39;clock is too early and 7 o&#39;clock should not be too early. I remind him that this is a matter of judgment in the various States. For instance, in my State the habit of the commercial television stations is to move backwards towards 6 o&#39;clock as the time for the most popular demand for a viewing hour for news. </para>

It partly concerns mining and partly civil liberties. I shall draw his remarks to the attention of the relevant Minister. In relation to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren&#39;s</inline> remarks, I shall seek information as to the number of copies already printed and whether there are sufficient copies both for distribution and for sale.

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator McLaren</inline>raised matters in regard to the reduction in the number of newspapers in the lower corridor at Parliament House. I must point out to the honourable senator that each honourable senator receives 3 newspapers of his or her choosing in his or her office. Further, 44 daily newspapers are delivered to the Liberal Party and the Australian Labor Party and 28 to the National Country Party to enable all honourable senators to have access to newspapers without having to wait for some other person first to look at them on arrival, and so on. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the Parliamentary Library is a complete coverage of newspapers. It was deemed to be excessively wasteful to have the number of newspapers which were hitherto provided in the lower corridor. In respect to the spread of newspapers as between States, this is a matter that I shall investigate immediately. I can assure the honourable senator that I receive the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">Advertiser</inline> daily, as he would in his own office. But I was not aware that the coverage of all States down in the lower gallery was not being provided. That I shall attend to. </para>

            <item label="(1)">
              <para>Yes. Investigations into Freon 1 1 (FI 1) are conducted on a regular and continuing basis by the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Physics as part of its overall research into pollutants. Fuller details are given in the answer to part (5). Measurements of Freon 12 (FI 2) in Australia are not made at present. </para>

          <para>Special studies have been conducted by United States Government agencies and other investigations are being carried out by the WHO, WMO, UNEP and the OECD. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Yes, it is the opinion of research workers both here and overseas that the gases constituting refrigerants and aerosol can propellants are present in the atmosphere solely as a result of human activity. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Yes. Research at the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Physics recently confirmed that almost all of the carbon tetrachloride in the atmosphere is of man-made origin. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>There is a general agreement amongst workers in this area that man-made pollutants could be a threat to stratospheric ozone. However, since the inception of CSIRO &#39;s ozone program some 20 years ago results have provided no definite evidence on any change in the concentration of stratospheric ozone which can be ascribed to pollutants. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>It is essential to understand that present knowledge of stratospheric chemistry is insufficient to say more than that a threat is possible. Also, because of the absence of well defined trends in observations to date, it is not possible to draw any reliable conclusions as to what the future holds. </para>
          <para>The most recent reports on this subject was presented in September by the United States National Academy of Science. At present only a summary is available. Although the report does not reach firm conclusions it makes clear that potential threat to the stratosphere by man-made pollutants does exist. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(5)">
              <para>For almost 20 years the CSIRO Division of Atmospheric Physics has adopted a network of ozone observing stations stretching from Darwin through Brisbane, Aspendale, Perth and Hob an to Macquarie Island. Measurements are made daily. On a fortnightly basis balloon borne sampling of ozone is carried out from Aspendale. This provides a vertical profile of ozone concentrations from ground level to, approximately, 27 000 metres. Ozone in the surface air is also measured continuously at Aspendale and on a once daily basis at Macquarie Island. </para>

          <para>On a regular and continuing basis the Division monitors the following atmospheric pollutants all of which could conceivably have a deleterious effect on the ozone layer. </para>

            <item label="(a)">
              <para>Freon 1 1. Ground level concentrations of Freon 1 1 are monitored regularly at Aspendale and Cape Grim in Tasmania (the interim site for the Australian Baseline Station). Using aircraft sampling the Freon 1 1 content of air at 4000 metres over Bass Strait and at 9000 metres over the Great Australian Bight is regularly measured. Recently, the Division commenced a limited sampling program of this gas up to 27 000 metres (well into the stratosphere) using high altitude balloons. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(b)">
              <para>Oxides of Nitrogen. These occur as the products of industry, as components of exhaust gases of motor cars and aero-engines and as a result of widespread use of artificial fertilizers. It is hypothesised that they could cause a reduction in the concentration of atmospheric ozone. Concentrations of these gases in the near surface air are currently measured at Aspendale and Brisbane and measurements will soon commence in Penh. Next year, it is proposed to start monitoring nitric oxide in the stratosphere- the first such measurements made in the Southern Hemisphere. Only just started is the measurement of nitrous oxide, the results of which work will provide a link with the problem of artificial fertilizers. </para>

            <item label="(c)">
              <para>Erythemal ultra-violet radiation (those wave-lengths considered to increase the incidence of skin cancer). A network of <inline font-style="italic">6</inline> erythemal ultra-violet radiation monitoring stations over Australia was established one year ago. The apprehension expressed over a reduction in stratospheric ozone is related directly to the increased ultra-violet which a depleted ozone layer, acting as an ultra-violet filter, would let through. Systematic trends can be ascertained only after several years data have been acquired. </para>

          <para>In conclusion, I would like to point out that an interdepartmental committee, convened by my Department, is currently considering what steps might be taken to further develop Australia&#39;s involvement in the investigation of the stratosphere. Investigations aimed at a better understanding of possible dangers to the stratosphere from human activities are receiving particular attention from the committee. </para>

              <para>and (3) The honourable senator will be aware that the Medibank hospital agreements between the Commonwealth and State governments have been declared invalid by the Commonwealth and that negotiations are presently proceeding for the drawing up of new Medibank hospital agreements to be effective <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> 1 October 1 976. </para>
            </item>

          <para>Under the new agreements, it is proposed that the Commonwealth will pay to the respective States an amount equal to 50 per cent of the net operating costs of all the recognised hospitals in the State based on the agreed budgets of those hospitals or the aggregate of the amounts paid by the State to or rar the recognised hospitals in the State as its share of the net operating costs of those hospitals, whichever is the less. </para>
          <para>The new agreements will provide for the establishment of <inline font-style="italic">State</inline> standing committees- an innovation aimed at putting the lid on the open-ended nature of the previous cost-sharing arrangements. </para>
          <para>The net operating costs to be shared are to be based on annual budgets and variations thereto formulated by the State standing committees, which are to consist of Commonwealth and State officers, and approved jointly by myself and the respective State Health Minister. </para>
          <para>In carrying out their function, the State standing committees will endeavour to apply principles aimed at achieving operating economies in recognised hospitals and central services consistent with maintain or achieving an acceptably high standard of health care. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator will agree, being himself a medical practitioner, that research carried out in our teaching hospitals is vital in the maintenance of high standards of health care. Costs incurred in research projects associated with patient care are acceptable as forming pan of net operating costs for cost-sharing purposes. </para>
          <para>The costs of research in teaching hospitals are only one of the components in the relatively higher costs of teaching hospitals as reported in the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Medical Journal</inline> More significant are the increasing sophistication of medicine leading to greater numbers of resident staff, who are to some extent still undergoing postgraduate training, increased number of specialists, greater capital and maintenance costs of sophisticated apparatus, increasing expectations of patients, and substantial increases in salary rates as compared with general community experience. Research into methods and techniques of diagnosis and treatment and therefore related directly to patient care may be inseparable from such care. In addition, the benefits of research and postgraduate teaching will flow over to all patient care, no matter where it takes place. </para>
          <para>Nevertheless factors such as these will be examined by the State standing committees. </para>

              <para>The reports from Japan that milk may give some protection against stomach cancer do not appear to have been confirmed in any other countries. It may be that in Japan, where stomach cancer is particularly common, the disease has causes different from those in other countries. The disease is also rapidly becoming less common in Australia. In these circumstances, there is not sufficient justification to warrant the transfer of scarce resources from research projects of higher priority and it is not intended that a special study of the matter be made in this country at this stage. </para>

            <para>Is the Minister aware that duty free shops at Australian airports stock only a few brands of cigarettes, all of which have extremely high tar content? In view of the Government&#39;s consistent policy of discouraging the promotion of tobacco sales because of tobacco&#39;s association with lung cancer, will the Minister take steps to see that the duty free shops at least stock competing popular brands of cigarettes which have an acknowledged low tar content? </para>

              <para>. tam unaware myself, and lam not sure whether my colleague in another place is aware, that duty free shops at airports stock only those cigarettes with a high tar content. I shall ask my colleague to have an inquiry made. Should it in fact reveal that to be true, I will ask my colleague whether he will happily refer the matter to the Minister for Health so that the steps as indicated can be taken. </para>

            <para>The duty free shops are operated under authorities issued under the Airports (Business Concessions) Act after the calling of public tenders. The Department of Transport has not the contractual right to require the duty free concessionaires to stock a certain brand of cigarettes. It does ask the concessionaires, however, to carry a representative selection. Our inquiries reveal that at each of the two largest airports, Sydney and Melbourne, among the cigarettes being merchandised by the concessionaire are at least 7-10 brands which are reputed to have a low tar content. </para>
