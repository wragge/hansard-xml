          <para class="block">To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled. The petition of the undersigned citizens of Australia respectfully showeth: </para>
          <para>That residents of the suburb of Fraser, in the Australian Capital Territory are deeply concerned at the lack of adequate educational facilities to be made available to our primary school aged children. </para>
          <para>That plans to remove children daily to other suburbs will cause overcrowding, will force parents to private transport or pay bus levies, and will make a mockery of the frequently quoted A.C.T. Schools Authority policy that primary school students should have access to a school within reasonable walking distance of their homes. </para>
          <para>That population trends in Fraser and adjoining suburbs more than adequately prove the need for a separate primary school in each of these suburbs. </para>
          <para>That a primary school in the suburb would provide an important focus for an area which currently lacks any identity as a community. </para>
          <para>That plans to distribute Fraser students between two to four different schools in adjoining areas may well frustrate the social development of many ofthese young persons, forcing them into a situation where they must relate to two different sets of peers. </para>
          <para>Your petitioners therefore most humbly pray that Senate in Parliament assembled will take urgent steps to revise current plans for the education of our children with a view to the provision of a government primary school in Fraser. </para>

I ask: As it has now been claimed by the Liberal Party in a brochure to be issued on 13 December that unavoidable devaluation was one of the Government&#39;s major achievements&#39;, can the Minister explain to the Senate how something that is unavoidable can be a major achievement? Can he also tell the Senate what other unavoidable acts the Government hopes to achieve in 1977? </para>

The Leader of the Opposition picked out one word in a phrase in a pamphlet. I have no intention of answering questions in relation to a word plucked out of some hundreds of words. It is one of the oldest tricks in the book to take something out of context and seek an explanation on it, even though it is totally out of context. </para>

              <para>- Why did the Leader of the Opposition say that it is being issued on 13 December if he has a copy of it today, which is 10 December? Honourable senators opposite seem to spend all their time reading various publications. I assure the honourable senator that I can well understand why the previous Government got into such a mess. It spent all its time reading newspapers and documents, whereas this Government gets on with the business of governing and running its departments. We do not have to keep switching our Treasurer or our Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. We do not have to hire Khemlanis to tell us how to get overseas loans. We do not have to have funny Executive Council meetings in secret at the Lodge, out of which unusual situations arise. This Government is a government of competence. We get on with the business of governing and not just chasing hares here, there and everywhere. </para>

I refer to the report in the Australian of 12 November, outlining the results of the tests conducted by the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration into the concentrations of propel- lant gases, mainly fluorocarbons in the southern hemisphere. Are these tests part of a continuing program to ascertain the effect of these fluorocarbons on the ozone layer? Will recommendations be made regarding any necessary regulations on such propellant gases? If so, can the Minister indicate when the recommendations are likely to be available? </para>

            <para>- I answered a question in the Senate some time ago relating to the effect of pollution of the atmosphere. I say to the Senate and to the honourable senator that I believe that this is perhaps one of the most important areas of scientific investigation taking place in the world at the present time. The pollution of the atmosphere of the world is important to its inhabitants. The direct answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question relating to the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> of 12 November is that in part the article is correct and in part it is incorrect. So far as I can recall, the article suggested that high levels of Freon II exist in the atmosphere. That is apparently the substance which is mainly the basis of the propellant force in aerosol cans. It is apparently a non-degradable substance and can have some quite devastating effects on the ozone layer. The article was written in response to information that the National Aeronautics and Space Administration Commission of the United States had sent an aircraft to Australia to assist in the monitoring of the quality of the equipment we were using in Australia to test the atmosphere and its pollutants. The result of that flight and the equipment I saw were quite surprising in some respects. Although CSIRO scientists have been looking at the effects of pollution for over 20 years, this is a very new branch of science. The Senate will appreciate the importance of Australia joining in an international group to establish base line air pollution studies. An association has been formed and stations set up in Samoa, Hawaii and at Barrow in Alaska, and attempts are being made to decide what is the base content of the atmosphere. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The aircraft to which I referred flew in a gradually rising motion to some 27 000 metres, which is a very high level, and tested the levels of pollutants, particularly in relation to Freon II. The test led to the surprising conclusion that the level of pollution of the southern hemisphere is very near to that of the northern hemisphere. It had been suggested that because of industrialisation and the greater population in the northern hemisphere the high levels of pollution found there would not be found in Australia. However, it was found that the pollution in our atmosphere is within 8 per cent to 10 per cent of that of the northern hemisphere. The monitoring of our equipment and the monitoring of the atmosphere are particularly important. We should all be very proud that a station has been established in Tasmania at Cape Grimm. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devitt</inline> have asked questions about it previously. It is from that station and from a permanent station which we hope to establish before very long in southern Tasmania that we will be monitoring the atmosphere. In regard to regulations, I doubt very much whether we will be able to bring them forward for some years. </para>

I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources by reminding him of the -continuing saga of Mareeba Mining No Liability. Is the Minister aware that unless the company receives a reprieve and funding before 14 December 1976 it will become insolvent and in breach of the Companies Act? Will that mean that the promising high grade Dianne copper deposit will be sold, possibly to overseas companies? Will the Government come to the aid of this allAustralian company by giving a deed of release for the company&#39;s last house in Mareeba so that the company may sell the house to generate a cash flow to pay overdue accounts and the company&#39;s geologists&#39; salaries for the next few weeks? Will the Minister also ensure that his Government gives this proposal immediate and urgent consideration in order to give the company some breathing space? </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator was kind enough to alert me that he would be requiring some information on this subject and I have been advised by my colleague that the short answer is that a wife has no mandatory power to deny the issue of a passport to her husband. Neither the Passports Act nor the passport regulations contain any specific reference to consent of spouse. Section 7 of the Passports Act provides the Minister with discretionary power to grant or refuse a passport. In the exercise of this discretionary power successive Ministers- Ministers of Immigration prior to the transfer of responsibility to the Minister for Foreign Affairs in 1975, and Ministers for Foreign Affairs since then- have followed the practice of requiring an applicant for a passport, if married, to obtain the consent of his or her spouse. </para>

            <para>-The report is in printed form now and is available. I, as Minister for Education, have had the opportunity to study it only briefly. I had the opportunity yesterday, a valuable one but a brief one necessarily, to talk to its author, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Fitzgerald.</inline> I have undertaken to study the report myself and to have my Department study it in depth in the days and weeks immediately ahead. I will seek a very detailed discussion again with <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Fitzgerald</inline> in the near future. The report raises some profound questions, and I use word advisedly. Those questions are borne out by studies elsewhere by a working party from the Australian Education Council on transition from secondary schooling to work, by the study at the moment in dialogue in Paris at the Organisation of Economic Co-operation and Development on transition from school to work based on study done in Australia. All these things tend to point to the fact that a student on leaving school at this moment is, in the main, not effectively equipped for vocational transference and orientation. Perhaps we have oriented education over decades more towards a general and special kind of education that would aid the 20 per cent or 25 per cent that go on to matriculation and tertiary education than towards the great bulk of students. There are so many profound questions involved. There are the questions of whether primary and secondary education are effective; whether technical education has been underprivileged and even neglected. All these things are important and also are indicated by the nature and construction of unemployment today. I regret the length of this answer but the subject is an important one. It is well to point out that 40 per cent of our unemployed people are under 2 1 years of age; three-quarters of those receiving the unemployment benefit are without dependants, as I understand my colleague the Minister for Social Security would indicate. That being so, in the past 4 years there has been a transfer of some unemployability to a group which formerly enjoyed full employment continuously. I do not seek to draw any political inference from that; I just seek to find out what is the reason for it. The facts are so significant and so depressing that they require the greatest study and, in conjunction with other departments, my Deparetment will undertake that study immediately. </para>

He will be aware of the statistics recently released which show that collection of company tax for the first 5 months of the financial year 1976-77 amount to only $50.7m as against a figure of $938m for the same period last financial year. This presumably is as a result of the abolition of quarterly company tax payments.

            <para>-I direct a question to the Minister representing the Prime Minister. In an answer to a question from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> the Minister referred to secret meetings at the Lodge. I refer now to midnight meetings in Parliament House. What was the purpose of the visit of 6 Treasury officials to Parliament House at midnight last night? Why did the Prime Minister request their attendance? Is this an indication that there is to be a change in economic initiative? If the meeting was important enough to need the attendance of 6 Treasury officials, why did they have to enter Parliament House in such a surreptitious manner through the back door? </para>

            <para>-I am somewhat surprised at the honourable senator&#39;s question. I think he is seeing spooks at the bottom of the garden. He does not say how those people entered surreptitiously. Did they come in in boxes? Did they come in with cloaks and daggers? An honourable senator suggests by interjection that they came in in tea chests. Honourable senators opposite cannot understand- they all have a 35-hour week mentality- that people on our side of the Parliament are prepared to work about 28 hours a day 7 days a week. </para>

Are there any other known instances of opium poppy seed being made available inadvertently?

            <para>-No instance such as has been suggested in the question has been referred to the Commonwealth Department of Health. The only legitimate growing of opium poppy is in Tasmania, and the industry is strictly controlled by the Commonwealth and Tasmanian governments. Lucerne seed is not produced in Tasmania for supply to the mainand. Any certified lucerne seed would not contain poppy seed, due to the difference in size and shape. No other instance of mixed seeds is known. The growing of opium poppy is illegal in all States, other than the controlled cultivation in Tasmania. The Department of Health, in conjunction with State authorities, takes all precautions to prevent illicit cultivation and to eradicate unathorised growing. I am able to assure the Senate that the Minister for Health is making inquiries into the report that was the subject of the question. If any information is to be released, it will be done by him. </para>

            <para>- The only knowledge that I have of this matter has been gained from a brief newspaper report which, I point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> I read this morning. It did not give the reason for the resignation of the chosen candidate from the Liberal Party&#39;s preselection team for the seat of Balcatta, but it did say that he had decided that he would assist the Labor Party&#39;s candidate. That in itself seemed to indicate to me some confusion in the mind of the candidate who had been formerly preselected by the Liberals. If the reason for his resignation was not as was suggested- that is, the he was unable to work with the Liberal Party members of the branches in that area- but was because he felt that there had been discriminatory remarks made against him or his wife, I would suggest that the Commissioner for Community Relations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby,</inline> could look into the situation. Perhaps he would be able to reconcile the facts as they are and the confusion in the mind of the former candidate and have made any appropriate apology that should be made to him. </para>

            <para>-I think that I have mentioned before- if not, I should have- that a statement is issued each month by the Treasury on this matter. It comes out at about the middle of each month. I suppose the next one will be available in about another week. The statement shows government financing transactions in fine detail for the year to date- actual against estimates- and for the previous year in comparative terms, how that amount of expenditure has been financed and, if there is a deficit, how the deficit has been financed. It is a statement which covers fully the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland. Like him, I shall have to wait for it. </para>

            <para>-My question, which I direct to the Minister representing the Minister for the Northern Territory, follows questions asked previously by both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> and myself concerning the supply of electricity to the Darwin area. The Minister will be aware of reports of frequent blackouts and selective interruptions to the Darwin power supply. My information is that the problem is two-fold- shortage of staff at the power house and inadequate capacity of the generators to meet peak load while allowing for maintenance. Will the Minister see whether more staff can be provided and will he take action to ensure that an additional generator is procured to enable regular maintenance to be carried out so that a reliable power supply can be provided for the people of Darwin? </para>

            <para>- I acknowledge that apparently there have been some minor power failures in the Darwin power house over recent months. My understanding is that prior to cyclone Tracy the power lines from the power house to an extent were not as good as they could be. A problem has existed for some time. My understanding is that the disruptions to the power supply have nothing whatsoever to do with a shortage of labour but have resulted mainly from breakdowns of equipment. Several turbines have broken down. In one instance it was necessary to bring turbine blades from Sweden. Apparently an assurance has not been able to be given that the back-up system will prevent temporary blackouts from occurring. If I can give the honourable senator further information I shall do so; but he can be assured that those responsible for this matter in the Northern Territory are attempting to keep the supply of electricity to the population as assurred as possible. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport. To what extent are Australian domestic airlines, one of which is a statutory authority of the Commonwealth, permitted to sell more air tickets than there are seats on aircraft? What regulations exist to prevent or to police this practice? What are the rights of a passenger who, having purchased a ticket and believing that he is able to travel on a particular flight, finds that he is off-loaded because of overbooking? Is there any move to insist that airlines indicate to all extra passengers that in fact they are only waitlisted for a particular flight? </para>

            <para>- I do not have detailed or authoritative answers to the series of questions asked by the honourable senator. I think that the questions he asks are important. As a preliminary, I make these comments, subject to check: In the first place I understand that it is the practice of airlines to sell in some cases, if not in all cases, more tickets than there are seats on the aircraft on the basis that invariably there is a wastage or a failure of passengers to turn up for a flight. If that is so and it can be guaranteed, clearly that is in the interests of both the public and the airlines, because if an aircraft can carry a high passenger load that ultimately will keep the cost of a ticket down. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Of course, the honourable senator&#39;s question is directed, and properly so, to the rights of the traveller in taking out a ticket. My own impression, with my meagre knowledge of the law, is that all travellers who use public carriers are invited to read the small print on the back of their tickets. I think that is a sound principle of law. Noting that the lawyers in this place have relaxed their faces, it seems that I have got a legal point right for once in my life. I understand that, as with other things, to a certain extent there is a <inline font-style="italic">caveat emptor</inline> or &#39;let the buyer beware &#39; situation in respect of the airlines. However, I am not fully aware whether there is any protection. I do not know whether there are any regulations which prevent airlines from over-booking beyond a certain percentage of the seats. Nor do I know what the rights of passengers are if, having validly booked and validly turned up at the airport within the required margin of time, they are refused a seat, on the ground that the aircraft is overloaded. It is an important point. I will take it up, have it examined and let the honourable senator have an answer. </para>

            <para>-I ask a question of the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. The Minister will recall that on 9 November I raised with him the matter of Australian Broadcasting Commission radio news services in Queensland following the introduction of daylight saving in other eastern States. In his reply the Minister stated that he would draw the attention of his colleague in the House of Representatives to my comments about evening radio news services now being at times inappropriate for Queensland people. Further, the Minister said that he would ask his colleague to give my comments his consideration. Subsequent to my question. I was given a copy of a letter sent from the ABC to the Secretary of the Graziers Association of Central and Northern Queensland. The letter indicated that the ABC could not accommodate the people of Queensland because of a lack of funds. I therefore ask: Has the Minister&#39;s colleague given any indication of what decision he reached following consideration of my comments? Will the Minister again raise the matter with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and ask him to ensure that the ABC does receive sufficient funds so that the people of Queensland are not discriminated against? </para>

            <para>-I would be interested to have, if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> would give it to me, a copy of the letter to the Graziers Association. With my knowledge of economics, now perhaps meagre, I am reminded of marginal utility. The marginal utility of the cutback of $9m to the Australian Broadcasting Commission is reflected in the situation that apparently every kind of failure to perform is drawn to it and not to the $120m that basically remains in the Commission&#39;s budget. I do not say that with any cynicism. It is important that we should examine whether every mote in the eye- every suggested threat to some 7 orchestras or the news services or <inline font-style="italic">State of the Nation</inline> or any other program- can be attributed to what is I think a 6 per cent cut. If this is so, what happens with the rest of the budget may puzzle some of us. Nevertheless, having said that, I stress that I accept that the honourable senator&#39;s question is an important one for the people of Queensland in that it relates to the need for them to have proper news services. I did refer the matter to my collleague, the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I have no firsthand response to it. I will take up the <inline font-style="italic">matter</inline> if the honourable senator will let me have a copy of the letter to which he referred. </para>

I will ascertain whether he has. He has certainly made no representations to me as the Minister responsible for the security of foreign diplomats within this country. I think I said to the honourable senator yesterday that steps were being taken to put an end to this harassment. I think it may well be in the interests of the success of the prevention of the harassment that the steps being taken are not disclosed as that may be of assistance to those who are doing the harassing. As to the threat of withdrawal, I hope it will not come about. It is very important for Australian-Indian relations that we maintain the closest contact. I will ascertain from my colleague whether there is any substance to the report which the honourable senator received. </para>

            <para>- My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs follows a question which I raised in the Senate the other day concerning the very fine report of the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence, <inline font-style="italic">Australia and the Refugee Problem.</inline> The Committee investigated the problems of Vietnamese and other refugees. Is the Minister aware that yesterday the Thailand Government announced that it would stop accepting refugees from Indo-China by the end of this year, that is, by 3 1 December 1 976? Is the Minister aware that the number of refugees from Vietnam is still running extremely high, even though it is 18 months since the cessation of hostilities in that country? Is the Minister aware that as a result of the Senate inquiry and the understanding gained, the Australian public is conscious of the need to assist with this problem? Will the Minister obtain from her colleague in the other place a commitment that Australia will take a substantial number of refugees? Can this commitment be made prior to Christmas in the spirit of generosity and responsibility? </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the statement by the Thai Government that it will stop accepting refugees by the end of this year. But I believe the Senate is aware of many statements which have been made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs in past months about our assistance and our willingness to assist those refugees whom we are able to help in Australia. I shall refer to the Minister the special matters which have been raised in the question in order to obtain a response from him. But I cannot give the assurance that a statement will be made by the Government before Christmas on this matter. I will have the matter examined by the Minister. </para>

            <para>-I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Martin</inline> poses 4 questions relating to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development study. I point out as a general background that the OECD undertook to make a study of a particular aspect of education in Australia this year. It invited my department through the Australian Government to nominate a particular subject. We nominated the subject, &#39;Transition from school to work&#39;, because in our view it is highly significant for Australia. Equally in the view of the OECD it is a world-wide problem. It undertook that study. Four members from the OECD made a detailed tour of Australia. I was privileged to have some discussions with them in general terms. May I say in passing that, as to the general standard of Australian education, whilst they saw detailed deficiencies in other categories they expressed a view that measured against standards elsewhere we were performing reasonably well. The origin of the study is that we nominated the subject. The second question concerned the release of the report. My recollection is that as at 9 December, which was yesterday, in Paris the OECD was undertaking an examination of its investigations. It has circulated a series of questions which it has identified in terms of those investigations. If the honourable senator is interested we can make available to her details of those questions. The OECD operates by posing questions rather than providing answers. Australia was invited to be present. I was unable, due to other commitments, to be present and I asked that my departmental head, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ken</inline> Jones, should go. He is there as is a senior officer from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Street&#39;s</inline> Department of Employment and Industrial Relations. They are taking part in the discussions. We are in continuous contact. There will, of course, be documentation arising out of the discussions. I think this will be important as will the study of the working party of the Australian Education Council on the subject Secondary education to work&#39;. Along with the documentation of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Fitzgerald</inline> they are starting to produce a mosaic of the whole field of education which poses a series of questions at which we will need to look. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. The Minister may be aware that at the present time schools are charged $3 a month or part thereof by the Post Office to store school mail during summer vacations. It is claimed by the Post Office that schools are being treated as business firms, but business firms are charged only $1.50 for a similar service. As schools never have sufficient money for their needs and this is an additional burden and must represent a small amount of revenue to the authority, will the Minister use his influence and suggest that the charge be withdrawn? </para>

            <para>- I am aware of the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> that there should be an additional payment of one week&#39;s pension prior to Christmas for age pensioners. I can respond only by saying that this is a difficult matter to consider in the present economic climate. I wonder whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> were aware of the fact that if this additional payment were to be made it would amount to something like $47.5m. The payout to the age pensioners in cheque payments yesterday was approximately $95m. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> might also consider that if we were to give an additional week&#39;s pension to age pensioners, the invalid pensioners, the widows pension beneficiaries, the supporting mothers beneficiaries, the unemployment beneficiaries and others might also feel that Christmas should arrive for them. If that were to be considered by the Government we would be talking about a total amount of $81m. There are probably people who would see that as being desirable, and I do not argue with that point of view. I stress that it is a burden of cost which, in the present economic context, could not be considered. I can only respond to the suggestion of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Souter</inline> in that way. </para>

I would like to do that if I may. Let me go one stage further and say that people are now making conjectural remarks about future rates of devaluation, the revaluation position and what the rate of inflation may be. Those speculations do not really help anybody. I think we all know now that the exchange regime is not what is was before. I think we all understand that. What I suggested yesterday, and it will be disposed of this morning, is that it would serve us well if we put these matters to the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce for continuous study. That is my recommendation to the Senate. It would help to answer more carefully and objectively a lot of the questions which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Primmer</inline> raised and I think it would be very valuable to us all. </para>

            <para>- I have not seen a copy of the Country Roads Board annual report which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> says was tabled in the Victorian Parliament yesterday. I would be grateful if he would refer me to the source of his information and I would be very happy to study the media report of it. Because I have not seen it, it is very hard for me to comment on it. I am aware that my colleague in another place, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon,</inline> is very keen that the moneys made available to the States for roads, which are a substantial amount- the honourable senator will recall that a further $3 5 m was made available recentlyshould be used to the best possible purpose in terms of priorities. It is a matter of assessing priorities, a matter on which I am not expert. I will seek out the media source and I will seek out the report itself. I will certainly discuss with the Minister for Transport the factors which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has outlined. </para>

In view of reports that the United States Agriculture Department has proposed that foreign beef entering the United States from a duty free foreign trade zone next year be counted against the originating country&#39;s quota for the year, can the Minister say whether Australia is one of the 12 countries which have agreed to restrain their beef shipments to the United States next year? If Australia has entered into that agreement, what action does the Government intend taking to find alternative markets so as to prevent any escalation of the present economic crisis being experienced by the Australian beef producers? </para>

The Australian Meat Board and other people in the commercial world, including the Australian Meat Exporters Federation, are always searching the world for increased opportunities to sell Australian beef. Many beef producers believe that they do not carry out that task energetically enough. I cannot give the honourable senator any further detail about the negotiations taking place in Washington. The officials are there and the negotiations are proceeding. Since the Parliament will not be sitting much longer, I think it might be useful if, when the discussions are concluded, I ask the Department to write to me so that I can give the honourable senator an uptodate assessment of the position at the point of time when we as Australians know the situation. </para>

              <para>-The profit may be up 6.4 per cent, but it is still only a marginal profit when it is related to turnover. The report showed also that there has been a strong passenger resistance to the increase in air fares that we have experienced over the last few years, particularly during the reign of the Labor Government. Has the Government considered setting up an inquiry into the whole airline industry so that the level of costs levied upon airlines by government charges can be viewed in the context of the benefit that the airline industry is for the whole country? I ask that question because any fall in the number of airline passengers obviously affects the tourist industry and, of course, that industry is most important to my State of Tasmania. </para>

            <para>- I have seen the report of the Australian National Airlines Commission. Indeed, I recall that I tabled it in this place yesterday. I have noted that airlines in Australia generally have suffered a decline in patronage, and that decline has paralleled the acceleration over recent years of the rate of inflation in Australia. The profitability and trading of the airlines have been directly related to the failure of the previous Labor Government to maintain a stable cost structure in this country. The real root of the problem is inflation. The real root of the problem is the need to bring about cost stability so that passenger usage will once again be increased. I appreciate fully the reason why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley,</inline> who comes from an island State which has been beleaguered by the difficulties caused by the high costs of sea transport and which therefore is dependent on efficient air transport- if I may say so, it is first class air transport to the State of Tasmania- should raise this matter with me. As a second part of his question he asked whether any consideration had been given to an inquiry into the cost structure of airlines as imposed by governmental authorities. I am not aware of that having been done in any <inline font-style="italic">in globo</inline> fashion. Of course, 3 levels of government would be involved. I shall raise the matter with my colleague, the Minister for Transport. </para>

Is the Minister further aware that this is the first year for several years in which there has been a decline in the growth of the airline system in this country? </para>

            <para>- Earlier in the week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> asked me a question to which I undertook to obtain a reply. He asked me about inquiries being conducted by the Commonwealth Arbitration Inspectorate into matters involving the observance of awards binding upon James Richardson Pty Ltd and other concessionaires operating at Kingsford-Smith International Airport. I am now able to say that that company, which conducts the duty-free shop at Kingsford-Smith Airport, is bound by the provisions of the Duty-Free International Airport Stores Award of 1974. Investigation of the company&#39;s award observance at the KingsfordSmith Airport was initiated by the Sydney inspectorate following the lodgment in November 1975 of a complaint by an employee working at the airport. The complainant contended that the company&#39;s employees were working under the day work provisions of the award whereas they should have been employed under the shift work provisions of the same award. Calculations have had to be made by the inspectorate in relation to the possibility of underpayents having been made in respect of each of these 2 awards, and it is proving to be a very complicated task. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The company itself has had an investigation made by an independent accountant. As a result of that investigation the company claims that in fact it has overpaid its employees by an amount of $6,782.71. However, the accountant&#39;s calculations, which were based on the shift work provisions of the award, may not have taken into account certain of those provisions. It has first to be established which of the provisions of the award should be applied to individual employees and then a large number of wage records made available by the company must be examined. All this is proving to be a very extensive and complicated investigation. I think that in fairness to the company, in view of statements that have been made, it should be emphasised that the company is claiming that there has been an overpayment, whereas there have been allegations of very large underpayments. I think it is only fair to say that, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> no doubt is justified in raising the matter, the company has been concerned that the allegations made may have reflected upon it. </para>
          <para>The fact remains that the investigation is still continuing and, in view of the complexity of the whole arrangement, I cannot clear up the matter any further. There is only one other matter to which I should refer, that is, that it was alleged that an accountant had been sacked because he had drawn attention to these matters. The company has informed me that it had an unqualified accountant employed and his services were terminated on 1 1 November 1976, but that this termination had nothing to do with this matter. This would seem to be confirmed by the fact that the complaint was made in November 1975. I think the complaint must have been made by somebody else. </para>

          </para>
          <para class="block">Throughout this year, the Government has had one clear goal in front of it. That goal is a sustainable economic recovery- a recovery which will lead Australia towards sustained economic growth, and increasing employment opportunities. A prerequisite for achieving that goal is the control of inflation. The dominant goal of our whole economic strategy has been- and remains- directed to the control of inflation. In this statement, I want to set the measures of the last two weeks in the context of that strategy. A realistic assessment of the impact of those measures must take into account the effects of policies already implemented during the last year. These policies have already achieved a slowdown in the rate of inflation and in the growth of wages and salaries. The increases in each of the last three quarters in the Consumer Price Index were lower than any increase for two years, leaving aside the effects of Medibank. In the September quarter, the increase was 2.2 per cent the lowest since the March quarter 1973. </para>
          <para>Components of the index show very encouraging trends. Other price indicators have also been encouraging. For example, the price index for materials used in house building rose by 0.5 per cent, in October, the lowest increase since November 1972. Similarly, the price index of materials used in building other than housing increased by 0.4 per cent in October- again the lowest increase since November 1972. Figures published recently show that Australia&#39;s rate of inflation is now broadly in line with the average of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. In fact, the Consumer Price Index, expressed as a compound monthly rate of 0.7 per cent, is actually marginally better than the 0.8 per cent for the OECD countries as a whole during September. While other indicators are mixed, there are encouraging signs. Among these the index of industrial production has firmed since July and in October was 9 per cent above its low point in June 1975. Recent figures show that investment spending on new buildings and structures in manufacturing industry is expected to increase by some 3 1 per cent in the half year to December. Some of the distortions inflicted on the economy during 1974-75 are beginning to be corrected. For example, business profitability has grown; the savings ratio has declined and the shake-out in stocks appears to have run its course. </para>
          <para>Despite this progress, we could not put off facing the problem by our loss of Reserves. On coming to office, the government faced an exchange rate which was already susceptible to speculation and uncertainty. In the weeks immediately following the election in December 1975, several hundred million dollars of private capital flowed out of the country- mainly due to a widespread belief that the Australian exchange rate was overvalued. In the three months to the end of November 1976, the decline escalated- our reserves fell by over $700m, if official borrowings by the government in this period are left to one side. The decline in reserves continued despite the additional monetary measures of 7 November. The continued outflow of reserves stemmed from the fact that most observers in Australia and overseas believed that our currency was overvalued. </para>
          <para>The week before last, the Government&#39;s official advisers jointly presented two options to the government: Overseas borrowing of around $ 1,000m or immediate devaluation. The Government looked at these options with a number of facts in mind. One central fact was the uncompetitive position of Australia&#39;s export and import-competing industries. In the last six years wages in Australia&#39;s manufacturing industry increased by 130 per cent compared with 53 per cent in the United States, and 70 per cent in West Germany. The Industries Assistance Commission estimated that the general competitiveness of the Australian import competing sector fell some 17 per cent between 1970-71 and 1975-76. </para>
          <para>One drastic consequence of this and related factors is that employment in Australian manufacturing industry fell by almost 100,000 between May 1974 and the end of June 1976. There has been a growing tendency for some sections of manufacturing industry to move offshore to minimise cost disadvantages. This export of jobs had to cease. These facts were of deep concern to the Government. They could not be ignored. Further, uncertainty about the exchange rate was causing new projects involving overseas investment to be deferred. There was continuing and growing belief overseas about the inevitability of an Australian exchange rate adjustment. Increasingly, the overwhelming view in international circles was that the Australian exchange rate was overvalued, and that sooner or later an adjustment would have to be made. </para>
          <para>Throughout this year the Government has done everything possible to protect the exchange rate, as part of the fight against inflation. Ultimately the point was reached where the rate was no longer sustainable. By the time this decision was unavoidable we had been able to bring each of the other major arms of policy to focus in the fight against inflation. Policies in these areas must now be tightened further. In all these circumstances the first option of borrowing around $ 1,000m, including funds from the IMF presented substantial risks. A borrowing of this magnitude would not have ended speculation against the downward movement of the dollar because people were looking as much at the underlying cost position as at the balance of payments position. To take just one example, as the chief international economist of Morgan Guaranty has said: &#39;You simply lost competitiveness because of the amount of inflation. This situation has been widely recognised over the last year. &#39; </para>
          <para>Since Australia only began in the battle against inflation in December last year, further borrowings in the situation which had arisen would not have provided the change in attitudes the Government was determined to achieve. Were that the case the strengthening economic recovery would have been threatened and the eventual devaluation or further borrowing could well have been greater. In these circumstances it would have been nonsense for Australia to have gone to the IMF. The Government was not prepared to put Australia in that position. </para>
          <para>Once we had made the inevitable decision to devalue there were a number of options open to us on the extent of devaluation and on the form of the new exchange rate system. We could have moved to a new fixed rate which would, at some future time, perhaps require a further significant alteration in the exchange rate- a move which, as the devaluation demonstrated, is attended by major public concern. We could have a market determined float which would make fluctuations possible on a daily basis, or we could have an administered and controlled management of the exchange rate. A further question requiring very careful consideration was the magnitude of the initial change in the rate which would be made. </para>
          <para>The choice before us was to make a move which would decisively end further speculation against the downward movement of the dollar, or a move which would leave the way open for speculation about a further devaluation perhaps in the not too distant future. The government took the view that it was essential to end definitively further speculation against the dollar, and to establish a regime which would in future permit the exchange rate to adjust smoothly to changing circumstances. The decision to devalue by 1 7Vi per cent was made after full consultation with the government&#39;s advisers and on the basis of a technical evaluation of the magnitude required to achieve that result. The magnitude of the devaluation indicates the seriousness of the cost disadvantages which had been weighing with increasing heaviness on Australian manufacturing industry. It should awaken all Australians to the serious weakness in our economic situation which will require a concerted national effort to overcome. It is important that there should be a much wider understanding than now exists, of the implications of adopting a managed regime. </para>
          <para>In taking this decision, the Government has brought Australia more into line with the system adopted by other major trading countries. It needs to be understood that most major countries have tended to adopt exchange arrangements that permit more flexibility in rates in response to changes in economic circumstances. The experience of a number of countries (including the United States, Germany, Japan and Canada) has clearly demonstrated the important role that a managed exchange rate can play in the pursuit of domestic policy objectives. And in this context, it is interesting to note the comments of the IMF in its 1976 Annual Report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Faced with substantial uncertainty concerning future balance of payments developments and exchange rate patterns, and aware of the persistence of marked differences among national economies, in particular with respect to rates of inflation, interest rates and levels of economic activity, as well as of structural changes, the major industrial countries have continued to permit their currencies to float. Indeed, as underlying economic conditions have continued to differ among countries whose currencies are floating, frequent exchange rate variations have been a major form of balance of payment adjustments. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Some people have expressed surprise that under the new system of a managed exchange rate the first change in the rate should have occurred so soon. I regret to say that this indicates a lack of understanding of the nature of an administered exchange rate. Suppose that we had adopted a fully floating exchange rate, under which it is not unusual for rates to fluctuate daily. If under such a float the rate had moved upwards on the first day would anyone have suggested that it should not have done so? Of course not. Under the regime we have adopted not infrequent changes are likely to occur in the ordinary course of events. That is deliberate. The regime is designed to avoid the large jumps that have occurred in the past. That is, indeed, the purpose of adopting a managed exchange rate. </para>
          <para>The initial decision was taken in the context of the adoption of such a system. Critics of the two per cent revaluation are tied to the past. They have not understood the nature of the change which has been made. For example, some critics have asked why all the criteria used by the bank in making decisions about the rate should not be made public. Such a course would only advance the cause of the speculator. There is no responsible bank in the world which would give the precise grounds on which decisions about changes in the rate would be made or for those on floating rates, about daily interventions in the market. As understanding of the new system grows it will be fully accepted. Devaluation inevitably means that a number of other difficult decisions had to be taken. It is a decision with some inflationary consequences which can only be countered by a tightening of policy in other areas. Devaluation makes it more necessary than ever that the anti-inflation strategy we have pursued throughout this year be persisted with. In the light of the seriousness of the situation made clear by the devaluation, that strategy will be pursued with renewed intensity. The government has already announced a number of measures designed to counteract the inflationary impact of devaluation. </para>
          <para>On the fiscal side, a review of expenditures aimed at identifying scope for further savings through the deferment of expenditures has been put in hand, through the new Department of Finance. The Government is determined to hold government spending firmly in check. This is essential to reduce the pressure on monetary policy. Let me emphasise that responsible further relief in income tax is dependent on success in this area. Further to this, in the preparation of forward estimates of expenditure for next yearnow under way- Ministers have been asked to identify any increases in existing programs so that these can be looked at separately in the same way as entirely new proposals. Keeping a very tight grip on government spending continues one major Une of the anti-inflation strategy we have been pursuing with success. It is an unpleasant reality that if we want to beat inflation and restore employment opportunities the pressure on national resources from high government spending and high deficits must be reduced. There are widespread calls for further tax cuts, and the government in principle accepts this. But if these tax cuts are to be made responsibly, they must be matched by further restraint in government spending. This year we have shown that we are prepared to take the tough decisions required in this area. We intend to demonstrate that determination again in the coming months. </para>
          <para>On the monetary side, action has already been announced to help ensure that monetary conditions do not become accommodating to increased inflation, but at the same time providing adequate funds to underwrite economic recovery. Yields on Treasury notes were raised by 0.5 per cent on 29 November. Subscriptions to the notes have been encouraging- non official holdings are presently $ 1,400m. About half of which is held by the non-bank public. Subsequent action by the authorities has brought about an adjustment of similar magnitude in yields on short-dated bonds, with consequential adjustment- on a diminishing basis- of yields on other securities. The long term bond rate has been increased by 0.3 per cent to 10.5 per cent. The yield on savings bonds has been increased to 10 per cent. Bank lending will be monitored so as to prevent any increase in inflationary pressures. Normal financing requirements of business will be met. </para>
          <para>I should not need to emphasise that wages policy has assumed an even greater importance in the post-devaluation context. To allow the rate of increase in wage settlements to escalate as a result of devaluation would be to negate the beneficial effects which otherwise flow from devaluation for the competitive position of Australian industry and for employment. The Government will therefore be doing everything within its power to ensure that any identifiable effects of devaluation on the CPI do not flow through into wages and salaries. A number of major measures adopted during this year have been designed to protect potentially disadvantaged groups from the costs of inflation. These measures include: the automatic adjustment of pensions for inflation; the family allowance scheme; and full personal income tax indexation. These measures which are of continuing benefit should provide an important support to wage and salary restraint. There should be a recognition that the important fact to the wage and salary earner should not be gross income, but final real disposable income. The wages area is one where- as both the Treasurer and I have emphasised throughout the year, the Government cannot achieve success on its own. In this area particularly, it will take a commitment by all sections of the community to take up the fight against inflation and to restore employment opportunities. </para>
          <para>It is somewhat ironic to recall that we were attacked earlier in the year for arguing as strongly as we did in our first submission to the Arbitration Commission. Even then, there were those who predicted that if the Government based its policies on economic commonsense, the result would be confrontation with the unions. Unfortunately, too much credence has been given to the threats of extremist union leaders to create further conflict. In this area there has been a capitulation to threats instead of recognising economic common sense. Not enough weight has been given to the great common sense of the vast majority of rank and file trade union members who know full well the importance of restraint at this time. I believe most are fed up as Australians with the disruptive tactics of a few. </para>
          <para>This Government will not allow an unreasonable burden in the fight against inflation to fall on any section of the community including wage and salary earners. The Government has deliberately taken a number of major measures designed to encourage wage and salary restraint and to protect potentially disadvantaged groups from the costs of inflation. These measures include: the automatic adjustment of pensions for inflation, the family allowance scheme, and full personal income tax indexation. These measures, which are of continuing benefit should provide an important support to wage and salary restraint. As well the Government&#39;s submissions before the Arbitration Commission are designed to protect lower income earners. The should be a recognition that the important fact to the wage and salary earner should not be gross income, but final real disposable income. These measures provide a totally reasonable basis for wage and salary restraint. </para>
          <para>It is in this total context that the Government intends to argue more strongly before the Commission for recognition of the absolute importance of wage and salary restraint. Beyond that we will be taking every step within our power to secure restraint. The Treasurer will, for example, be discussing the impact of wage levels on the State loan programs with the Premiers at the Loan Council next week. Quite clearly, with wage restraint, the States can achieve more effective loan programs. This again is part of action to tighten the main lines of the strategy we have followed throughout this year. In addition to action on the budgetary, monetary and wages front, action has also been taken on the prices front. </para>
          <para>The Prices Justification Tribunal has been asked to pay special attention to price increases consequent on devaluation. This will not be limited to companies technically covered by the Act. The purpose is to ensure that devaluation is not used as an excuse for unjustified price increases. The Government&#39;s legislation regarding the PJT will in fact increase its surveillance capacity and its ability to investigate areas where there is evidence of price abuse. The PJT will report progressively to the Minister, and at the end of three months, the Government will review its requests. </para>
          <para>In the external area, as a result of the devaluation of the Australian dollar, the Government has examined the Australian tariff. We have not made across the board cuts in tariffs but have acted selectively to reduce inflationary effects arising from the devaluation without negating the improved competitive position that devaluations has brought to Australian industry. This improvement is greatly needed by Australian industry if jobs are to be created and industries are to be discouraged from going off-shore. Our decisions on tariffs have been the right decisions taken at the appropriate time. </para>
          <para>An across-the-board tariff cut would have been foolish. Selectivity was necessary and it was therefore imperative to take advice. In this case, advice could not be sought until after the devaluation was announced. To have done otherwise would have been imprudent- to say the least- it would have extended the circle of people who knew about the devaluation beyond responsible bounds. Accordingly, the decisions on tariffs had to be taken after the devaluation. We were fortunate to have before us, IAC recommendations and we acted on those recommendations. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s decisions affect over 900 of the 2750 items covered by tariffs, the value of the trade in these items being around $2,000m. The reason for the selectivity of the tariff reductions, for our refusal to engage in across the board cuts, is clear. Manufacturing industry has in recent years had its competitive position eroded by rising wage costs, a dollar which was until recently overvalued and the shocks imposed by the Labor Government&#39;s 25 per cent acrosstheboard tariff cut. What needs to be understood is that the. competitive position of Australian industry had to be restored. Devaluation will achieve that. At the same time, we have sought to reduce the inflationary impact of the decision. </para>
          <para>Thus following devaluation, the Government has acted with respect to each of the major arms of policy. On monetary policy: Adjustments to interest rates on Treasury notes, Australian Savings Bonds, and other Government securities. On tariffs: A review of temporary assistance arrangements followed by measures announced to offset the inflationary impact in certain areas. On budgetary policy: A further review of government expenditure aimed at holding real expenditure levels. We will also maintain pressure on the wages front and we have acted to establish conditions in which restraint is possible. We intend to persist with our anti-inflationary strategy in full measure. </para>
          <para>In the circumstances that Australia faces, it is disappointing to note that some people who should, by now, know better, continue to promote policies which only add to inflation. The vast majority of people realise that it is no longer possible to spend our way out of inflation and unemployment. One consistent feature of all the alternatives offered by Labor Party leaders has been the willingness- some might say eagerness- to vastly increase public spending once more, or to pump up the size of the Federal Budget deficit. The Leader of the Opposition some weeks ago urged the Government to adopt measures which would increase the budget deficit by some $ 1 billion. The Premier of Tasmania followed up with an extravagant 24-point plan. The Premier of New South Wales outshone both of them with proposals for almost $2 billion more in federal spending. Others have urged, and continue to urge, tax cuts and inflationary spending. </para>
          <para>It would seem that these proposals are made in total disregard for their consequences. Each of these proposals, without exception, would be highly inflationary. The overriding need of this country is to conquer inflation. What the Labor Party is proposing would create yet more inflation. Surely they understand that by now. Throughout its period in office the Labor Party failed to develop a credible anti-inflationary policy. All its essays in economic policy this year have been designed to give a further spur to inflation. </para>
          <para>Let me explain in plain terms the effects of increasing the Government&#39;s deficit in the present context. Every new expenditure means a higher deficit and this must be paid for in some way. Let me explain in plain terms how this can happen. It can be done by the Reserve Bank printing money which adds further to inflationary pressures. Secondly, it can be paid for through higher interest rates, which can lead to a credit squeeze on business, and a loss of job opportunities. Thirdly, it can be met by increased taxes, and no one is proposing that. All these alternatives are inflationary. The clear consequences of further increases in spending are unacceptable. </para>
          <para>When people propose policies of this kind, they must be prepared to follow through the full consequences of these policies. Unfortunately, this is too often not done. The Government rejects these as desirable or viable alternatives. Higher government spending, larger deficits would do nothing whatever to correct the imbalances in the economy. Such an approach would: Further damage the private sector; increase further government demands on the nation&#39;s resources; it would increase unemployment. Those who propose to solve our problems through yet higher government expenditures are in fact- whether they know it or not- perpetrating a cruel deception. </para>
          <para>Contrast the effects of devaluation. It does not add significantly to the deficit. It will reduce the burdens on those sectors which have been hardest hit by inflation and which have not been protected by some form of indexed returns, which have not had guaranteed selling prices for their products. It will create conditions where more jobs can be created. It will reduce the reason for Australian companies to move offshore. Overseas and domestic investment projects will start moving again. </para>
          <para>The real possibilities of increased production for domestic industries constitute a substantial benefit from devaluation. Many manufacturing firms are able to expand their currently under.tilised capacity. At present their fixed costs- such as plant and equipment depreciation, capital costs, rent and salaries- represent a high proportion of total costs. In this situation, increases in demand and production can produce quite significant reductions in unit costs. It is worth recalling the words of the 1975 Jackson Committee report: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Australian manufacturing industry is in acute financial crisis. Unemployment is high. Factories are running below capacity . . . Their profit record and prospects make it hard to raise equity. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Jackson report also mentioned the damage caused to manufacturing industry by recent adjustments in the exchange rate and the levels of protection. Our company tax measures have made a contribution to alleviating this situation, but beyond this, devaluation presents an opportunity for much needed relief in the problem areas identified by the Jackson Report. The alternatives to devaluation would have been massive subsidies or even higher tariffs. Those who criticise the decision to devalue, fail to appreciate the continued thrust for more and more tariff protection which carries its own inflationary impact. </para>
          <para>In the last two weeks, there has been a remarkable unwillingness on the part of some commentators to assess the decisions objectively in their full ramifications. One well known economic commentator writing on the devaluation of the Australian dollar has made the following points. He stated firstly that:   . . most spectators would have felt the devaluation would have been timed for some time next year. The Government, by getting in early before speculative pressures built up, has avoided a  haemoraging  of Australia&#39;s international reserves through capital outflow . . . The extent of the devaluation will be sufficient to convince potential foreign investors in Australia that there is unlikely to be any further devaluations . . . will give a breathing space to some Australian industries now suffering from severe import competition . . . The economy is running below full capacity, so the extra stimulus to domestic demand and employment will hopefully take up some of the spare capacity . . . The devaluation will give a fillip to business confidence. </para>
          <para class="block">There could be no better description of the positive aspects of the 1976 devaluation. But these comments were made about the 1974 devaluation which was undertaken in an inflationary context and followed by a number of inflationary measures. The same commentator condemned the 1976 decision neglecting his own earlier arguments- not to mention the complete different policy context within which the 1976 decision has been taken. </para>
          <para>Many of the statements being made in recent days about the devaluation are quite out of touch with reality. Wild assertions about interest rates, the availability of credit and exchange rate confusion are not based on a considered assessment of what has actually been occurring. The information available suggests the transformation to the new interest rate yield curve has been successful. The greater indications of support for the Government Treasury notes is encouraging. A cautious observation of the stock market indicates strengthening since devaluation. The Government welcomes renewed interest from overseas in portfolio investment. The changes made in the exchange rate have halted speculation against the dollar and the haemoraging of our reserves. The massive inflow of capital that some people have predicted has not occurred. </para>
          <para>Much of the criticism failed to understand the changed nature of the regime. This week&#39;s adjustment reflects no more than the success of the initial move. Commodity markets have also shown continuing strength. The hysteria and humbug which certain people have tried to create in relation to the last two weeks is not supportable by the evidence to hand. The Government condemns it. The Government believes that the movements will be seen as responsible and appropriate. What a contrast has been provided by some more measured reactions overseas. In accordance with normal practice the executive board of the International Monetary Fund has considered Australia&#39;s decision to devalue. The board appreciated the factors behind the decision. All directors who spoke supported Australia&#39;s decision to devalue. In addition, the greater flexibility that would be permitted under the new exchange arrangements was welcomed. There was no suggestion that the devaluation could be regarded as a competitive devaluation. </para>
          <para>Most international reaction to our measures has recognised the soundness of the decisions which have already been taken. The New York Morgan Guaranty&#39;s Chief International Economist described the 17.5 per cent devaluation as a very correct amount and noted the wide recognition of Australia&#39;s international uncompetitiveness. Milton Friedman has observed, postdevaluation: </para>

            <para>Australia is very well regarded internationally because now- and this is comparatively rare amongst Western nations at the moment- it appears to be pursuing a mature and steady course. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Our Ambassador to the United States has reported that our emphasis on the anti-inflationary objectives accompanying the devaluation is being applauded, and that the devaluation has been seen as removing a significant disincentive to investment in Australia. </para>
          <para>In balancing the arms of ecomonic policy, the government considered inflation as the number one priority but we have never contended that it was the only priority. Nor has it ever been argued to my knowledge that it ought to be the only priority. In a number of decisions, such as the introduction of family allowances, full personal tax indexation, the investment allowance, and the allocation of moneys to Aboriginal and welfare programs, the Government has moved to help the sectors of the community hit hardest by inflation, and to encourage activity. If inflation had been the only priority then there would have been no family allowances, no indexation, and no increases in money for social programs. There would have been no Budget deficit and much more extensive cut backs in government programs. If inflation were our sole objective we should have had a balanced budget. I do not recall the Government being urged to bring down a balanced budget. The reason is obvious. The hardship in the other areas would have been too great. </para>
          <para>The fight against inflation, although our dominant objective, cannot be conducted with an utter disregard for its effects on other areas of social policy. The fact that devaluation has taken place does not mean that combating inflation has lost its place as our first priority. The fact that the Government has been forced to take a decision which has some inflationary consequences can no more be adduced as evidence that the antiinflationary strategy has been abandoned, that the fact that the Government did not plan for a balanced budget. The reverse is the truth. The devaluation decision requires that we redouble our efforts to get on top of inflation- that there be no let up- that we press ahead with our announced strategy more strongly than ever before. </para>
          <para>Let me review the year&#39;s major economic decisions. In February, $360m worth of savings resulting from an expenditure review were announced. In January, decisions were taken to soak up excess liquidity in the financial system. In May, a package of fiscal policy decisions was introduced- tax indexation, $2, 600m savings to forward estimates, family allowances. In the Budget, spending was held and the deficit contained, monetary guidelines were laid down and strategy for recovery was firmly implemented. </para>
          <para>Let me state the main elements of our strategy again. The most rigorous restraint on Government spending to rein in the bloated public sector and free resources to productive private enterprise, the provision of a wide range of incentives to industry to resume expansion and provide employment opportunities. We are seizing every opportunity to emphasise the importance of restraint in wage and salary demands; establishing, through a variety of measures a climate which will make wage and salary restraint possible. This is essential to keep costs down and create conditions in which employment opportunities can be expanded as rapidly as possible. We always said that this strategy would take time- that it would be a full three year program. It is the only strategy which is going to work. </para>
          <para>Let me state the Government&#39;s attitude to inflation so there can be no possible misunderstanding. Inflation is the enemy Australia must defeat. It undermines security, destroys the value of savings and incomes, hinders the expansion of job opportunities, erodes our position in the world, and in the end eats away at the vitality of our institutions and our way of life. Twelve months ago, Australia, we all know, was in economic disarray. When we came to office we were faced by the worst unemployment since the 1930s, an actual decline in the gross domestic product, a depression in company profits, a decline in business investment to its lowest level in three years, a desperate situation in the farming sector and an inflation rate that was fourteen per cent- higher than it had been a year before and showing no substantive indications of declining. In the past year, we have focussed the arms of policy on the problem of inflation and have achieved improvement in our position. </para>
          <para>The fact that it was not possible to avoid devaluation shows the magnitude of the problems which still face the Australian economyand every one of us as Australians. Some people appear to believe that devaluation was a soft option. Nothing could be further from the truth- it is the hardest option of all. If we do not take advantage of the opportunities that devaluation offers us, if we do not bring every weapon of policy to bear on inflation then the future will be a grave one- we may not get another opportunity. The present situation facing us all- demands a conceited national effort. All Australians, all sectors of the community, have an overriding national interest in achieving a soundly based economic recovery. We have made a beginning- and we must not squander out national opportunities and our national strengths. </para>
          <para>The Government&#39;s measures have been the right ones- but the Government cannot do it alone. In the battle against inflation, we need the support of all Australians. We need to find a national will and determination to overcome inflation. Too often our institutions seek to sharpen differences in the community- to pursue an adversary relationship with each other for temporary advantage rather than emphasising the common interests we all share. This is a time when all our institutions, all Australiansbusinesses, trade unions, all in positions of leadership in the community- must seek to set aside narrow interests in favour of the overriding common interests we all share. Devaluation should underline for every Australian the seriousness of the problem that confronts us. It also gives us an opportunity that we as a nation cannot afford to lose. The fight against inflation is a fight we are going to win. </para>

          <para>-  I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland in thanking the Minister for accepting the amendments to what we saw as defects or unfair aspects of the Bill. I also notice that in the Foreign Proceedings (Prohibition of Certain Evidence) Amendment Bill this has occurred. This indicates the role that the Senate plays in these matters. It is appreciated when the Government accepts amendments on the basis of good advice. Whether this is because of the attitude of particular Ministers, I do not know.

          <para>After &#39;proves&#39;, insert &#39;, or proves that he had reasonable grounds for believing, &#39;. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">My complaint with regard to clause 9 is that in places such as Port Hedland or the northern gulf a person might not see the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> notice. A person has a defence if he has reasonable grounds for believing that the article was not the one referred to in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette.</inline> If the words &#39;reasonable grounds for believing&#39; include the fact that he had not seen the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> that covers the point completely. </para>
        <para>I also appreciate the amendment to clause 23. I have a long recollection of cases of people being compelled to answer a question that may tend to incriminate them. This matter first arose under the Evidence Ordinance, when the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances recommended disallowance of the Ordinance which, amongst other things, contained things that the Senate at the time thought improper. Therefore, it disallowed the Ordinance. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greenwood</inline> appealed to us to rescind our decision, as the Supreme Court of the Australian Capital Territory would not sit because it did not have an evidence ordinance and it did not know how to take evidence. The result was that, although the Senate would not reconsider its previous decision, the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> moved a motion to make the Ordinance an Act for 6 months- I think, so that it could be considered by the Senate Standing Committee on Constitutional and Legal Affairs. At the end of that 6 months, when the Act expired, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
        <para class="block">Murphy, the then Attorney-General, moved that it become an Act without a specified lifetime. That undesirable Evidence Ordinance is now an Act of this Parliament. From that time onwards most Acts and most ordinances have contained that provision compelling a person to answer a question even though that answer may tend to incriminate him; but they also have contained a provision that the answer cannot be used in a prosecution of that person in a court of law. Now there is a reversion to the position that a person does not need to answer a question if the answer to that question may tend to incriminate him. I appreciate the change of attitude. I suggest that perhaps our legal committee could at some time determine whether it should be essential to answer such questions. </para>

          <para>- The honourable senator raised 2 points. I will answer the last one first. I am advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that an acting judge of the Supreme Court of South Australia in <inline font-style="italic">Loftus</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Taylor,</inline> which is reported at page 289 of the South Australian law reports for 1955, held that fear of self incrimination was a reasonable excuse within the meaning of the legislation under consideration in that case. I am further advised by the Parliamentary Counsel that the question has not come before the High Court and therefore, to put the matter beyond doubt, it is recommended that new sub-clause  (5A)  be inserted. The Parliamentary Counsel advised that, relying on the decision in <inline font-style="italic">Loftus</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Taylor,</inline> which is now 21 years old and which has not been challenged by anybody as being unreasonable- certainly it has not been challenged by any prosecutor- it has become accepted that the normal clauses in Bills which have been dealt with in the past have been subject to that decision. I imagine that the office of Parliamentary Counsel, having now put its toe in the water with new sub-clause  (5A),  will follow that course until there is a more definite ruling on this matter by some court. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I refer now to the amendment moved to clause 9 which was the first matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> He referred to the taking out of the word &#39;and&#39; and inserting the word &#39;or&#39;. I suppose there is quite a difference between custody or control and custody and control. It is rather like the distinction which is often drawn between possession and property. Occasionally one can have both. Occasionally an article could be in the custody of one person but the control of another. The Bill, as originally introduced, provided for both custody and control. The situation could have arisen where a person could have had custody but not control or a person could have control but not custody. They are 2 different concepts in law. </para>

            <para>- I will be very brief in my remarks. The Opposition will not oppose the reference of this matter to the Senate Standing Committee on Trade and Commerce. It will remain to be seen just how much the Committee will be able to do in view of the complexity of the reference, involving, as it does, currency alterations and changes to manufacturing industry protection. Another element is inflation, including prices and manufactured goods. Nevertheless, the Opposition feels that there could be some value certainly to the Parliament and, we would hope, to the nation as a whole from the work and findings of the Committee on this matter. The only point I stress is my hope that it is clearly understood that in no way would any member of the Committee be inhibited from asking questions in this chamber on those matters to which reference is made. I note that the Minister for Industry and Commerce, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton,</inline> nods his head in agreement. I am sure that in the course of consideration of this reference by the Committee there will be many matters which members of that Committee will wish to raise in the Senate, particularly at question time. Provided it is quite clear that there will be no factors inhibiting members of the Committee in that respect, the Opposition will not oppose the reference. </para>

            <para>
              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>for reasons that I was outlining last night when the Senate was debating this legislation, the Opposition opposes these Bills. The Opposition does not find the legislation in its present form particularly offensive. However, we oppose the legislation because of the haste and secrecy with which the inquiry into broadcasting was held. We oppose it also because of the original form of the legislation which was totally obnoxious and because we believe that the community should have the opportunity to investigate thoroughly all of the issues involved in broadcasting before structural changes are implemented. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Opposition to the legislation in its original form was very great. Members of the chamber will be aware of the outcry from the general public and from members of the Press, even the most conservative elements of the Press, who were highly critical of the attempt to destroy the independence of the Australian Broadcasting Commission in the original legislation. Opposition also came from academics and scholars, teachers, parents concerned with standards of children&#39;s broadcasting, ethnic groups which, in the period of the Whitlam Government for the first time had had access to broadcasting, and in particular, members of the staff of the ABC. </para>
          <para>I mention in passing that a strike was held in most States and the Territories by staff members of the ABC. It was a political strike against the Government&#39;s legislation. I think it can be fairly characterised as a political strike. It was a successful strike. It achieved its objectives. I believe that that strike had broad support from the community. It is interesting to note that political strikes can be just strikes; we have had an example of one. </para>
          <para>The attack by the Government on the Australian Broadcasting Commission, of which the legislation before us is just one part, was threefold. The first prong of the attack was the appointment of a partisan <inline font-weight="bold">chairman, Sir Henry</inline> Bland, to the ABC. The second prong was the cutting of funds to the Commission. This has led to a most undesirable and unwelcome cutting of programs. The third prong is this legislation. I wish to make some comments on the appointment of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland and on his subsequent actions. I know that these matters have been discussed by honourable senators on several occasions. However, I think the most recent evidence of the unsuitability of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> as  chairman  of an independent broadcasting commission came to our attention this week. I refer to the remarks that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> made when addressing the Northern Tasmanian Regional Advisory Committee of the ABC on 1 6 November 1 976. </para>

If I may say so, I think that that is most appropriate. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> said a number of quite surprising and distressing things in giving his views on the ABC and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen,</inline> who is aware of what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> said on that occasion, tried to defend the inappropriateness of the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> by saying that he was expressing only a personal opinion and that everyone is entitled to a personal opinion. I do not believe that somebody in what has become such a controversial position since <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> became  Chairman  of the ABC and during a period when we have a government which has conducted an unceasing onslaught on the independence of the ABC, can address a meeting of people connected with the ABC and then have it claimed on his behalf afterwards that he was merely making personal statements. Those of us who go into public life and enter public debate lose the right to make merely personal statements on some issues. I certainly do not believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry&#39;s</inline> remarks on that occasion can be dismissed as being merely private and personal points of view. </para>

          <para>He said a number of disturbing things. I found one of the lines of attack which he took particularly distressing, and that was that all present and past commissioners, and by implication past  chairman,  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, management of the ABC and program makers in the ABC were totally irresponsible and unrealistic when it came to budgeting. I quote a couple of remarks from the transcript. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">A remark like that is nothing short of insulting to present and past commissioners and chairmen.

          <para class="block">They were the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland,  Chairman  of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and the appointee of the Fraser Government, a few days before the same Government  introduced legislation which was designed to do just what <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland said was unthinkable and disastrous. That indicates a total breakdown of communication and confusion by the Government on broadcasting policy. </para>
          <para>Another very distressing view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland on the same occasion was in relation to Radio Australia. He expressed the view that Radio Australia had no right to objectivity, had no claims to independence and should be nothing but a further arm of the Government&#39;s foreign policy.

            <para>How on earth does anybody imagine that Radio Australia could go its own way . . . anybody can simply imagine that the Radio Australia can put out programs in direct contradiction to government policy, foreign policy ... of course Radio Australia can&#39;t put out programs in direct opposition to it. </para>

          <para class="block">So from <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland&#39;s point of view Radio Australia is not a news broadcast to inform people in any kind of balanced or objective way of what is going on in Australia; it is merely a propaganda instrument for the present Government. </para>
          <para>This is not only my interpretation of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland &#39;s comments.

              <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline>now seems to be saying that Radio Australia&#39;s claims to be something more than an uncritical vehicle for Government public relations is, or should be, invalid. We rind his view totally unacceptable. There are no defensible grounds for arguing that the ABC-which runs Radio Australia as its international arm- should be less open and honest with its foreign audience than it is with its domestic listeners. As we pointed out some weeks ago, when commenting on suggestions that the Foreign Affairs Department should lay down formal guidelines for Radio Australia, the world has enough propaganda services already. </para>
            <para>Radio Australia is today serving a much reduced audience as a result of the loss of its Darwin transmitters in Cyclone Tracy. We believe the enormous cost of replacing and updating those transmitters would be well worthwhile- but not if <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland &#39;s views become official ABC policy. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline>Bland;Extracts from Discussion </para>
			<para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Sir HENRY</inline>BLAND; Well,  chairman,  let me say immediately that I&#39;m extremely pleased that arrangements could be made to have this meeting at this time and that it was possible for me to come down. We&#39;ve been in the commission somewhat exercised about advisory committees, whether they were justified, what they are doing, what their role was, what notice was taken of them . . . and I myself said I would go round and discover for myself what is happening . . . what sort of contributions are made . . . what notice is being taken of them. And let me say immediately that one of the problems in an organisation like the ABC is that it becomes highly institutionalised, runs great risk of coming to believe that it knows all the answers and what&#39;s more knows what&#39;s best. This is something for which I have no time, particularly in an organisation with the responsibilities such as the ABC has. The great value, as I see it, in theory at least of advisory committees, is that they provide a means whereby . . . assuming the committees represent a broad sweep of community attitudes . . . provide a means whereby those who are concerned with producing programs and planning facilities can understand more clearly what is local opinion. And so I think we&#39;re thrown back to the first point as to the reason that is exercised in assembling committees and the wisdom that is displayed by individual members of committees in directing themselves, devoting themselves to issues that are of considerable significance and finally as to what happens inside the head office of the ABC and the State regional offices in respect of views and opinions expressed at meetings of the advisory committees. Nobody of course is any better than the people who constitute it and so it becomes enormously important that the advisory committees, like the ABC commission itself should be well-constituted and whatever is the situation about the constitution of the committee, the real value of them is only to be measured by the notice that&#39;s taken of them by the organisation. </para>
			<para>I, myself, as I think I&#39;ve already indicated believe that this advisory committee system is a good system and ought to be preserved and what&#39;s more I think there&#39;s probably a need for looking more closely at just what happens with the proposals and the views and the attitudes when they do get to head office. Nothing will be achieved of course if they&#39;re put into nice files and pigeon holes . . . and this is a matter that I&#39;m interested in ... but I make the severration quite firmly that I believe in advisory committees, indeed I believe in the maximum input from all community sources, so that the ABC can do better its job of service to the community. </para>
			<para>Now, rather than deal specifically in insteriatum with the various points that have been raised, I think perhaps it might stimulate discussion, chairman, if I raise some broader issues. We&#39;ve heard a lot about a lot of things since I&#39;ve been around the place . .  perhaps there were a lot of things said about the ABC before I was around the place, but since I had no particular responsibility I wasn&#39;t particularly interested. We&#39;ve heard about financial constraints -  . . we&#39;ve heard about (tape mutilated), we&#39;ve heard about interference with management, we&#39;ve heard about independence . . . now let me take them in some sort of order. </para>
			<para>It is for the parliament to decide what funds will be made available to the ABC in common with what funds will be made available for all the other purposes to which the parliament directs itself. In this case, this current case we&#39;ve got a certain financial allocation which is what the parliament has decided is available to the ABC. This is set in a total framework of financial restraint as pan of a total policy which is directed to containing inflation . . . it&#39;s an uncomfortable situation, when people have been given candy and lollies for a long time they nave exactly the same withdrawal problems that people who suffer from any other situation. It&#39;s not for the ABC to complain, let alone rally about what the parliament decides what the ABC should have, because the ABC is an instrument of parliament. The ABC put forward some financial proposals which were not adopted in their entirety and in the end result it was given a sum of money fixed and said this is what you&#39;re going to spend. Unfortunately we&#39;ve been brought up in the society over a long period of time when the parliament has done that in the past, the recipients of its distribution have said how nice and then proceeded to go ahead and when they ran out of cash went back to the parliament for extra funds which have been granted . . . and this of course is something that can be done when you can provide funds by printing money, but it&#39;s not the sort of thing that any ordinary householder or ordinary business can live with and we&#39;ve now got the situation where the government has decided that they&#39;re going to apply some fairly stern measures and when funds are made available they convey the impression that they mean that and that this is not just a starting point . . . and of course, what has happened in the past, and this is not only what has happened with the ABC, everybody has run riot and that&#39;s why we&#39;re paying taxes of the order of which we are, and that&#39;s where 1 as a taxpayer have a very direct and personal interest . . . and don&#39;t forget, I come from having done another job ... or a job for the government in which I didn&#39;t like what I saw was happening in departments or instrumentalities and remember also of course that I used to be a practitioner myself in this area. </para>
			<para>Now, we wanted something like $137m all up and we finished up with $129m all up. The first task that fell to me, almost after my appointment was to have to tell the astonished world that the ABC had decided that it had to make some reductions in activities in order to live within the budget . . . and it was perhaps not surprising to me for a free organisation which has been unaccustomed to living with budgets that when we came to review our financial situation a few weeks ago, we found that we were spending ahead of budget. We also found that we were much further ahead of budget because of all sorts of increased costs quite beyond the control of the ABC. Now there&#39;s a certain irony in this, which I won&#39;t trouble you with, but those of you who are engaged in private enterprise know very well that if you run into situations where there are costs external to your control, then you meet them either by shoving up the price if the community is prepared to pay for it, or you cut your cloth according to the total funds that are available. Now, in our situation as of a few weeks ago we found that we had ... we were running ahead of budget in respect of costs entirely within our control by about $2m and in respect of costs entirely beyond our control to the extent of $3m. But the government has said, not to the ABC only, but to all departments who are going through precisely the same traumas that the ABC has because this idea that governments ought to behave like private businesses is extremely strange in government circles, . . . they are equally going through the trauma of trying to conform with decision of government which is that the departments and agencies should live within their budgets and absorb increased costs, whether they &#39;re within or without their control. </para>
			<para>Now, at the last commission meeting, we directed ourselves first to the problem as to how we could do what any ordinary individual and organisation in the community has had to do, and is accustomed to doing, namely cut our cloth so that we could live within the amount that parliament has allocated to us to the extent that we could control this . . . and so we directed ourselves as to how we could save $2m, with the results that have been announced. And that still leaves us with $3m less . . . $3m that we&#39;ve got to do something about. Which means, as I&#39;ve already announced, that if the government is not prepared to make available that $3m, then certain consequences will flow. And of course we&#39;re not through the sums yet . . . if the Arbitration Commission should hand out some more money for national wage cases in the next week or so and do so again in February and do so again in May, we&#39;re in accelerated, compounded trouble. But, you know, don&#39;t let&#39;s get too fussed about this . . . this is what private sector has had to live with for a long time and unless you &#39;re in a situation where you can convince the prices justification tribunal and then find buyers who are prepared to pay even what the PJT says you can charge, you don &#39;t get terribly far . . . and I think it&#39;s rather important that we shouldn&#39;t get carried away by notions that public bodies are immune from these traumas, because that only induces the irresponsibility which some of us know a fair deal about. But as of the moment, what we &#39;ve done is to cut our cloth to the money that parliament said that we could have, that is to say, in respect only of costs that we should have been able to control, but we haven&#39;t controlled effectively in the first five months of the financial year . . . and at the next commission meeting in December, well have in front of us other things that we would have to face up to and then I shall be going off, as I&#39;ve said publicly to talk to the government about the consequences of the government&#39;s not persuading the parliament to provide extra funds. </para>
			<para>Now, all of this of course is tending to get mixed up with other things that are happening. We&#39;ve had a report produced by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Green,</inline> Secretary of the Department of Posts and Telegraphs, or whatever it&#39;s called these days, which is a commendable document, I think he&#39;s to be complimented on producing a document which is readable and sensible in the short space that he had. We have had a statement by the Minister which indicated certain decisions of the government which were not in accord with the Green recommendations, and which was notable for the things that it didn&#39;t say, which is not surprising, because after all, the Minister will be bringing down a Bill before long and he needs to make a second reading speech and there wouldn&#39;t be very much point in exhausting the subject matter of the second reading speech before he made it. So we will know in art the government response to the Green report when the ill comes in and the second reading speech is made. I think it&#39;s quite likely that the bill that comes in will not deal exhaustively with the Green report because I don&#39;t think it was competent for the draughtsmen to prepare a bill covering everything and indeed it may be that the Cabinet has not decided all the issues that were raised by the Green report. So it looks as though there &#39;II be two bites at the cherry. </para>
			<para>Of the Green report, all I want to say is this: that it causes me no concern whatever . . . and I speak now as  Chairman  of the ABC. Indeed, I think if I&#39;d been writing the Green report I might have been doing some other things. But it causes me no concern whatever. The similarity between the recommendations made by the Green report and the submissions made by the ABC- and they weren&#39;t mine, I had no pan in them- they all occurred before I turned up- is very great. The ABC asked for control of transmitters; the ABC thought that the ABC ought to be subject to external review every so often; the ABC thought that it ought to escape the clutches of the Public Service Board; the ABC thought that it ought to be able to get a triennial rolling program; it wanted to have great freedom in respect of acquisitions of property and getting its building works done; just about everything the ABC proposed in its submission has been adopted in the Green report. True, the Green report came up with proposals for restructuring the Commission, which have not been adopted by the Government judging by what the Minister said in his interim statement . . . and 111 come in a moment to Radio Australia. But there is nothing in the Green report or in the statements that have been made on behalf of the government which in any way impinges upon the independence of the ABC in its program making, and that is the critical issue. There has been a great deal of speculation by people who seem supremely capable of dreaming up every sinister implication. It&#39;s beyond my comprehension that any government would wish to sweep away the Commission&#39;s membership as it now stands . . . you know this assumption that governments and politicians- and I bow respectively to our friend on my left- are cunning, sophisticated, shrewd people . . . it&#39;s one of the greatest pieces of journalistic construction that I know of, believed mostly by all of us . . . occasionally they&#39;ve been known to be cunning and shrewd, but not very often. I think they thrive on being thought to be just that. But no government in its right senses would sweep away the membership of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, because they know that to create that sort of precedent would be utterly disastrous. </para>
			<para>Now, I may be proved to be wrong, I don&#39;t know, but it&#39;s my quite firm belief that when the number&#39;s go up you 11 find that what I say is right. There is no threat to the ABC . . . there is just about only one as of the moment issue on which there is unanimity of views among parliamentary parties, and that is the independence of the ABC in its programming. And now that leads me on . . . there&#39;s nothing in the Green report . . . one can&#39;t complain about review of the ABC. The more I see of the ABC and the more I understand the enormous power the ABC has, the more I respond to Lord Acton&#39;s statement that power corrupts and the more I would be anxious, I think if I&#39;d been in the Green position, to want somehow to have some arrangement that ensured that power didn&#39;t corrupt the ABC. Now, the pluses are very great, but before I pass on from the point I Ve just made, the Tribunal has got proposed according to the report to have authority to determine minimum Australian content and advertising. Neither of these worry about us, we&#39;re not in the advertising game and we&#39;re so far out ahead of everybody else in program content  , . Australian content . . . that that&#39;s of no consequence. On the Broadcasting Council- which will be concerned with program standards and development of programme standards which are left to the industry .. . no problems for us. We &#39;ve always followed the program standards, laid down by the ABC Board, although they didn&#39;t apply to us, except for radio. And so this is to me of no consequence. </para>
			<para>And so I&#39;m led on to talk about the ABC &#39;s programs. Now there&#39;s been a great deal of hoohah going on about censorship. You know, to put it in an oversimplified form, parliament has charged nine commissioners with the responsibility for what the ABC does, which means what it puts to air. This is not the responsibility of the staff, it is the responsibility of the commissioners and the commissioners have quaintly enough been exercising their responsibilities. And of course this has become consorship. Now, unhappily of course, words in this day and age have all sorts of meanings that the user of them attributes to them. But censorship is an act of external imposition. No organisation can censor itself. What an organisation can do is to make selections and can exercise self-discipline. Every day our news service, which is acclaimed as the best news service in Australia and it is, is engaged in selecting out of an enormous number of news items what it will put to air. Now, if you like you can say that is censorship . . . it&#39;s nothing of the sort . . . it&#39;s selection . . . there may be plenty of people who disagree with the items selected and all their judgments will be subjective, but the news service every day selects what it will put to air on the basis of professional judgment . . . and </para>
			<para class="block">I think the ABC news service has done a magnificent job. Now, when it comes to programs they cost a lot of moneyand it apparently hasn&#39;t occurred to the ABC in the pastand it&#39;s the commission I&#39;m talking about- that it ought to be interested in what its programmers propose to do with the money that the Commonwealth Parliament gives it. And this I find very strange. So we are now becoming very interested as a body of commissioners in what the programmers propose to do with the money that they&#39;ve got. And there is nothing odd about this. It doesn&#39;t make any sense to me that some bright person, regardless of what it costs, declares to make a program without wondering who&#39;s going to look at it, and finishes up by putting a very expensive program on the air at a quarter to eleven at night when everybody&#39;s gone to bed . . . and somebody was talking about this a little while ago. Somebody, and in this case the commissioners, charged by the parliament with the responsibility of spending their funds, and for what goes to air, has got to become . . . to be interested in what the contribution is going to be . . . what benefit costs are going to be . . . and don&#39;t get alarmed when I introduce phrases like that- they have equal relevance to creative activity . . . here is one of the commercial programs that . . . commercial stations that have spent a lot of money in producing a new series which canned it after the fifth episode, it was so bad . . . and there&#39;s Thames in England, has just made a very expensive program which they&#39;re even burning before they&#39;re shown . . . and there are all these stupid idiotic people who chase strange fantasies that people round the ABC can do what they like. Now, they can&#39;t (tape mutilated) ... the act which says that the ABC staff can do what it likes and I don&#39;t think any parliament is going to be quite so rash as to do that. Now don&#39;t let anybody get me wrong. Our job as commissioners is to encourage to the uttermost creativity, to encourage to the uttermost innovation and this is what well go on doing. But particularly when funds are not unlimited, somebody has got to say &#39;are we going to spend our money on light entertainment, or are we going to spend it on televising sport or are we going to spend it on heavy drama or are we going to spend it on light situation- I &#39;m sorry, I oughtn&#39;t to say light because I haven&#39;t discovered one yet- situation comedy, or are we going to spend it on current affairs. Now, that is the job of the commissioners; and it&#39;s not discharged by saying well, TV can have 1014m dollars and say how you use it is no concern of ours . . . and so we&#39;re beginning to look at this sort of problem and with some traumas that you&#39;ve been aware of. So if I come in and I doubt you&#39;ll misunderstand me I want it understood that the commissioners, not I, I &#39;ve got no powers as  Chairman  under the legislation . . . there are nine commissioners who somehow or other have to come to a conclusion . . . and strangely enough despite everything that&#39;s been said, we come to conclusions and most times, indeed on all the critical occasions, unanimously . . . and I haven&#39;t felt it necessary to hammer these points, because I don&#39;t believe that that&#39;s desirable. The situation ought to be that we have a corporate body which somehow or other comes to a conclusion . . . and sometimes it may be 5/4 and sometimes it may be 6/3 and sometimes it may be 7/2 and sometimes it may be 8/1 and sometimes 9/0 . . . and I don&#39;t see any point whatever, except the surest way to destroy the insitution to identify how it&#39;s come to its conclusion. There is a decision it&#39;s come to, but I say in this respect that all the critical decisions since I&#39;ve been around the place have been unanimous decisions . . . and so what I&#39;m saying is the commissioners are charged by the parliament to the responsibility for providing-what is it- adequate and comprehensive programs and necessarily the commissioners are charged with what goes to air . . . and I&#39;ve also dealt with the subject of censorship. </para>
			<para class="block">Now, if I may deal with some of the particular matters. </para>
			<para class="block">One of the other-many other-matters that have been impressed on me over the last six months is the difficulty in discovering what people will think about anything that is televised or broadcast. As I&#39;ve gone round talking with people it&#39;s been a very salutory experience to discover that people who I would stake my fortune on would hold a particular view, have proved to hold precisely the opposite one. It&#39;s quite impossible to discover or guess how people are going to respond to this program or that program. We all know a great human failing of describing as biased anything that we don&#39;t happen to believe with or in. I was remarking earlier in the day that I got accused the other night at a gathering of swallowtails that the ABC was showing its wellknown communistic bias by refusing <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> five minutes at 7.30 on ABC when the commercials were giving him five minutes and so I indicated what the background was and had a certain amount of joy in saying that I&#39;d been described as many things and abused as many things, but so far I hadn&#39;t been described as being communist . . . but you know, they haven&#39;t had enough time yet . . . but remember, everybody considers what is broadcast or what is televised through his own eyes and ears against his prejudices, his predictions, his attitudes, his faiths . . . one can go on listing the characteristics that determine these things and they&#39;re all different to everybody, and we&#39;ve got this uncomfortable job of trying to be as honest and sincere and objective as we can be . . . and we are no way succeeding as we know. Now, that&#39;s another problem that faces the commissioners . . . but a great deal of effort is put in to trying to be objective by a great number of very devoted members of staff . . . and this is why our programs are I think generally very good. There are lapses, we know, and some of them of course are not always the responsibility of individual producers and time wreaks all sorts of results because a situation that might have been appropriate at point X becomes quite inappropriate at X plus two years when community attitudes may have vastly changed. But all I can say is that we do our best; when there are deviations from what we as commissioners think is the true gospel, we try to do something about it. But of course the horse is well and truly out of the stable by then and what you&#39;re doing is to try and avoid that situation arising in the future. </para>
			<para>Now, it&#39;s as a consequence of this, of course, that we get abused by members of parliament, members of political parties, members of churches, members of . . . you name them, we get abused. My fan mail is really fascinating. Some very delightfully direct letters tell me I&#39;m the greatest disaster since the San Francisco earthquake, and others who write to me rather plaintively and say, well, you know, you were appointed as the saviour of society and all we conclude now is that you&#39;re just as bad as the rest of them, which just shows that there may be some truth in the (tape mutilated) policy that somebody was laughing about recently . . . that the ABC has some characteristics that are generally attributed to the Chinese. But just to pick up this point  . . . somebody was referring to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Nixon&#39;s</inline> (tape mutilated) . . . well look, he may have been justified, I don&#39;t know, about some programs, but there are lots of other people who are equally upset about our programs  . . some programs I&#39;m upset about . . . and some of my colleagues are upset about others . . . and as I&#39;ve said to you what we try to do is to see whether, looked at as objectively as it is possible to look at things, this or that just went over the edge. There is a tolerance point . . . there are some people around the place who are trying to stretch the tolerance point . . . and they have to be looked at as you go along and don&#39;t forget always that tolerance point isn&#39;t always there . . . (gestures) ... it can be back there . . . (gestures) . . . or it can be up there . . . (gestures)  . . depending on . . . like skins, whether they&#39;re at thigh level or whether they&#39;re at ankle level ... things change. </para>
			<para>Somebody spoke about Radio Australia. This again of course has been a subject which has had a great deal of bashing about in the press. I think one of our problems is these days you know, if you haven&#39;t got any news you make it up, and if somebody doesn&#39;t deny it the next day it becomes fact the day after. In the case of Radio Australia, there&#39;s no suggestion that the ABC should not cease to control Radio Australia, there is a suggestion that there ought to be guidelines from Foreign Affairs on Radio Australia. And of course the fact of the matter is that as long as I&#39;ve been associated with government there has been a liaison between Foreign Affairs and Radio Australia . . . and how on earth does anybody imagine that Radio Australia could go its own way . . . anybody can simply imagine that the Radio Australia can put out programs in direct contradiction to government policy, foreign policy. And I&#39;m not talking about liberals or country party or labor, I&#39;m talking about government . . . and so if the government has a policy ... a foreign policy ... of course Radio Australia can&#39;t put out programs in direct opposition to it, which isn&#39;t to say of course that if the government has a foreign policy, and there is a parliamentary debate in which the Leader of the Opposition or the Shadow Foreign Minister states the Opposition&#39;s viewpoint, that Radio Australia doesn&#39;t report it ... of course, it reports it . . . and I think this is one of the reasons why Radio Australia has the reputation it has overseas. I know that on occasions Radio Australia has caused a great deal of annoyance to Indonesia over recent events, and this is the price that we pay I suppose in one sense. But there&#39;s a clear distinction between Radio Australia understanding what a government policy is and recognising it and doing nothing itself to run a different line . . . editorial line . . . rather different for Radio Australia to report what one would hope would be the considered remarks in the parliament of the Leader of the Opposition or the Opposition spokesman on foreign affairs . . . and then that shades off into all sorts of problems that Radio Australia you wouldn&#39;t imagine would report what some ratbag said on the Yarra Bank. And I don&#39;t think Radio Australia would have done that  . . and that isn&#39;t censorship . . . that&#39;s just sound commonsense which I&#39;d expect of any professional operating a delicate instrument like Radio Australia . . . and the Green report has said that our overseas trade ought to have some sort of input. Well, I&#39;m not troubled by Radio Australia sitting down with somebody from Overseas Trade who says, we&#39;re sending a delegation to Kamchakwi (?) or Kashmir . . . will you give it a mention and Radio Australia in its normal way putting together something about it. But really there&#39;s no question about the ABC losing control over Radio Australia and I can&#39;t imagine any government suggesting otherwise. The real problem about Radio Australia at the moment is that it hasn&#39;t got the transmitters in Darwin because the aerials aren&#39;t there . . . haven&#39;t even got a launch to get out to the site ... it got blown up in Cyclone Tracy . . . and the poor old transmitters at Shepparton are 35 years old and are strung together with cotton wool, I think, or reels of cotton. And this is all very deplorable ... the BBC is putting its new big transmitters into Singapore and other stations- the Russkies and the Chinese and the Americans and the French are all pumping out stuff on souped up transmitters and new transmitters and we&#39;re getting squeezed out . . . and we see this immediately in the response to our letters . . . there has been a very great decline in our correspondence and not only is this sad from our point of view, and by our point of view I mean Australia&#39;s point of view and Australia&#39;s image in the South East Asian area and the Pacific area, it&#39;s sad from the point of view of our listeners, who really do have a great regard for Radio Australia. Now that is a matter that will be receiving the attention of government before long. </para>
			<para>Orchestras ... let me just simply say this ... I happen to be very fond of orchestral music  . . but I do have to say in this room . . . that orchestras can&#39;t be treated as something sacrosanct when an organisation like ours is faced with the sorts of problems it is. I don&#39;t want to start a discussion on this, but 1 suppose the Philistine would probably prefer current affairs to orchestras ... on the other hand as one who had to listen to so many people for so often I couldn&#39;t care less if there were no current affairs program . . . and I could put up with a lot more orchestras. But I just throw in, and don t read anything into my remarks for goodness sake, we have six very large orchestras in this country. The English with a population of rive times our size don &#39;t have as many as that. The nips that run a very good service only have two for a population of 125 million. There may be a great deal of room for the State Governments to chip in ... so don&#39;t forget our approach to orchestras and concerts and don&#39;t forget that we&#39;re the biggest concert managers in the world, which is a strange distinction . . . don&#39;t forget that there&#39;s . . . the States don&#39;t chip in terribly much and we give a very good service to country areas, to schools  . . don&#39;t forget that we ourselves perhaps aren&#39;t doing as much as we might have done to try to develop highly specialised groups ... we tried in South Australia with the choral group which unfortunately folded up . . . but all I&#39;m just simply saying is that nobody can these days put a fence round anything and say that&#39;s absolutely taboo. But keep your ringers crossed. </para>
			<para>I was interested in the comment about the image of woman . . . I&#39;ve been trying to work that out myself for seventy years and having looked at Monday Conference last night I was even more unclear . . . but I don&#39;t need to say anything about Alvin Purple ... I think you&#39;ve rather judged my views on that and if there was one thing that led me to believe that there was a lot to be said for gallup polls it was to pick up one and discover that 30 per cent of the people thought like me ... it ought to be burned. For anyone engaged in marketing, which is after all what we are in a certain way could ever afford to market a program that 30 per cent of the people didn&#39;t want ... I was a bit distressed to hear it said that our . . . or I got the impression the feeling was that our TV programs were at an all time low. I don&#39;t think this is right ... I think Alvin Purple was a disaster, I think that this other wretched show is an equal disaster. We&#39;re not good yet at making light situation comedy . . . you  Enow,  we&#39;re very heavy handed and there are very few people around the world who are good at this ... the French are, the Brits are, the Americans are horrible and the Germans are colossal. Which isn&#39;t to say that we&#39;ve got to stop trying and  what  I want to see happen is that we just go on trying to see whether we can get on top of this particular technique. But never in another disastrous series . . . it&#39;s one thing to spend $25,000 maybe on a half hour show and then when you recover from the brickbats in three months&#39; time you try again. But we haven&#39;t produced yet good script writers, good producers and good actors for this sort of thing, which, as I say, is no reason why we shouldn&#39;t go on trying. I think that some of the programs are very good. Indeed, I think that what we&#39;ve done is encourage (?) the commercials to follow suit . . . there&#39;s a new show started in Melbourne last night which has had a  lot  of rave notices, which is directly a result of the work we did on Power Without Glory, Rush and we&#39;re coming up to a Timeless Land and all I hope is that the script turns out well and then that it&#39;s cast well and then produced well . . . and the consequence of this is that another of the commercials is coming up with one of the other Australian novels ... the name keeps escaping me. Some of the documentaries, some of the nature films that we&#39;ve produced I think are world class. We&#39;re selling them overseas, which is something ... we even sold Certain Women overseas. But I . . . you know, we Ve had our lapses, but so do most people and what we&#39;ve got to do is try to reduce the lapses as far as we can. </para>
			<para>On current affairs, there&#39;s no intention on our pan to cut current affairs . . . the AMs and the PMs . . . programmes will continue, TDT will continue, Four Corners will continue. We decided to cut out State of the Nation . . . it&#39;s been a bit of a disaster in terms of what&#39;s generally thought of it, and I&#39;m not talking about politicians here. I &#39;m talking about the people who look at it. TDT is a terribly expensive program- it costs about $2m . . . and, you know, it&#39;s getting up into the orchestra class. TDT as I Ve said elsewhere in most States has been scraping the barrel ... I don&#39;t know for myself, but I suppose I&#39;d better watch it for the next few days down here, which will encourage everybody to put on some good performances ... the ogre is about. But judging by my fan mail, apparently a lot of people aren&#39;t terribly impressed by some of TDT down here. It&#39;s extremely difficult to keep up a high level of informed, critical, analytical approach to what may be called current affairs problems  . . and I suspect, indeed I know that in some cases TDT has gone out and created news and then rushed along next night and filmed the result of their stimulation of the previous day. I&#39;ve already referred elsewhere to that awful affair at Monash, which I&#39;m sorry to say I think TDT had a large hand in ... in producing. Now, what we&#39;re looking for is a means of revitalising the TDT program, we haven&#39;t yet taken final decisions as to how this should be done. Whatever happens there&#39;ll be a large input from the regions ... it won&#39;t be dominated by Melbourne or Sydney. And I would hope that we come up with a program that instead of having a half a dozen snippets, none of which treats anything in any effective way, that we&#39;ll have rather fewer items which will treat in more depth and with more sophistication and with more balance items of significance that come up in the news. And this raises an enormously important problem that we&#39;re wrestling with ... we have as perhaps you &#39;ve heard, a sort of barrier between news and current affairs . . . we&#39;ve got some union problems in this area, which ought to be capable of solution. If you&#39;ve watched the news you will have noticed that the straight news particularly on the seven o&#39;clock national TV program, sometimes has an element of what I might call embroidery or elaboration about it. Now, you can go through from straight news to commentary over a spectrum and somewhere in the middle you get out of straight news and before you know where you are you&#39;re into straight analytic commentary. Now, this is troubling broadcasting outfits all round the world . . . how you cope with it . . . the newsboys here are concerned that the current affairs boys are seen as the glamour boys and they don &#39;t see any reason why they shouldn&#39;t be in the glamour game. I think what we may get to is the situation where the TDT program becomes an analytic, critical study of the main items of news of the day and this itself produces some problems because so much can happen between the time that TDT goes to bed and the time the news comes on. And we&#39;ve had, indeed last night was another occasion in point . . . lots of problems because in the <inline font-style="italic">2&#39;A</inline> hours or 2 hours that expires between . . . elapses between TDT going to bed and the seven o&#39;clock news comes on all sorts of things can happen. In Melbourne last night the seven o&#39;clock news quite rightly said that the Post Office hoohah was over in Sydney and TDT came on five minutes later and said, you know, what&#39;s going to happen to the Post Office hoohah in Sydney . . . so we&#39;ve got some technical problems as well to solve. </para>
			<para>But what we would hope will come out of this will not only be some money saving, but a better program and I think I might just stop here if I may ... I&#39;m talking too long  chairman  ... to say this . . . don&#39;t regard this financial constraint as a dreadful disaster for the ABC- it is nothing of the son. The ABC is now having happen to it what has happened to a great number of organisations over the years. It s going to discover that it can do a lot of things very much better than it has been doing and it&#39;s going to discover a lot of new ways of doing things that it hasn&#39;t been doing in the past. And this I think is tremendously important. </para>
			<para>On Launceston I know all about the desire of Launceston to have its own TV facilities ... the folk here have been telling me about your transmitter problems  it seems that some areas round Launceston are sublimely placed in that they can&#39;t hear anybody. I&#39;d have thought that had a great lot going for it. But all I would just simply say is . . . and I don&#39;t misunderstand the position at all . . . but when I was in Newcastle a few weeks ago, they were very insistent that they had an area to serve of over half a million and they don&#39;t have facilities and they&#39;re very well advanced- they&#39;ve got a studio mostly fitted out, except that we&#39;ve been cannibalising it in recent times to use bits and pieces for elsewhere. And as I&#39;ve said Radio Australia wants an awful lot of money to get its launch to go to its transmitter and to get some aerials on the transmitters and to replace the ones that are falling apart at Shepparton. It&#39;s all a matter of priorities . . . and from now on as you have seen from the Green report the ABC is going to be vitally concerned with planning . . . this is again if the government adopts this tremendous advance because here we&#39;ve had a situation where Telecom goes rushing around shoving up transmitters in all sorts of people&#39;s back yards, virtually for the benefit of two people living in next door houses, and this doesn&#39;t make terribly much sense. And so the ABC will I hope from now on really be determining where transmitters should be and of course at that stage the politicians and the parliamentarians mightn&#39;t like the ABC taking an independent objective view of where transmitters ought to be placed, because they&#39;ll no longer be able to rush along to Ministers and encourage them to put transmitters in people &#39;s back yards. </para>
			<para>Well, chairman, I think I&#39;ve said enough for the time
			being. </para>

            <para>- I thank the Senate. I turn now to the legislation before us. It has been drasticlly amended since it was first introduced into the other place last week. I believe now, perhaps because it has been drastically amended, that it is fairly pointless legislation which is not worth pursuing at this stage. The remaining provisions in the legislation, now that the most obnoxious provisions which would have sacked the entire ABC and funded commercial broadcasting have been removed, are fairly pointless. </para>

		  <para class="block">There is a provision in the Bill that every State should be represented on the ABC. I think this is a quite unnecessary piece of legalism. Any government which wants to ensure a balanced representation of States could have done so under the existing legislation and could do so without any legislative requirement. This is an inflexible provision. I should like to point out a couple of other inadequacies in a provision such as this. One is, of course, that no mention is made of the Territories. The Territories yet again are ignored. At this point of time I would not claim that the ACT would necessarily require a representative because it is fortunate, in one respect, in that it is close to the national media. I would suggest that if there is a case for having State representation-I am not sure that there is- the Northern Territory should be considered. Surely the people of the Northern Territory who have particular needs with regard to national and public broadcasting would be entitled to representation. They have particular problems with their huge distances, with the Aboriginal population and with the decentralised and isolated areas of population. If there is any justification for representation on the basis of States, surely the Northern Territory-if not the Australian Capital Territory- should be included. </para>
          <para>An amazingly anachronistic and uncalled for provision is contained in this legislation requiring the appointment of 2 women commissioners. I am not grateful for such a provision. I remind the Senate that when the original legislation was drawn up in 1942- the year in which I was born- it provided for one woman commissioner. At that time, only S commissioners were appointed to the ABC. At that time the rights of women to participate in public institutions and public life had suffered a great setback since the early feminist movement because of the Depression of the late 1920s and early 1930s and the subsequent world war. The argument about the status of women was probably at an all-time low in 1942. It may not have been unreasonable at that stage to provide specifically for representation by a woman on the Commission. I hope that during my lifetime, and partly as a result of the feminist movement, to which I have devoted a lot of my energies and will continue to do so, we will find that we have passed the stage where unless we provide legislatively for the appointment of a woman no woman will be appointed. What sort of egalitarianism is that? I am not particularly interested in that kind of legislative provision for equal opportunity. Equal opportunity must come in a more sound and basic way than through mere legislative provision. But if one is proffering some sort of egalitarianism through this legislation, I should have thought that a provision for at least 4 women out of the 9 members would have been more realistic. I will not say any more about that at this point because it will be raised at the Committee stage. </para>
          <para>The main issue at stake in the current debate on broadcasting in Australia is the issue of access to information. The reason why all sections of the community have risen up and opposed the Government&#39;s attempts to interfere with the ABC is simply this: In Australia we have a print media which is a complete monopoly of a very small number of people who, on the whole, are not democratic in their outlook. The Opposition sees a danger of the electronic media becoming a similar monopoly. Australians appreciate the fact that an independent broadcasting system is probably the only guarantee they have in present circumstances of having access to information which they may fairly judge to be unbiased, objective and properly critical of all political parties. That is the main issue, and that is the reason why the Government&#39;s attempts to set up an ABC composed entirely of its own nominees were so strenuously opposed by the community. </para>
          <para>There are a couple of other issues. There is the issue involved with Australia&#39;s peculiar geography and peculiar geographic position. Because Australia is so isolated from the rest of the world, broadcasting is particularly important. Because many Australians are so isolated from other Australians and from access to any kind of information at all, broadcasting is particularly important. Another issue which I am pleased to say has become of importance to the community is the issue of Australian content. I do not want to go over the whole of the Australian content debate, but I would like to say that Australians are ready for Australian content in their broadcasting and television programs, in both current affairs and drama. They are ready for it, and evidence for that can be found in the great success- the almost surprising success- of a number of ABC television dramas which have an Australian content. I refer to programs such as <inline font-style="italic">Seven Little Australians, Rush, Luke&#39;s Kingdom, Certain Women, Bellbird</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Power Without Glory.</inline> Not all those programs were really brilliant. For example, I am surprised at the tremendous success of <inline font-style="italic">Power Without Glory,</inline> which seems to me, as a piece of television drama, not to be of exceptional standard. But the success of these programs lies in the fact that they are Australian. They are about our own culture, they are written by our own writers, and they reflect our own social mores of the present and of the past. I have noticed that young children and teenagers particularly are absolutely fascinated by programs like <inline font-style="italic">Rush</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Power Without Glory,</inline> which give them some insight into their own history. These programs have been made and been very successful. The issue of Australian content, I think, has now been settled. Similarly, the success of the Australian film industry indicates a readiness by Australians to accept their own products in the media. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators may be wondering why I have raised the subject of Australian content at this point in the debate. If we have legislation which undermines the independence of the ABC, if we have financial strictures which limit the ability of the ABC to make programs such as those, we will not continue to have them. It is fairly clear that the commercial interests will not spend the money and do not have the skills and resources to proceed with the development of this very exciting phenomenon of Australian media productions. Only the ABC can continue to do those things and it can do them only if it has the creative freedom, the independence, and an appropriate financial allocation. </para>
          <para>In conclusion, I must make it clear that the Opposition does not believe that everything is perfect with the ABC or with the Broadcasting Control Board or with the issuing of licences or any other matters that are touched on in the legislation before us. We have never said that there was no need for public inquiry or that there was no need for a restructuring of broadcasting. There is a need for all those things. I submit there is a need for a public inquiry into broadcasting, one of suitable duration and substance to give rise to good legislation and sensible structural change. I refer to the fact that the Arran inquiry in Great Britain will take 3 years. That seems to me to be an appropriate period of time for a public inquiry into broadcasting. There have been just criticisms of the ABC which a public inquiry could explore, such as its having a top-heavy bureaucracy, a lack of depth in some current affairs programs, a lack of professionalism on the part of some interviewers, and so on. All these things are just criticisms and could be properly investigated by a public inquiry. </para>
          <para>Our earlier contention has been proved right, that a new type of broadcasting structure is necessary to accommodate developments such as community access broadcasting, special interest broadcasting, and the issue of public broadcasting licensing. There is a need for clarification of where editorial and programming policy should properly reside in broadcasting. We have seen a great deal of confusion. There have been accusations of censorship and, indeed, there have been acts of censorship in the past few months since <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Bland took over chairmanship of the ABC, partly because, I believe, responsibility for editorial and programming policy has not been clearly enough defined, or where it is defined it is no longer appropriate. There is a need for more community and worker participation in order to decentralise and demonopolise the media. </para>
          <para>There are lots of examples of things a public inquiry could look at. We could look at what has happened in Holland where there is a very interesting and innovative structure in access radio. We could take a lesson from what has happened in France where there is monopolisation of the media by the Government. None of these things was looked at in the hurried and secret inquiry that led up to the legislation before us. There is also the question of standards but I will not dwell on that subject because my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> spoke very persuasively last night about the needs for standards for children&#39;s television and there is to be a Senate Standing Committee inquiry into that matter. However, standards are of concern to the community. There is a lot of confusion about aesthetic standards, moral standards, technical standards and so on and so forth and a lot of these things need to be resolved. There is also the possibility of investigating the potential of the ABC to make and sell programs of high quality overseas. Perhaps that is one way in which the financing of the ABC could be more satisfactorily managed. Undoubtedly it can make programs of high standard and if it were appropriately structured it could sell these on the market and recoup the finance for investment in further programs of that kind. </para>
          <para>I suggest these things because I do not want the Government to think we are being entirely negative about the whole question. We appreciate the fact that the Government responded to public criticism and removed the most offensive aspects from the legislation before us, but because it did that we really think that the legislation now have is botched. It was hastily conceived legislation. It originally was drawn up for a sinister political purpose-to rid of the Commissioners who were unacceptable to the Government. That strategy did not succeed. What we have left in this Bui really is not worth proceeding with at present. </para>

              <para>-The honourable senator suggests that I should tell something to the staff of the ABC. I have not been telling the staff of the ABC anything. I have been listening to the ABC staff for some time on this issue and I will continue to listen to the staff of the ABC and workers in associated industries, and I will continue to listen to members of the public express their views on broadcasting because I think that is my responsibility rather than telling them what they should be doing. Because the legislation before us virtually has had its guts taken out- the sinister political aspect has been removed- there is nothing much in it which is worth proceeding with. The change from a Broadcasting Control Board to a Tribunal really only means that we will have a body similar in structure and function but all its members will be nominees of the present Government, and that is most unfortunate. Therefore, I support the amendment moved by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> which opposes this legislation and proposes to send it back for redrafting after a period of time for proper public inquiry and discussion so that the Government will then come up with legislation which will restructure public broadcasting in the interests of democracy, the Australian consumer and all the people involved in the industry. </para>

            <para>- in reply- The Senate has been engaged in an extensive debate involving some 9 honourable senators from both sides of the chamber, primarily concerning one main Bill, the Broadcsting and Television Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1076 and 2 machinery measures considered cognately. Inevitably the debate has ranged more widely than the terms of the Bill. The main substance of the debate has been an expression by honourable senators of their concepts of what may be the defects of the electronic media, both radio and television, and how they feel there should be some improvements. None of those matters relate to the mechanics of this Bill. I think all Australians share the view that it is eminently desirable to upgrade, as far as one can, broadcasting and television in this country. The elements are expressed in the same way in every country that has such a debate today. Of course the Government agrees and we would seek to have the highest possible standards for broadcasting and television in Australia. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is significant to record that nevertheless the Opposition has expressed the view that it is not opposed to the concept of some reforms, some legislative restructuring of the broadcasting and television system. In fact a number of Opposition senators said so. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> who lead for the Opposition, I think indicated that. Indeed basically what a number of Opposition senators have said is that the present legislation is, in their words, &#39;somewhat insignificant&#39;. There has been a dialogue in public. The Government listened to the dialogue and made some amendments. Incidentally, on the one hand we had an argument that we ought to have a public debate and listen to it but we had not and on the other hand, I think, the Opposition acknowledged that we had had such a public debate and we had listened and had amended legislation and the Opposition commended the amendments as such. </para>
          <para>I want to state some principles. I state quite unequivocally that my Governemnt stands for an independent broadcasting and television system, in terms of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, absolutely free of all political interference. There has been considerable debate and emotionalism over recent weeks. I simply invite the public of Australia to test one thing. In 23 years of Liberal-Country Party Government in the past the Australian Broadcasting Commission grew in strength, in quality and in independence, and was free of political interference. I invite the public to recall that we are a Government of the same philosophy and with the same goals. We aim to have the Australian Broadcasting Commission enhanced in the quality of its delivery. As I have said before, the goal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is often argued as being the goal of independence. That is not the goal. The goal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission is to establish an adequate and comprehensive programming service for Australia and that is what the legislation enjoins the Commission to do. Towards the accomplishment of that goal, independence is provided so that objectivity shall be achieved. It is vital that in the seeking of the goal everybody-both Government and the ABCshould look to a completely non-partisan and objective approach by the ABC. I believe that this will be the goal to which we will work. </para>
          <para>Much has been said about the Government seeking to stack the Commission. I respond by saying that during the course of the Whitlam Government, I think it is right to say, all members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission and almost all members of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board were replaced by the Whitlam Government. It seems that the Opposition feels that it was quite all right for it to make such replacements but that replacements by this Government would be wrong. Over a period of 23 years numerous replacements were made by governments of my philosophy, and without critical comment by the people of Australia. That would justify our judgment, in that - </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Button</inline>acknowledges that fact. I think it is important that we acknowledge it. The real test is whether we are appointing people of objectivity and quality to the Commission. I think it is significant that it is acknowledged by the Labor Opposition that in the past Liberal-Country Party appointments to the Commission have been good appointments. That has been said. </para>

          <para>The Bill is virtually an interim measure. It seeks to set up a series of institutions. It abolishes the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, sets up the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal and gives to that Tribunal in the interim period, prior to further legislation, virtually the powers of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. The Bill leaves with the Minister temporarily, in that interim period, the final power of licence approvals. Ultimately that power will be transferred to the Tribunal. Since we are debating the need for a non-political broadcasting and television system, I want to say that this Government is going further than any government went in the past. Whereas in the past applications for licences were investigated and recommended by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and then approved by the Minister, in future the Tribunal- an independent statutory body- will investigate applications and determine licences free of political intervention. Whilst in the past under the Wireless Telegraphy Act it was possiblethat Act was operated on by the Whitlam Government-for Ministers to grant licences, for instance, for public broadcasting, in the longer term this power will pass to the Tribunal and there will be no political or ministerial determination of licences. I think all these matters are valuable. </para>
          <para>In the course of the debate there was a great deal of discussion about standards. A lot of concern was expressed, and rightly so, about the quality of television and broadcasting as it relates to children primarily, during children&#39;s viewing and listening times, and to adults, because assault on the eyes and ears is as bad in many ways as physical assault on the body. It is important to understand that this measure envisages that, immediately upon the setting up of the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal, that Tribunal will set out upon a broad ranging public inquiry into standards and will invite the public of Australia to tell that Tribunal the kind of standards that the people of Australia want. This is an enormously important inquiry and one which should have full public support. I hope that members of the Opposition will make submissions to that inquiry on standards, because we all will be very interested to see what kind of standards they suggest. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button,</inline> who is smiling now, that when he was in government Ministers of his persuasion argued that there should be a relaxation of standards and that the public should be given freer choice. So this is basically an important matter. </para>
          <para>There are some matters that I would like to clean up. I am conscious of the time limit and shall therefore do so quickly. An important announcement was made this morning on ethnic radio. There was acknowledgement by the Australian Broadcasting Commission of its acceptance of its role. To save time and with the Opposition&#39;s approval, I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a telex of a statement by the Australian Broadcasting Commission on ethnic radio, which was signed by the General Manager, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Duckmanton.</inline> I think that it would be handy for all honourable senators to have it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

			<para>Statement by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Embargoed for public release at 7 p.m. Thursday 9 December 1 976. </para>
			<para>The Commission at its meeting today, reviewed the course of discussions the  Chairman  and the General Manager had had with the Minister for Post and Telecommunications and the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs since the Government invited the ABC to take over the ethnic radio stations 2EA Sydney and 3EA Melbourne. </para>
			<para>Agreement has been reached about the functions of the national ethnic broadcasting advisory committee, which go beyond advice for the ABC, that the secretariat for it would be provided by the ABC, and that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs would consult with the ABC about appointments to the committee. </para>
			<para>As soon as the Committee has been appointed, the ABC will be 	looking to it for advice about the conduct and program structure of the ethnic stations. The Commission&#39;s objective will be, in light of this advice, to settle these matters by early March and then assume formal responsibility for the stations. It may take some little time thereafter to implement the conclusions arrived at in actual program structure. </para>
			<para>The plan is to operate the ethnic broadcasting service as a discreete element of the ABC. The Commission has already given preliminary consideration to detailed investigations made by its staff and feels confident that it will be able to provide a service that not merely meets more adequately the needs of ethnic communities, but one which will have an appeal to the Australian community as a whole. </para>
			<para>The Commission&#39;s acceptance of the generment&#39;s invitation is subject to its covering all costs of the new service, including the cost of support services, e.g. management, personnel, accounts and general administration without any diminution in the funds that would be provided for the ABC&#39;s normal services. It is not possible at this stage to quantify the ultimate costs because so much depends upon the conclusions reached by the commission following the advice of the committee, the extent to which it is decided that english language training should be provided, the need to provide a special program content of news from migrants&#39; countries of origin and the decisions reached by the Government about the transmitters. </para>
			<para>The present transmitters are obviously inadequate to provide a service to ethnic communities, for example, in the Wollongong and Newcastle areas. </para>
			<para>The commission contemplates a continuing substantial input from the volunteers who have so far provided much of the content of 2EA and 3EA. It seems likely that some legislative changes will be needed to provide protection for the ABC in relation to its legal responsibility for program output. </para>
			<para>There is agreement also with the Ministers that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs will proceed to the appointment of advisory committees in Sydney and Melbourne when the ABC has considered early in the new year the general advice of the new national advisory committee on matters affecting the overall conduct of the ethnic broadcasting system. </para>
			<para>The Commission is aware of considerable concern in Melbourne about the future of 3ZZ. Today&#39;s decision has no bearing upon the future of this station. </para>

		  <para>A number of statements was made during the debate. I will be very quick in replying to them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> asked what was the cost of the Alvin Purple program. My understanding is that the cost of 13 episodes runs somewhat higher than his figure. He put a figure of $500,000 on it. My impression and that of my advisers is that it ran higher than that. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> asked under what conditions a commissioner could be dismissed. I invite his attention and that of all other honourable senators to section 37 of the principal Act, which sets out the conditions and the safeguards in that regard. I will not go into them because we are racing against time. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> asked a number of questions regarding public broadcasting. I repeat what I have said in the interim period. This will be a matter for the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to recommend. Incidentally, I should add that during the interim period standards will be the responsibility of the Tribunal, just as they are at this moment the responsibility of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. </para>

              <para>-I will find it and draw the honourable senator&#39;s attention to it. I think that it is important to understand that at this moment, under the existing Act, the standards for commercial stations are the responsibility of the Control Board and that the standards for the Australian Broadcasting Commission are its responsibility. There is a dichotomy there. It is one to which the public may wish to address itself. That will be a matter for discussion. The answer to the interjection by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> is that proposed section 16(1) (a), as provided for in clause 6 of the present Bill, at page 8, is the head of power to which I refer. </para>

              <para>-I think that this matter would be more appropriately dealt with in the Committee stage. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> said 2 things. She said really that the Opposition was opposing this matter only because of the prior events that related to the amendments and not to the substance of the Bill itself. I should have thought that events which led to public dialogue and to amendments arising out of public dialogue would be events that would be commended and I would see that as being a virtue. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> also argued that State representation was wrong. As the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications I say that scarcely a week passes by in this chamber when an honourable senator from a particular State does not get up and argue that his State is not getting a fair deal one way or another- whether by way of local news services, regional news services or regional public information services- from the ABC. It seems to me to be vital in terms of the consensus of the Senate that we should enshrine the concept of minimal representation in legislation. Honourable senators have drawn my attention to this situation in recent days. I think it is fair to say that in recent times Tasmania and South Australia have suffered simply because they do not have a voice on the Commission. It is interesting that there should be a suggestion that that voice be denied. </para>

          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Young</inline>raised a question in respect of the Broadcasting Council. This body will be established by regulation in early 1977 but representatives of the 3 sectors of broadcasting on the Council will have to be chosen by their professional associations. The functions of the Broadcasting Council, as set out under this Bill, are to review and comment upon plans for developments in broadcasting presented to the Minister. The Commission is to have a consultative function only. Assuming that we follow the pattern set in the other place and the Bill is passed by the Senate the Commission will have modified consultative powers. </para>
          <para>Let me very quickly pull all of the points together. The Government has introduced a Bill which seeks to abolish the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. This legislation proposes to transfer the Board&#39;s powers of licensing to a statutory authority, and no one argues against that. Also, it proposes to transfer the Board&#39;s powers of inquiry to a statutory body, and no one argues against that. In addition it proposes to transfer the Board&#39;s technical powers to the Postal and Telecommunications Department, and there is no dialogue against that at all. The legislation proposes to give to the Tribunal the power to undertake a major wide-ranging inquiry into standards, and everyone has sought just such a move. </para>
          <para>In accordance with a series of important measures recommended to the Green Committee by the Australian Broadcasting Commission itself and by employees of the ABC it is proposed to give the Australian Broadcasting Commission vital new changes in respect of staffing arrangements by releasing the Commission partially and significantly from the control of the Public Service Board. The proposal to establish a management-employee consultative committee is of vital importance because it provides the basis for consultation within the industry. As a consequence the Australian community will have an impeccable broadcasting and television service in the sense that it will be absolutely free of political control. I repeat that there will be less political intervention than was possible under the previous legislation. There will be no political intervention in respect of licencing at all, and this proposal is absolutely vital. There will be in fact absolute freedom for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
          <para>I repeat that the Australian Broadcasting Commission is and will remain a statutory body charged with producing adequate and comprehensive programming in Australia. All aspects of programming by the Commission are the total responsibility of the Commission and of nobody else. No government seeks- and certainly not this Government- to intervene in the programming of the Commission. The government of the day on behalf of the taxpayer says to the Commission, as it does to others: &#39;This is your budget for the year&#39;. This year the Commission suffered, as did all government departments and instrumentalities, some restraints in finance because of recessive characteristics which this Government inherited. A reduction of some 6 per cent was made in respect of the budget of the Commission. Virtually $130m of taxpayers&#39; money is available to the Commission. This money will be allocated by the Commission and by nobody else according to its priorities and without any intervention at all by government. This is an interim measure, and of course a series of events will flow from it. I repeat that during the second reading debate nobody really suggested that there was a fundamental defect in the structure of this measure. I take aboard the general criticisms of honourable senators about the need continuously to upgrade the quality of programs and the need to upgrade standards. I will convey them to my Government. In the light of those comments, the Government will reject the Opposition&#39;s proposed amendment. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>After proposed sub-section 10 (4), insert the following new sub-section: (4a) A person who immediately before the commencing day held office as a full-time or part-time member of the Board for a term expiring after that day shall be appointed as a member of the Tribunal and shall hold office for a term equivalent to the remainder of the term to which he would have been entitled but for the provisions of this Act. &#39; </para>
          </motion>
          <para class="block">In effect and in summary, proposed new subclause (4a) provides that members of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board, which is to be abolished by this legislation, who have unexpired terms as statutory officers should be appointed for the balance of these unexpired terms to the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal which will be established by this legislation. The functions of the Broadcasting Control Board, which will be abolished as at 1 January 1977, apart from its technical functions, are in essence twofold. There is the quasi-judicial function of dealing with licence applications, licence renewals, the granting of licences, and so on; and there is the administrative function of administering the standards insofar as standards are prescribed by the Broadcasting and Television Act. The Government, by its amendment made to this legislation in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission, has seen fit to say: The position of statutory office holders on the Australian Broadcasting Commission should be protected. They should not be axed. &#39; I use that expression in a political context, totally unfamiliar to us all! Office holders should be allowed to complete the unexpired portion of their terms as members of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. It has probably been a less flamboyant political issue, but the same thing intended by the original legislation in relation to the Australian Broadcasting Commission is being done by this Bill to the office holders of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. I thought the matter was well expressed by the honourable member for Casey, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peter</inline> Falconer.

Page 3 of the annual report of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board for the year ending 30 June 1976 makes reference to members of the Board. It states: </para>

          <para class="block">It was during that period that the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts, produced one of the Senate&#39;s most monumental reports on an inquiry into broadcasting. The Committee lasted for some 2 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland served on that Committee. There may be other honourable senators present who also served on it. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evans</inline> was secretary to the Committee. He has a long period of expertise in broadcasting. The other 2 members of the Broadcasting Control Board who would be affected are: <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Patricia</inline> Edgar of La Trobe University, who has published a number of reports relating to children&#39;s television standards in this country, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr E.</inline> A.

          <para>So of the 3 persons concerned, only one is a full time member and that is <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evans.</inline> Only one member would be eligible for a full time appointment on the proposed tribunal, and that would be <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Evans.</inline> Presumably, the other two would be eligible in the category of associate member of the tribunal. I put to the Senate very seriously that if the principle holds good in relation to one statutory body it should hold good in relation to another. That principle was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Falconer</inline> in the House of Representatives. I believe it is shared by most members of the Parliament. It is for that reason that I have moved the amendment. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator used the argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Falconer</inline> and transposed it to a completely separate situation, namely, that this clause sets up a new tribunal. The Australian Broadcasting Control Board is being abolished. The honourable senator is suggesting that when the Government transfers some of the Control Board&#39;s powers to the new Tribunal is must appoint to the Tribunal the same persons who were on the Control Board. If that suggestion were accepted, the Government would be inhibited in deciding who was suitable for appointment to the Tribunal with the powers that it will have. </para>

          <para class="block">The Opposition&#39;s position on this is quite clear. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick,</inline> in his reply to the second reading debate today, stressed time and again that the Australian Broadcasting Commission was required by the terms of the Broadcasting and Television Act to provide adequate and comprehensive programs. Until this Bill is passed the commercial sector of the industry is also required under section 16 of the existing Act to provide adequate and comprehensive programs in exactly the same way as the ABC. The effect of this clause is to repeal the requirement that commercial television stations provide adequate and comprehensive programs and to leave the ABC with that statutory instruction to provide adequate and comprehensive programs. </para>
          <para>I think there is a general concern about the standards of television programs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> addressed himself to this question this morning. We feel, for a number of reasons, that section 16 should remain in the Act as it always has. I illustrate my point in this way. In the Green report on broadcasting and television there is a reference in paragraphs 75 and 76 at page 26 to a discussion by the Vincent Committee in 1962 about the expression &#39;adequate and comprehensive programs&#39;. The Green committee went on in paragraph 76, after dealing with the interpretation of those words, to discuss them in the context of the commercial sector of broadcasting. It said: </para>
          <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
            <item label=".">
              <para>. that this inquiry would endorse the spirit of the above interpretation, but in the following paragraphs will canvass those individual aims which it considers appropriate to each sector of broadcasting. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The fact of the matter is that they were accepted as appropriate criteria for the commercial sector as well as the ABC. The Government is displaying inconsistency in removing this stipulation in relation to the commercial sector but leaving it there for the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
          <para>It is often said on behalf of the commercial sector that it gives the public what they want. I refer the Senate again to the comment of the Pilkington Committee in Great Britain on this very question. It is quoted in the Green report at page 33 and it says: </para>
          <para>No one can say he is giving the public what he wants unless the public knows the whole range of possibilities which television can offer and from this range chooses what it wants to see. What the public wants and what it has a right to get is the freedom to choose from the widest possible range of program matter. Anything less than this is deprivation. </para>
          <para class="block">The section which this Bill removes is the only stipulation in the Broadcasting and Television Act which does something towards preventing what the Pilkington inquiry called deprivation in terms of television comprehensiveness and adequateness, to use the words of the section. </para>
          <para>There is one other thing I want to say. I refer the Senate to the report of the Broadcasting Control Board which was referred to in yesterday&#39;s Press. I read from the report in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> which refers to self-regulation being a subject for a public inquiry next year by the proposed Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The article says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The survey found that 39 per cent of those favouring control of television believed it should be done by a Government body. </para>
            <para>An independent representative body was favoured by 27 percent. </para>
            <para>Fewer than one in four believed control of TV content should be left to television stations. </para>
            <para>Only a small minority believed there should be no control at all. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The report then goes on to deal with the poll which was conducted and says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The response favouring controls on what was shown was 75 per cent. The opposition was 22 per cent. The remaining 3 per cent did not know. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">They are the sort of people who listen to test pattern music. The article continues: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The response favouring control of time of programs was 83 per cent. The opposition was 14 per cent. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The figures go on in that vein. I do not need to go into them in further detail but I refer honourable senators to the report. So the Opposition has moved its amendment because the Government is adopting double standards on this issue by not retaining the present prescription in the Broadcasting and Television Act. </para>

            <para>- Let me state very briefly that the Government will oppose this amendment. It will do so not for the reasons that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> adduced but for very good and cogent reasons. As soon as the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal is established its primary job will be to set up a major public inquiry into standards so that in the place of an amorphous stipulation of adequate and comprehensive programs it will be possible for the community to transmit to the tribunal its ideas as to what standards there ought to be in terms of hours or in terms of the quality and the comprehensive and adequate nature of programs generally. That is the whole basis for the inquiry. So this legislation is in no way an abandonment of sanctions upon commercial stations or indeed, in the end, standards which the Australian Broadcasting Commission must look at. It is an invitation to the public in the first place to find out what the public requires and, consequent upon that, it is competent for this Parliament to legislate further if it so desires. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In the interm, after the passage of this Bill, the Tribunal will be responsible for standards, just as the Broadcasting Control Board has been responsible. So there will be no vacuum. There will be an interim period in which the Tribunal will have the same powers as the Board had. Following the public inquiry, the likelihood is that there will be a far more comprehensive expression of standards desired by the public than is contained in the general terms now in the Act. </para>

            <para>- Following my contribution to the debate last night, I might appear to be a little obtuse this morning, but I cannot see how, under clause 6, the Tribunal has, firstly, the authority and, secondly, the power to administer what is already able to be administered by the Australian Broadcasting Control Board under section 16 ( 1 ) (c) of the current Broadcasting and Television Act which is sought to be repealed by this Bill. I advert to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> said last night. She made the point very clearly that in America television has taught children to kill before they learn to read. As I read the Bill- I hope my interpretation is incorrect- it seeks to repeal that part of the Act which is related to the Broadcasting Control Board. One of the functions of the Broadcasting Control Board, albeit recently it has not lived up to its reputation, is to deal with complaints from viewers as to standards of production and standards of presentation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If there is one thing that the people of Australia want it is ease of access to some sort of tribunal in order to ensure that the standards which they deem to be acceptable are those standards which are accepted by the electronic media. Admittedly at present that requirement can be imposed only on the commercial stations, and that is not done with great effect by the Broadcasting Control Board. At least the amendment put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> attempts to enshrine in this legislation a power for the Tribunal to ensure that adequate and comprehensive programs are provided by commercial broadcasting stations and commercial television stations in the best interests of the general public. Of course, it is an attempt to transpose what is currently contained in section 16 (1) (c) of the Act into the new provisions for the Tribunal. I wonder whether the Minister can explain to the Senate just where in proposed new section 16 the Tribunal is given power to administer, as distinct from determine, the standards to be observed by licensees? Does the Minister interpret the word determine&#39; to mean both determine and administer? If so, are there provisions for regulations to be made so that the Tribunal in the period between its establishment and its making findings after the public inquiry can ensure the maintenance of standards in the public interest? </para>

            <para>- There was a curiously convoluted illogicality in the reply which the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> gave to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> As I understood him he was saying that there has existed in the Act up till now some requirement on commercial broadcasters to provide adequate and comprehensive programs. I do not think anybody would claim that they satisfy that requirement in the Act. It was constantly claimed in defence of the Broadcasting Control Board that it had fallen down on its job to police that requirement because of some weakness in the powers conferred on the Board. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I can remember when the Committee to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> adverted was holding its inquiries. It had the  Chairman  of the Broadcasting Control Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Miles</inline> Wright, before it on several occasions. He was asked- principally by me-why it was that with this provision in the Act the broadcasters were able to drive a horse and cart through the Act and were obviously not providing adequate and comprehensive programs. He took the curious view, especially in relation to radio programs, that provided in a given area there were adequate and comprehensive programs- if rock music was coming from one station and high class music from another- this constituted for an area some sort of adequate and comprehensive broadcasting. Nonetheless, we did not get adequate and comprehensive broadcasting, from either commercial television or commercial radio stations, even when this provision was in the Act. </para>
          <para>Now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> tells us that they are going to hold an inquiry which almost inevitably will result in even more stringent requirements for adequate and comprehensive services. I take it that he envisages a fairly lengthy inquiry. At least I hope he envisages a lengthy inquiry so that the matter will be looked at in the way that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> has suggested. But in the meantime we will have this hiatus when the message will go out to these custodians of popular broadcasting: &#39;Bob&#39;s your uncle&#39;. I very much fear that if they are allowed 6 months, 12 months, or 2 years to establish their own notion of standards they will be immovable, no matter what emerges from the inquiry. They are a very powerful lobby and I know that their philosophy of using the air waves of the nation merely to make money without any regard for the public interest has many sympathisers on the Government side of politics. </para>
          <para class="block">I fear that if we allow this hiatus and the broadcasters are allowed to establish their standards before the public inquiry is finished we shall get their standards all right and they will be worse than they have been up to now. </para>

I remind the Senate of what the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> has said today, that is, that the Tribunal is going to hold a public inquiry so that the people of this country can come forward and give evidence and pass comment. If the standards of these commercial sinners that are referred to by the Opposition are going to become so low, I am very certain that the people of Australia will come forward and say many critical things and will want to lay down very stringent standards. </para>

          <para>I feel that this responsibility should rest with the people concerned, that is, with the general public. It is all very well for us to stand here and use the term &#39;adequate and comprehensive&#39;. Let one of the honourable senators opposite define for me what the Opposition means by &#39;adequate and comprehensive . It will be far better for the general public to come forward when the opportunity is given for the Tribunal to hold a public inquiry and set down standards that it thinks are necessary for this country. A lot of confusion surrounds this issue. A lot of discussion has been going on for a long time. We have problems with children&#39;s programs, on which we hear contradictory arguments. There are many areas about which people have been concerned and I am certain that people will come forward on this occasion and express their concern. I feel that they will be far better at setting down the definition, as they see it, of &#39;adequate and comprehensive &#39; than anyone else. </para>

I ask the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> in his reply to comment on the fact- I put it to him that it is a fact-that in the past 3 months average advertising time per hour on commercial television has gone up from 9 minutes to 13 minutes when the standard set by the Broadcasting Control Board is a maximum of 1 1 minutes per hour.

            <para>- I am advised that the standards for advertising are 13 minutes during prime viewing time and 1 1 minutes during non-prime viewing time. I have no evidence that those times have been exceeded. It is competent for the Australian Broadcasting Control Board to look at that matter in respect of the weeks immediately past. Let me deal with this matter as quietly as I can. I do understand it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland and I did a great deal of work together on this matter. I hope that I am not misjudging what he said in any way. As I understand it, he said that the words &#39;adequate and comprehensive&#39; were so ambiguous that it was virtually impossible to pin them down and that to that extent they were of no great help to the Broadcasting Control Board. </para>

              <para>- The Control Board itself expressed the view that the words were amorphous or woolly. At present, the Board itself holds the view that the words do not give it any real directions. Therefore, I put it to the Senate that their presence or absence is inconsequential. </para>

          <para>There are 2 important things to remember. One is that this Bill specifically will give the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal the power to determine the standards to be observed by licensees in respect of the broadcasting or televising of programs. It is not a question of whether the commercial stations will do their own thing. It is for the Tribunal to determine the standards. There is a firm provision for the Tribunal to do what the Australian Broadcasting Control Board can do now in accordance with the woolly wording &#39;adequate and comprehensive programs&#39;. In case anybody has any doubt about this matter, I draw the attention of the Senate to section 86 of the principal Act. That gives a residual power to the Minister. If there were to be any hiatus- I do not acknowledge that there will be- it is competent upon the Minister, indeed he is responsible, to take such action as he sees fit, under his power of suspension or revocation of licences, if there is a decline in standards. </para>
          <para>In summary, the Board felt that the words &#39;adequate&#39; and &#39;comprehensive&#39; were of no use to it and that their deletion was therefore of no significance. The powers of the proposed Tribunal have been more rigidly expressed in a clear way in the Bill before us. There is a residual responsibility upon the Minister. The Government has no intention of allowing any kind of open season. It will try to interpret from the public what it wants. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland often has expressed the view- he expressed it when he was a member of the Senate Standing Committee on Education, Science and the Arts- that it is important not to have standards so rigid that they do not express the contemporary viewpoint. I do not want to put words into his mouth; but at the same time, I imagine, he believes that the standards should not be so lax that they are arbitrary. Standards can and must be fixed by the Tribunal. The public has the opportunity to determine the matter. In the interim 2 things can happen: The Minister may exercise his power which, I admit, is a bulldozer power and has some defects. More importantly, the Parliament has the power to intervene by introducing legislation- if necessary, next February- if there are any defects in the present legislation. Should there be any defects in this legislation, it would be possible for very swift action. It would be a very short period before the Government could introduce legislation which would express the will of the Parliament. </para>

          <para class="block">The amendment, I believe, is self-explanatory. Why should that stipulation not be included if we believe in open public discussion of what the Broadcasting Tribunal is doing? The Opposition takes the view very strongly that this is a matter, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> said only a few minutes ago, about which the public is concerned and about which there should be public discussion. The Opposition believes that the reports of the Tribunal should be published so that the public can take a continuing interest in the structure of broadcasting in this country and in reports which are made by the Tribunal. I will be interested to hear the Minister&#39;s reason for opposing the amendment if, as he has often professed, he believes in openness of government. Maybe there is some sort of ritualistic Party decision which binds the Minister. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- The Government opposes the amendment. It is true that the Green report proposes that the Tribunal should prepare and publish reports of all inquiries. However, the provision has not been included in the Bill because it is felt that the Tribunal may prepare some reports which are of a confidential nature and therefore should not be available for publication. In any event, it is considered that the publishing of reports, wherever possible, should be dealt with on an administrative basis and not as a legislative commitment. I share <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button&#39;s</inline> concern for open government, and so does the Government. The test of whether the Government pursues the principles of open government will be the decisions it makes administratively from time to time on these reports, and not whether it entrenches something which may prove to be a burden. It ought to be possible for a government to determine and then to justify as it has to justify to this Parliament and to the people of Australia, whether a report is confidential. The Government opposes the amendment. </para>

              <para>- The first amendment relates to a staff elected representative on the Australian Broadcasting Commission. This was a matter of quite lengthy debate in the House of Representatives and I do not want to go into the matter in great detail, except to make one point which I feel was not made in the other place when there was this tedious discussion of what worker participation means, and so on. The point about the Australian Broadcasting Commission or a body such as the Australian Broadcasting Commission is that they are not factories. The Australian Broadcasting Commission is a creative body; it has creative tasks. I believe there is a difference between the sort of discussion on worker participation which took place in the House of Representatives and a body like the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>

          <para>I understand that the Government will oppose these amendments. In all sincerity, I say that I believe that reasonably cogent arguments were advanced on this general question in the House of Representatives. Our position, however, is that the ABC has a staff elected commissioner. It should continue to do so. It was the wish of the staff association that that election take place. I believe it has led to a degree of openness within the affairs of the ABC. As to the question of the women representatives on the Commission we find that a quite extraordinary and Neanderthal sort of provision. I believe that one of my colleagues may have something to say about that aspect. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>I think the situation is this: The amendments ought to be opposed. At the moment an elected staff representative is a member of the Commission. His appointment, as the Government has made it clear, is to be continued. He will be employed as a member of the Commission for the next 1 8 months or 2 years or whatever his term of office is. </para>
          <para>There is also provision in this Bill for consultative machinery. We will be able to judge in the next 1 8 months whether it is adequate, whether it will provide a panacea, or whether the election of a staff representative is still desirable. I think that it is desirable to have a period when these methods of participation can be seen in operation and tested. I happen to have strong views on the subject, though they may not be the views of all my colleagues. But I am content to wait and see how the whole effort pans out in that period, how the consultative machinery from low to high ranks, effectively brings the staff into the decisions that are made by management. I think therefore, that that particular amendment is not called for at this stage. </para>
          <para>With regard to the appointment of 2 women Commissioners, it is all right to say that there is no need to have this provision. But in fact we live in a society where I think we need to ensure that there are at least 2 women Commissioners. I hope that in future more than two will be appointed. But I think that there is no reason for cutting out that provision which would then be interpreted in a different way. </para>

            <para>- During the second reading debate on this Bill I said that the more sinister aspects of it had been removed when the Bill was redrafted. However, when looking at these two amendments to the clause we are endeavouring to amend, I think one can draw some sort of sinister inference. On the one hand, the Government is prepared to make a quite unnecessary, anachronistic and even sexist provision for the inclusion of 2 women on the Commission. But at the same time, it is not prepared to make the desirable, sensible, and perfectly acceptable provision for the appointment of an elected representative of the staff to the Commission. In order to accommodate the quite unnecessary provision of 2 women Commissioners, the Government has actually had to go to the length of saying that the number of commissioners shall be increased from nine to eleven if this is necessary to achieve the balance. It seems to me to be extraordinarily complex, clumsy and quite unnecessary. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Green report which the Government claims is the basis for this legislation said that 9 Commissioners were too many and that seven would be adequate. Here we have a measure aimed at the possibility of having 11 commissioners simply to accommodate an unnecessary provision for 2 women. On the other hand, there is the refusal of the Government to admit a very basic principle of worker participation, which is that those working in the Australian Broadcasting Commission should have the right to elect one spokesperson to the Commission. </para>

              <para>- I conclude by saying that the amendment to provide for a representative to be elected by the staff to serve on the Commission is probably the most important amendment the Opposition has moved to this Bill. I hope the Government will accept it. We oppose, for the reasons I have given, the unnecessary sexist and patronising provision for 2 women commissioners. </para>

            <para>- The Government will oppose the amendments for reasons as set out in another place. I think they were described as cogent reasons by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button.</inline> It is important to identify the fact that this is not an attempt on our part to remove from existing legislation any legislative power to appoint a staff representative. That power does not exist. It is true that there is a staff representative on the Commission at the moment. That has happened without the necessity for any legislative amendment at all. This Government&#39;s Bill does not preclude such a situation. The Government&#39;s Bill provides for management staff consultation. On that basis we oppose the amendments. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition will move 3 amendments to clause 14. They all relate to public broadcasting and are designed, in effect, to do 2 things. The first is to make the Broadcasting Tribunal the responsible body for issuing licences to public radio and television broadcasting stations. As the Bill now reads, the Minister is the responsible person to grant licences. The Government has talked a lot about keeping politics out of broadcasting. I thought that the Tribunal was part of that exercise. We are concerned that it should be the Tribunal which should grant these licences. Consistent with that we are concerned that public broadcasting licences should be granted on the same basis as all other licences; that is, subject to public inquiry and so on by the Tribunal. Basically the amendments are to achieve that purpose. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The other purpose of the amendments is to ensure that broadcasting licences for the public sector should not have these limiting conditions placed on them by the legislation. That seems to us to represent a misconception of the nature of public broadcasting. Public broadcasting cannot be defined by the sort of criteria which the Bill puts on it. For example, the needs of the community which is served by an access radio station change from time to time. The needs cannot be spelt out in the terms of a licence or as conditions for the granting of a licence. For example this provision of the Bill is ridiculously inhibiting if a licence of a particular kind is granted and the needs of the community change. Accordingly I move: </para>

            <para>- I did not speak in the second reading debate, but I am pleased to see that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> in the other place and the Government have been prepared to listen to the representations that I and others have made about certain aspects of this legislation. I believe that we now have before us a Bill that is better than the one that was foreshadowed in the beginning. There is still one aspect of this Bill that I feel deserves further consideration. The Government may argue against any changes, perhaps because the Government will point out that this is only an interim measure and that a subsequent rewrite of the Broadcasting and Television Act will tidy up all aspects that are not dealt with in this Bill. Perhaps that is so. But this Bill does incorporate some major changes. It does change much of the distribution of powers within broadcasting. I feel that we must assume that this Bill will remain in force for a considerable time. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The clause with which we are now dealing proposes to give the Secretary of the Postal and Telecommunications Department power to plan the future of all broadcasting in Australia. These powers, I feel, are pretty wide. I would like to see any such planning subject to inquiry and report by the proposed Australian Broadcasting Tribunal. The Minister has already gone some of the way towards restricting the power of the Secretary of that Department. Paragraph 9 of proposed new section 1 11D provides: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Nothing in this section empowers the Secretary to make orders or give directions relating to matters of program content. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">This is one of the most significant changes envisaged by the Bill. It is significant as it relates to commercial broadcasting. It transfers fully the power of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board and the current functions that it exercises under section 16 ( 1 ) of the Act to the Secretary of the Postal and Telecommunications Department. I think there are some objections to this proposal. For instance, the transfer of the planning functions to that Department will move those functions from an independent statutory authority to a government department. That department must become responsive to the direction of its political head. Earlier in the day, the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> in summing up the second reading debate said that the aim of the legislation was to make broadcasting free from political interference. The clause that we are discussing proposes to move planning from a neutral environment to a politically influenced atmosphere. </para>

              <para>- It would take the honourable senator a tremendous amount of time because what the honourable senator is saying is not correct. It is obvious that the honourable senator has not read the Bill as closely as a senator who has led for the Opposition is this debate and has moved amendments to the Bill should have done. I would like to see words added to this clause which will mean that we will have an inquiry into any plans that are developed by the Postal and Telecommunications Department. If this were done it would mean that the Department and the Minister would be required to reveal to the Broadcasting Tribunal proposed plans. The Minister would be required to withhold action until the Tribunal had held an inquiry at which all parties, the public and commercial broadcasters as well as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, could attend and express their views. He also would have to hold any action until the Tribunal had made a report on the desirability of the plans, and if he did not do so he would be acting in the face of a comprehensive report compiled by that eminent body. </para>

          <para>There is some precedent for this in the area of the protection of Australian industry. Before the Government can grant protection to an Australian industry it must commission an inquiry and a report by the Industries Assistance Commission. Of course, the Government is not bound to follow the recommendations of the IAC, but it rarely departs from them because it knows that the IAC report represents the result of a quite thorough study of the needs of the industry concerned. We should not assume that this Bill is merely an interim measure, and I ask the Minister for Education whether he can envisage when alterations to this legislation will be introduced. I would like to hear his attitude to amending proposed new sub-section 111 C(l)(a), (b)in the Broadcasting and Television Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976 to provide for wording such as being plans from time to time approved by the Minister after inquiry and report by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal &#39;. </para>

            <para>- I will refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Townley</inline> &#39;s comments to the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> so that they will be kept in mind. I make only the following brief comments. It ought to be understood that the existing Act does not require the Australian Broadcasting Control Board or the Minister to publish plans prepared by the Board, so today the Minister makes his plans and there is no question of publication. On the other hand, this Bill says that the secretary shall consult with the Broadcasting Council which is made up of the whole industry and that provision goes a long way towards meeting what the honourable senator is talking about. Until the Broadcasting Council is established, the Minister is required to consult with representatives of radio and television stations. Equally, the Green report suggests that major planning proposals should be the subject of so-called Green Papers. I want to make it clear that we would not want to transfer all the decision making for the whole of the broadcasting and television industry to a statutory body, however good or objective that body is. After all, the fundamental situation is that in the end the planning, the essential decision making, for the structure of broadcasting and television in Australia must reside in this Parliament, and it would be wrong if that were not so. There are 2 quite separate situations. One is the political intervention in programming, which ought to be anathema to government, and the other is the absolute responsibility of a government for the structure and mechanism of broadcasting and television. However, I will take the suggestion aboard. </para>

          <para class="block">The Opposition&#39;s dissatisfaction with this provision in the Bill is simply that it allows the Minister to establish a Broadcasting Council by regulation. There is no guarantee, except for some talk, that the Broadcasting Council will be established. In abolishing the Australian Broadcasting Control Board the Government is destroying a body which exercised a number of functions. Part of its functions will be taken over by the Broadcasting Tribunal and part of its functions- the technical functions- will be taken over by the Department of Post and Telecommunications. But the part of its functions which deal with administration of broadcasting standards and so on will not be transferred, and there will be a vacuum in that area. It is assumed, one gathers, that the Broadcasting Council when it is appointed by regulation under this Bill will take over that function. We do not think it is good enough to have the Broadcasting Council appointed as a sort of advisory body by regulation. In his second reading speech the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> said that the Council will be largely comprised of representatives of the national and commercial public sectors of broadcasting. I would like to know what the expression &#39;largely&#39; means. I hope that it does mean that the Minister will accept some suggestions at least from the amendment which has been moved by the Opposition. </para>
          <para>What we have sought to do, consistent with the spirit and terminology of the Green report, is to establish the Broadcasting Council as a statutory authority which would be a significant body in the administration of Australian broadcasting and which would be representative of a wide range of interests. Of course, it has got to be representative of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the commercial sector, the public sector and so on. The Minister has announced already on television, I understand, that it will have 4 representatives from the commercial sectorcontrary to the 3 representatives suggested in the Green report. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> nods his head. The Minister has said that there will be 4 representatives from the commercial sector. </para>

If that is so, well and good. There are, of course, provisions for representation of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. There should be representation of the public sector. </para>

          <para>What we have done in the second part of this amendment is to suggest something which appears to be common ground to both Parties in all the rhetoric that has gone on about the broadcasting system; that is, to give some recognition of what might be regarded as the public interest. After all, we talk about public airways, a great public service in terms of the ABC, a lesser public service in terms of the commercial sector, and public radio. Here is a proposed Broadcasting Council with no representation of the listeners or viewers. The fact is that we should have consumer representation if we are going to talk seriously about the importance of national broadcasting and the importance of the views of consumers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> himself used the words &#39;public importance&#39; and the &#39;significance of the public&#39;. These sorts of expressions have been used in this debate about a dozen times. I am not singling out the Minister. The fact of the matter is that this Council is to have no consumer representation. We thought about the question of consumer representation. It is difficult to establish representative bodies. If the Government is concerned about qualitative considerations of broadcasting the sort of representative bodies which we have suggested as possible members of the Broadcasting Council include the Australian Film and Television School which was set up by a Liberal government under <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton,</inline> was proceeded with under the Whitlam Government and is being proceeded with now under the Fraser Government as a great national institution with the purpose of improving standards in film and television in this country. If the Broadcasting Council is to be established there should be a representative of the Australian Film and Television School on it, because that is what it is all about. </para>
          <para>Similarly, we have suggested that there should be a representative of the Australia Council because we spend $22m a year trying to improve cultural standards in this community. That money is spent through the Australia Council and it should be represented on a body such as this because, hopefully, broadcasting will become one of the important cultural mediums in this country. We have suggested also representation from the Australian Schools Commission because there has been a lot of pious cant about children&#39;s television emanating from people like me. The important thing is that we recognise that a body such as the Schools Commission should be represented on the Broadcasting Council because children&#39;s television and the sort of educational standards which one would hope that the broadcasting system will inject a little more of into the Australian community would be very important considerations. </para>
          <para>The Opposition has moved that the Broadcasting Council should be established in the way in which I have just suggested and that it should be a representative body to provide a national, representative and a community service. If we are going to talk about self-regulation, let us have the advice on self-regulation on a continuing basis from a council which represents consumer organisations or public instrumentalities which have an important vested interest in that body. The only thing I would say about our amendments relating to the Broadcasting Council is that they do make the scheme of the broadcasting structure complete, which the Bill does not do. The powers we have suggested for it are taken holus-bolus from the Government&#39;s own inquiry, the Green inquiry into broadcasting and television. We think they are reasonable and sensible powers for a body of this kind to have. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I wish to speak very briefly to this amendment. In general, I feel a great deal of sympathy with the view put by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> that these matters ought to be spelled out in the legislation. Of course, that has not happened. The Government has proposed that there should be matters which will be dealt with by regulation. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Button</inline> ignores is that, first, this is interim legislation which sets up a body at this stage. Secondly, it sets up a council which is essentially advisory in nature. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Nonetheless, I hope that account will be taken of the matters which have been put forward. I do not agree with some of the details of the amendment. I do not think that the point about consumer representation comes through in the Opposition&#39;s amendment. Reference is made to other organisations, officials and so on, which the Opposition wants included on the Council, but I do not think that the requirement for consumer representation is covered in the proposal. I do not propose to be petty about this because I believe it ought to be considered and I am sure that in determining the composition of this Council the Government will take it into account. </para>
          <para>I remind the Senate that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee of this Senate has constantly complained about major powers being left to regulation and not being set out in statutes. It is unfortunate that these powers and the existence of this Council are not provided for in the legislation. I rather hope that when the Government considers the next stage it will also consider the possibility of including those matters in the legislation, so that it will be known to the public and not have to be looked for in the regulations. Apart from that, I hope that the Government will consider some of the ideas which are spelled out in the amendment and will give further thought to those suggestions. </para>

Indeed, I am advised that the Minister for Post and Telecommunications <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Eric Robinson)</inline> is considering seriously the matter of consumer representation and has in mind a balance between national and commercial advertising, as well as the public. The Council is not a decision-making body. Its function is purely consultative and therefore it does not require to be a body corporate.

            <para>-The Opposition does not oppose these 3 Bills, which are being dealt with cognately. We draw attention to the fact that the rate of accumulation of long service leave as set out in the first Bill represents an improvement. Most of the matters in the Bill do represent an improvement and were supported by the previous Government. We regret that the rate of accumulation is not of the same high standard as that in 3 States, but I do not wish to refer to the details of this matter any further. The Bills were fully debated in the House of Representatives and people who are interested will be able to read the report of that debate in the House of Representatives <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> We do not oppose the Bills. </para>

            <para>- I commend the Government for introducing the Public Service Amendment Bill (No. 2) 1976, which relates to the setting up of the Northern Territory Public Service. As honourable senators know, there is to be a transfer of powers from the Commonwealth Government to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly on 1 January. Several statutory bodies, the police and various other departments, will be transferred as part of the initial transfer of powers. Several hundred Commonwealth public servants will be seconded to the Northern Territory Public Service. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This matter goes back to 1974 when the Commonwealth Parliament set up a Joint Committee on the Northern Territory. That Committee is to be commended for the work it did in producing its report on constitutional development in the Northern Territory. Since that date that report more or less has been the bible for developing the transfer of powers. In the first year after that the transfer was in the doldrums; very little was done in regard to the report. But in the last year in particular a considerable number of moves have been made. I commend the Minister for the Northern Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Evan</inline> Adermann, for his work in this field. Despite his responsibilities in this very busy year in the Federal Parliament, he has been to the Northern Territory no fewer than 20 times and has spent many weeks there. I think that would be a record for any Minister holding responsibility for the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>- That matter is to be worked out during the transfer of powers. The area of finance is being looked into. We saw the amendment to the Northern Territory Administration Act which set up the Executive and now we are seeing this legislation being passed in order to set up the Northern Territory Public Service. It seconds Commonwealth public servants to the Northern Territory Public Service. But in seconding the public servants to the Northern Territory Public Service there will be no loss of privileges and if they wish they will be able to go back into the Commonwealth Public Service. So they will not be left in the Northern Territory Public Service if they do not wish to stay there. </para>

          <para>In the last few months continuous talks have been going on between the Majority Leader and the Executive of the Northern Territory Public Service, the Minister for the Northern Territory and the Department of the Northern Territory and the various public service unions involved. One report from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Norman</inline> Campbell of the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association, indicated that the discussions went very well and the Assembly wants to do the right thing. There has been very good consultation by all. The public service unions are in agreement. Three to four weeks ago I had discussions with the Federal Executive of the ACOA in Darwin. All these members of the Federal Executive from the various States of Australia were there and indicated that as far as they could see the problems that had appeared had been ironed out and apparently the move will be quite successful. I commend the Government for this initiative that it has taken- a very firm initiative- to ensure in this coming year that after the transfer of powers we will have a strong Northern Territory Public Service. </para>

            </talker>
            <para>- I rise in this debate to speak briefly on the Public Service Amendment Bill (No. 2). As has been explained by the Minister for Veterans&#39; Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Durack)</inline> the purpose of the Bill is to facilitate the transfer of officers from the Australian Public Service to the Northern Territory Public Service. This is a most important step for the Northern Territory, following as it does the decision of the Labor Government to establish a fully elected Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and to arrange for the transfer of powers to give the people of the Northern Territory greater involvement in the decision-making process. Like my fellow senator from the Northern Territory I welcome this legislation, but I have some reservations which I shall come to in a moment. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I agree with the Minister that the Northern Territory should be given greater control and that arrangements should be made for the governance of the Northern Territory to reflect the views and the aspirations, not only of some of the local communities but the majority of the people in the local communities and of all communities, not only Darwin itself. The Minister in his statement said that he was looking for a viable and efficient Public Service. I think we ought to go one stage further than this; we want something better than a service which is viable and efficient. The setting up of a new Public Service is a most exciting, challenging situation. I think those people who have served in the Public Service would agree that the opportunities are there for people to enter and to give us the best possible Public Service. I agree with the Minister that one of the jobs we have in front of us is to protect the rights of those officers who are moving to the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>The reservations I have about the Bill relate in the main to the haste- I would call it unseemly haste, although one of the newspaper reports mentioned &#39;irresponsible haste&#39;- with which the Bill is being introduced and things are being implemented. Only recently we had a situation here in which a Bill was brought in and we had to deal with it late at night. It came back later to be corrected. The situation where a Bill has to be corrected is deplorable, but when we are dealing with people&#39;s lives it is just not a tenable situation. We cannot afford the luxury of what we might call experimentation when we are dealing with people&#39;s lives. My information is that the people of the Territory are particularly disturbed about the haste, especially those who are at the moment based in Brisbane. </para>
          <para>Let us look briefly at the situation in the Northern Territory. Approximately one-third of the officers involved are on leave at present. This is fairly standard at this time of the year. People move out before the wet. The Northern Territory Commissioner has only just been appointed. He arrived in the Territory this week and he has yet to prepare his determinations. It is fairly obvious that he will not do this in two or three days. This has resulted in a feeling of uncertainty among public servants in the Territory. From my understanding, no one has yet been advised whether he is to be transferred. So we have this feeling of uncertainty. People are being asked to make decisions before Christmas. Christmas is about 2 weeks away. With the Public Service grinding to a halt, as it does before the Christmas season, I think it is fair to say that this is unseemly or irresponsible haste. </para>
          <para>I have always agreed with the dictum that justice must not only be done but must be seen to be done. I think we could transfer this to the present situation and say that arrangements must be not only fair and reasonable but must be seen to be so. I think it must be agreed that the Minister and the Department are not giving people any time to make decisions which have to be made in the best interests of all concerned. It is fair to say that people have some fear of change, particularly abrupt change. They need time to adjust and to adapt. The decisions which people are being asked to make involve a career for the rest of their working life. The decisions involve the education of children. With examinations just over and people waiting for results, they are not sure what they will do next year. With the state of the economy and unemployment they are not sure whether the children will be employed. So they are reluctant to break away and move to a new area when so many factors must be considered. </para>
          <para>I do not think the department or the Minister have considered the social situation of the families concerned in asking them to make a decision of this social magnitude so quickly. There is no reason why the legislation should not be deferred and not implemented for 6 months. As my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> said, secondments could be made. Temporary appointments could be made. The executive to work the Legislative Assembly could be set up. I agree entirely that this is most important and that it should be done, but it could be done other than by permanent appointments. The branches and the boards that have been transferred could continue operating as they are operating at present. Things could go ahead normally. It would give people an opportunity to look further at the Northern Territory ordinance which sets up the Public Service. </para>
          <para>The comments that have been made to me on the legislation are that it has some very rough edges, that it has a few omissions. There have been discussions with the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations and the Administrative and Clerical Officers Association. I commend the Minister for having these discussions. As a result there have been some improvements, but the legislation could still do with further improvements. I wonder whether the Minister realises that the setting up of a new department such as this is a wonderful opportunity for the Public Service. It does not happen very often. I think that to rush into it, without taking the opportunity to look at the position in the States and to get the best possible situation, is most unreasonable and unwise. From personal experience of a similar situation, I know that the opportunity to correct errors that other people have made, the historical errors which we cannot correct in a State situation, is one that should not be overlooked. I commend to the Minister very sincerely the suggestion that we should think of not implementing the legislation for 6 months. </para>
          <para>There is a complicating factor. It has been mentioned in the Press. The Public Service Board in the Territory is determined that all officers in Darwin will lose one week&#39;s tropical leave and that leave fares will be paid only to Adelaide, not to any other capital city. The Minister may know that a protest meeting is being held in Darwin more or less at present to discuss this matter. This is one more factor to suggest that it is not the right climate for setting up a service which will last us into and during statehood. </para>
          <para>There are a couple of other comments which I wish to make as an ex-public servant. I am concerned about the Minister&#39;s powers to override the Public Service Act and to transfer officers against will. I am not suggesting that it will happen, but the power is there. This is something which we will not support. I think that most of us on this side of the chamber would not be happy about it. As the Senate would know, the Act enables officers to decline transfer. This right must be maintained. A situation where the only option to transfer is resignation, is not acceptable in a career Public Service. Despite what my colleague said, there is no guarantee of acceptance back into the Australian Public Service. I have mentioned this matter here previously. If we are to have a good, strong Public Service, people must be able to move back. My view is that there should be free movement at all times. Certainly at the moment there appears to be no such opportunity. I am a huie disturbed that the honourable member for Canberra <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Haslem)</inline> said that he would be watching the Northern Territory to see what happens in the Australian Capital Territory. I certainly do not want to see the Northern Territory used as some sort of guinea pig to try out what is going to happen in Canberra. We have had enough experimentation. My discussions with the Public Service unions have led me to believe that they are very frightened that the cream of the Public Service at the present time is not prepared to stay in Darwin and that they are frightened that good men will not be attracted if the legislation goes through at the speed at which it is being proposed. The honourable member for Canberra said in the other place on 2 December: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>There is some feeling, albeit a psychological or emotional feeling, that if they join another body which does not have quite the stature of the national Public Service, somehow or other they will be second grade citizens in the national capital. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That would apply in the Northern Territory. I repeat that the Northern Territory Public Service wants the best and needs the best at this exciting and challenging point in time. I ask the Minister to consider delaying the implementation of the legislation and, secondly, to remove the uncertainty which exists at the present time by saying what is proposed and then to have full and frank discussions with the Council of Australian Government Employee Organisations. I commend the Minister for starting these discussions. But let us see them develop so that we will have the best possible Public Service. </para>

            <para>- in reply-I thank the Senate for its support of this measure. Briefly, in response to the points that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> has made, the Government has decided that this transfer will be implemented on, I think, 1 January of next year. That timetable has been fixed. Discussions have taken place on that basis. The Government sees no reason for any delay in that regard. Regarding some of the concerns which have been expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> and others, I point out to him that the Bill contains within it a provision enabling officers who have been transferred to have the right to apply for positions in the Commonwealth Public Service. Rights to apply for promotion also will be available to them. That is not to say that they will be guaranteed to get a position, but they will have their rights the same as they have now. There is certainly a lot of precedents for this being done. It was done last year by the Labor Government when it set up the Australian Telecommunications Commission and the Australian Postal Commission. I think almost half its members were public servants who transferred to those new Commissions under provisions broadly similar to the ones in this legislation. Having said that, I am pleased that this legislation is to have a speedy passage. </para>

            <para>- The purpose of these Bills, which are concerned with the apple and pear industry, is to provide for the imposition and collection of levies on the production and sale in Australia of apples and pears and a charge on apples and pears exported from Australia. The need for these new measures arises because of the steep decline that has taken place in the export trade, particularly in respect of apples. The Senate has discussed this matter from time to time. The measures are necessary also because the Apple and Pear Corporation is lacking the necessary financial resources to carry out its functions adequately, particularly those functions related to the development and promotion of the Australian domestic market. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition supports the legislation. It recognised the problems faced by the industry when the then Government brought about a reorganisation of the industry in 1974 and reformed the Apple and Pear Board into the Apple and Pear Corporation. Of course, more changes are necessary if we are to overcome the problems that have been referred to for many years in the Senate and in the House of Representatives, particularly by the Tasmanian representatives who have spoken about the problems of the industry. </para>
          <para>It would appear that nothing has happened to bring about any substantial change in the nature of the industry or in creating conditions of stability. It is a matter of regret that the Government has continued to fail to take the restructuring action essential for the industry. The need to restructure the industry and to create some stability cannot be denied as the present methods of marketing and promotion have proven to be unsuccessful. </para>
          <para>The record of the industry indicates its poor state of health over the past few years. This position is unlikely to improve in the future. An Industries Assistance Commission report has been unable to predict accurately the future of the apple and pear industry as it relates to the export market. With the permission of the Senate I would like to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> rather than read to the Senate, the comments of the IAC in this respect. </para>

            <para>While it is not possible to predict accurately the long term competitive position or trends in freight and exchange rates, it does not seem likely that the adverse circumstances of the recent past will be reversed. Average returns from apple exports to Europe will continue to be subject to considerable marketing pressure and marketing disadvantages and the Commission does not see any prospect for their improvement. Although the situation facing pear exports to Europe is somewhat better than for apples (since controlled atmosphere cool storage is not used commonly for pears and Southern Hemisphere shipments from competing suppliers have not increased to the same extent) they too face the same freight and exchange rate problems. There is no evidence to suggest that, over the longer term, returns from pear exports to Europe will increase in real terms. A somewhat similar situation exists in respect of the North American market. The main consideration is Australia&#39;s competitive disadvantage, relative to South Africa, as a supplier of fresh apples and pears to Northern Hemisphere markets. Freight rates are considerably lower from South Africa to Europe than they are from Australia to Europe. South Africa also has a slight advantage in regard to freight to North America. In addition South Africa enjoys lower production costs than Australia, particularly in regard to wage rates. Production in South </para>
            <para class="block">Africa is likely to continue to expand from increased plantings which are taking place in response to the generally high profitability of apple and pear growing. The long term prospect is, therefore, for a contraction rather than an expansion of Australia&#39;s Northern Hemisphere markets. </para>
            <para>Alternative markets to those in Europe have been sought in North America, the Middle East and South East Asia. With the exception of increases in exports of pears to North America in the late 1960s and early 1970s and very recently of some apples to the Middle East, little success has been achieved. The main immediate restriction on the development of these markets appears to be the limited availability of suitable varieties of apples such as the Red Delicious variety for South East Asian markets. However, the availability of locally grown low cost tropical fruits is likely to limit the development of markets in South East Asia for expensive imported temperate fruit. Furthermore, the requirement in these markets is for shipments to be spread over a longer period than is the case for Northern Hemisphere off-season markets thus placing additional strain on storage facilities and increasing marketing costs. To the present time, however, prices received for exports to the area have been acceptable to the Australian industry. </para>
            <para>The major competition for Australia in South East Asia is from New Zealand and South African fruit. Hong Kong is South Africa&#39;s major market outside Europe and North America and, in 1973. South African supplies accounted for 22 per cent of total Southern Hemisphere supplies to this market, both for apples and for pears. Australia and New Zealand held 55 per cent and 23 per cent respectively of the apple market, while Australia accounted for almost all pear imports other than those from South Africa. In some South East Asian and Middle Eastern countries, South Africa at present faces trade embargoes which result in the apple market being shared by Australia and New Zealand while Australia alone supplies pears. Singapore is a case in point. </para>
            <para>Australia and New Zealand have slight advantages over South Africa in freight rates to most South East Asian and Middle Eastern markets as opposed to large disadvantages in freight rates to Europe. South Africa&#39;s production of Starking (a Red Delicious variety) is expected to increase following heavy plantings. There would, therefore, be potential for South Africa to expand into the South East Asian market although, at the present time, returns from Europe and North America appear to be more attractive for South African exports than are returns from other markets. </para>
            <para>New Zealand does not export significant quantities of pears but is an important competitor with Australia in relation to apples. New Zealand faces similar problems to Australia in Europe and is also attempting to diversify into other markets, particularly the Middle East and South East Asia. Planting trends indicate that a considerable expansion in New Zealand shipments of Red Delicious apples can be expected. </para>
            <para>The Commission considers that in attempting to maintain or expand exports of apples to South East Asia and the Middle East, Australia will meet active competition from New Zealand. Over the longer term, comparative cost movements and a declining market in Europe (where South Africa faces considerable competition from Argentina), are considered likely to produce an expansion of South African interest in the areas. The future prospects for apple and pear exports to these markets must, therefore, be viewed with considerable caution. </para>
            <para>The Commission&#39;s assessment of the domestic market for fresh apples and pears does not suggest any scope for significant expansion in consumption. However, with some relaxation of interstate quarantine controls there may be opportunities for certain areas to expand production while other areas reduce. </para>
            <para>The prospects for apple processing suggest lower levels of production in the immediate future than existed before the withdrawal of the sales tax concession on soft drinks, but the long term outlook is for continued growth. However the processing industry is at present, and is likely to remain, an outlet for lower quality fruit and its value to growers is as an offset to production costs rather than as a profitable outlet in its own right. </para>

              <para>- Thank you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> One other matter worth noting was the insistence of the old Apple and Pear Board upon forward selling terms when competitors were offering alternative terms which were more acceptable to the importers. This, of course, is one example of the difficulties which must be overcome. </para>

          <para>The Opposition is pleased to note that the Apple and Pear Growers Association has proposed, and the Government has accepted, that it is in the interests of an equity to all growers that they contribute financially to assist the activities of the Corporation. It is quite unreasonable that growers who are favourably placed to domestic markets receive the benefits of high domestic prices and are not required to bear some part of the burden of the development and promotion of the industry from which they derive their livelihood. Of course, honourable senators from those States where the fruit industry is in dire circumstances appreciate the need for equity in that area. The Minister stated in his second reading speech: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>These Bills are designed to ensure a firm financial base for the Apple and Pear Corporation, which has a vital role to play in assisting the industry in the face of problems which nave developed in recent years, resulting in a severe cut-back in the volume of apples moving to export markets. The additional funds to be placed at the disposal of the Corporation from the new levy arrangements will enable it to make a more positive contribution towards market development, particularly on the domestic scene. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Of course we agree with the views of the Minister as stated in his second reading speech, because obviously if we have difficulties in our export market then much more time and energy need to be applied to the promotion of sales on the domestic market. In view of the reasons for the cutback in the volume of apples moving to the export markets, we are entitled to ask: What does the Minister propose should be done to improve the situation? He does not seem to know, because his speech seems to indicate that he is prepared to abdicate his responsibility and delegate it to the Apple and Pear Corporation. </para>
          <para>As we well know, on the domestic side the picture is not much better. I did speak recently on the introduction of the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. Again I emphasise that I make no comment about the equity of that scheme,  other than to say that we perhaps did not take into consideration the influences which the marketing of Tamanian apples may have on other sectors of the industry on the mainland. The Apple and Pear Corporation will be placed in a difficult position when the Government makes a decision relating to a specific freight matter. The Corporation will have to take into consideration that the Government is giving one sort of assistance that will affect the industry in another place. So the Corporation cannot be expected to plan for the industry unless the Government in fact sets the guidelines for it and gives it not only the financial assistance but also the legislative authority. It seems to me that some examination needs to be made of the final statement by the Minister in his second reading speech on the Apple and Pear Levy Bill 1976. The Minister makes some of the most disturbing admissions which confirms that he is completely unaware of the direction in which the industry is heading, the policies needed to arrest the industry&#39;s declining fortunes or the way in which such policies can be put into operation. The Minister says: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>I am confident that there is a place in Australian horticulture for a viable apple and pear industry, and I believe that the Corporation will become more significant as a focal point for the industry&#39;s re-organisation and adjustment. It is imperative, however, that its financial support be assured if it is to fulfil its objective. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That seems to be a little insincere because really it does not take into consideration the nature of the problem for the apple and pear growers in the Huon district in Tasmania, or those at Stanthorpe in Queensland or at Manjimup in Western Australia. They have waited for a full year for some legislation and policy considerations to overcome the decline which has taken place steadily over the years and which has manifested itself even more markedly in 1976. 1 do not think it is any wonder that more and more growers, as is indicated in the publications of the grower organisations, are becoming impatient and no longer have trust in the Government. Of course one can understand this when so many sectors of agriculture look at the statements that are made by the Minister from time to time. We are waiting for some new policies, new vigour and some degree of stability to come into the various sectors of agriculture. </para>
          <para>The Government has had before it since 16 January this year 2 Industries Assistance Commission reports dealing with the fruit industry and its reconstruction, but it has not taken any steps to implement or adopt the reports or to amend them, or to adjust to the problem facing the industry. These reports, entitled &#39;Fruitgrowing Part A&#39; and &#39;Fruitgrowing Reconstruction and Fruitgrowing Part B: Apples and Pears&#39;, have made very worthy suggestions to improve the well-being of fruitgrowers and their families. At times I wonder whether the Minister has any knowledge of the subject at all. If he did, he would not make the wild promises he has made at election times and repeat <inline font-style="italic">ad nauseum</inline> some of the statements he makes about beef contracts, nor would he deliver a second reading speech on the apple and pear industry without giving some indication of the matters of concern to the industry and a solution to the problems facing the industry. In his second reading speech he failed to deal adequately with the problems facing the industry. Perhaps a quick refresher course on the critical position faced by the industry would serve the Minister well. </para>
          <para>The Australian Labor Party believes that alternative measures designed to facilitate adjustment could provide more help to fruitgrowers, to their families and to the communities which depend on them, at much less cost to the nation. Such measures could also benefit those who remain in fruit growing and facilitate their adjustment to subsequent change. It is up to the Government to take initiatives in this area. The Minister and the Corporation should be aware that fruit growing is concentrated in specific areas. Any decline or downturn has a tremendous social implication in those regions which are mainly export orientated. Other regions rely primarily on domestic market outlets. Of course, it is clear that there is a relationship between what happens in one section and in the other section. Although many problems facing fruitgrowers have their origins m the industry&#39;s dependence on export markets, welfare problems and reconstruction needs are not restricted to the export sector. </para>
          <para>The Corporation should look to the following matters. It should give attention to interstate quarantine regulations and other restrictions on interstate trade with a view to obtaining agreement with appropriate States to eliminate unnecessary restraints on trade. It should look at liberalising its restrictions on methods of sale in export markets, other than Europe and North America. It should take some initiative, perhaps, as I have seen South Africa do in recent times in relation to markets in the Far East. A maximum exporter&#39;s commission should be fixed in terms of a percentage of the f.o.b. value and there should be a liberalising of the requirements for the issue of new exporters licences. Many representations have been made to me by those who want to participate in a more liberalised scheme. I suggest that the Minister examine the recommendations in the Industries Assistance Commission report on Fruitgrowing Reconstruction and give serious consideration to introducing the structural adjustment measures mentioned there. With the assistance of the Senate, and having regard to the pressures under which the Senate is operating at the moment, I ask for leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that section of the IAC report titled <inline font-style="italic">Assistance for Reconstruction of Fruit Growing Industries.</inline> We are prepared to consider a more fundamental approach to the fruitgrowing industry, but in the meantime, we will give our support and assent to these 4 Bills. </para>

            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In the previous section the need for measures which encourage and facilitate adjustment in fruitgrowing industries was outlined. If market trends continue and (as the Commission recommends) product-based price support for fruit is phased out, industry and region specific reconstruction measures would be required to supplement those recommended for rural industries generally. Acceptable levels of government price support would only delay these inevitable changes. </para>
          <para>The Commission considers the provision of adjustment assistance to be important for all rural industries and in the separate report on Rural Reconstruction it has recommended that: 1 financial assistance in the form of credit be made available to eligible farmers in all rural industries who are assessed to be &#39;viable&#39; in the long term; 2 household support for periods up to twelve months be provided for farmers with no long term prospect in agriculture; 3 increased rehabilitation assistance be made available; and 4 an independent national authority be established which would co-ordinate, monitor, and evaluate rural adjustment policy and initiatives. </para>
          <para>In that report it has also been suggested that there could be circumstances in which particular adjustment problems should be tackled by regional bodies. Although the four general measures outlined above are essential for the efficient and equitable on-farm adjustment of the fruitgrowing industries, the Commission considers that they do not fully cover the specific needs of many fruitgrowing regions and industries. </para>
          <para>The Commission recommends, therefore, the introduction of additional measures for prescribed fruitgrowing industries or regions. These are designed to encourage adjustment and offset as much as possible the personal hardship which otherwise would accompany the inevitable changes facing parts of these industries. </para>
          <para>The recommended additional measures are: 1 establishment of ARAs in specified fruitgrowing regions; 2 establishment of an adjustment counselling service to operate in these areas; and 3 provision of adjustment finance on concessional terms, for use either within agriculture or where appropriate outside it, in cases where commercial credit cannot be obtained but the loan can be serviced under the concessional arrangements. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support these Bills which carry out the recommendations of the Australian Apple and Pear Growers Association. The recommendations put forward by the apple and pear growers prove once again that they are prepared to support their own industry. They prove, again, the independence of the man on the land. Even though apple and pear growers who export are going through perhaps the most difficult times the industry has experienced, they are prepared to pay their share, in the interests of equity. They have recommended that they share the cost to enable the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation, which is lacking in finance, to have the financial resources necesssary to promote and develop the potentially larger domestic market. The levy, in line with the apple and pear growers&#39; recommendation, is to be based on the quantity of fruit marketed both in Australia and overseas. </para>

          <para>During last week we heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh,</inline> in his usually destructive way, that devaluation will not help the fruit industry, the dairy industry, or the beef industry. I guess the honourable senator does not know much about the economics of our export industries, so perhaps he can be forgiven for such stupid statements. But many people, including 2 of his colleagues, disagree with him. They are members of the Senate Select Committee on Mount Lyell Mining Operations of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> is  Chairman.  They agree that in that export industry alone the general devaluation will save the jobs of those 400 men who have been threatened with dismissal. Regarding the rural industry I shall quote some remarks to show the feelings of men associated with that industry. The  chairman  of the Tasmanian State Fruit Board, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr R.</inline> B. Walker, stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It will put the apple industry back in business. It is a great decision and will give us the opportunity to compete for markets especially on the continent and in the Persian Gulf. </para>

          <para class="block">The State  President  of the Tasmanian Farmers Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stewart</inline> Ferguson, claimed it was a shot in the arm for farming as a whole. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr John</inline> Bennett,  Chairman  of the Dairy Farmers Federation, was delighted with the decision and he said: </para>

            <para>It is something in the order of what is needed to help dairy farmers. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Similar statements have come from all round the industry. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Max</inline> Nicholson on behalf of the meat industry said that 45 per cent of the locally </para>
          <para class="block">E reduced meat was exported and now there was better opportunity to get into overseas markets. So it would appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> has a fair bit of learning to do about our export markets. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> was not quite so dogmatic about the effects of devaluation. He claimed there was just no certainty that the market situation could be expected to improve following devaluation. He claimed it was not the price of the article but access to the markets that represented the greatest threat to the apple industry. There would not be one apple grower who would say that given equal competition and favourable financial terms the growers could not win those markets. We have quality fruit. All we need is favourable financial terms, and this devaluation must help. </para>
          <para>There are extraordinarily uninformed comments coming from honourable senators opposite. The depressed rural sector has been given the biggest boost in years and it is jubilant but because honourable senators opposite cannot bear to see this sector joyous even at this time of the year they have to pour cold water on its enthusiasm and cry doom. We heard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> objecting to the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme, saying that it would ruin the mainland markets. Of course the mainland States will have to look to their laurels regarding the quality of their fruit because for the first time Tasmanian growers are now on an equal footing and can transport their fruit to the larger cities at the same cost as growers situated at an equal distance from that lucrative market. As I say, it will make the mainland growers strive to improve the quality of their fruit because the quality of Tasmanian fruit is world famous. </para>

The IAC report recommended the phasing out of the apple and pear industry. It recommended that &#39;the apple and pear statutory scheme be terminated after an interim 2-year period&#39;. It went on to suggest that the scheme be extended to cover only the 1976 and 1977 crops. This Government will not be party to the termination of the scheme. The Government has confidence in the industry, as have the growers. Just because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> says that a Labor government would terminate the industry, there is no reason for this Government to agree with that. </para>

          <para>These Bills provide for a levy not exceeding 6c per box for apples and pears for either the home market or the export market sold fresh, not exceeding 60c per tonne for juice fruit and not exceeding $1.40 per tonne for processing fruit, the only exemption being for the canning fruit industry which already pays a levy under the terms of its Act. However, while the Bills provide for these maximum figures, in the regulations accompanying the Act the Government is entitled to set the figures, following consideration of the recommendations of the Apple and Pear Growers Association. The Government has accepted these latest recommendations and they will apply from 1 January next year. They are: 5c per box for fresh apples and pears for both the Australian market and the export market, 50c per tonne for juice fruit and $ 1 per tonne for processing fruit. So that administrative costs will be kept to a minimum, the collecting points of the levy will be left to the selling agents, processors, quality purchasers and exporters. </para>
          <para>Certain exemptions also will minimise these costs. These exemptions are for fruit sold direct by growers from orchards or by the roadside. That custom is well appreciated by all Tasmanians. Many people go for a picnic in the beautiful Huon Valley and buy cases of tree ripened apples. Another exemption is for juicing or processing that is carried out by the grower himself, as long as the quantity does not exceed 500 boxes a year. The levy thus paid is expected to provide the Corporation with an income of $850,000 a year, compared with its present income of $250,000. It will enable the Corporation to carry out the marketing developments that the industry considers necessary. This Bill typifies the desire of the apple and pear growers for independence, and I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I enter this debate very briefly and in a very impartial way. I have no interest here; so I can speak as an Australian as well as a Tasmanian. I rejected the invitation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> to respond to her reference to me, because I find myself in something of a dilemma when my colleague from Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges,</inline> is defending Queensland and I as a Tasmanian would be expected to defend Tasmania. If Tasmanians can export fruit to Queensland and market it there, they are entitled to do so. I say that with great respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> The quality of Tasmanian fruit is well known. I think it would do the Queensland Premier a great deal of good if he stopped eating Queensland apples and ate some Tasmanian apples. He might then be a much more amenable fellow than he is at the moment. </para>

          <para>The other point I want to emphasise is that this is the first time these Bills have come before the Senate over the years that I have been here when there has not been a slanging match. I can recall on several occasions crossing swords with my good friend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who is glaring at me from over there even now. Over the 3 years of Labor government the same broad approach to the industry was taken as was taken before. </para>

              <para>-I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> not to provoke me. This Government is continuing the support schemes that were carried on by the Labor Government. I believe that all of us here, perhaps with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> would agree that the industry needs that support. One thing that ought to be said not only about apple growers in Tasmania but also farmers generally is that they do not seek subsidies all the time. The Australian farmer is not a grabber after subsidies. What he is entitled to and what he mainly wants is assistance when his industry is in difficulties. That is being recognised more and more by all governments as time goes by. All rural industries will benefit by that more sensible approach of assisting them by means of support schemes when that assistance is needed. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>But the built in subsidy system is not wanted by the Australian farmers. They do not want it because of the inequity of it. They do not want it because inefficient farmers are helped at the expense of efficient farmers; and the great majority of farmers are efficient. They object, and I believe rightly so, at public moneys being paid out to those who are not prepared to keep themselves abreast of modern farming technology. So we ought not to make any apologies for the assistance that is provided, especially to an industry such as the apple and pear industry in southern Tasmania. </para>
          <para>There can be no question that the industry has declined in recent years. I believe that every effort has been made by both Federal and State governments to arrest that decline and, particularly in the last two or three years, to attempt to diversify the form in which the products of the industry are offered for sale, rather than simply selling them on the market as fresh products. The legislation which finances the activities of the Corporation obviously must be supported by the whole of the Parliament. Even though a State election is to be held in Tasmania tomorrow, I repeat that I am pleased that, at least till now, the contributions made in the debate have been devoid of politicking for the State election tomorrow. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> speaks in the debate, I hope that his contribution will be in the same vain. </para>

            <para>-We are debating 3 Bills which deal with the apple and pear industry of Australia. It is notable that when it is dealing with a primary industry such as this the Government expects that the industry will finance itself, unlike other industries such as the tertiary industries and the city industries of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> &#39;s contribution to the debate was in line with the contribution he made when he was Minister for Agriculture under the Labor Government.  His  contribution consisted of generalities and it was completely superficial. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>We have before us the second annual report on this industry presented by the Australian Apple and Pear Corporation. I do not give the Corporation full responsibility for the poor results, but it reports the poorest results ever achieved in the industry. It states that the quality of the fruit that has been offered on the market was lower than was desired, the quantity has been reduced and the return has been most disappointing. Those people who have confidence in a government corporation seeking out new markets and improving realisations should not count me among their number. </para>
          <para>The export industry for apples is doomed by the increasing freight rates from Tasmania to </para>
          <para class="block">Europe, which this year are threatened to increase by $1 a case to the inordinate cost of about $5.50 or $5.40 a case, whereas the cost should be no more than $2 a case. If the transport component of this industry, which has been destroyed by the inflation which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> brought upon the country in unique measures, were assisted as are other transport industries, such as the Canberra bus service which receives a subsidy of $5m, the metropolitan bus service of Tasmania which receives a subsidy of $5.5m and train services throughout the country which cost millions of dollars, the industry, with the assistance of the devaluation which was announced the other day, would be on the move again. Let me read just one section from the annual report of the Corporation: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A major influence on the level of freight rates is the high cost of loading and the slow turn round of ships at Australian ports. Hobart, for example, is regarded as the most costly fruit loading port in the world . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That is the key port from which is exported the majority of the produce of this unique export apple industry that has been maintained now for some 80 years or more. It has become the most costly fruit loading port in the world. </para>
          <para>I rose to point out one or two facts. One is the advantage accruing to the industry for the purpose of interstate trade from the Tasmanian freight equalisation scheme. That, of course, should be recognised by mainland growers as a necessary concomitant of the destruction of our export trade. On looking at the figures we see that New South Wales in 1966 produced 2.9 million cases of apples and in 1 976 she produced 3.8 million cases. In 1966 she produced 0.57 million cases of pears; in 1976 she produced 1.2 million cases. Tasmania, on the other hand, instead of increasing production in each of those respects as was the case in New South Wales, reduced production from 8.3 million cases of apples in 1966 down to 4.6 million cases in 1976. In pears the reduction has been much more calamitious: In 1966 she produced 650 000 cases and in 1976 she produced 137 000 cases. </para>
          <para>It is therefore necessary for mainland growers now to accept their proportion of this levy because they will be maintaining their industry by access to the metropolitan markets, chiefly of Melbourne and Sydney and, to a lesser extent, Brisbane. But, as this report points out, it is of vital interest to all mainland growers that they realise that any support for the export industry, although directly and specifically it is received by </para>
          <para>Tasmanian and to some extent Western Australian growers, is nevertheless an assistance to the industry on behalf of all growers. </para>
          <para>I come now to the real point of my rising. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> was quite wrong in saying that the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> has done nothing this year. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> ought to know that the maximum price for stabilisation was increased above the $1 a case that was recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission to $2 a case and that this has been adjusted by 53c on the basis of an adjustment by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. But, when the IAC recommends that our apple and pear industry should fall into the vulturous hands of social welfare or the &#39;people oriented assistance approach&#39;, I am completely in agreement with the Corporation when it states that that would be essentially a negative and ultimately more costly method of sustaining people in this industry than would be real industry support. Referring to the product of the industry, the report states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Virtually all of this would be lost, at a great deal of cost to the taxpayer, under the IAC recommendations. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Therefore, I want the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> to hear me say that at the beginning of next year I shall be moving very strongly for an acceptance by the Government of the Corporation&#39;s proposals for the stabilisation of this industry. It is significant that neither of the socialist speakers on the other side from the Australian Labor Party referred to the proposals of the Corporation the body that was specifically designed to advance the industry and which can be presumed to have a much more intimate knowledge of the industry&#39;s requirements than the IAC which is a remote, academic, bureaucratic object that I do not believe, from reading its reports, has the slightest understanding of the verities of the fresh fruit exporting industry. I refer briefly to what the Corporation has asked the Government to do; that is, not to accept the welfare proposals of the IAC but to continue the new stabilisation scheme for 3 years-1977, 1978 and 1979. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> said- I made a note in passing- that I supported the scheme. I was in Cabinet when the scheme was introduced and gave the strongest assistance to the Minister for Primary Industry of the day. That scheme was produced over a period of years by the former honourable memer for Franklin, C. W. J. Falkinder, me and other Tasmanians who laboured for five or seven years to get it accepted. We want it to continue until at least 1979 and not to be destroyed as is the policy of Labor. We want the maximum support under the scheme to be $3 a case and we want it to be indexed. If defence force retirement benefits payments for superannuants from the defence forces can be indexed in full, the cost to a producer can be indexed in full for 1978 and 1979 to take account of inflation. Then the maximum quantities could be tapered off. If we have not obtained access to Japan for our apples we will be in a hopeless plight with regard to maintaining this export industry. </para>
          <para>The returns from Europe, Singapore, America and all the other export markets this year are most disappointing. We have to reach a basis where, for the moment, the industry will be sustained so that it will survive the destructive high rising costs, particularly in Hobart, the costliest fruit loading port in the world. If we make the industry survive by entering the Japanese market, this country will need to double the quantity of apples and pears that it is producing now. I was at a luncheon the other day where about 12 important growers were assembled. At least half of them were planting out new acreages of apples. They had done this last year. So do not let the dismal Jimmies on the other side think that those who have lived on apples and know the trade are prepared to accept their doom. </para>

            <para>- in reply- This legislation is not opposed. As is stated in the second reading speech this combination of Bills is designed to ensure a firm financial basis for the Apple and Pear Corporation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> and other honourable senators have said, the Corporation has a vital role to play in assisting the industry to overcome the problems of recent years and the cutback in the movement of apples to export markets. It is hoped that this legislation will help the industry to develop a policy for improved marketing in the domestic scene and enable the industry to do better in the export markets when the opportunities occur. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> asked me the other day a question about the problem of entering the Japanese markets. It is a problem with which I am slightly familiar. I agree with him that it would be an important market to penetrate. It would make a big difference to the industry in the whole of Australia. I do not intend to cover any matter in great detail. It should not be thought- I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> will agree with me- that the only apple producing States in Australia are Queensland and Tasmania. I hesitate to do so, but I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> that the central districts of New South Wales, where I come from, are also fairly notable for apple and pear production. </para>

            <para>-The States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Bill 1 976 now before the Parliament is probably the most significant piece of rural legislation considered this year. It sets the framework in which assistance for adjustment purposes will be provided by the Commonwealth and administered by the relevant States. To the degree that it measures some part of the problem and goes some way along the road, the Opposition is prepared to support the legislation. The Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton)</inline> in his second reading speech stated that the legislation seeks to rationalise the various forms of rural adjustment presently operating under separate legislation- the rural reconstruction scheme, the dairy assistance program and the beef carry-on finance scheme- into one comprehensive scheme which covers all rural producers. In supporting the amalgamation of these various forms of rural adjustment, the Opposition believes that there should be one comprehensive scheme. We support the additional provisions included in the legislation relating to farm improvement carryon finance, household support and an increase in the rehabilitation loan to selected applicants from $3,000 to $5,000. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Opposition wishes to state clearly, however, that it does not consider that the legislation goes far enough in establishing structural adjustment assistance as a future tool of agricultural policy. Hence the Opposition intends to move some amendments, but in particular an amendment to the schedule of the Bill at page 13 to set up a National Rural Adjustment Board to monitor the administration of the provisions of this very important form of assistance to the rural sector. The Opposition proposes also that this form of assistance should be made available to the fishing industry, which to date appears to be excluded from access to adjustment assistance. We will be moving amendments to have these producers brought within the ambit of the present scheme. </para>
          <para>Before examining the provisions of the Bill in detail, it would be appropriate to examine some of the quite significant structural changes which have occurred in agriculture in recent years, the factors which have produced these changes and how the rural sector has responded to changes in the economic environment. It is important to do this if we are to come to some understanding of the role that government can and should play in facilitating the process of structural adjustment. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline>from time to time has spoken at great length about what he believes are the problems of adjustment in the rural sector. But it has to be pointed out to him that in the decade 1965 to 1975, for example, Commonwealth funds to the degree of $2,258m were paid out in form of direct subsidies and bounties to the rural sector. Because they were across-the-board types of subsidies there came about an imbalance within various sectors of agriculture as resources flowed into those sectors in which assistance produced a higher than average rate of income. Even within the period of the Labor Government $843m was paid out in those 3 years for the purpose of assistance to the rural sector. So when resources flow incorrectly from one sector to another, we get an imbalance. Then, subsequently, we are faced with problems associated with export markets such as the access to markets which is now denied to Australian agricultural producers. Clearly structural difficulties are involved also. I have heard Ministers of this </para>
          <para class="block">Government in recent dmes, not only in the Parliament but also in the media generally, referring to the strutural difficulties that exist in agriculture and in manufacturing industry in Australia. That is where we are at. That is why these sorts of Bills are essential. That is why it is necessary to have the Industries Assistance Commission carrying out an objective analysis of the situation, industry by industry, so that we may understand the changes that take place, sector by sector. </para>
          <para>Since the mid- 1930s the percentage of the population living in rural areas has declined significantly. According to the IAC, as well as to statistics generally, the male rural work force has declined from 26 per cent of the total employed males in 1921 to 8 per cent in 1971. The latest figures show an even more significant decline in the work force in rural sectors down to 6.3 per cent. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright,</inline> who is trying to interject, that all that has taken place in the period in which the conservative governments were in office. It was not the result of a Whitlam Government, or a Curtin Government or a Chifley Government; it was part of the inevitable evolution that has been taking place in agriculture in all the developing countries in the West. We have seen a gradual reduction in the number of farms, an increase in their average size and in their productivity, and considerable diversification in production. As the crisis on the land had deepend we have seen the farmer and his family turn to off-farm sources of income in an endeavour to stay on their properties. Surely no honourable senator could disagree that that is the objective reality of today. </para>
          <para>The factors which have brought about these adjustments in the industry structure are numerous. They include the general level of economic activity at home and abroad which affects the demand for rural produce. I refer, for example, to the decline in consumption of beef in the United States and Japan after the oil crisis in 1973 as the domestic levels of inflation increased in those countries. Then there is the denial of access to our products to overseas markets. I refer also to the increasing availability and application of new farm technology, climatic conditions, assistance policies pursued often in different directions by governments, Commonwealth and State, and of course fluctuations in the exchange rate. All these things have tremendous influences on and implications to the farmer. </para>
          <para>It is on this last aspect that the Government&#39;s credibility has been destroyed. Quite apart from the untold damage brought to our international financial reputation by the Government&#39;s rather embarrassing inability to reach a decision on the value of the Australian dollar, the Government has carefully and quite deceitfully disguised the long term impact of this devaluation on the cost structure of primary production. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters,</inline> in making her contribution to the debate on the apple and pear legislation, showed how she fails to understand the effect devaluation will have ultimately on the whole rural scene. It may well be that farmer leaders believe that the decision will be beneficial to them, but I gather than very shortly they will have a different point of view. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is aware of the immediate cash benefit to certain rural producers as a result of devaluation. It is also acutely aware of the long term costs which the rural producer will be forced to face as a consequence of devaluation. I agree with the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> about freight costs. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> will agree that the invisibles play a significant part in our balance of trade situation. That factor will be a minus in respect of devaluation. It will have a significant effect on both those rural producers who have shared in the short term gains of devaluation and those who have not shared at all. Many sectors of the economy rely on access to markets and therefore devaluation will be of very little assistance. </para>
          <para>The farmer faces a long term loss situation if the dollar is revalued significantly. He faces the prospect of a confirmed high rate of domestic inflation if the inflow of capital expected after this devaluation materialises, and that will take place for sure. He cannot be insulated forever against the economic realities of a rise in interest rates which apply to the community generally, no matter what action this Government may take to try to insulate the rural sector from interest rates. The farmer also faces the prospect of a long term squeeze on his income from a rising domestic cost structure and because of the high level of protection now afforded many of the manufactured inputs he consumes and the rising costs of inputs he imports. If considerable pressure had not been brought to bear on the Government it would have been prepared to let the sleeping dog lie in the tariff front. In the long term the rural producers would have been worse off. As it is many of the selective tariff cuts announced in the last few days do not apply to inputs consumed by the farmer. The Opposition can see only troubled waters ahead for the rural sector and a continuation of considerable pressure on this sector to adjust. I am not suggesting that every recommendation that comes out of the Industries Assistance Commission needs implementation or that the recommendations are necessarily correct, but they at least provide the basis for an active government to react and to legislate. </para>
          <para>The Government promised the rural sector producer domestic stability. All it has delivered is the prospect of long term domestic instability The Government promised sound economic management, and all the farmer has received is chaos in domestic economic policy. The Government &#39;s failure in economic management- that is what is being said in all the newspapers today and by all the commentators- makes the establishment of an effective structural adjustment policy even now more imperative than in the past. The Bureau of Agricultural Economics in its comments on the Australian farm situation in 1975-76 states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>A feature of the rural sectors in Australia has been the speed and the magnitude of the changes in the economic environment affecting different rural industries and the capacity they have shown to adjust autonomously. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Given these quite dramatic changes which have occurred in the structure of the rural sector in recent years, the challenge for government is to establish and maintain a constructive assistance policy aimed at improving the mobility and the productivity of resources employed in agriculture. By adopting such an approach government is not being intrusive. I disagree fundamentally with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> that government should stay out of agriculture as much as possible. The Government needs to move in. We need more government not less government in agriculture if agriculture is to have any future at all in the next 20 years. By adopting such a policy it acknowledges that it has an important role to play where the process of adjustment is impeded by certain factors. </para>
          <para>It is quite a feature of this Government that on the last day of every session of Parliament since this Government came to office we have dealt with rural matters. For example, at the end of the Autumn session in June last, I spoke 5 times on 5 rural Bills. The same process has been followed yesterday and today. That illustrates where priorities lie with this Government. </para>
          <para>Governments have an important role to play where the process of adjustment is impeded by certain factors, where considerable social and economic costs are involved, and for individuals and society in general because of the need to adjust. These impediments include the immobility of some rural capital, imperfections in the capital market, the limited off-farm occupational opportunities in rural areas and a natural reluctance and often inability for farmers to relocate. </para>
          <para>It is obvious from the advances which have been made under this legislation that the Government has based its consideration on the form of structural adjustment assistance appropriate to the rural sector on the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in its rural report of 1 January 1976. The Opposition asks: Why has the Government chosen to implement only half of the recommendations in that report? We are prepared to give legislative support to a concerted effort which, we feel, should be made now to establish the necessary administrative machinery at the national level to cope with the continued need that will exist for rural adjustment measures as a natural consequence of this Government&#39;s ill-conceived economic policies. </para>
          <para>Broadly, the IAC has made 2 recommendations relating to the future direction and administration of government adjustment assistance policy. It has recommended the amalgamation of industry-oriented schemes into one rural adjustment scheme covering all farmers in the rural sector. How important and imperative that proposal is- if a farmer is to be encouraged to move from one sector, obviously he needs assistance to know to which other sector he should movewith the inclusion of certain new provisions relating to farm improvement in this legislation, carry on finance and household support in the scheme. This part of the Commission&#39;s recommendations has fortunately been incorporated in the new adjustment measures proposed by the Government and supported by the Opposition. </para>
          <para>In its report, the Commission has mounted some very persuasive considerations for the construction of a single adjustment scheme, many of which relate directly to the defects now evident in all of the previous schemes. The Commission has recommended the creation of the national rural adjustment scheme to co-ordinate, evaluate and plan rural adjustment assistance. It is the creation of such a board which is the substance of the main amendment proposed by the Opposition. The Opposition takes the view that there is little benefit in attempting to rectify the deficiencies existing in previous rural adjustment schemes and to amalgamate the various schemes into one scheme without providing adequate machinery at the national level to ensure that the administration of the scheme is equitable and effectively administered. </para>
          <para>It is no good leaving this to the nuances and the influences of one State against another. A national initiative is required. In these processes, no State should be disadvantaged. The desired policy objectives of Government should be achieved in this way. Therefore, in Une with the recommendations of the IAC, the Opposition proposes that a national rural adjustment board be created with a full executive  chairman,  2 part time members from rural industry and 2 members drawn from the various State rural reconstruction authorities and selected on a rotational basis for a term of not more than 2 years. This would give the essential co-ordination that is necessary to implement such a scheme. The important feature of the proposal is that it will give primary producers direct access to policy making machinery at the national level through the 2 rural representatives who will sit on the board. </para>
          <para>The IAC also outlined many constructive considerations in its report on the various functions that such a board could perform. The Opposition has included these considerations in its amendment as a guideline to the proposed method of operation for such a board. Among the functions proposed for the board are that it should consult with State reconstruction authorities and federal and State departments on the annual fund requirements of the national rural adjustment scheme and arrange consultation between State reconstruction authorities and the Australian Government concerning emergency short term credit requirements when farm incomes are substantially reduced by a sudden market collapse or other severe situation. As a producer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> you would know that this constantly happens. It should discuss and liaise with State reconstruction authorities and agencies concerned with monitoring market prospects, such as the various commodity boards and the Bureau of Agricultural Economics, to ensure that viability assessments are based on the most up to date information available. </para>
          <para>What appals me is the lack of farm intelligence information. There is very little of it available to enable farmers to make an assessment based on market trends and influences. We also need to monitor the progress of reconstruction clients including those assessed not to have sound prospects of long-term commercial viability. We need to evaluate the rural adjustment schemes in terms of explicit policy objectives and guidelines. We need research into the relative effects of various assistance measures in anticipation of responding to continuing adjustment pressures. We need to conduct feasibility studies and to evaluate areas with specific problems in adjustment and redevelopment proposals suggested by interested parties and other government agencies, and to liaise at the national level with management of banks and other sources of farm credit. </para>
          <para>The Opposition calls upon the Government to demonstrate its sincerity with regard to this form of assistance to the rural sector and to accept the Opposition&#39;s amendments. Considering this legislation in detail, the Opposition supports the farm build-up, debt reconstruction and rehabilitation provisions which have been taken from previous reconstruction legislation, and supports the various additional provisions such as farm improvement, carry-on finance and, with one amendment, the household support scheme contained in the Bill. </para>
          <para>Having some regard to the time factor, I move on to that section of the Bill which seeks to look at the rehabilitation provisions. The Opposition supports the Government&#39;s proposals to increase the level of assistance from $3000 to $5000 but the Opposition is concerned that the Government in its haste to pass this legislation- and let us bear in mind that it is a hastily prepared piece of legislation which was introduced into the House of Representatives less than a week ago, not giving the Opposition adequate time to consider the implications, and introduced into this chamber several days ago to be passed todayhas ignored many important issues relating to the scope of adjustment assistance measures and the financial terms on which moneys will be made available to prospective farmer clients. </para>
          <para>The Industries Assistance Commission report was concerned that adequate counselling services be provided to inform farm families of the various provisions of the scheme, and that is an integral part of any readjustment scheme. The report also referred to the need to extend the counselling services available to applicants who receive assistance under the scheme to include management advice, and for those assessed as non-viable in agriculture, adequate counselling to alert those farm families to the options available to them outside the sector. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> said in his speech on another Bill a few moments ago, there are farmers planting more fruit trees although we have a tree-pull scheme under which they are being pulled out elsewhere. This shows the absurdity of lack of direction by the national government. </para>
          <para>The Australian Labor Party supports this important part of the adjustment assistance with special purpose grants to improve the scope of state extension services to cater for the counselling needs of viable and non-viable farmers and the Opposition requests the Government to give similar consideration to this important aspect of adjustment assistance. With regard to the rate of interest at which loans will be made available to recipients under the various provisions of the legislation, the Opposition seeks clarification on whether the Government has or has not accepted the IAC recommendation that the long-term bond rate be the basic rate of interest for loans made for rural adjustment purposes. The Opposition is concerned that concessions may be built into the notion of longterm viability and that such a course of action may militate against the long-term effectiveness of the scheme. In seeking this clarification the Opposition notes that in the existing provisions of the legislation considerable discretion is given to the State administrative authority in dealing with individual farmers in that scope exists to schedule repayments and to defer repayments in accordance with the farmer&#39;s financial capacity to meet early commitments. The Opposition considers that procedures for review of this scheme are inadequate and, therefore, should be strengthened in the legislation. This would occur if the Opposition&#39;s amendment pertaining to the proposed national Rural Reconstruction Board were accepted. We regard regular reviews as being an essential part of the flexible operation of the scheme. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is concerned also that the legislation does not go far enough in its consideration of special assistance to selected industries and the need for area adjustment measures. The carry-on finance provisions in the Bill can be implemented when a particular industry faces a severe economic down-turn. The Opposition is concerned at the impact that such an event could have on the economics of a regional area predominantly dependent upon a rural industry. The Opposition sees the situation arising where adjustment assistance beyond the farm gate would be necessary. It believes that the proposed national rural readjustment board could play a valuable role in identifying such situations and advising the Government on appropriate policy measures. </para>
          <para>The options facing Government policy makers with regard to the more general question of assistance to the rural sector are perfectly clear to the Opposition. If we can see them, the Government, with all the economic advisers it has at its elbow, should be able to see them. We have the choice of continuing the protective forms of assistance which have been the hallmark of the present Government&#39;s assistance policy- a policy commonly referred to as a policy of subsidy and concession, regressive in its operation, inward-looking and not applying itself to the basic problems of readjustment- or of devising new assistance policies which are rational in their conception and dynamic in their operation and which afford the rural producer the prospect of long-term viability with a minimum of government assistance. </para>
          <para>The rural producers&#39; attitude is clear. The rural sector wants to reduce its dependence on government assistance in the long term. It demands that the Government pursue rational assistance measures with regard to manufacturing industry and it demands that the Government pursue rational policies in relation to itself. That as been made abundantly clear to me in recent months. The Labor Party believes that the resources of a responsible government, through its assistance policy, should be employed in facilitating the process of structural adjustment where the costs to individuals and to society of those changes are deemed to be excessive. An important opportunity exists, therefore, for the Government to move away from its past assistance policies, which have encouraged farmers to move into areas of production which are now proven to be uneconomic, and to pursue more rational policies aimed at improving the mobility and productivity of resources employed in the rural sector. That is the Labor Party&#39;s approach and that is the only approach which will secure long-term growth and efficiency in the rural sector. </para>

            <para>- I rise to support the Bill. In an endeavour to save a little time later, I want to deal at once with the proposed amendments. I can do so very briefly. The amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 will upset the delicate structure of this scheme which now draws into one comprehensive piece of legislation all the various schemes which have been available to primary producers in recent times. For that reason alone, amendments Nos. 1, 2 and 3 should be rejected. So far as amendment No. 4 is concerned, the primary producers in Australia are sick of bureaucrats and boards. All that this amendment does is set up yet another Federal authority- a national rural adjustment board- when, at the moment, we have complete co-operation between the State governments and the Federal Minister in the administration of the existing proposals. That can continue. There is absolutely no necessity for another bureaucratic board to be set up under this legislation. I say that that amendment should be rejected. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>This Bill will give parliamentary approval for the execution of a new agreement by the Commonwealth and the States relating to rural adjustment. We will now have under one umbrella the previous rural reconstruction scheme, the dairy adjustment program and the carry-on finance scheme for beef producers. An entirely new form of assistance has been introduced- it is a very important one- known as household support. It will extend to those who have the greatest need for assistance, namely, those who are forced out of farming, in many cases due to circumstances beyond their control, and who have exhausted their cash and credit and have to make a final decision whether or not to leave the industry. It is important to note that all agricultural, horticultural and pastoral industries are included in this comprehensive legislation. As stated in the agreement Schedule to the Bill, the general principle to be applied is to distribute the available resources as widely as practicable. The overriding objective is to restore to economic viability those farms and farmers with a capacity to maintain viability once that object is achieved. </para>
          <para>I should like to deal very briefly with the various forms of assistance which are provided in the legislation. The first of these is debt reconstruction assistance, which is already provided for in the existing legislation. It is designed to help the applicant who has sound long term prospects but who is unable to obtain finance to carry on and thus puts his whole property and assets in jeopardy. The assistance may be provided for rearrangement or composition of debts to allow more time for repayment. Finance will be available for a wide range of assistance, including repayment of all or part of the debts secured on the property, and for carry-on expenses, livestock and further property development. </para>
          <para>The next form of assistance, and a very important one, is known as farm build-up. In relation to this type of legislation, since it was introduced 2 or 3 years ago it has proved very useful to the dairy industry in Victoria. It has a double effect in that in the first place it allows the farmer whose property is too small and no longer viable, having regard to the depressed market conditions for the product, to retire from the industry with some dignity and with the cash value of his equity in the property. In the second place, the farmer who buys the property becomes a more viable unit. The terms and conditions on which money is supplied to him are very generous both as to interest and repayment. The practice in Victoria has been to lend the whole of the purchase money to the farmer staying in the industry to enable him to take over the other property. Thus there is a reduction in the number of farmers, the people staying in become viable, and the nonviable people get out. It is a very useful piece of legislation. </para>
          <para>A further form of assistance is the extension of the dairy adjustment program to the whole of the primary producing sector. The purpose of this type of assistance is to restore an existing farm to economic viability without adding to its areaand that is slightly different from the previous provision. Before it is available, the applicant will have to demonstrate that his existing farm has been a viable proposition and that the purpose for which the assistance is being given will with some degree of certainty restore the property to long term viability. I should add that in relation to all the finance provided under these schemes there is a common factor. If the applicant can get finance elsewhere, it is not provided by the Government. That is the test, and it is a very useful test which will mean that the deserving cases will get assistance. </para>
          <para>The next type of assistance to which I wish to refer is that known as rehabilitation. The purpose, as set out in the agreement, is to provide limited assistance to those obliged to leave the industry where in the opinion of the authority administering the scheme it is necessary to alleviate conditions of personal hardship. In order to qualify an applicant must have sold his property to a purchaser under the farm build-up provisions which I mentioned earlier- that is the small man getting out. The second condition is that he will suffer financial hardship after his property has been sold, having regard to his financial position at that stage. For instance, the assistance will cover a small farmer who has very little equity in his property. He may have a heavy mortgage on it, and this provision will enable him to receive assistance. The nature of the assistance is a loan to a maximum of $5,000. The Authority has a discretion not only to fix the interest rate in terms of repayment but also a very valuable additional discretion to convert the loan to a grant. Undoubtedly this will materially assist non-viable people wishing to retire from the dairy industry m Victoria. </para>
          <para>The next type of assistance provided by the legislation is what is termed carry-on finance. It covers the situation where the States agree that an industry has real short term problems because of a severe market downturn or something else. It is a short term arrangement. When there is a problem such as drought or over supply assistance can be given, by agreement, to help people in the short term. </para>
          <para>I do not want to delay the Senate any longer than necessary but I want to say a little about household support. This is a new and very worthwhile provision which, in the terms of the agreement, will provide assistance for up to one year to non-viable farmers having insufficient resources to meet living expenses and who are in need of assistance to alleviate conditions of personal and family hardship while they decide whether to adjust out of farming. I took that statement from the agreement. The test of eligibility in this case, as provided by the agreement, is that the applicant must be assessed as nonviable in the long term, must be unable to obtain financial assistance from any normal source, as I mentioned earlier, and will suffer personal or family hardship. These provisions will alleviate that situation. There is an important limitation in that the amount of assistance which can be obtained is geared to the amount of unemployment benefits. Some of the proposed amendments to this Bill would cut across this principle which I think is a very basic one. I do not think any primary producer in Australia wants to finish up better off by means of government assistance than an employee who happens to be getting unemployment benefits. </para>
          <para>I do not want to go into all the details of this new household support scheme because there are 13 paragraphs relating to it, but I do want to say that considerable elasticity and discretion are vested in the State authority which will administer it in order that there is a range of assistance available for a particular case. That is a very valuable feature of the legislation because it is not until schemes of this type are put into operation that the hard cases emerge. Occasionally there is necessity for an administrative discretion to be exercised in favour of a person who might not qualify otherwise. That is a very valuable provision. Likewise, there is provision for a lump sum payment where a person eligible for household support wishes to adjust out of farming. At the discretion of the authority that person can receive a lump sum payment in lieu of household support. </para>
          <para>Finally, I want to say a few words about the basis of financing this legislation. Funding of the household support scheme will be the complete responsibility of the Commonwealth. The other forms of assistance will be met by an advance by the Commonwealth to the States, 85 per cent in the form of loan and 15 per cent in the form of grant. The rate of interest on the loan component will be 7 per cent but this will be subject to adjustment to the long term bond rate of interest. Provision is made for the sharing of the cost of administration. For the 6 months from 1 January to 30 June 1977 the Commonwealth is making available $20m. The details of the split-up of that sum are set out in the second reading speech made in the other place by the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair).</inline> It was pleasing to note that in that speech he indicated that the rural bank concept and the young farmers&#39; establishment scheme are under consideration by the Government. The legislation we are now discussing may require some adjustment when those matters are brought before the Parliament, hopefully next year. I commend the Bill to the Senate. It is a very worthwhile initiative on the part of the Government to assist all those persons in the primary industry sector who at present are suffering distress. </para>

            <para>-I support the States Grants (Rural Adjustment) Bill and the proposed amendments which will be subsequently moved by my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> The action which will be taken pursuant to this Bill is outlined in the schedule attached to it. I think the Bill actually states that the agreements under it must be made substantially in accordance with the schedule appended to the Bill. The schedule provides an outline of the purposes for which assistance will be provided and the approximate terms and conditions under which it will be provided. They have been outlined fairly comprehensively by previous speakers. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tehan</inline>mentioned interest rates. I make one point about interest rates. It is a popular notion in agricultural areas that finance ought to be made available for agriculture at concessional rates of interest. This Bill provides for finance at concessional rates of interest. While there may sometimes be a case for this, I make the point that when funds are provided on a long term basis at concessional rates of interest there is absolutely no incentive- indeed there is a positive disincentive- to repay those funds. Farmers who in 1970 and 1971 received loans at rates of interest as low as 4 per cent a year and who, because of the subsequent boom in both wheat and wool industries, are now quite affluent, still have money loaned to them in 1970 and 1971 at an interest rate of 4 per cent a year. The point I am making is that if these people were forced to pay the commercial rate of interest- given the current financial situation of many of them there is no reason on welfare grounds why they should not be forced to pay commercial rates of interest- there would be some incentive to repay the loans. Therefore more funds would be available to lend to some other farmers whose needs are greater, both as individuals and because of the subsequent adjustments which those other loans would promote within agriculture. </para>
          <para>I regret that when introducing this Bill the Government did not see fit to make any provisions for the fishing industry, which in some parts of Australia faces problems which are similar- problems of surplus capacities- to those which affect many sectors of agriculture. The Commonwealth Development Bank, until 7 months ago, used to make funds available for the purchase of fishing boats- this has a role to play in the reconstruction of the fishing industry- at interest rates between per cent and 1 <inline font-style="italic">Vh</inline> per cent a year, which approximated the overdraft rate. But about 7 months ago the Government, although it increased the limit of these loans from $200,000 to $300,000, increased the interest rate to 13 per cent. There seems to be a good deal of inconsistency in the treatment by the Government of different sectors with similar problems. On the one hand funds are being made available to agriculture at a concessional rate of interest and to the other sector, the fishing industry, at a rate of interest which is above the current overdraft rate. I suggest that in both instances the case is much stronger for the interest charge to be set at approximately the overdraft rate. </para>
          <para>The problems with which this Bill is concerned, as the word &#39;reconstruction&#39; implies, are principally the problems of structural adjustment in agriculture. Sometimes the provisions of the Bill will be used to overcome short term declines in farm income caused by agricultural problems on the production side or by short term problems on the marketing side. But in the main it is concerned with the structural problems which are deep-seated, the causes of which are unlikely to go away. Those industries which have structural problems display certain common attributes: Their comparative advantages, if they ever possessed any, are rapidly deteriorating; they nave surplus capacity; they are generally labour intensive and they are also characterised by very low marginal returns. In some instances the problems are further compounded by an excessive number of farms which are too small to be viable. When the problems of the deteriorating comparative advantage, low marginal returns and so on interact with the small farm problem, the problems become very significant. </para>
          <para>It is at least equally important for farmers to be informed adequately of the realities of the industries in which they are placed as it is to provide funds under legislation of this nature. It is in this area that the present Government and the parties which comprise it, both when in Government and when in Opposition, ought to be severely chastised. Many sectors of the fruit growing industry, of the dairy industry, of the canned fruit industry and of other industries have deep seated structural problems which have not been caused by ephemeral influences. Yet spokesmen for the Government say that this is the case. They present directly opposite conclusions. On 20 November, at a National Party rally at Roma, the Minister for Primary Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Sinclair)</inline> attempted, as he and his colleagues normally do, to blame all the agricultural problems on the previous Labor Government. He went on with the usual rhetoric about the changes wrought on the farming community by the Whitlam Government with its spendthrift policies and its desire to take all that it could from the rural sector, etc. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Whitlam inflation crippled the ability of the rural sector to compete profitably on international markets. </para>

          <para class="block">He did not specify the things which were taken away, but I presume that he meant, among other things, those taxation dodges which were deliberately and explicitly designed to encourage new investment in agriculture or to provide the incentive to what our opponents in 1973 called an urgent need to increase production. In 1973 the then Opposition severely criticised the Labor Government for removing these tax concessions which were deliberately designed to encourage new investment and greater production in agriculture. Yet in a very short time we saw the wisdom of this decision. I refer to the fact that so many sectors of agriculture already had surplus capacity, the most dramatic of these being the beef industry. It had been in trouble for more than 2 years. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Anthony</inline> in 1973, it faced a very favourable future. He said that demand for beef would increase so fast that we would be flat out trying to keep up with it. It did not take very long to show how grossly in error he was on that point. In a statement, which is numbered 153A by the Parliamentary Library, the Minister said: </para>

          <para class="block">I suggest that that is alarmist clap-trap. Of course the rural sector will survive with or without assistance from this Government. Its structural composition and its size are certainly open to dispute and to revision, but its survival <inline font-style="italic">per se</inline> is not in doubt. For the Minister to suggest that it is in doubt or that it ever has been in doubt is the epitome of irresponsibility. He also said: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">It is an interesting notion that the Government should underwrite the earning of adequate profits from investing in the land. Among other things, it incorporates the notion that the Government should guarantee a specific or predetermined return on capital used to buy land which, if adopted, locks us into a vicious circlethe higher the return on investment in land, the higher the level at which the Government guarantees, inevitably the higher the price of land becomes. To meet this commitment to provide a minimum return on capital the Government has then to increase again in some way the prices of the commodities produced on the land. So we start off on the next round. It incorporates the sort of economic thinking which led to the injustices and the distortions of the corn laws in England which were repealed more than 100 years ago. I suppose that is where the Country Party and the present Minister for Primary Industry really belong- about 100 years ago. In statement No. 117, which was delivered about July- I do not have the precise date- the Minister said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If you have the resources for agricultural development, then develop them without wasting them. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Government has a mindless commitment to development <inline font-style="italic">per se.</inline> The application of that belief as government policy and the implementation of that belief as government policy is the direct cause of the problems in many of the industries which are the subject of this piece of legislation. The mindless expansion of irrigation schemes is an example. The Goulburn Valley is perhaps the most recent and most demonstrably foolish example in that respect. Throughout the 1960s a massive program of orchard planting and expansion of irrigation was undertaken which almost doubled the capacity of the Australian canned fruit industry. It, of course, is one of the major problem industries with which this Bill is concerned. This sort of thing might be good rah-rah stuff at Country Party rallies. But, whether deliberately or otherwise, to mislead the farmers of Australia about the actual conditions in their industries and the true realities they face is the epitome of irresponsibility. </para>
          <para>As recently as 15 November the Minister repeated the line that large increases in costs caused by inflation under the Whitlam Government were largely responsible for reducing the living standards of those in the farming community. At Rockhampton only last Saturday he said: </para>

              <para>- The Minister for Primary Industry. The facts of the situation are very different. The fruit growing, dairying and canned fruit industries have been problem industries since way back into the 1 960s. As I said at the beginning of my speech, their problems, though they may be marginally exacerbated by inflation and a few other things, are deep-seated and structural. They are found in the simple fact that these industries are labour intensive in a high labour cost country, that they face quantitative restrictions at the marketing end, that the marginal returns are extremely low, that they have surplus capacity and that whatever comparative advantage they may have had is either steadily or rapidly being eroded. These problems are all compounded by the fact that in many instances the farms are too small. </para>

          <para>Before closing I must pass some comment on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters&#39;</inline> remarks this afternoon. Firstly, she misquoted what I had said about the effects of devaluation on Australia &#39;s problem industries. I did not say that devaluation would provide no assistance for the dairying industry or for beef production. What I did say was that the greatest assistance- the greatest benefits- would flow to those sectors which were already relatively well off, particularly wheat and wool and perhaps, to a slightly lesser extent, sugar, that the beef producers would get some value, that the dairy farmers would get very little and that in the very specific case of apple producers the increases in freight costs could well be great enough completely to offset the price gains. I wanted to put the records straight on that. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline>then developed her argument that devaluation would provide massive assistance to Tasmanian apple exporters. With the superb logic for which her Party and its coalition partner are noted she tried to prove her point by saying that Mt Lyell would remain open because of devaluation. As far as I know, nothing much grows around Mt Lyell at all. I think that I have the right place. There are certainly no apple orchards. I think that that area produces copper. What the price of copper has to do with the price of apples <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> failed to explain. </para>
          <para>But since she raises the point it is obvious that the Bureau of Agricultural Economics does not share her optimism about the effects of devaluation on farm incomes. Despite having tried on 2 occasions in the last fortnight by way of question to the Minister for Industry and Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cotton),</inline> who represents the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> in this place, I have not been able to get the Government&#39;s or the Treasury&#39;s official estimates of the effect of devaluation on farm incomes or the export prices of agricultural commodities. But one forecast from the BAE has been published and that forecast estimated that net farm income would increase by some $1 50m in the remaining 7 months of this financial year as a direct result of devaluation. That figure cannot be reconciled with the $700m a year increase in agricultural export prices which the Treasurer claimed in a speech last week. </para>
          <para>I would like to see the Government give some clarification as to how $150m in 7 months can suddenly be transformed into $700m over a full year. The point is that if the full benefits of devaluation flowed on into agricultural prices, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> seemed to believe they would, the aggregate income received by Australian agricultural exporters would increase by something like $900m. The Treasurer says $700m. Not even he shares <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters&#39;</inline> optimism. Of course, that is a nonsense figure, as the BAE estimate shows. The true figure for the increase in agricultural prices will probably be around $300m to $350m. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters</inline> once again that the overwhelming majority of that benefit, both proportionally and in aggregate, will accrue to the relatively well-off wool and wheat producers. When the second round effects of devaluation are taken into account- and by that, of course, I mean the inflation which even the Government acknowledges will be generatedthe Tasmanian apple producers could well be, on balance, disadvantaged by devaluation. </para>
          <para>The weakness of this Bill introduced by the Government is that it is directed only at farmers, that there is no provision for the national rural adjustment board of the type recommended by the Industries Assistance Commission which could have taken action on a broader front than would be possible under any scheme which is oriented only to farmers. There are people other than farmers who are affected by the structural problems and the long term decline of agricultural industries. People who are directly employed in agriculture without being farmers themselves have been completely ignored by this legislation. This has also been the case with people who are employed in or who are proprietors of the service industries in the rural towns. This legislation provides nothing for these people. To some extent and to some degree the Opposition proposes to try to remedy that defect with an amendment which will be moved by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> during the Committee stage. </para>

      <para class="block">The amendments propose that the definition of rural producers&#39; in clause (3), sub-clause ( 1) of the Schedule include any person involved in the pastoral, horticultural, agricultural or fishing industries and that reference to fishing be included in Part I of the Schedule. The purpose of this is to recognise that fishing comes within the general descriptive definition of a primary industry. I suppose that in many respects we could say that fishing was the first industry not only on the world scene but also in Australia. We are prompted to move these amendments because we believe that the fishing industry is at a stage in its development, because of the recent extension of the fishing zone to 200 miles off shore, when it requires government assistance in order to carry out its responsibilities as an income earner and employer. There are some 16 000 fishermen in the industry. The industry&#39;s returns now exceed $100m, so it is not an insignificant industry. Yet so far no attempts have been made by governments at the national level to include fishing as part of their responsibilities. Clearly structural problems are involved. </para>
      <para>I would hope that the Committee would give some serious consideration to the amendments we propose. The tendency when you have the numbers is not to give any consideration to amendments but I genuinely believe that the Government ought to look at the amendments quite seriously. The Department of Primary Industry gave evidence to the Industry&#39;s Assistance Commission in April this year, when the Commission was considering reconstruction of the fishing industry, that this was in line with a pre-election commitment that was made by the Federal coalition Government. The Department said in its submission that the issues it was canvassing in its study of the possibility of reconstruction included the identification of fisheries needing reconstruction, the feasibility of extending existing rural reconstruction programs to the fishing industry and the feasibility of reducing the number of boats in over-exploited fisheries by means of a buy-back scheme. A lot of other things were said, but I will not weary the Committee with them at this late stage. </para>
      <para>I had to do some research in respect of the fishing industry, because when the Opposition attempted to move these amendments in the other place the  Clerk  gave advice to my colleagues there that fisheries would not come within the Bill. We then had to establish whether in fact there was a relationship between fisheries and primary industry. Lo and behold, we turned up an Act passed by the national Parliament in 1907 which clearly established fishing as an industry which had received Commonwealth assistance. Bill No. 12 of 1907 was a Bill to provide bounties and financial assistance in relation to cotton, fibres, linseed oil, rice, coffee, tobacco leaf, fish, fruits and wool tops and so on. So the Government can be assured that by including the fishing industry as one of the industries capable of receiving assistance under the rural adjustment scheme it is following a practice that the Parliament has already adopted. </para>
      <para>Notwithstanding that, we take the view that it is not up to the bureaucracy to determine what Bills the Parliament should deal with but it is up to the Parliament itself. </para>
      <para>In relation to the household support scheme, I hope that I will have the vocal support of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright.</inline> I draw attention to Part 7, paragraph (1), in the Schedule, which states: </para>
      <quote>
        <para>A farmer who is eligible for household support and who is prepared to adjust out of farming may, at the discretion of the Authority, receive in lieu of household support assistance a lump sum payment of $3,000 less any household support assistance paid to him prior to adjusting out of farming . . . </para>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">As was pointed out by the Minister in his second reading speech, the proposal to pay benefits to farmers under the household support scheme is limited to social security benefits. So, if a farmer received approximately $40 a week over a couple of years he would receive no payment if, finally, he decided to leave the industry. It seems to me that, when we have established the principle of severance pay in relation to adjustments in the manufacturing industry, that principle ought to be established in relation to the rural sector. We propose that the following words be left out of paragraph (1): </para>
      <quote>
        <list type="lowerroman-dotted">
          <item label=".">
            <para>. less any household support assistance paid to him prior to adjusting out of farming. </para>

        </list>
      </quote>
      <para class="block">So, he would receive a lump sum of $3,000 plus any adjustment assistance given to him in the period in which he was making the decision to leave the industry. </para>
      <para>I know that the Government&#39;s advisers will talk about Part 5 of the Schedule, which deals with rehabilitation. There, under certain conditions, it is possible for a person to be paid a maximum of $5,000 in any one case by the Authority. But I put it to the Senate that at that stage, when a farmer has finally concluded that he has to leave the industry, he may well find that he is unable to sell his property because of the general decline within the region. He will find himself not attracted to the scheme in terms of a loan. He will have employment difficulties. He will have difficulties in establishing himself in another home if he is going to leave the district. He may well be faced with those sorts of problems if he opts out of the industry. Obviously he and his wife and family would have to leave if he were to get employment elsewhere. In those circumstances we do not believe that the assistance should be regarded as being the basic amount. He should receive his severance pay of $3,000, and good luck to him if he has been able to receive other assistance. </para>
      <para>I spoke on the proposed national rural adjustment board. We adopt, in their entirety, the recommendations of the Industries Assistance Commission in relation to the establishment of such a board, with a full time executive chairman and part-time members from rural industry and the various State reconstruction schemes. We urge the Government to give serious consideration to our amendments. Only in the interests of brevity and of getting home for Christmas am I prepared to conclude my remarks. </para>

          <para>- I shall direct myself briefly to the observations made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> Amendments Nos 1 and 2 are directed towards providing for the fishing industry to be included in the legislation. The following details are relevant to this matter: This general idea was floated in the Industries Assistance Commission report on rural reconstruction, but no mention was made by the IAC of the fishing industry. This Bill is about rural adjustment, not primary industry adjustment. In the Schedule, Part 1, General Principles, it is provided that all agricultural, horticultural and pastoral industries are included in the scheme. In principle there is no reason why the fishing industry should not have a similar scheme. The basic differences between rural industries and the fishing industry are such that separate schemes would be far more appropriate. </para>

            <para>-When is Christmas? It was an election promise to establish a reconstruction scheme for the fishing industry similar to the present rural reconstruction scheme. However, a reference is presently before the IAC on the fishing industry and a report is expected early in 1977. Following that report we could be looking at the situation again in more detail and at alternative schemes. In reply to the third amendment, the intention of paragraph (a) of clause 3 of Part 7 of the Schedule is to provide immediate assistance to a farmer who desires to adjust out of farming quickly and to encourage him to make this decision without undue delay. The effect of the amendment would be to frustrate this intention. Attention is drawn to the fact that applicants are eligible for rehabilitation loans of $5,000 notwithstanding any assistance received under household support. </para>

        <para>The Industries Assistance Commission talk about administration of the scheme at Federal level might be achieved by either of 2 alternatives. One alternative is a commissioner approach within the Department of Primary Industry and the other is an approach to a statutory board. The amendment is in line with the second alternative. I refer to paragraph 9.2 of the IAC report at pages 65 to 68. The idea of this board was discussed with the States. No State authority wanted to be involved in it in spite of the fact they would have had representation on it, so therefore it fell down on the basis that they did not want to be a part of it. Analysis of the proposal shows it would be far more costly and would achieve no better results. These matters can be done quite comfortably within the Department of Primary Industry. In view of the time limitations upon us I think those answers should provide a satisfactory explanation of the reason the Government does not feel the amendments add anything to the Bill. </para>

            <para>- I intend to use the first reading stage of this Bill to raise 3 matters. They are minor matters inasmuch as they will not take much time, but they are important matters. I originally intended to raise them during the adjournment debate on Wednesday but because I would have delayed the Senate I arranged to speak on the first reading of this Bill, which I anticipated would have taken place yesterday. By the time I realised that the Bill would not come on yesterday I had decided not to speak in the adjournment debate last night in order not to keep the Senate here late in the evening. I find that it is almost adjournment time now, but I intend to speak on these matters. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The first matter I wish to raise concerns answers to some questions that I placed on notice. The answers are not satisfactory in the information that they provide and they do not explain why that information could not be provided. On 2 1 September I received an answer to a question which I placed on notice. The question asked: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) What is (a) the name, (b) designation and (c) salary and entitlements, of each member of the GovernorGeneral &#39;s personal staff. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>Have there been any resignations or departures from the Governor-General&#39;s personal staff since 11 November 1 975. If so, for what reasons have the resignations or departures concerned taken place. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">I received an answer which gave details of the name, designation, salary and entitlements of 7 members of the Governor-General&#39;s staff. The answer then went on as follows: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>There have been no resignations from the GovernorGeneral&#39;s personal staff. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">That is, since 1 1 November 1975. The answer continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">Departures have consisted of defence force officers returning to their Services at the completion of their normal periods of duty. </para>
            <para>Personal staff has been interpreted to mean those staff normally selected personally by the Governor-General. Domestic staff and office staff have not been included. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Because of the latter part of that reply to my question, I placed several further questions on notice in relation to the personal, domestic and office staff of the Governor-General so that I could obtain a complete answer to the original question I asked. On 8 December I received replies to those questions which I placed on notice. But I contend that the replies provided are not at all satisfactory. One of my questions read as follows: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>What is (a) the name, (b) designation, and (c) salary and entitlements of each present and past member of the Governor-General&#39;s personal, domestic and office staff who took up duty after 11 November 1975. (2) What position was held by each member referred to in ( 1 ) prior to his or her joining the Governor-General&#39;s staff. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The answer I received was as follows: </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) and (2) Since 1 1 November 1975, five domestic personnel and eight office personnel have joined the GovernorGeneral&#39;s staff, including replacements and new staff for the Australian Honours Secretariat. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">In other words, my question was not answered, because my question sought the name, designation and salary and entitlements of each present and past member of the Governor-General&#39;s staff. The reply I received did not answer that question. I suggest that if the answer to that question could not be provided for some reasons of security, that should have been stated in the answer to the question. In other words, the Minister should have replied: &#39;The answer to ( 1) and (2) cannot be provided because of national security&#39;. </para>
          <para>I asked 2 other similar questions based on the original question that I asked. They were questions No. 1115 and No. 1116. Although they are worded slightly differently, they both ask for the name, designation and salary and entitlements of personnel on the Governor-General&#39;s staff. In each case that first part of the question was not answered. I intend to follow up this matter. I could follow it up in 2 ways. I do not wish to telegraph my punches, so I will not say the way in which I intend to follow it up. I believe it is an unsatisfactory state of affairs that when members of this national Parliament request more complete answers to questions previously asked those questions are not answered at all or they are answered in an offhand manner. The questions to which I have been referring are questions No. 1115, No. 1116 and No. 1117. I believe that none of those questions was answered in the way that a member of this Parliament should be able to expect them to be answered. </para>
          <para>The second matter I raise is separate from that matter. It is related to price increases which have occurred since devaluation. This matter has been mentioned in the Parliament before, but I wish to put on record another instance of how a firm has increased prices following the announcement of the devaluation but, I would think, before it had to pay increased prices for goods coming from overseas. I shall read a letter dated 1 December 1976 which a constituent who is in the photographic business received from a photographic firm named Agfa-Gevaert Ltd. The letter reads as follows: </para>
          <para class="block">Dear Customer, </para>
          <para>It is with great disappointment that we must announce that due to the recent devaluation of the Australian Dollar, we are forced to increase our prices. </para>
          <para>The price increase will become effective as from Wednesday, 8 December, 1976. </para>
          <para>The price increases have been notified to our respective Branch Offices and Salesmen. We recommend that you check prices with us before ordering, for our official price list will not be in your possession before the New Year. </para>
          <para>All goods ordered up to the close of business on Tuesday, 7th December and which can be immediately delivered will be charged at current prices. </para>
          <para class="block">I believe that this represents a deliberate rip-off of customers on the pretext that devaluation has increased prices. The person who wrote to me suggested that it takes about 3 months to obtain from overseas the type of photographic equipment which this company supplies. Yet on 1 December- very shortly after devaluation- this firm advised that as from 8 December prices would be increased. I am not sure whether anything can be done with regard to this, but I think it is important that the people of Australia know that some firms are taking undue advantage of devaluation to increase prices to their consumers. </para>
          <para>I said that I wished to mention 3 matters. I mention this third matter because I believe it outlines a serious situation which prevails in Queensland. I refer to the Medical Benefits Fund of Queensland. I have been in touch with this Fund to check out certain details. I told the person with whom I spoke that I thought his explanation of the situation which I brought to his attention was not satisfactory and told him that I would probably raise the matter in this chamber. So the Fund is aware of the possibility of my raising this matter here. The matter refers to what I consider to be a double payment for medical insurance. </para>
          <para>I cite 2 cases which have been brought to my attention, not by the persons involved but by a pharmacist who enrolled these people in the Medical Benefits Fund after they had been paying the Medibank levy. These people had paid the Medibank levy from 1 October. As far as I can ascertain, the pharmacist enrolled these 2 people in the Medical Benefits Fund on about 26 October. The pharmacist concluded and his clients concluded that these people&#39;s membership with the Medical Benefits Fund, in lieu of paying the Medibank levy, should have prevailed from the date on which they made application to join the Medical Benefits Fund. However, when their membership book was returned they found that their membership had been back dated to 1 </para>
          <para class="block">October and therefore subsequent payments had to be made from 1 October. In the case of at least one of these people, monthly payments are payable on the first day of each month thereafter. This has meant that for a period of about 3 or 4 weeks in October these people paid not only the Medibank levy but also the amount charged by the medical benefits organisation. </para>
          <para>I telephoned the Medical Benefits Fund after I received this information from the pharmacist. I believe that there are often two sides to a story and I wanted to hear what the Medical Benefits Fund had to say about this situation. I was told that the Fund presumed that people who enrolled some time in October wanted their medical coverage through the Fund from 1 October. The fund said it would amend any document if it had been started at the right date and, in fact, these two memberships were amended. The Fund also told me that it could leave the membership as it was and the person could obtain a refund of his Medibank levy after he had lodged his tax return next year. That is all right for a person who can afford to have $30 or so lying idle with the Australian Government earning no interest- $30 which he could probably use effectively. In other words, it is not satisfactory to wait to have one &#39;s Medibank levy refunded in circumstances like this. The person I spoke to from the Medical Benefits Fund stated that he could not read people&#39;s minds. I do not think this is good enough. We would not expect anybody to read a person&#39;s mind with regard to when he wanted to start his membership of a particular fund, but surely there could have been a place on the application form which would have indicated a starting date. If that had happened, the two people to whom I have referred would not have been in this situation. </para>
          <para>I can well understand some of the problems of the medical benefit funds. There was a great deal of confusion prior to 1 October with people wondering whether they should pay the Medibank levy or take out medical coverage with a fund. It would seem to me that there is also fault with the fund in not providing sufficient safeguards so that people would not be placed in this sort of situation. Two cases have been brought to my attention. I would not be surprised if there were more. I would advise people who find themselves in similar situations to contact the medical benefits fund concerned so that they can have their membership altered accordingly and will not have to contribute to the fund and pay the levy at the same time. </para>

I will be as quick as I can. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> complained that he was given no answers to questions on notice. I have had to wait a very long time for an answer to a question I had on notice. When I received the answer today I had to do a paper chase around the Parliament to find out where the answer ended up. In answer to my question the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> said: </para>

          <para class="block">The answer to Question No. 432 was given to my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> sometime during the day at about the same time that I received my answer. The answer to the early part of my question was given to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden</inline> in the other place some days ago. As I said, I had a paper chase trying to find the answers. </para>
          <para>I do not know whether it was by design or by default that I had to wait so long but had I received the answer some weeks ago I would have made an issue of it. I was seeking details of the nature of facilities provided to retired Prime Ministers, the names of the retired Prime Ministers, the total cost of each Prime Minister for the past 5 years and so on. Because of the lateness of the hour I will refer to only a few parts of the answer that I received. This Parliament has been told all this year that the ordinary person in Australia should be prepared to take a cut in income. Yet when we look at the amounts of money being paid to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen,</inline> who was Prime Minister for only a short time between the death of Prime Minister Holt and the installation of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> as Prime Minister, we find that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen</inline> receives nearly as much for his efforts as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> receives for all the years that he was Prime Minister for this country. The amount of money which these people are receiving will be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> I recommend to interested persons, particularly the members of the Press, that they should read today&#39;s Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> so that they can make some comment on the amount of money which the Australian taxpayer is at present contributing to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen,</inline> quite apart from the parliamentary pensions to which they are entitled. </para>
          <para>The cost of official car transport for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> was $14,774 in 1971; $18,235 in 1972; $18,846 in 1973; $19,140 in 1974; $19,837 in 1975; and $13,823 from January to June this year. The total expenditure, including office expenditure and car transport, for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> was $30,378 in 1971; $25,294 in 1972; $25,868 in 1973; $48,123 in 1974; and $67,071 in 1975. </para>

              <para>- It was $67,071. As I said, that is apart from the parliamentary pension to which he is entitled as an ex-Prime Minister under the superannuation scheme. From January to June this year the cost was $29,224. The cost of official car transport for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen</inline> was $12,391 in 1971; $15,424 in 1972; $14,625 in 1973; $14,611 in 1974; $12,188 in 1975; and $ 1 8,544 from January to June this year. This was for car transport alone. The total cost, including other expenditure, for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen</inline> was $17,353 in 1971; $22,660 in 1972; $28,567 in 1973; $37,489 in 1974; $48,660 in 1975; and $29,077 from January to June this year. What has <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McEwen</inline> done to deserve that amount of entitlement out of the pockets of the taxpayers of this country? </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>To make the matter worse, I refer to an answer to a further question concerning the overtime paid to car drivers for both these persons. The base salary of a car driver for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> in 1971 was $3,727. The amount of overtime paid in that year was $7,293. In 1972 the base salary was $3,875 and the amount of overtime paid was $8,525. In 1973 the base salary was $4,766 and the amount of overtime paid was $9,950. In 1 974 the base salary was $5,929 and the amount of overtime paid was $12,062. In 1975 the base salary was $7,075 and the amount of overtime paid was $11,153. For the period January to June this year the base salary was $3,860 and the overtime paid amounted to $2,095. </para>
          <para>Those figures relate to transport costs for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies. His</inline> car driver is receiving in overtime just about double the base salary. In answer to a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hayden,</inline> it has been revealed that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> is now supplied with a part-time medical orderly to look after him. What is he doing with a car and a car driver running up this amount of overtime? Surely <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Menzies</inline> is not driving around in the car, because he is so ill that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser</inline> has had to provide him with a part-time medical orderly. </para>
          <para>Now let us have a look at the situation with regard to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> McEwen &#39;s car driver. In 1971 his base salary was $3,584.  His  overtime for that year was $2,518. In 1972 his base salary was $3,730 and his overtime amounted to $2,445. In 1973 his base salary was $4,575 and his overtime amounted to $2,1 12. In 1974 his base salary was $5,608 and his overtime amounted to $3,789. In 1 975 his base salary was $6,770 and his overtime amounted to $4,217. From January to June of this year his base salary was $3,537 and his overtime amounted to $1,507. 1 think it is a scandal that 2 drivers of 2 ex-Prime Ministers are receiving that kind of money in overtime. But if we look at the situation with regard to ex-Prime Minister Forde- a Labor Prime Minister- in nearly every category he has no entitlement except for some office staff. The cost amounts only to a few thousand dollars. I shall not go into that now. I think I have explained the point. I hope that the public at large takes notice of it. I shall have a lot more to say about that matter when we come back in the autumn session. </para>
          <para>The other matter I wish to raise again relates to a matter which I raised in the Senate during the adjournment debate on 2 December 1976. It relates to community health centres and a screed that was put out by the present Minister for Health, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt. Mr Hunt</inline> wrote to me concerning the matter I raised on 2 December. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In the Senate adjournment debate on 2 December 1976 you referred to my letter of 18 November 1976 regarding 1976-77 Commonwealth grants under the Community Health Program.

            <para>My letter was in no way misleading as evidenced by the sentence contained therein which you quoted in the debate- </para>

          <para class="block">He then referred to a portion of his letter quoted by me during the debate in connection with the $70m being allocated for the community health program. He went on to say: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is clear that the list of projects attached to my letter was not described as a list of projects for new health program funding as you implied, but rather a list of previously approved projects which make up the total South Australian Program, and in respect of which continuation funding was made available by the Commonwealth through a block grant of $5. 1 million to the State. </para>

          <para class="block">He went on to make further comment about a letter which I had received from <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cass</inline> and which I had read to the Senate. The Minister disclaimed the comments of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Cass.</inline> I shall not refer to that now. In the last paragraph of the previous letter to which I referred during the adjournment debate- the letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> dated 18 November- he states: </para>

            <para>Attached to this letter is a list of the projects in your State which have been approved for Commonwealth purposes in relation to the $5. 1 m block grant to your State. </para>

          <para class="block">
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline>said that that $5.1m had been given in this fiinancial year. Yet he accuses me of not being on the ball when I ask for some clarification as to whether his document was a misleading one. He said that it was not misleading. </para>
          <para class="block">Yet in that letter he talks about a $5.1m block grant to my State, that is, South Australia. </para>
          <para>I refer now to the appendices which he attached to that correspondence, and in particular, to the attachment relating to South Australia. It is set out in 2 columns. One column is headed Name and Location of Project&#39; and underneath is listed all the projects for the various Federal divisions. The other column is headed &#39;Description of Project as Approved for Community Health Program Funding in 1976-77&#39;. It is clearly set out there that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> was implying to the people at large and to the Press, as is evident from the Press releases that were put out, that this funding which he announced, this $5.1m for South Australia, was for the 1976-77 program. Yet he stated in his last letter to me that I was completely wrong in assuming that that is what he meant. He said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>It is clear that the list of projects attached to my letter was not described as a list of projects for new health funding as you implied. </para>

          <para class="block">What else could I assume when looking at those appendices which he circulated to all members and which definitely state in the description of the projects that they are projects approved for community health funding in 1976-77? He went on to say to me in his letter of 7 December that he did not say that. I must have a very poor grasp of English if he is right and I am wrong. However, I checked with the South Australian Department of Health concerning the projects listed for funding in the 1976-77 program. Part of a telex which I received from my colleagues in South Australia stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">PROJECT COMMENCEMENT DATES </para>
            <para>All community health projects have an official project number, part of which identifies the year in which the project was approved for commencement. A check of the departmental records shows that of the present total of continuing projects 26 were approved to commence at July 1973, 24 at July 1974 and 25 at July 1975. No new projects have been approved since the latter date. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I emphasise that no new projects have been approved since July 1975. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> wrote to all South Australian members of Parliament that he had funded all the projects that he listed. On a check with the Department I found that most of the projects had been commenced under grants given by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Everingham,</inline> the then Minister for Health. In that period buildings were commenced, completed and occupied. Some have been operating for many months. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> claimed that this Government was funding the projects in this financial year. </para>
          <para>I ask the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> who represents the Minister for Health in the Senate to obtain for me during the recess information concerning the date of announcement of funds for each of the projects listed for South Australia, the date of commencement of construction, the date of completion of construction and the date of occupation of the facility. I would like this information so that I can refer to the matter next session. I suggest that whenever projects of this nature are announced in the future, dates should be shown alongside the listed projects, together with all of the details so that others do not have to go to all the trouble that I have had to go to. I would have been embarrassed if I had made a Press statement that I had been advised by the Federal Minister for Health that a certain project had been funded for a certain district. After releasing such a Press statement I might have been asked whether an identical project was to be built in the same place. We would have run that risk had we not been vigilant enough to examine the letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hunt</inline> put out and the appendices to it. </para>

            <para>- I am sorry that my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> may have inadvertently given wrong information yesterday as a result of what I was trying to whisper to her while the question was being put. The only direct knowledge that I have is that I saw the Prime Minister&#39;s movement sheet for his arrival at Fairbairn airport and amongst the instructions I recall reading- that was on Monday nightthat all shoes used during that visit had to be placed or kept in the plastic bags in which they had been placed and given to Customs, or perhaps it is the Department of Health, for fumigation. I tried to whisper this information to my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> but she quite understandably misunderstood me and thought that these people were wearing some sort of plastic overshoes. All I can say- we both probably need more detailed information-is that, as I recall the list of instructions for those travelling in the party, precautions had been instituted and I assume they were taken. </para>

It follows questions asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren</inline> and me last week regarding possible dangers to Australia&#39;s livestock industry following the visit by the Prime Ministerial party to  President  Suharto&#39;s farm in Indonesia. Last week <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> stated the precautions relevant to the Prime Minister&#39;s return, but journalists who had accompanied the Prime Minister returned to Australia by various direct and indirect routes over a period of several days and serious doubts remain as to whether adequate precautions were taken. To clear the matter up I ask whether the Minister will obtain for the Senate details as to the number of Australians who visited the farm and information on when and how these people returned to Australia. Can the Minister guarantee that the clothing of these people was correctly quarantined and fumigated? </para>

          <para>I refer to your question without notice on 1 9 October 1 976, to my colleague the Minister for Social Security on quarantine arrangements relating to the Prime Minister&#39;s recent visit to farms in Indonesia. </para>
          <para>In line with normal practice adopted for senior dignitaries arriving in Australia, entry procedures to apply for the return of the Prime Minister and his party were discussed in detail at an interdepartmental committee meeting prior to the Prime Minister&#39;s return. The purpose of such meetings is to ensure that necessary regulatory procedures are known to all parties involved and that protocol and ceremonial can be adjusted where necessary to meet essential regulatory requirements. </para>
          <para>From a quarantine viewpoint any special arrangements made on such occasions are developed against the overriding requirement that there can be no relaxation of quarantine surveillance. This approach has of course, the full support of the Prime Minister himself who has made this clear to all his Ministers. </para>
          <para>In the present case, in accordance with prior arrangements, all shoes worn by the Prime Minister and his accompanying party on agricultural farms in China, Hong Kong or Manila were collected before arrival in Australia and placed in plastic bags for examination and disinfection where examination indicated this was necessary. The Prime Minister and the accompanying party of twenty returned to Australia via Darwin on Monday 1 1 October. The shoes concerned were in plastic bags as arranged and following examination in Darwin, eight pairs of footwear were cleaned and disinfected. Also as arranged, all quarantinable items of animal or plant origin including gifts accompanying the pany were segregated and subsequently examined by quarantine personnel in Canberra. </para>
          <para>These arrangements applied to the Prime Minister and his accompanying party only. It is understood that a number of Australians including journalists, who travelled as private citizens and not as members of the official party, also visited the farms covered by the Prime Minister. The number and identity of these persons would not be known to quarantine officials. However, on their return to Australia, these people would be subject to the normal Customs/Quarantine surveillance measures applying to all persons entering this country. </para>

            <para>- During the Prime Minister&#39;s absence in Indonesia photographs were published in Australian newspapers accompanied by reports which showed that the Prime Minister and some members of his staff, journalists and other Australians, were visiting and walking through an intensive cattle feed lot on President Suharto&#39;s farm in Java, an area in which, among other things foot, and mouth disease is endemic. After a good deal of confusion and some evasion which is revealed in the documents which have been incorporated, it became clear that although the footwear worn on the farm by people on the Prime Minister&#39;s staff was adequately disinfected, the other persons who were also on the farm could not even be identified. That is made very clear in the final couple of paragraphs of the letter of the Minister for Health of 10 November. It reads: </para>

          <para>It does not provide that assurance. I have spoken to some of the journalists who visited President Suharto&#39;s farm on Java. Normal procedures may have been followed when they returned to Australia; but I do not know whether the procedures followed were &#39;normal&#39;. What happended was that those returning were asked whether they had been on a farm abroad. They replied: &#39;Yes&#39;. They were asked whether their shoes were clean. Some of them were wearing the shoes that they had worn on the farm. A visual inspection showed that they looked pretty clean. The virus that causes foot and mouth disease, of course, is not visible to the naked eye. No other precautions were taken. The footwear which was worn by these people when they returned to Australia was not fumigated. </para>
          <para>We face conflicting objectives with quarantine procedures. If we want to have absolute security, we ban anyone or anything coming into Australia. Some adjustment or some sort of trade-off has to be made between the security objective and the convenience objective. Precisely how much emphasis ought to be placed on either of those conflicting objectives is arguable, I suppose. I submit that, in these circumstances, the procedures applied were not adequate and revealed considerable negligence. The circumstances were that people who had visited an extremely high risk area re-entered Australia with only a visual examination of the footwear that they were wearing in that high risk area. </para>
          <para>I think that the present Prime Minister, more so than a typical Australian Prime Minister because he has an agricultural background, ought to have been especially aware of the potential dangers and ought to have insisted on or taken some special precautions to see that all of the people who visited that farm in Indonesia were examined adequately when they came back to Australia, as the members of his own party were. The Prime Minister, of all people, ought to have been aware of this requirement and ought to have seen that adequate precautions were taken. Perhaps we have been lucky. Perhaps foot and mouth disease was not introduced into Australia through this event. But there was a considerable and a greater than normal risk that it could have been introduced. I trust that, if in future the Prime Minister is to make visits abroad and for reasons of publicity or whatever he visits farms owned by leaders of other countries and takes parties of officials and Australian journalists to those farms, he will ensure that more adequate precautions are taken to protect Australia from exotic diseases than were taken in this instance. </para>

          <para>This Bill will impose income tax for the 1976-77 financial year, at the rates declared in the Bill, on the 1975-76 incomes of companies and the 1976-77 incomes of superannuation funds. The rates of tax payable by individuals and trustees for the 1976-77 financial year were, of course, enacted earlier this year when personal income tax indexation was introduced. The rates of tax declared by this Bill do not vary from those declared for the 1975-76 financial year. For companies and for superannuation funds that are taxable only because of a failure to observe the 30/20 investment rules, the rate is again 42.5 per cent. For superannuation funds that fail to comply with other exemption requirements, the rate is again 50 per cent. So too, is the rate of additional tax payable by private companies that do not make a sufficient distribution of profits. Notes on the Bill are included in an explanatory memorandum being made available to honourable senators and I do not think that there is any need for me to go into further detail at this introductory stage. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>at this late stage in the session, it is extremely difficult to consider seriously some of the complexities and implications arising from the 4 Bills that the Senate is now debating, especially the Income Tax Assessment Amendment Bill (No. 3) 1976 and the Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill 1976, which deal with substantial changes relating to the write-off of certain mining investments and associated aspects. The Opposition has mixed reactions to the measures. We have no objection to the deductibility of expenditure on railway transport facilities, harbour surveys, additional dredging, navigational aids and breakwaters, but we do have reservations about the shortening of the write-off period from 25 years to 10 years for other assets. There is a series of policy aspects involved with this matter and they have been best covered by the Opposition&#39;s earlier statements on minerals and energy policies. The Income Tax (Companies and Superannuation Funds) Bill 1976 which increases the retention allowance for undistributed income from 50 per cent to 60 per cent will have some advantages. It will allow some smaller businesses, particularly those which are privately owned and are in industries where cash is needed, to have stock accumulation on a short term basis. However, like all tax measures, it does leave the opportunity for abuse and I hope that the Taxation Office will closely scrutinise the operation of this measure and report to the Parliament if there are abuses. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I specifically address myself more to the proposed new division of the Income Tax Amendment Bill (No. 3) which deals with the Government&#39;s income equalisation deposit scheme. The Loan (Drought Bonds) Amendment Bill permits the conversion of stock under the drought bounds scheme into an income equalisation deposit on application and is supported by the Opposition. The income equalisation deposit scheme, or perhaps more popularly known as the IED scheme, as legislated for in the 3 Bills before the Senate, is different in operation from that envisaged and described by the Minister at the time of the last Budget. Reductions under the scheme are to be limited to taxable income other than income from property and are not to exceed 40 per cent of gross primary production income for the particular year of income. Thus income from gross primary production only can be deposited, not non-farm income as previously announced. I am sure that it was the public comment which arose out of the proposals that were announced in the Budget and the reaction that came from that announcement which has caused the Government to reassess the scheme and to amend its earlier proposal. </para>
          <para>However, the Government has continued to refuse the advice from the Industries Assistance Commission in relation to the payment of interest. It has insisted that interest be paid on the full amount deposited. The IAC in its earlier consideration of these proposals, rather than just the legislation, was critical of this solution. In its report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Rural Income Fluctuations- Certain Taxation Measures</inline> published on 30 June 1 975, at page 9 it stated: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The payment of interest on the full face value of the I.E.D. would be unsatisfactory. Depositors would thus receive interest on the deferred tax component of the deposit Taxpayers should not receive any benefit from the actual deferral of tax. Moreover, the payment of interest on the tax component gives greatest advantage to taxpayers with high incomes. The Commission considers it unsatisfactory that a scheme intended to allow all taxpayers to smooth their taxable incomes should unduly favour persons on high incomes. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The Opposition believes that there is a need to alleviate the problems with which persons on fluctuating incomes are faced. The inequities of our present tax system are well known to the community, the Opposition, the Government and its advisers. There is a real need to research and fundamentally alter the tax system so that no undue burden falls on producers and the work force. </para>
          <para>The reason the Opposition is supporting the IED scheme in general principle, although we have some misgivings about the precise nature of this legislation, is that the Australian Labor Party in its updating of its rural policy decided to support this as a very desirable amendment to the existing taxation system. Schemes of this nature are to be applauded as they are directed to alleviating the tax burden falling on persons for no other reason than that they have large fluctuating incomes. The real concern of the Opposition is that the scheme does not achieve in full what it should be designed to achieve and the Government seems to be adopting the attitude that once legislation for income equalisation is passed it will relieve the Government of its responsibilities to rural producers, particularly those producers suffering a drastic drop in real farm income from last year&#39;s low level, a drop which has not been substantially improved by the Government&#39;s manipulation of the exchange rate. In fact, this scheme does not give any short term relief to producers in genuine need and we believe, therefore, that those farmers who have little or no income- the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> has referred to this himself on many occasions- will not be interested in placing money in the IED scheme because they do not have the money to do so. The long term implications of the scheme are to be applauded to the extent that it mitigates against the detrimental tax burden falling on farmers with fluctuating incomes. If, as I think, it purports to be a scheme to achieve equity between taxpayers it is only fair that the operation of the scheme is placed under close scrutiny to determine to what extent it is equitable. </para>
          <para>The IAC, as I have indicated, has criticised inequitable situations which the payment of interest on full term deposits would achieve. If such a scheme is put into operation to do equity it should not have this inbuilt inequitable provision which unduly favours persons on higher incomes. The Government has not answered this charge in the other place or generally. Nor has it indicated in the second reading speech the reasons it ignored the recommendations of the IAC. I am not suggesting that the IAC is necessarily correct in all of its conclusions or recommendations, but I think that when it does make recommendations in matters of this nature, the Government should indicate why it sets them aside. No one denies the right of the Government to go against the IAC recommendations. But as a Parliament we are surely entitled, as the Australian people are also entitled, to know what the reasons are for ignoring the advice. </para>
          <para>In introducing a worthwhile scheme such as this, the Government is spoiling it in order to obtain an additional benefit for that minority of wealthy farmers- I stress a minority- which may consider it worthwhile to place large sums into the scheme. In my discussions with farm leaders, they indicated that they can see some advantages to them but if they are able to have a levelling out of their income, from a tax point of view, they may be able to ride out the bumps that are encountered in rural production and in market changes. In those circumstances, of course, the scheme has some validity and needs some support. The primary producer members of the Cabinet, for example, who do not rely on farm incomes to survive and who, because of their other activities have a high tax liability, can place up to 40 per cent of gross primary production income of any year into the scheme and receive the 5 per cent interest on the full sum lodged. As I had indicated in my speech on the Budget, people on high incomes gain quite considerably under the scheme and are not the sort of people who need assistance. A taxpayer with income above $28,250, who pays 65 cents tax on every dollar, will be able to deposit the excess for 12 months, provided it is derived from primary production, and does not exceed 40 per cent of the income from that production, and receive an effective interest rate on it of 14.3 per cent, and that is inequitable. </para>
          <para>I feel sure no more encouragement need be given to those sorts of persons. The Government has to be condemned for not accepting the criticism and removing this inequity. By contrast, most genuine farmers will not be receiving such benefits under the scheme. The thrifty smallscale farmer, for example, who is able in a good year to save a couple of thousand dollars and has a much smaller tax liability because, for example, his income is from $6,000 to $ 10,000 a year, does not have a large deferred tax component on the sum deposited under the scheme. It is true that he is also obtaining5 per cent on the full sum deposited, but he would be doing much better if he paid the tax, and invested the balance of the sum at a much higher commercial rate of interest. At lease he would keep ahead of inflation. </para>
          <para>It would have been more equitable for small farmers if the Government had followed the IAC report and had decided to raise the rate of interest payable closer to a commercial rate of interest on that sum deposited which was not a deferred tax component. In a sense, by not accepting this recommendation, the Government is playing a cynical confidence trick on genuine farmers, who are hoping that the scheme will assist them, when in fact, it will only have a limited effect. It would appear that if the Government had not decided to pay interest on the full sum deposited there would have been no need to restrict the scheme to primary producers, and income derived from primary production. Surely it is not beyond the capabilities of our draftsmen to formulate a non-exploitable scheme which would cover all persons who have undue tax burdens placed on them because they have large fluctuations in their incomes from year to year. </para>
          <para>I believe rural producers do not want to be singled out for special treatment. I believe they would have no objection if the scheme was made available to all taxpayers whether they are artists, architects or rural producers. This view is supported by the IAC which, in its recommendations, indicated that it could see no reason why the IED scheme should not be made available to all taxpayers. Of course, that is an equitable position and one which should have been reached by the Government. Instead, the scheme is confined to rural producers and to rural incomes, primarily because the Government- </para>

              <para>- Yes. I believe that consideration of taxation legislation, which is highly technical, requires the use of a considerable amount of notes. It is the Opposition&#39;s concern that these benefits, which should be available to all taxpayers, in fact are benefiting one particular section of the community. That arises from the complicated and clumsy way in which the legislation has been drafted. I seek the Minister&#39;s advice as to whether a person who has deposited a sum under the scheme can use that deposit, whether directly or indirectly, as security for obtaining on the open market a sum of money equivalent to the sum deposited. The Opposition would like some assurance as to whether in fact there will be restrictions on those who deposit their money in the IED scheme then being able to take it on to the money market and seek certain advantages there. There is ambiguity in the legislation in respect of that matter. The legislation provides that sums cannot be transferred from persons to persons, but can they be transferred from persons to companies? That is the sort of complexity in the legislation which we would like answered by the Government. In his second reading speech <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton</inline> stated: </para>

          </quote>
          <para class="block">That upper limit of $100,000, however, can be easily sidestepped- implicit recognition of that fact is found in the legislation- by a depositor who creates partnerships, nominal or otherwise, in companies in order to split his or her income. By doing so, each partner or company created is entitled to deductions up to $100,000, even though only one enterprise is involved. It is those sorts of anomalies which we believe ought to be answered by the Government. </para>
          <para>A number of members of the Opposition wanted to discuss this legislation, but in the interests of trying to complete the session they have surrendered their rights to rise and discuss these matters and have sought the opportunity for me to raise them with the Government. We are concerned with the income averaging scheme, which is not provided for in any legislation. It seems to me that there ought to be some explanation from the Minister as to why the Government has not implemented the IAC recommendation to abolish the $16,000 limit on incomes eligible for averaging and so institute a transition provision comparable with those provided in 1966 for the removal of the $16,000 limit. There are a number of matters which need to be raised, but the Government knows that the Bills have the support of the Opposition. It knows that even if the Opposition had moved any amendments which might have sought to iron out some of the difficulties and anomalies that we believe exist in this legislation, there would be little chance of the Senate agreeing to them. While the Opposition does not oppose the legislation, it rebukes the Government for not providing Australians with a fluctuating income, a non-discriminatory, non-exploitable tax planning system which would be of benefit to all Australians. </para>

If what the honourable senator said is the case then I regret that it is so. Turning to the Bill, whether a deposit can be used as security is entirely a matter for the depositor to arrange with his would be creditor. Deposits, however, are not transferable from one person to another because of the tax deductions. In relation to the payment of interest on income equalisation deposits, interest is to be payable initially at 5 per cent a year on the full amount of the deposit. It would have added a fairly unnecessary complication to pay interest, possibly at higher rates, on the amount deposited less tax savings. The income equalisation deposit scheme is as simple as it can be made, according to my information. Of course, its operations will be kept under review. </para>

The Government s proposal would mean that for mines with lives greater than 5 years, about 67 per cent of the allowable capital expenditure in the first year would be deductible in the first 5 years.

            <para>-The Marriage Amendment Bill is a Bill to amend the Marriage Act of 1961-1973 and for related purposes. The Opposition does not object to the amendments to the Act. Under normal circumstances we would have taken the opportunity to discuss a whole range of the clauses of the Bill. It is possible that out of such a debate in the chamber minor alterations might have been made to the Bill. But in the circumstances and owing to the lateness in the session at which the Bill has been brought on for debate we shall allow the Bill to pass without opposition. </para>

            <para>- The acting Minister for National Resources has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(1)">
              <para>No. Fast breeder reactors (FBRs) have inherently a higher nuclear efficiency or breeding potential, and a higher thermal efficiency than current thermal nuclear reactors. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>In a way, yes. By using plutonium bred from uranium-238 in present day thermal reactors, which rely on uranium-235 for their operation, FBRs will generate about 1.1 to 1.3 times more plutonium at each pass of fuel elements through the reactor. This number is called the fuel breeding ratio. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>When the irradiated fuel is reprocessed, plutonium and uranium are separated and recycled into new fuel elements. If recycled often enough through FBRs, natural uranium can give up about 70 per cent of its stored energy instead of about 1 per cent as in present thermal reactors. In this sense and over a period of time, FBRs will &#39;multiply&#39; the energy available from the original uranium-235 by a factor of about 70. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>There are no commercial FBRs in operation. The U.K., France and the U.S.S.R. have prototype FBRs in operation. The breeding capability of an individual FBR is defined by its breeding ratio, i.e. the quantity of fuel it produces divided by that which it uses. The breeding ratio is determined by a number of factors such as the type and physical form of the fuel used, the physical size and shape of the reactor core and its surrounding material, and the distribution of the breeding material (uranium-238) in the reactor. In the prototype FBRs no attempt has been made to maximise breeding ratios and as yet no measurements of the actual breeding ratio have been made. Earlier experiments, projected to a commercial reactor size of above 1000 megawatts electrical output, suggest breeding ratios of about 1.1 to 1.3 using uranium oxide fuel. For a given breeding ratio, the power rating for given reactor core loading determines the rate at which new fuel is generated and a low value is being used at present. At these ratings, fuel doubling times should be in the range 12 to 25 years. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(4)">
              <para>Research on an international basis aims to improve present breeding ratios through the use of fuel forms such as uranium metal or uranium carbide instead of uranium oxide; use of these alternative fuel forms would increase breeding ratios and decrease fuel doubling times. Better transfer of heat from the fuel elements to the sodium coolant would allow increased power rating for a given reactor core size and so decreased doubling times. Such improvements should ensure fuel doubling times in the region of 12 to 15 years. In addition, consideration is being given to the use of thorium, a fertile material which can breed uranium-233 another nuclear fuel with properties roughly equivalent to uranium-235. </para>

              <para>to (5) The Commonwealth Government has supported the Australian Mineral Development Laboratories since their establishment in 1959 through work guarantees. The main users of AMDEL &#39;s services under these arrangements have been the CSIRO, the Bureau of Mineral Resources and the Australian Atomic Energy Commission; the Commonwealth Government guarantee has been allocated between these parties in the proportion 6:5:1 respectively. The Government has recently given consideration to the future funding arrangements for AMDEL. As stated by the Leader of the Government in the Senate in his answer to a Question Without Notice from the honourable senator on 10 November 1976, arrangements are in hand for discussions among the three co-sponsors of AMDEL; the Commonwealth is to be represented by the Minister for National Resources. </para>

              <para>1 ) A major Intertown Public Transport Study was initiated late in 1974 by the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Capital Territory to investigate and report on a transport system which might be suitable for an intertown public transport system for Canberra. Two categories of public transport systems were consideredconventional (bus, light/heavy rail) and nonconventional (automatic rail systems orginating overseas). </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para class="block">The latter is taken to cover the term &#39;rapid transit system&#39; used in your question. </para>
          <para>After analysis and evaluation of systems in both categories, three of the main conclusions reached were: no non-conventional public transport system could be recommended for installation in Canberra in the near future; a conventional priority bus system is the preferred system for Canberra for at least the next 5- 10 years; changes in Canberra&#39;s present public transport service and the improvement of the existing intertown link should take place gradually. The Department of the Capital Territory is currently re-examining its operational strategy (e.g. routes, scheduling and timetables) and there will be amendments made early in 1977. The Department of the Capital Territory and the National Capital Development Commission are planning the establishment of convenient and efficient interchanges at Belconnen and at City and these improvements, coupled with priority for buses and the development of further bus services where the need becomes apparent, are in keeping with the overall public transport objectives. </para>
          <list type="decimal">

              <para>Action is being taken to implement the recommendations of this study. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The operation of local feeder and express services have been improved progressively to meet demand. Since 1973 the bus fleet has expanded significantly and this can be shown by considering the number of passengers carried. (In 1973 8 400 000 passengers and in 1976 14 500 000 passengers.) This represents a 72 per cent increase over a period when the population only increased by 17 per cent. The addition of off-street bus stations and interchanges will be a further attraction. </para>
          <para>A major step has been taken with the identification of an intertown corridor, which is capable of being developed for both bus and rail based transport systems. This links the town centres and will progressively be developed as a separate transport road, initially for express buses, but allowing provision for the introduction of a newer form of transport technology, perhaps rapid transit, when the use of public transport reaches a sufficiently high level. It is expected that the first stages of the separate route will be in operation as an efficient priority bus way within three years. </para>

            <para>Did the Queensland Minister for Police, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newbery,</inline> in the Queensland Parliament on 8 September 1976, state, in relation to the police raid on Cedar Bay on 19 August 1976, that the attendance of the naval patrol vessel HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Bayonet</inline> during the raid was considered necessary because of the unusually large number of trawlers reported to be in the area, some of which were suspected of drug trafficking. If so, (a) is the reason advanced by the Queensland Police Minister for the presence of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Bayonet</inline> correct; (b) how many vessels were searched during the tour of the area by HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Bayonet;</inline> (c) were any charges laid as a result of investigations made by the crew of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Bayonet.</inline> If so, what are the details; and (d) was there evidence of drugs on any of the vessels searched.

Figures are, however, available for the expenditures of the Nuclear Power and Reactors Division of the Agency. The objective of this Division is &#39;to disseminate information on the technology and economics of nuclear power, reactors, nuclear fuels and materials, to provide assistance and advice to member States in the application of nuclear power for generating electricity and for water desalination, and to facilitate the use of research reactors for research and training&#39;. </para>

          <para>No decision has been taken by the Government on any special privileges which might be granted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> as a former Prime Minister nor have any been sought. Nevertheless, for completeness I have included in the tables expenditure for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> as Leader of the Opposition for the period 1 January to 30 June 1976. </para>
          <para>Where possible, expenditures shown for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon, Mr Whitlam</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Gorton</inline> when he was a sitting member of Parliament, do not include expenditures on entitlements as members of Parliament. The Tables indicate where this has not been possible. </para>
          <para>Expenditures on entitlements to travel, other than by staff, are not included. These entitlements derive in some cases from privileges attaching to the Life Gold Pass which does not form part of the special privileges of a former Prime Minister. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> are entitled to certain travel privileges as members of Parliament. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>Information on net direct industry assistance on an Australia-wide basis is set out on pages 76-78 of Statement No. 3 attached to the 1976-77 Budget Speech. For reasons indicated below, information on the amount of such assistance paid to firms in a particular State is in many cases either not available, or subject to qualification. </para>
            <para>For many schemes of assistance, records are not maintained on a State basis, and in some cases it would not be practicable to extract the information sought in view of the large number of claims processed or because the assistance does not take the form of payments to individual firms. It should also be noted that, as many firms operate across State boundaries, assistance paid to a firm in one State may be applied in another. Similarly, the Commonwealth&#39;s contribution to wool promotion would be largely expended overseas; but, while it could be expected to benefit wool producers in all States, nevertheless it could not be dissected on a State basis. </para>
            <para>Some assistance to industry is provided through the States. A dissection of the amounts involved, by State, is shown in the document &#39;Payments to or for the States and Local Government Authorities 1 976-77 &#39;, Budget Paper No. 7. </para>
            <para>The Western Australian component for these items is summarised below. As indicated in Budget Paper No. 7 the State dissections for some items for 1976-77 are estimated and do not represent a commitment to provide the stated amounts: </para>

        <para>Note: Since the Budget the Minister for Primary Industry has announced details of a new Rural Adjustment Scheme to operate from 1 January 1977. The Commonwealth has indicated that it will support an approvals program of $3.25m for Western Australia for the first six months of the Scheme. Most of the expenditure in respect of these approvals is expected to be incurred in 1 977-78. </para>

        <para>Available information on assistance paid direct to firms in Western Australia, or in respect of activities undertaken in Western Australia, corresponding to the information set out on pages 76-78 of Statement No. 3 attached to the 1976-77 Budget Speech, is as follows: </para>

        <para>Similar information for 1975-76 for export development grants should be available shortly when the report on the activities of the Export Development Grants Board for 1975-76 is presented in Parliament. </para>
        <para>For reasons which have been indicated above, it is not practicable to identify accurately the fifty firms which received the greatest amount of assistance, as would be necessary to answer one part of the honourable senator&#39;s question, or to give a complete dissection of the amounts paid to the various sectors for which total outlays are shown at pages 76-78 of the Statement referred to. </para>
        <para>In regard to the part of the question concerning investment allowance, an estimate has been made of the amount of assistance to Western Australian firms afforded in 1975-76 through the operation of the investment allowance. The income tax revenue involved in respect of assessments issued by the Western Austraiian office of the Australian Taxation Office is put at about $lm in terms of revenue foregone in 1975-76. It should be noted however that this estimate does not take account of investment allowance for expenditure in Western Australia that may have been incurred by companies having their central management and control outside Western Australia, the income tax returns of which would have been assessed in other offices. </para>

              <para>Initially, STD facilities were provided on a pointtopoint basis only and the first extension of the facility following Ministerial approval ofthe Community Telephone Plan (announced in August 1959) was in May 1960 for calls from Windsor to Sydney. Between 1967 and 1969, automatic trunk exchanges were installed in all capital cities and most major centres in all States, forming the framework for the present day national STD service. Today almost 94 per cent of all telephone services have access to STD and 94 per cent of all calls that can use STD are subscriber dialled. </para>

              <para>1 ) The differential in rates of pension for single and married pensioners was introduced by the Liberal/Country Party Coalition Government in November 1963 and differential rates for single and married pensioners have been paid since that date. When the differential was introduced the single rate was about 55 per cent of the combined married rate; by August 1974, due to the relative level of increases in the single and married rates of pension, the ratio had increased to approximately 60 per cent, and this ratio has been maintained since. </para>

          <para>Estimates vary of the relative needs of a single person and a married couple and there is no reliable Australian evidence available. Studies in the United States have indicated that to maintain the same standard of living an aged single person would require about 67 per cent of the combined income of an aged married couple. The Report of the Canadian Special Senate Committee on Poverty in 1 972 recommended a &#39; basic guarantee level &#39; for a single person set at 60 per cent of that for a married couple. The Report of the Royal Commission of Inquiry into Social Security in New Zealand in 1972 also considered that 60 per cent was an appropriate ratio of single to married rates. The ratio of &#39;at least 60 per cent&#39; was also favoured by Professor R. F. Henderson and his team from the Institute of Applied Economic and Social Research at Melbourne University in their report of the 1966 study of poverty in Melbourne &#39;People in Poverty- Melbourne Survey&#39;. In the First Main Report of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty, Professor Henderson recommended pension rates that would result in a 6 1 per cent relationship between the standard and combined married rates of pension. </para>

              <para>On Home Island, Cocos, which is inhabited by the Cocos Malay community, there is less than full attendance of school-age children at the local primary school. In consideration of community attitudes it must be noted, however, that no formal schooling was available on Home Island until 1966, and that a trained, Australian teacher has been provided on the Island only since 1973. The increasing desire amongst parents for their children to be educated is reflected in the fact that, with one exception, all children born since 1 967 have attended school. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>I draw the Minister&#39;s attention to an article in the Australian Financial Review by Robert Haupt which refers to the export of beef to the United States. The article states that in American eyes Australia &#39;beat the system&#39; of meat import restrictions next year, so next year will be different. It goes on to say that the American Administration wants to deal with an official who can negotiate on Australia&#39;s behalf and wants to have the matter of beating the system resolved by the end of December. Three things rankle with the American Administration: They are Australia&#39;s use of the loophole of the Puerto Rico free trade zone under virtually false labelling, Australia&#39;s reluctance to deal with the problem of low priced Australian beef going into Canada and the influence this in turn has on the American market. I ask: Why did the Minister&#39;s advisers, in a recent letter to me, deny that some Australian exporters are trying to beat the system and are disadvantaging the legitimate exporters of Australian beef to the United States? Will the Minister re-examine my request and warn these exporters who are using roughhouse tactics that their questionable conduct will not be tolerated and, if necessary, withdraw their export licences? </para>

              <item label="(a)">
                <para>During the financial year 1975-76, staff numbers reduced by 1 1 1 1 in the Third Division ( 1 . 8 per cent) and by 5849 in the Fourth Division (5.8 per cent) after allowance is made for transfers of staff into and out of the Public Service Act coverage. </para>

            </list>
            <para>In conformity with Government directives, reductions due to staff ceilings have been achieved by the non-replacement of wastage and by redeployment. The higher wastage rate in the Fourth Division arises from the particular designations and the high proportion of short term temporary employees it contains. However, the effect of the differing wastage rates should be kept in perspective; for instance, at 30 June 1975, the Fourth Division constituted 61 per cent of the Service, while at 30 June 1 976 it made up 60 per cent. </para>
            <list type="loweralpha">
              <item label="(b)">
                <para>The reduction in the Fourth Division has caused some difficulties, particularly in areas such as registries and typing pools. The Public Service Board is continuously monitoring the situation and directing essential recruitment to ensure that imbalances (in both the Third and Fourth Divisions) are redressed and that the overall efficiency of departments is maintained. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="(c)">
                <para>The Public Service Board has considered the suggestion that divisional as well as departmental staff constraints be applied. In addition, other ceiling alternatives have been explored, e.g. ceilings by categories of staff or by geographic locations. However, such ceilings would only introduce inflexibilities into departmental management as well as generating an increased management workload in departments. The appropriate mix of staff by divisions, classifications, category, and location can already be controlled by establishment and recruitment procedures. Staff ceilings provide the additional control necessary to ensure that Government objectives of containing the overall levels of Government employment are achieved. </para>

The following table shows the total number of placements confirmed by the Commonwealth Employment Service (CES) under the scheme up to February 1976 when collection of data ceased. For the most part, a confirmed placement represents one person placed in one vacancy created under the RED scheme. However, it would include an unknown, but probably small, proportion of persons who were, in fact, employed on more than one individual RED project during the currency of the scheme. The figures do not include those persons who performed supervisory roles and were made available by local councils. </para>

            <para>The Industries Assistance Commission, as part of its investigations into the financing of rural research, conducted a survey of some 230 authorities and enterprises (State and Federal departments, agencies, commissions, private businesses, universities, agricultural colleges, industry associations, co-operatives and councils) identified as undertaking research which is wholly or significantly rural in application. The IAC study related to the 3 years ending June 1974. In respect of dairy research, it appears that total expenditure was of the order of: </para>

        </para>
        <para>Details of expenditure by major groupings of rural research agencies are set out in the table. The Commission has certain reservations about deficiencies in the results of the survey, in particular with regard to its coverage of the private sector enterprises, leading probably to underestimation of total expenditure on rural research (including dairy research). </para>
        <para>The dairy industry would have benefited also from research findings in other rural industries, where these findings have relevance to the dairy industry a share of &#39;multi-industry&#39; research expenditure, i.e., expenditure which benefited more than one industry group and which could not be allocated. The IAC study reported over 20 per cent of total expenditure on rural research as &#39; multi-industry &#39;. </para>
        <para>The main avenue in the funding of dairy research for which the Minister for Primary Industry has responsibility is through the Dairying Research Trust Account. This Account is funded by a levy on wholemilk and butterfat; expenditure from the Account for dairy research purposes is matched by contributions from the Commonwealth. </para>
        <para>Information about the program of dairy research supported by this Trust Account appears in: </para>

        <para>Annual Reports of the Dairying Research Committee for the years ended 30 June, 1973, 1974, 1975 and 1976. </para>
        <para>These reports provide the detail sought, other than the names of the persons in charge of each project. Between forty and sixty projects have been conducted annually. </para>

            <para>The documents mentioned carry progress reports of the projects supported under the dairy research program and, as available, summaries of completed work. The research workers are also under an obligation to publish their results in professional journals. </para>

        <para>Some indication of the progress in dairy research and in the application of research can be gauged by the continued advance in productivity per cow, per farm, per man and per processing plant that the dairy industry has been able to achieve despite difficult economic conditions. Milk yield per cow, for example, rose by 20 per cent over the past decade (1964-65-1973-74). There have also been major gains made in the range, throughput and quality of dairy manufacturers. A large part of these advances in technology can be attributed to the research work conducted by State Departments of Agriculture, CSIRO, universities and other bodies, including projects funded through the joint IndustryCommonwealth Dairy Research Trust Account. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para>Inquiries made through the Australian Embassy in Lisbon indicate that virtually all the Timorese evacuees went to Portugal voluntarily. This resulted from an approach by Portugese General M. E. Silva to the Indonesian authorities to negotiate the release of 23 Portugese military persons and arrange the evacuation of approximately 1000 Timorese civilians who did not wish to remain in Timor in the changed circumstances. </para>
          <para>These people would not be regarded as refugees and it would be inappropriate to consider their claims for migrant entry to Australia as being different from those of many others desiring to settle here. </para>
          <para>The immigration program operates on a global basis and Australia&#39;s involvement at the present time is limited to the normal family reunion or occupational criteria. In those instances where sponsorships have been lodged already by relatives in Australia, the applications are being considered in the normal manner. </para>
          <para>Arrangements were recently made to interview in Portugal some 205 persons who are believed to have immediate family in Australia. Applications involving a further 832 persons have been received from persons with possible relatives in Australia and 474 people who have no relatives in Australia. </para>
          <para>There can be no question that any of the $250,000 allocated by the Government for relief and assistance for the people of East Timor could be directed to assist evacuees presently in Portugal. </para>

This means that a few double unit pre-schools have not been operating to full capacity but nevertheless all 4- year-olds whose parents desire it, are receiving the normal pre-school education program.

            <para>Is it usual practice within the Australian Public Service that classification and remuneration for public servants occupying positions based in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra to be in excess of those for public servants occupying positions with similar duties and responsibilities in other capital cities. If so, with relation to the Housing Allowance Voucher Experiment, (a) does the Government s decision to allocate the new positions of Site Office Director to a Class 8 public servant in Sydney and Melbourne and in Hobart denote a change in that policy, and (b) will public servants in future not be disadvantaged in classification or remuneration because their position happens to be based outside of Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. </para>

            <para>Earnings of casual staff employed as polling booth clerks in Federal elections have always constituted income that is subject to income tax. Such earnings also fall within the scope of the PAYE system applicable to salaries and wages. Deduction of tax through that system is designed to ensure that, as the law requires, tax is borne on salary and wage income, broadly, at the time the income is derived. </para>
            <para>The Commissioner of Taxation, who is responsible for the administration of the income tax law, recently drew the attention of electoral authorities to the requirements of the PAYE provisions of the income tax law. The personal tax system currently in operation requires that tax deductions should be made <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> the earnings of a person employed as a casual polling booth clerk according to whether or not a rebate declaration is lodged with the electoral authorities. Where a declaration is not lodged (for example, because the person has lodged a declaration in respect of earnings from his or her regular employment) tax deductions should generally be made at the minimum rate of 3 5 cents. That is the rate of tax applicable to the slice of taxable income between $5,650 and $11,300 </para>

Students may earn up to $1,500 in 1977, including earnings from vacation employment, before their entitlements are reduced. Earnings in excess of $1,500 will reduce a student&#39;s entitlement by $1 for every $2 in excess. Previously the abatement rate was $1 for $1 for dependent students and $1 for every $1.50 for independent students and earnings from vacation employment were not included in the total earnings for the year. </para>

There may have been isolated cases where an appellant in those circumstances has applied for, and been granted, special benefit as a person in need, but separate statistics for such cases are not kept. </para>

However, I have directed that the Australian Development Assistance Agency make it known to the Papua New Guinea Government that scope exists for a training program to meet the needs mentioned by the Auditor-General, if requested. With regard to the honourable senator&#39;s suggestion that Australian administrative specialists be sent to assist the Papua New Guinea AuditorGeneral, it continues to be the policy of the Australian Government to make available to Papua New Guinea qualified officers to staff specialist Governmental agencies such as the Auditor-General &#39;s office. </para>
