            <para>-Does the Minister assisting the Prime Minister in Federal Affairs recall a question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> on 27 April in which he asked whether the federalism policy of the Government meant a more generous financial deal for the States than existed under the previous Labor Government? Does the Minister recall answering with an unqualified 'Yes' and adding the words 'The arrangements under federalism will be more generous for the States' and then repeating that assertion on the following day? In view of the fact that the Budget now reveals that total payments to the States will increase by less than 9 per cent- 13 per cent, of course, according to the Treasurer's hypothetical figures- does the Minister still claim that in the next 2 years payments to the States will have increased sufficiently to maintain the increase in total payments which occurred in the 3 years 1972 to 1975? </para>

            <para>- Yes, I recall the question. Indeed, I re-read the question and answer recently. The Budget reveals that stage 1 of revenue sharing under the federalism policy will provide the States with substantially more money at both the State level and the local government level than the Whitlam Government provided. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The facts are that stage 1 revenue sharing for the States provides a guarantee that for the next 4 years the States can never get less than the Whitlam Government's new formula, including the 3 per cent betterment tax, would have provided. It so happens that on the formula of 33.6 per cent the States will get approximately $8 9m more in revenue sharing this year than they would have got under the Whitlam Government. That is an unqualified fact, and the amount will escalate as the years pass. Next year and in the years afterwards, as revenue from income tax increases, as productivity grows, so the States will continue to grow. For the first time, they will grow at the same rate as the Commonwealth and they will therefore have expanded revenues. As to local government, the facts speak for themselves. This year local government will get $140m in untied grants, compared with $79.9m last year. That is an increase of 75 per cent. The answer therefore is that the statements I made in reply to the April question have been proven, both in the Budget and at the Premiers Conferences, to be fundamentally correct. </para>

              <para>-I can fully understand the irritation of the honourable senator, who yesterday tried a stunt and fell on his face and now does not want to hear the unpleasant facts. The simple fact of the matter is that the Commonwealth, having itself initiated major economies to set the lead in the public sector of the economy, nevertheless has been extremely generous to the States. In total, the States will have substantially more funds this year than last year, quite apart from their federalism content of revenue sharing and local government finance. Allowing for inflation, which happily is falling, they will in fact be able to expand their programs and not contract them. That takes into account all programs. It takes into account revenue sharing for the States, and for local government, the borrowing programs at government and semi government levels, and the moneys that go back to the States in specific purpose grants. That is quite unqualified. The fact is that, on the figures in the Budget, the States will get more money in real terms than they got last year under the Whitlam Government, and of course that is very unpleasant news for the Whitlam Party. </para>

            <para>-It is a fact, documented in many written addresses by the former Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> that the stated policy of the Leader of the Federal Labor Party and his colleagues is to destroy the States. In fact, this has never been denied. When I was at the Federal Anniversary Seminar on the Constitution held at the University of Melbourne I stated these things when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> and his colleagues were present. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> made no alteration to what was said when I recited what had been his policies and invited a rebuttal of those policies from him. The simple fact of the matter is that the Federal Labor Party set out to destroy the States. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam,</inline> in his statements to the local government authorities, said that he wanted to abolish the States. He said he wanted to amalgamate the 900 local government bodies into some 60 or 70 regions subservient to Canberra. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline>said that his blueprint for the Australian Labor Party was the abolition of the Senate, the destruction of the States and the amalgamation of local government so that there would be one Australian House of Representatives with no check or balance on it and, in fact, with local government totally responsive to the government in power. Now, for the Labor Party suddenly to discover the States is tantamount to Satan rebuking sin. During the Labor Party's 3 years of office the specific purpose grants- the tied grants- to the States moved from 3 1 per cent in 1 972 to over 52 per cent in 1 975, proof that the Federal Labor Party wanted to strangle the States and make them puppets of a Federal Labor government. </para>

            <para>- I am aware of the problems in this area mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Maunsell</inline> and have been giving some very earnest consideration to them. It was certainly never the intention of the Government, by way of the policy change announced on 20 May, that there should be any withdrawal of the benefits of veterans. The Government, of course, stands at all times by its obligation to provide a very high standard of medical care for those who have served their country. However, some problems have arisen in the application of this policy. As a result of that, and of a review of its administration which I have been making, I have now decided that in any case where an eligible repatriation patient wishes to continue to be treated by his local medical officer- as honourable senators will know that is his general practitioner- or by a particular specialist acceptable to the Department, and that admission to a non-departmental hospital as a hospital service patient would preclude this, the admission will be arranged as a private patient in shared accommodation as was the practice before. </para>

Would this increased capacity lead to an increased export quota for the meatworks? Would not such a result be of great benefit to the Territory graziers and the Territory as a whole?

            <para>- I assure the honourable senator that family allowance payments are not being delayed. It should be understood that under the previous child endowment scheme payments could be made in 3 ways to those who had entitlement. Payments could be made by way of a 4-weekly cheque, a 4-weekly credit to a credit union or building society or a 12-weekly credit to a bank account. Those 3 ways are still in existence. People who elect now not to have a 12- weekly credit to a bank account can simply elect to receive a 4-weekly cheque or a 4-weekly credit to a credit union. That can be arranged and expedited. Families which receive the allowance for children received the first cheques on 13 July. Similar families which receive allowances by bank credit will receive their payments on 7 September if they have not elected to change the method which they chose for the payments to be made. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is interesting to cite some figures on the way in which people have chosen to have these payments made. Those who have chosen to have a 4- weekly cheque approximate 43 per cent of the people who are entitled to family allowances, a 4-weekly credit has been elected by about 3 per cent and the 12-weekly credit, which will be due on 7 September, has been the way in which 54 per cent of the people have elected to have their payments made. It is quite likely that people who had 12-weekly credits to their bank accounts will choose to have 4-weekly payments and we will be pleased to expedite this change without any delay at all. </para>

During the Budget Speech on Tuesday it was announced that an income equalisation deposit scheme would be introduced. This measure already has been welcomed by the farming community.

This could be of great benefit to those farmers who had a large taxable income last year and are suffering from a drought this year. Could the Minister explain how the scheme would be administered and, in particular, how farmers can take advantage of it in respect of the 1975-76 year? </para>

It is equally true that improvement in productivity in Australia across the scene is an essential factor in getting real economic recovery moving. Anything that brings that about is highly desirable. I have found in the course of both my private and government life that one of the ways to achieve this result is to get the people who are working together talking together. That is one of the reasons we have industry advisory councils in the Department- to assist manufacturers, consumers, retailers, unions and parliamentarians to do precisely that. Anything that would lead in the direction of getting people talking together to improve the operation in which they are jointly engaged will have my support. </para>

It relates to the position of 1 1 members of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Union employed by M. B. John Ltd and John Valves Pty Ltd at Ballarat who were fined a maximum $20 each before a closed committee of the union for refusing to take part in a political strike in connection with Medibank despite the fact that their action in refusing to strike was supported by a two-thirds majority of employees at a lunchtime meeting. It appears that the provisions of the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, in particular sections 138, 140, 141 and 188, have been breached by the union in this matter. Will the Minister take urgent action to investigate the situation with a view to instituting prosecutions should the investigations disclose breaches of the Act and to protecting the individuals concerned from further victimisation? </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. It appears that certain private health funds are setting out to confuse the people of Australia in advertisements placed in daily newspapers by misquoting the cost of Medibank Private and the benefits gained. For instance, in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> today the Australian Natives Association headed its advertisement <inline font-style="italic">Break the Medibank Barrier,</inline> and quoted its rates as $6 as against $6.90 for the same benefits from Medibank. In fact the position for a large number of Australians is that they can stay in Medibank, pay the levy and take out some extra cover for Medibank Private and achieve for a lot less than $6 the same cover as ANA offers. As this seriously misleads the people of Australia will the Minister have these advertisements suspended until he can have the matter of false and misleading advertising investigated? </para>

            <para>-Senator Jessop was good enough to give me some notice of this question. I have obtained the following information from my colleague in the other place: The matter to which the honourable senator refers is a visit to Australia during July of a delegation of West German industrialists led by Professor Karl Heinz Imhausen of Imhausen International, one of the world 's leading companies in the field of coal conversion. In the course of the visit the delegation had discussions with the Minister for National Resources and officers of his Department, with State government departments and authorities in New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, and with private companies in those States. The basis for the discussions was a presentation prepared by the companies represented on the delegation at the request of the West German Ministry for Research and Technology. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In brief, the proposal is to undertake a joint Australian- West German study of the economic feasibility of establishing a plant to produce about 2 million metric tons of motor spirit per annum, plus associated basic chemicals. The capital investment involved is estimated by the West German companies to be about $900m for the conversion plant and $400m to $550m for the associated coal mine and infrastructure. It is intended that the study, if it proceeds, will be one of the major objectives to be carried out under the terms of a bilateral agreement on scientific and technological co-operation which is intended to be signed in the near future. I understand that the Minister for National Resources told the delegation that the Federal Government welcomed the proposal and would be happy to facilitate the making of the necessary arrangements on the Australian side. Contact has already been made with the State governments and private companies concerned. </para>
          <para>The current situation is that the delegation has returned to West Germany where the companies concerned will update their original proposal as necessary in the light of their discussions in Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop,</inline> whose interest in energy matters is well known, will appreciate the need for Australia, with its limited known resources of naturally occurring petroleum, to investigate carefully proposals of this type.

            <para>-I have received representations from a wide number of universities and colleges regarding the general proposal of the Government to reintroduce fees in the second or higher degree spheres. It may well be that I have received such a letter from Sydney University post-graduates. In all cases the letters are receiving very close consideration by both myself and my Department. An interdepartmental committee was established by the Cabinet to look at a number of matters, as has been outlined in the </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Budget. One of those matters is the reintroduction or otherwise of second or higher degrees. I cannot relate the second part of the honourable senator's question- the exempting of pre-school teachers- to the matter. It seems not to have any relationship. But if it has, I will examine it and let the honourable senator know. </para>
          <para>The Government is thoroughly keen to ensure that post-graduate research should continue at a major pace at higher institutions. I remind the Senate that the very great impetus to tertiary and post-graduate education in the 1950s and 1960s came under governments of Liberal faith. I remind the Senate that until very recently- 2 years ago- the number of post-graduate scholarships was at the level that we have proposed for this year as a special year to hold them. So that the cutback, while significant, is not in proportion major. I am looking with my committee at the whole impact of this matter. It is abundantly clear that we need post-graduate research and to encourage it, but we need to offset the priorities. Equally we need to ensure that those people who might not, under a cutback by the Labor Government of last year, be able to get into first year places in primary degrees are not denied this opportunity in the future. I am happy to tell the Senate that a document that I will be tabling today- the report of the Commission on Advanced Education- signifies that the Commission will be able to take in some 10 per cent of the new first year enrolments next year. That should correct that injustice. So the matter is one of looking at priorities. The Government will keep in mind that as soon as it can it will increase its emphasis at the post-graduate level. </para>

            <para>- I am not terribly sure what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has said but if I do not understand him correctly he may seek to ask a supplementary question. The Government said in May that it would look towards the reintroduction of fees for second degree, higher degree and private foreign students, but that in so doing it would make absolutely sure that there would be no reintroduction of fees for primary degrees, combined primary degrees or end-on degrees, and that therefore it would be necessary for a considerable amount of research to be done to ensure that, in the introduction of such a policy, no hardship would arise. The simple fact of the matter is that a number of second degrees will conform to our exclusion as primary degrees because a considerable number of them, such as B.A.- LL.B or B.A., B.Ec. degrees, could be regarded as end-on degrees and therefore be excluded. The Government has been consistent in what it has said. We, with the interdepartmental committee, are now looking at the whole matter. I am hopeful that by the end of September or early in October we will be able to announce the position for next year. It will be announced quite clearly. I am extremely hopeful that no hardships will occur because of any action that the Government may take. </para>

            <para>- I am happy to inform the Senate that all the reports which I have read or heard in the media suggesting a 50 per cent cutback in migrant education are based on a complete but natural misunderstanding of the Budget papers. The Budget papers suggest that a policy which required an expenditure of $20m has had that amount cut back to $ 10m. In fact, what the Budget papers do not disclose in that column is that in the past year there has been a transfer of child migrant education from the Department, which funded that program in the first half of last year to the extent of some $10m, to the Schools Commission program. I am able to tell the Senate that the program as recommended by the Schools Commission for child migrants in the document which was tabled yesterday, I think envisages some $2 1.6m as a recommendation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>In addition there is provision in the Department's estimates in relation to the child program which amounts to $691,000 for the provision of materials, conferences, special arrangements for refugee children and the Australian Council for Educational Research test development project. I think it is true that yesterday the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> probably by printer's error, misrepresented that figure of $691,000 as $190,000. </para>
          <para>Taken overall, the position is that a substantial amount of money will be made available by the Government to migrant education, particularly for the child migrant. As to the matter of special research, this is continuing. I would like the honourable senator to give me notice of the matter, perhaps by separate question, because it involves a fairly detailed answer. </para>

On 9 May 1 976 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> stated that the primary objective of national compensation was to establish a right of long term income security benefits for wage earners who, because of injury or sickness, had either lost or had reduced their capacity to earn.

            <para>- The matter of national compensation is at present under consideration between the Commonwealth Government and State governments. The proposals which have been discussed already have related to the wage earner rather than to the total population. At this stage I can say that no proposals have been under active consideration which would encompass the whole Australian population in a scheme of national compensation. Most matters concerning any proposed scheme which could be introduced are under consideration at officer level at the present time. I will take note of the matters which have been mentioned by the honourable senator but it is fair to say that they are not part of the matters under active consideration at the present time. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question, which is directed to the Minister for Social Security, by reminding the Minister that in response to 2 written questions on notice, neither of which was directed to her, I was informed that child abuse is almost unknown, officially at least, in the Northern Territory and the Australian Capital Territory, these being the 2 parts of Australia for which direct Commonwealth responsibility exists. The Minister would probably agree that any assessment suggesting that child abuse is rare is likely to be an under-assessment. The Minister has announced also that the new Office of Child Care will include within its ambit projects in connection with the prevention of child abuse. I therefore ask the Minister: Will special attention be given to the education of those departments and officials in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory who apparently either do not know of child abuse or else do not understand the need for proper community monitoring to detect the true incidence of the abuse by adults of defenceless children? </para>

            <para>- I agree with the honourable senator when he suggests that it is virtually impossible to obtain accurate figures on the incidence of child abuse. I think it would be agreed that it frequently does go undetected and even when it is identified by health or welfare officers or others it may not be reported to legal or other authorities. I therefore do feel that any figures that have ever been quoted on the incidence of child abuse are likely to be an under assessment of the problem. Last year funding was provided by the Commonwealth Government for a conference which related to the battered child. This brought to Australia some United Kingdom experts who were interested in the treatment of child abuse. I believe that much was learned at that conference and has been under consideration by those who are able to deal with these matters. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Office of Child Care, of course, has programs that give assistance to parents and children and which would act towards the prevention of situations which might lead to child abuse. The sorts of services that can be funded, such as emergency care and services for the provision of accommodation for those who require it, may alleviate some of the battered children problems we have seen. </para>
          <para>With regard to that part of the question relating to education of officials in the Departments of the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory, I can say only that where programs were able to be developed information would be given to officials of the departments concerned. Any specific program developed would need to be framed in co-operation with the relevant Commonwealth and, if necessary, State welfare, health and other authorities. Programs which might be of assistance in educating the whole community in relation to child abuse certainly would have support in any funding that the Government was able to direct to them, and I believe that officials in departments would benefit from any of the activities that might be undertaken. </para>

The Minister will recall that on 18 May the Treasurer made a statement, later confirmed by the Prime Minister, that the Commonwealth Government had decided to ask an independent committee to inquire into the Adelaide-Crystal Brook railway project and the options available. Is the Minister aware that criticism from business and other leaders in South Australia suggests that that inquiry may result in a cancellation of the project? Is the Minister also aware that a previous Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon,</inline> agreed with the view of the consultants? Firstly, is the Minister able to state when that committee of inquiry, which I understand comprises a representative of Commonwealth Railways and two other persons, will make its report to the Government?

The Senate might also be aware that in the interim period transmission has taken place from Carnarvon in Western Australia and Shepparton in Victoria but at a considerably reduced volume. The Senate may recall that the previous Government, the Whitlam Government, invited the then Secretary of the Department of Foreign Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Keith</inline> Waller, to look at the whole question of the development of Radio Australia. That in fact was done and a report is in hand. Recently an interdepartmental committee was set up and is working on possible courses of action which would give additional levels of service from Radio Australia in both the immediate and the long term future. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>No decisions have been made as yet, but I understand that the committee's report ought to be available in 6 or 8 weeks time. I accept that this is an important matter and that Radio Australia has functioned to bring Australia to the practical knowledge of many hundreds of millions of people. I will refer the honourable senator's question to the relevant Minister. </para>

I promised I would obtain information for the honourable senator on the subject. I am now able to advise that, under the policy of the Australian Government, promoters seeking the entry of sports contestants from overseas are required to provide sponsorships and give certain guarantees. The same applies to the proposed entry of overseas entertainers. Each such sponsorship is considered on its merits. These arrangements are operating satisfactorily. This policy is kept under constant review. The entry policies applied by other departments are matters for decision by the other departments and other governments. Any complaints by Australians concerning problems of entry to other countries, whether as individuals or as a class of person, would not be matters to be dealt with by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I can only say that the entry policies which are applied by other governments are matters that concern them and are their own responsibility. I can add nothing further on the matter that has been raised. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer because I have gathered the impression in public presentations of the Budget that the emphasis is on showing it to be a big business Budget. As I find balancing factors emphatically in favour of the low income earner, I ask the Treasurer whether I am correct in saying that 3 features are involved. The first is that there is no burden of increases in taxes on beer, petrol and cigarettes. Does that amount to a denial of about $ 1,000m in terms of Whitlam 's last Budget? The second refers to the redistribution in income tax scales in respect of deductions for children. The benefit goes from the high income earner to the low income earner with children. Do I understand that that involves a redistribution of about $ 1 ,000m? The third feature is the decision to index taxation. Will the operation of tax indexation lift the income scale so that increased tax is automatically escaped when wages are increased? Does that operate to relieve the lower income earner of the burden of about $ 1,000m? I just want to know whether my impression, which some people would credit as being quite right in the first place, has ministerial approval. </para>

            <para>-The honourable senator's insight and understanding do him great credit. I commend the knowledge that he possesses and his clear analysis of the position. Members of the Opposition could well profit by a study of it. Looking at this Budget in the broad and reducing it to the essential simplicity of the position, one will see that the Government set out to reduce Government waste and extravagance which had been a product of the Labor years; to stop money being thrown down the drain; to make money available to reduce personal income tax, as the honourable senator has said; to help in social security and social welfare, and to lead to economic recovery. Equally the Government set out to put no further burden on the people by way of taxation. There are no increases in indirect taxation whatsoever. There is a reduction in personal taxation and in areas of corporate taxation. The Budget is a social security and social welfare Budget designed to revive Australia. This is mostly achieved at a saving in Government waste and extravagance. </para>

I now have before me pages 6 and 7 of the Budget document and am able to say that this document discloses an entirely different picture from that which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> put forward. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> did not read either the next paragraph or the next table which states that a representation of a figure of 7.2 per cent increase for this year would be wrong and, if properly adjusted, the figure should be 14.6 per cent. I place on record that the figures put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> do not accord with the true picture disclosed on pages 6 and 7 of the Budget document while my own statement that the increase in percentage was something of the order of a modest 13-odd per cent is stated in the Budget documents as 14.6 per cent, substantially higher than the rate of inflation and, therefore, amounting to real total growth for the States. </para>

              <para>- I rise on a point of order. In regard to the answer given by the Minister we now have a situation where in the rebroadcast of question time there will be an incorrect assertion made by the Leader of the Opposition. This will achieve publicity but the truth of the matter will not then be able to be given by the Minister. I ask: Is it possible to edit that particular question so that the truth also can be made available to the public? </para>

              <para>- Speaking to the point of order, the advantage just taken by both Ministers is quite unfair. What has happened is that there has been a further laundering of figures by the Minister who has now brought in his adjusted figures. He claims that the figure he has just quoted is beyond the inflation rate. Unless he is quoting real figures, and he did not say so, obviously the inflation rate has been toned down by him. Let us face the facts. The inflation rate is still running at around 14 per cent which is higher, as I said yesterday in this chamber, than when the Labor Party went out of office. </para>

            <para>- Honourable senators will recall that on 20 May 1976 1 announced the guidelines for the triennial programs of the education commissions for the period 1 977-79. This report of the Commission on Advanced Education responds to those guidelines and, in accordance with the decision to establish Deakin University incorporating two colleges of advanced education, it recommends the transfer of funds to the university sector to facilitate the establishment of Deakin. It also recommends a transfer of funds to the Technical and Further Education Commission in respect of some courses in New South Wales and Victoria which were previously funded by the Commission on Advanced Education. The effect of these changes on amounts allocated in the Government's guidelines is shown in the attached table. </para>

            <para>That the Bill be now read a second time. </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The main purpose of this Bill is to increase the rates and amounts of compensation payable under the Seamen's Compensation Act to seamen and their dependants. The Bill will ensure that the monetary rates payable under the Act are kept in line with those contained in the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill 1976. I should mention, however, that the proposed amendments will not involve any cost to the Commonwealth Government as payments under the Seamen's Compensation Act are the responsibility of the shipowners. </para>
          <para class="block">Increased Compensation </para>
          <para>Under clause 7 of the Bill the weekly compensation for total incapacity for work is to be increased from $57.00 to $80.00 for a seaman without dependants. The additional weekly supplement for a dependent wife will be increased from $15.00 to $21.00 and that for each dependent child from $7.00 to $10.00. The ceiling which applies in certain circumstances in relation to the weekly payment for partial incapacity is to be increased from $57.00 to $80.00. In addition to the increases in weekly incapacity payments, the Bill provides for the lump sum death benefit, to which the lump sum benefits for specified injuries and maximum compensation are related, to be increased from $20,000 to $25,000. The weekly payment in respect of each dependent child of a deceased seaman will be increased from $7.00 to $10.00 and the maximum payable in respect of funeral costs will be increased from $450 to $650. </para>
          <para class="block">Other Amendments </para>
          <para>Clause 3 removes the limit of $1,000 on the amount of compensation payable in respect of medical and ambulance services. This limit currently applies unless, in the opinion of the Minister, the exceptional circumstances of any case warrant payment of an amount in excess of $ 1,000. The same limit also applied in relation to Commonwealth Government employees but it was dispensed with in 1971 because the practical effect of the limit was to constitute a point of review and never a ceiling on the amounts paid. Similar considerations apply so far as the Seamen's Compensation Act is concerned and this is the reason for this amendment. </para>
          <para>Clause 6 of the Bill removes a restrictive provision contained in sub-section 10a (2) of the Act. The existing provision prevents a seaman, or his dependants in the case of his death, from proceeding against the employer to recover damages unless the proceedings are commenced within 1 2 months of the date of receipt of the first payment of compensation. The effect of this amendment will be that the ordinary time limits relating to actions for damages will apply. This has been the practice in relation to Commonwealth Government employees since 1971 and the Government considers that seamen should be placed in the same position. </para>
          <para>Clause 7, in addition to providing for some of the increases in benefits already mentioned, also includes provisions relating to the weekly payments in respect of dependent children in both death and incapacity cases. Under these amendments such payments will be made in respect of children aged between 16 and 21 years who are full time students not ordinarily in employment. This will bring the Seamen's Compensation Act into line with the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act and the workers' compensation legislation of the States. The opportunity has also been taken to make some minor amendments of a formal or technical nature in keeping with current drafting practice. These amendments make no changes of substance. </para>
          <para class="block">Application of Amendments </para>
          <para>The amending legislation is intended to come into operation on 1 September 1976. The Bill follows past practice in providing for the increased weekly payments to apply from that date, notwithstanding that the payments relate to an injury sustained or disease contracted before that date. Likewise, the increased lump sum payments for death and specified injuries will also apply from 1 September 1 976 in all cases where the death occurs or the final degree of injury becomes assessable after that date, even though the death or the specified injury may have resulted from an injury sustained or disease contracted before that date. Increases in other benefits will apply in a similar manner. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

        </motion>
        <para>The main purpose of this Bill is to provide for increases in benefits payable under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act which provides workers' compensation for employees of the Commonwealth Government and its statutory authorities. This legislation was last amended for this purpose during the 1974 Budget session of the Parliament. Since then there have been significant increases in the cost of living and in the benefits payable under the workers ' compensation legislation of most of the States. It is therefore necessary and indeed, only fair, that the benefits under the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act should again be increased. </para>
      </subdebate.1>
      <para class="block">Compensation for Total Incapacity </para>
      <para>Employees who have been injured since 2 November 1972 are entitled to receive weekly compensation payments equal to their normal full sick pay rate during the first 26 weeks of total incapacity for work. For long term cases where total incapacity has exceeded 26 weeks, the compensation is based on fixed weekly rates that are specified in the Act. Under the Bill, the fixed weekly rate for a totally incapacitated employee without dependants will increase from $57 to $80. The additional weekly supplement for a dependent spouse will increase from $15 to $21 and the weekly supplement for each dependent child will increase from $7 to $ 10. </para>
      <para class="block">Compensation for Partial Incapacity </para>
      <para>A similar increase, from $57 a week to $80 a week, will also apply to the ceiling which operates in relation to the compensation payable for partial incapacity for work. </para>
      <para class="block">Compensation for Death </para>
      <para>The Bill also provides for increases in the amounts of compensation payable where an injury results in the death of an employee. The basic lump sum payable to dependants will increase from $20,000 to $25,000. The weekly amount payable in respect of each dependent child of a deceased employee will increase from $7 to $10 and the minimum total amount payable for each child will increase from $700 to $1,000. The maximum amount payable in respect of funeral expenses will increase from $450 to $650. </para>
      <para>Compensation for Specified Losses </para>
      <para>The lump sums payable under the Act for specified losses will also increase. The maximum lump sum payment for such a loss will increase from $20,000 to $25,000 and the lump sums for the less serious losses will increase in the same proportion. For example, payment for severe and permanent facial disfigurement will increase from $10,000 to $12,500 and compensation for loss of the sense of taste or smell will increase from $2,000 to $2,500. </para>
      <para class="block">Other Increases </para>
      <para>The maximum amount payable for alterations to buildings or vehicles, or repair or replacement of certain aids and appliances, will go up from $500 to $700. </para>
      <para class="block">Provision of Vocational Training </para>
      <para>The amendment in clause 5 of the Bill is consequential upon a 1974 amendment to the Social Services Act and requires a detailed explanation. Under section 38 ( 1 ) of the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act, the Commissioner for Compensation is empowered to arrange with the Director-General of Social Security for compensation cases to undertake rehabilitation vocational training using the rehabilitation service of the Department of Social Security. It is desirable that both compensation and social service beneficiaries undergoing this training be dealt with on a similar basis. In 1974, section 135D of the Social Services Act was amended to provide a training allowance for social service beneficiaries that equals the weighted average weekly minimum wage appropriate to the person's age. It took the place of the rehabilitation allowance and a smaller training allowance that were payable before 1974. </para>
      <para>This opportunity is being taken to amend the Compensation Act to take account of the 1974 amendment to section 135D of the Social Services Act. Because compensation cases undergoing training continue to receive compensation benefits, the amendment provides that the training allowance is an amount, if any, by which the person's normal weekly compensation benefit is less than the weighted average minimum wage appropriate to his age. This will mean that no person receiving compensation payments and undergoing rehabilitation vocational training will receive less than the person receiving social services benefits undergoing similar training. Both will receive at least the weighted average weekly minimum wage appropriate to their age. It should be noted that no training allowance is payable where a person undergoing vocational training is receiving a compensation payment equal to or in excess of the weighted average weekly minimum wage. For both compensation and social service beneficiaries undergoing training, a living away from home allowance is also payable where appropriate. It is an amount determined by the Director-General of Social Security that does not exceed 25 per cent of the weighted average weekly minimum wage appropriate to the person 's age. </para>
      <para class="block">Other Amendments </para>
      <para>The opportunity has also been taken to make some other amendments of a relatively minor nature. The first of these, in clause 3 of the Bill, is consequential upon the new form of citation proposed in the Acts Citation Act 1976. The amendment in clause 4 will clarify a provision regarding costs that was inserted in the Act in 1974. The amendment in clause 6 is consequential upon a change in other legislation referred to in the principal Act. The remaining amendments to the principal Act are set out in clause 8 and Schedule 2 and are of a formal or technical nature. They are in keeping with current drafting practice and make no changes of substance. </para>
      <para class="block">Application of Amendments </para>
      <para>The Bill provides that the amendments will come into operation on 1 September 1976. The Bill contains the usual provisions for the increased weekly payments to apply from that date, notwithstanding that the payments relate to an injury sustained before that date. The increased lump sum payments for death and specified losses will also apply from 1 September 1976 in all cases where the death occurs or the loss is suffered after that date, even though the death or the loss may have resulted from an injury sustained before that date. Increases in other benefits will apply in a similar manner. </para>
      <para class="block">Cost of Increased Benefits </para>
      <para>The total cost of the increased benefits authorised by the Bill is estimated to be $ 1.77m in a full year. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

      <para>The main purpose of this Bill is to make some necessary amendments to the United States Naval Communication Station (Civilian Employees) Act as a consequence of the change in citation of the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act, provided under clause 3 of the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill 1976. The Act is a companion piece of legislation which automatically extends the terms of the Compensation (Australian Government Employees) Act to civilians employed by the United States Navy at the Naval Communications Station at North West Cape. This Bill will ensure that the increased rates of compensation being introduced under the Compensation (Commonwealth Government Employees) Amendment Bill 1976 will be payable under the Act. I should mention, however, that the flow-on of increases in compensation to these employees will not result in any cost to the Commonwealth Government because, under arrangements with the United States Government, payments made under the Act are reimbursed by that Government. The amendments contained in clauses 3 to 7 of the Bill are of a formal nature and make no changes of substance. The amending legislation is intended to come into operation on 1 September 1 976.I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

              <para>-The honourable senator has received it? I am delighted about that. I have asked my other ministerial colleagues to try to get out the particulars relating to their departments well before the Estimates Committees meet so that honourable senators will have an opportunity for themselves or for their research officers, if need be, to take some time to go through the particulars. Perhaps for the first time honourable senators will not be caught at the last moment with all this detailed information. I hope that because of this the Estimates Committees will work better than they have ever worked before. </para>

            <para>- Honourable senators will recall that at the time of the consideration by the Senate Committee of the Estimates Committees, Senate Estimate Committee A in its last report to the Senate suggested that the papers relating to the Estimates should be prepared and presented by the departments to the Senate at the time the Budget papers were brought down by the Treasurer. I understand from inquiries I have made from the Senate staff that that procedure is going on reasonably expeditiously as far as some departments are concerned. I have indicated that I have already received papers from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> department. I hope the Senate Committees will take into consideration the recommendation of Senate Estimates Committee A that they might sit and study the papers in advance before calling a great number of public servants as has been the case to date. We might be able to expedite the work of the Senate and do it much more efficiently. </para>

              <para>-That is right. The Labor Government filed an ordinance on 10 September 1975. The Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances brought down a report suggesting disallowance of that ordinance. An undertaking was given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> as Minister for Administrative Services, to that Senate Committee. As a result an ordinance for repeal of the original ordinance was brought in. Now we are moving for disallowance of that repeal ordinance. No other part of the world has changed as little as the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. The original purpose of the introduction of the Lands Acquisition Ordinance by me when I was Special Minister of State in the Whitlam Labor Government on, I think, 10 September 1975 was to bring about some form of change on Cocos (Keeling) Islands. I shall say something about the history of the islands. They consist of some 27 small coral islands in 2 atolls. They are situated about 2800 kilometres northwest of Perth and some 3700 kilometres due west of Darwin. All told they have a total land mass of about 14 square kilometres. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>Of the 27 islands only two are inhabited. Home Island is occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross, the fifth generation Clunes Ross, and about 500 Cocos Malays. West Island is occupied by the Australian Administrator, the office of Administrator being established by the Labor Government, and by the Australian Administration employees and their families. From recollection the number of Australians living on West Island is about 130 or 140. The Cocos Islands were first settled in 1827 by the Clunes Ross family which imported labour mainly from North Borneo in order to improve the coconut trees which were already growing there. In 1857 following a number of representations from the Clunes Ross family the islands were formally declared part of the British dominions. In 1886, 90 years ago, Queen Victoria granted to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Clunies Ross a freehold title on all land on the islands above the high water mark. </para>
          <para>Australia's administration of the islands has been relatively brief. Our direct interest started, I think, in the early 1950s when the then Australian Government discussed with the then British Government Australia's interest in acquiring control of the airstrip which existed on West Island for the purpose of the Australian-South </para>
          <para class="block">African air link. As a result the Australian Government and the British Government agreed that sovereignty over the islands, which were then part of the colony of Singapore, should be transferred to the Australian Government. </para>
          <para>The commercial economy of the Territory is based almost solely on the production and export of copra that is grown on the Clunes Ross Estate. At present the economy of Home Island, which is the island occupied by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross and the Cocos Malay workers, is interwoven with and almost totally dependent upon that of the Clunes Ross Estate. Within the limits of its present standards the Home Island community is basically self-sufficient but, depending on copra production and price levels at particular times on the international market, the Estate and therefore the Cocos Malay people- the Home Island community- place some reliance on contract work that is undertaken for and on behalf of the Australian Government to supplement their income. The Australian Government provided, and I understand still provides, significant finance and/or meets operational expenditure for education and health services, and the existence of the Territory Administration, the airfield and other related services on Cocos provide indirect benefits to the Home Island community and the Estate. The extent to which the Cocos Islanders on Home Island may benefit from the business interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross, other than copra production, cannot of course be stated. </para>
          <para>In 1968 a cyclone destroyed a large number of coconut farms and an extensive replanting program is only now starting to come good. Over the years <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross complained that the Australian Government did not provide him with financial assistance after that cyclone occurred. The copra produced on the Estate is of high quality but the price realised for copra on world markets over the last couple of years has suffered a sharp downturn. I think it is down now to about $250 a tonne, compared with about $1,000 a tonne some years ago. I thought that I should briefly outline that history of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands. </para>
          <para>We are debating a motion, which stands in my name, that the Lands Acquisition (Repeal) Ordinance 1976 as contained in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Ordinance No. 1 of 1976 and made under the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Act 1955-1975 should be disallowed. On 18 March this year <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood,</inline> as  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committing on Regulations and Ordinances, presented the 52nd report of that Committee to the Senate. That report related to the Ordinance to which I originally referred, namely, the Cocos (Keeling) Islands Lands Acquisition Ordinance of 1975, and which I introduced on 10 September last year when I was the Special Minister of State in the previous Government. In presenting the Committee's report to the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wood</inline> said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Committee is not concerned with the policy of the Ordinance, but is concerned to ensure that subordinate legislation, made by the executive, is not used to give effect to substantive matters of policy which ought to be the subject of parliamentary enactment. The Committee considers that, if the Executive is to have a general power to acquire and transfer all land in the Territory for unspecified purposes, this policy ought to be laid before the Parliament in the form of a proposed statute for the Parliament 's consideration. </para>

The simple fact of the matter is that despite a unanimous resolution of this Senate that conventions should be maintained by all parties, conventions were not maintained. Certain senators were appointed to represent their States on the other side of the fence- one to replace a Labor senator who had retired and one to replace another Labor senator who, unfortunately, had died. We as a government at that time were engaged principally, as every honourable senator will remember, in endeavouring to get our Budget accepted by the </para>

It was a matter of urgency because for so long undertakings had been given to the people of the Cocos Malay community-by the McMahon Government as well as by the Labor Government- and to the United Nations by governments, and apparently nothing had been done other than the introduction of primary school education on Home Island and the appointment of an administrator.

            <para>This notice of motion is for the disallowance of the Lands Acquisition Ordinance 1975 of the Territory of Cocos (Keeling) Islands. In its 52nd report presented to the Senate on 18 March 1976 the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances recommended the disallowance of the ordinance on the ground that if the Executive Government is to be given a general power to acquire all land in the Territory for unspecified purposes, this ought to be done by Act of Parliament and not by subordinate legislation. The ordinance, however, has now been repealed in accordance with an undertaking given to the Committee by the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> The repealing ordinance was made by the Governor-General yesterday. Accordingly, I withdraw business of the Senate notice of motion No. 1 standing in my name. </para>

              <para>-And, as my colleague says, with the future. The Lands Acquisition Ordinance, which I introduced originally in September 1975, was introduced after I had conversations in Sydney and Canberra with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dickson, Mr Clunies</inline> Ross's manager. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dickson</inline> advised me that it would be in the interests of everyone concerned if I went to Cocos to negotiate with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross for the acquisition of the area. The legislation was introduced after I went to Cocos and, unfortunately and regrettably, after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross had retracted or withdrawn from statements that had been made to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dickson</inline> and to the Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross himself. The Committee has already tendered a report to the Senate. In my statement to the Senate on 10 September last year I pointed out that Australia's representative in the Committee of Twenty-four, which had visited Cocos in August of that year and presented its report to the United Nations in November, had made a statement which indicated that the then Australian Government, the Whitlam Labor Government, endorsed the broad approach recommended by the Committee.

The situation prevailing in the Cocos (Keeling) Islands involves a denial of human rights to the indigenous people.

Five hundred Island people are involved on this remote Australian Territory but it is far from a simple matter to effect changes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross has his property rights and, as the fifth generation of a long dynastic line, his influence with the community naturally remains considerable.

I appointed an interim advisory committee, and the Government was determined to enforce the existing laws relating to any aspect of the estate's activities. Unfortunately, and sadly for the people of Cocos, the Labor Government was removed from office on 1 1 November last. All the customs and habits of the colonial era that existed on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands since 1827 have been allowed to continue ever since. </para>

              <para>- It is feudalism, as my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill,</inline> says. Whether or not the Government likes it, a feudal system is operating there. As I said in my statement last September, some people want change! Some people are concerned about change; some people sit on the sidelines and wait to see which way they should go. But the fact is that the world is catching up with the situation on the Cocos (Keeling) Islands and this Government cannot sit on the sidelines with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross much longer. </para>

          <para>The Senate Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence went to Cocos in June of last year. It was reported to me at that time by my then Department that the people seemed to have regarded the Senate Standing Committee on </para>
          <para>Foreign Affairs and Defence more as a Government committee than as a parliamentary committee. Obviously, they did not quite understand the distinction between Parliament and Government. Indeed, a petition had been presented to the Administrator of the Cocos (Keeling) Islands at about that time from the Cocos Malay people seeking the establishment of an Australian administration office on Home Island itself. It was further reported to me as Minister at the time that if negotiations for the purchase of the estate were for any reason protracted there was a clear danger of serious disruption within the community. I was advised that the early establishment of a Government office on Home Island might well help stabilise the situation. </para>
          <para>Of course, Home Island itself is territory vested in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clunies</inline> Ross. Indeed, the all-Party Senate Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack was a member of that Committee- made recommendations in paragraphs 53 and 54 of its report under the heading 'Economic Viability of Cocos' that some action should be taken to acquire land on Cocos on just and reasonable terms. Since we went out of office in November 1975, Cocos, like grandfather's clock, has stood still on the floor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> the Minister for Administrative Services, went there in April. He told us upon his return that he would be making a submission to Cabinet and that an announcement would be made in regard to Government policy. He told us that in the Senate on 27 April 1976, some 4 months ago. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has put forward a Cabinet submission at this stage. </para>

              <para>- I wish to speak on the point of order. I would imagine that if the honourable senator is arguing that the repeal of an ordinance ought not to have been made- that is what he is really arguing because he is arguing for the disallowance of that repealing ordinance- he ought to argue firstly that the conclusions to which the Regulations and Ordinances Committee came were wrong in principle or wrong in fact. He has made no attempt to do that. Secondly, he ought to be arguing that I was wrong in repealing the ordinance before it would have been disallowed by the Senate. As I understand the history of this matter before the Regulations and Ordinances Committee, there was a unanimous recommendation. There was not a recommendation merely that certain parts of the ordinance be disallowed. The recommendation was for the disallowance of the whole of the ordinance. It was an all-party recommendation. I, in my innocence, am not attempting to defend what I did in speaking to a point of order, but it would have been a very brave Minister who would have taken on in this place the Regulations and Ordinances Committee and said that the ordinance was valid when the Committee had condemned it. </para>

          <para>Therefore I put it to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Acting Deputy President,</inline> that the honourable senator ought to be arguing on 2 facts: Either that the Regulations and Ordinances Committee came to its decision incorrectly, on the wrong information or the wrong premise and that the ordinance ought to be disallowed or that I, as Minister, did something quite silly in repealing the ordinance prior to its being disallowed by this Parliament. After all, as the honourable senator has said, the Regulations and Ordinances Committee said that it was not concerned with the policy contained within the ordinance; it was concerned with some of the characteristics of the ordinance itself. Therefore the policy contained with the ordinance is not up for grabs; what is up for debate is what one might call the principles contained with the ordinance, and that is what the honourable senator ought to be arguing. </para>

I submit therefore that under the proper and logical procedures of the Senate, so that we know the content of debate, the honourable senator should be confined to the terms of his motion and justify why he should disallow the repealing ordinance, and that is concerned with the reasons why <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> gave an understanding to the Committee to repeal the Ordinance instead of the Senate's disallowing it. That was clearly stated for the Senate in the Committee's report of 18 March. Two grounds were stated in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland 's opening remarks. The first one was made by himself and the second by my invitation. Paragraph 3 of the report states that the ordinance allowing for acquisition allowed the Governor-General of this country by compulsory acquisition to acquire any private land on Cocos Island for any purpose whatever with the right to transfer that land to any other person. The Committee's principle is to protect private rights, protect property rights, protect individual rights, That is stated in paragraph 3. Paragraph 4 states the second situation. The </para>

          <para>Lands (Acquisition) Act outlines the terms upon which land is to be acquired compulsorily. As I understand it, it is applicable to the external territories. Why therefore bring in a special ordinance with specific restrictions on people's rights in derogation of the right of the public statute of this country? So we said that we were not concerned with policy but were concerned that ordinances made by the Executive were not used to give effect to substantive matters of policy which ought to be the subject of parliamentary enactment. Therefore if anybody has to be expropriated of their property on Cocos Island it should be in accordance with law. That is the content of this debate, I submit. </para>

Two eminent lawyers and one eminent bush lawyer from the other side of the House have been endeavouring to raise these points of order. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, in order to do his job effectively on behalf of the Opposition, needs to give some of this background history.

It is about time that this Parliament, if it believes in humanity and the dignity of the Australian, undertook to do something to ameliorate the conditions under which these people live in a very servile state.

            <para>That the Minister for Administrative Services, in conjunction with his associated Ministers, should accelerate the release of the following land to the Government of the State of New South Wales which will provide essential sports arenas for Sydney to successfully enable that city to hold a future Olympic or Commonwealth Games, viz: (a) Moore Park Engineers' Depot; and (b) upper foreshore reaches of the Parramatta River. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">The gist of this motion is simple. I am endeavouring to accelerate the release of certain Australian Government occupied land in the city of Sydney and the picture I will paint relates to the period of time when the present Foreign Minister, Andrew Peacock, was Minister for the Army. It involves also the stewardship of the subsequent Defence Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard,</inline> and two Administrative Affairs Ministers, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> and the present occupant, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> It is a very simple matter. In a city the size of Sydney the Australian Government should make a contribution of land. It should vacate a certain strategic area, the Moore Park Army Engineers Depot, to allow the Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 and the Sports Ground to be amalgam ted into a first class modern sports auditorium accommodating all codes of football on an international scale. It could also accommodate a Commonwealth or Olympic Games. </para>
          <para>My association with this project began when the Honourable Andrew Peacock was Minister for the Army. At that time the question was finding an alternative site for Army use. I had a conversation with Brigadier Grenville, a very fine soldier and a man who is fairly realistic in these matters. It culminated in Eastern Command providing me, long before <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> time, with a helicopter to survey the Holsworthy area near Sydney and also the Singleton area to see where the Army could go if it vacated the Moore Park area. I understand from Army people that in terms of strategic considerations it would not affect the Army if the Moore Park Engineering Depot were transferred to Holsworthy or even to Singleton. At the time that I had a look at these areas the then Minister for Army, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock,</inline> was happy about the project and in a rather jesting mood said: 'If you get what you want, Sydney then will have a ground comparable with the Melbourne Cricket Ground'. A former prominent senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poyser,</inline> once told me where he thought the Melbourne Cricket Ground had faults and from a cricket aspect, possibly if a ground were completely surrounded, We would be more likely to get an appeal against the light than if the ground were open. </para>
          <para>In a modern metropolis there is a need for a sports stadium that will seat in the vicinity of 100 000 people. It is a pity that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lajovic</inline> is not here because when we argue about the capacity of a modern stadium I recall my visit to Europe in 1959. 1 think it would be agreed that the wartime devastation there was far greater than it was in the southern hemisphere but in those days there were soccer stadiums there from which 100 000 people could be cleared within a quarter of an hour at the most of the game ending. That was the dream that I have cherished since. That was the idea that the then Minister for the Army, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock,</inline> assured me would take a bit of time. I am approaching this matter in a strictly bipartisan manner. It could be suggested, perhaps even by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> that even if the Army gets out the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust may not have sufficient capital to undertake the project I have outlined. Whether the trust has a contingency fund I do not know, but I can assure honourable senators that the top echelon of the State parliamentary parties, such as former premiers <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Askin and the honourable J. B. Renshaw, have served on that trust. My view which I know is shared by a couple of my colleagues in the State Parliamentary Labor Party and by some in the Liberal Party is that there is a tendency to institutionalise things and one gets the idea that we must not change at all. I hesitate to quote him with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> looking at me, but Paul Kruger the Leader of the Boers said: 'You take the best of the past and you build on it'. This applies whether it was said by Kruger or anyone else. I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> will agree with me that the present impasse in Sydney cannot continue. I do not say that the Treasurer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lynch,</inline> has to provide any money but this land is the people's land whether the Australian Government or the State Government is the landlord and we should accelerate its transfer. </para>
          <para>I come now to the next era involving former Minister for Defence Lance Barnard, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> predecessor, the honourable F. M. Daly. I received a specific assurance from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Barnard</inline> that within about 2 years the Army would have moved out. I cannot see any indication of that. The position has been extremely complex. When I have raised this question in the Senate whether the present Government, the Whitlam Government or the Liberal Government of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McMahon</inline> was in office, we have got into a real old dog fight about whether I was asking for a single transfer operation, whether the Australian Government at the same time should be dealing with the question of a harbour side national park or whether part of the Holsworthy Army area should be available for housing. It is very hard to keep up with what is happening. The more one delves into it the more one runs into blind alleys. People like Ernie Christensen, the sporting editor of the <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline> and a highly qualified sporting journalist, and his very able assistant in that field, David Jack, have taken up this matter. Possibly as an interim measure, the Whitlam Government through <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly</inline> offered $500,000 to the Council of the City of Sydney to upgrade the E. S. Marks field primarily for athletics and soccer. The idea was that if the Australian Government gave half a million dollars the State Government would match it dollar for dollar. </para>
          <para>In fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> I should say that after this Government came into power I acquainted him with the agreement that was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly.</inline> I have a letter from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> saying that the agreement has been honoured. I have conveyed that information to people on the City Council and to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ken</inline> Booth, the New South Wales Minister for Sport. In addition I have given it to the sporting journalists. I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Jack</inline> had lunch recently with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Booth</inline> but I do not know what took place at that lunch. I know that New South Wales senators would agree with me when I say that if we are looking at an Olympic or Commonwealth Games concept even an upgraded E. S. Marks field would not be sufficient unless we also had this other project. I should say to cricket lovers that this project will not in any way affect the Sydney </para>
          <para>Cricket Ground No. 1. It simply involves the Sports Ground and Cricket Ground No. 2. The Sports Ground is a very good all weather ground for sport compared with other grounds, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> well knows. There is the question of drainage and the question of whether it should be made into a rectangular area but the risk has to be taken. </para>
          <para>As a person interested in urban affairs it seems to me that there may be some fears among local residents that if we increase potential capacity to 100 000 people we will have parking problems but there are grounds in Latin America and Eastern and Western Europe which seem to be able to accommodate this number. In comparison with some European countries we could argue that the magnitude of traffic here is more difficult to cope with but I have seen a ground occupied in Florida for gridiron football which can accommodate 80 000 people and with underground parking it is a goer. So I come back to my original argument. I do not believe that the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust will move until it is confronted with an accomplished fact. </para>
          <para>Perhaps I could put it this way: Those people who have read the life of Ernest Bevin, a very distinguished English parliamentarian, would know that when he was on his way up after leaving the coal mining areas and valleys of Wales he always thought that the power existed in a local council. When he got up higher in the British Labour Party and in the British Government he still was not sure where the power was. I am making this plea now to the Minister for Administrative Services, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers. Senator, when</inline> I used this device on a previous occasion to ventilate a grievance during discussion of general business I made a plea to the Minister and his colleagues about the use of off-shore lighthouses when they were no longer needed by the Federal Government but I did not get an answer to my remarks; we went on to deal with other business. </para>
          <para>On behalf of the people of Sydney and all the sporting writers who have plugged this theme, I hope we will get some tangible evidence that the Minister for Administrative Services has got in touch with the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Newman)</inline> and said: 'Eastern Command has to find another area for the Engineers depot at Moore Park'. I hope there will be an indication to the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust that it may take a slice of this area and include it in its blueprints. </para>
          <para>Perhaps I should explain the position for non New South Wales senators. We could have an ideal ground if we took this portion of the Sydney Showground which is occupied by the Army. We could use that area plus the Sports Ground and Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2. Perhaps for a season or two Sheffield Shield cricketers who came to Sydney would not be able to loosen up at the nets at Sydney Cricket Ground No. 2 because work would be going on there. However, I think we could get over that problem. We would not make the cricketers go across to Kippax Lake and bat on malthoid wickets. We could put another wicket down there somewhere. </para>
          <para>What I am advocating is not an impossible dream by any means. One of the problems we seem to have under our federal system is an inability to get things going. It might be argued, however, that ace sports administrators like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McAuliffe</inline> of Queensland were able to launch projects like Lang Park, but all areas are not the same. It is sometimes argued that sporting bodies should do their own thing. We might have reservations about the type of government we should have but I read an article in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> about the East German college of athletics, anatomy and kindred other matters with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> would be very familiar. I do not think we have to go ali the way but at least we want modern facilities. Ignoring for a moment the actual arena, nobody today is going to put up with ramshackle facilities. There are complaints about facilities from all codes operating in the outer suburbs. I suppose if we had a Treasury mentality we would say that a certain ground was not to be used every day of the week. </para>
          <para>What I am talking about may be a status symbol but in the present economic situation I cannot see that what I propose would be a drain on the Treasury. For a number of years the Army has spent a considerable amount on its Singleton areas. I am singularly fortunate, thanks to the use of an Army helicopter, to have been able to get from the air a very clear impression of what could be done. </para>
          <para>I am thinking ahead of future Olympic and Commonwealth Games; I am not merely considering the immediate fixtures. The venues for the Games have been up for grabs by various States. Somebody might say that the debt of the Olympic Games in Montreal is considerable. The former Lord Mayor of Sydney, Nick Shehadie, and people like him have been carrying the torch for something to be done. I am quite satisfied that irrespective of the mixed political complexion of the Sydney Cricket Ground Trust it will not move without a vigorous prod from Canberra. The situation is as simple as that and it is for that reason I make this plea to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> If I appear today to be a sort of political Diogenes looking for the truth it is just that I am looking for progress and I would like to believe that something better can be done. </para>
          <para>This may be a fragmentary approach. I remember telling <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Daly,</inline> a former Minister, that it seemed to me that Service people were difficult to deal with. I know that Andrew Peacock did the same thing. I think we agreed. However, Brigadier Grenville had some reservations. I might say that I went into the lions' den. I attended a military tattoo at Victoria Barracks and afterwards spoke to the officers about this matter. I did not take them on here; I went up there. They had some reservations about the matter. I spoke with Lieutenant-Colonel Brogan and people like him. They realised that this would be a good public relations exercise. </para>
          <para>I have always been interested in forms of demonstrations and have considered guerilla warfare in the various cities. I do not want to get on to the subject of effective movements but if honourable senators had read a military journal written by a gentleman who stood against Bill McMahon for the seat of Lowe they would have found out something about urban strategy. A garrison in a big city can be blocked up. However, if the garrison is outside a city it is more mobile. If I were talking to Brigadier Grenville now instead of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> I would roll that suggestion back to him in view of the views of <inline font-weight="bold">Major Peter</inline> Young. I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> has read his defence journal relating to military strategy. </para>
          <para>I want to conclude my remarks because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walsh</inline> is getting ready to raise another grievance. I simply say that I want a report. I would like to know whether the proposal is on <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> desk or whether the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Killen),</inline> a Queenslander, has been pressured by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Newman,</inline> a former Army officer, to hold the line. I honestly believe that this will not be an immediate charge on the Australian Government. I do not think it is a question of centralism; I have said before and I say again that I am one of those people who believe that Canberra, whether we have a Labor Government or a Liberal Government, can give leadership and then it is up to the States to move a bit. I very strongly advocate some indication from this Government of where we are in regard to the phasing out of the Army from Sydney to Holsworthy or Singleton. Let Sydney have a sports stadium that could be a potential venue for a Commonwealth Games or an Olympic Games. </para>

          <para>That the Senate expresses its concern about the implications of the Government's investment allowance policy. </para>
          <para class="block">This notice of motion which I placed on the notice paper in February this year has been overtaken to some extent by events. The investment allowance of 40 per cent for <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> years and 20 per cent for the succeeding 5 years, which the Government had announced as its policy prior to February, has since been enacted. I think the legislation was passed on 1 June. Nevertheless there are several points arising from that investment allowance legislation and the irrational thinking which underpins it which ought to be restated. One hopes that if they are restated frequently enough they will penetrate the consciousness of the people currently in control of economic policy and taxation policy in this country. The Liberal Party's document is entitled <inline font-style="italic">New Government Policies.</inline> I am not sure precisely when it was published but I think it was in December 1975. The document can be found in the Library and the reference is 329/407. On page 6 of that document the Liberal Party, then in Government, set out its economic policy. Under the heading ' Investment Revival ' it said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The strategy for restoring full employment and economic growth is based on a revival of private investment. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That strategy, or wishful thought, was put into legislation on 1 June, the essential features of which I have already detailed. Common sense would have suggested that, at a time when industry was operating at well below capacity, when manufacturing industry, to which the allowance was presumably largely directed, was operating at capacities estimated at between 70 and 80 per cent, and when there was no sign of a resurgence of consumer demand, it would be extremely difficult to persuade private business to embark upon a new or expanded investment program. Of course, some private investment was made; some private investment will continue to be made The point, however, is that that level of investment almost certainly would have taken place with or without the investment allowance. </para>
          <para>Superimposed on the improbability of private business embarking upon a new investment program when it already had surplus capacity and when there was no sign of a resurgence of* consumer demand was the fact that many private businesses also had liquidity problems and probably still have them. Regardless of their desires they were not, therefore, in a position financially to be able to embark upon a new investment program. The improbability of the investment allowance being effective in achieving the objectives stated in those circumstances was seriously aggravated by the fact that the Government announced that the 40 per cent rate would be available for 2 te years with an additional concession period of 12 months for plant not fully installed and a rate of 20 per cent would be available for a further 5 years. </para>
          <para>The message was given to business very clearly that here was a massive taxpayer provided subsidy for business investment. In effect the Government was saying: 'We would like you to embark upon a major investment program immediately because we believe that it will stimulate an economic recovery but we will continue to make this concession available at the maximum rate for a further 2 <inline font-style="italic">Vi</inline> years. Therefore, there is really no hurry to rush into an investment program'. That was the ambivalent policy which was presented to private business by the Government. It said: 'We want you to rush into a major investment program now, but if you do not feel like doing it it does not matter because you have <inline font-style="italic">2Vi</inline> years to delay and to procrastinate and you can still reap the maximum benefit from the concession'. </para>
          <para>Perhaps more important in the longer term than the absurdity of making the allowance available for such a long period and justifying it on the hypothesis of an investment-led recovery is that we have now been locked into an economic policy which may be totally inappropriate to the circumstances prevailing two, three or five years hence. To a significant degree, our options are closed for 7'/i years. No rational Government ought to make a decision to lock itself into a policy which may be inappropriate at a time so far ahead. Of course, there is the possibility that the legislation may be repealed or amended- remote though it is while the present managers are in control of the economy. I refer particularly to the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Lynch)</inline> and the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser).</inline> The possibility that they may be replaced by people more literate in these matters perhaps justifies an attempt to convey a different view to the Government. To his great credit, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gatton,</inline> a member of the present Government who clearly has considerably more comprehension of these matters than his Leader or his Treasurer, as early as 1 1 February publicly repudiated the notion that there would be an investment-led recovery or that it was a viable proposition when he said that he believed in a consumer-led recovery. </para>
          <para>The investment allowance did not even achieve its primary objective of stimulating the level of private capital investment. The Australian Bureau of Statistics publication entitled <inline font-style="italic">New Capital Expenditure by Private Businesses in Australia</inline> for the March 1976 quarter showed that on a seasonally adjusted basis new capital investment for all industries, excluding agriculture, although marginally higher than for the December quarter, was only one per cent higher. It was lower than it had been in the June and September quarters of last year. For manufacturing industry the level of new investment in the March quarter, on a seasonally adjusted basis, was lower than it had been for more than 2 years. I attempted to obtain a copy of the June publication today but I was unsuccessful. I am not sure whether the figures for the June quarter have been published. There have been rumours in the Press that private new capital investment increased by 7 per cent in the June quarter but the reason for that is most certainly the desire to businesses to take advantage of the 20 per cent accelerated depreciation allowance for investment before 30 June rather than the continuing benefit of the investment allowance. </para>
          <para>There is an important difference in principle between accelerated write-off and an investment allowance. That ought to suggest to the Government that, if it wants a particular taxation concession to be effective in terms of stimulating new investment, it will be much more effective if it is clearly stated that the time for its availability is limited and unless private business undertakes investment within a short-term period the concession will no longer be available. </para>
          <para>I confidently predict that private investment for the September quarter will fall below the level of the June quarter. That is not simply wild speculation or wishful thinking. The Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 1 6 August reported on a survey conducted by W. D. Scott and Co. which found that gloom and pessimism still prevail among the country's business chiefs. The article states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Less than 30 per cent expected a 'definite economic recovery ' in the next year. The majority said they hoped for a real recovery late next year or early in 1 978. </para>
            <para>For the immediate future about 40 per cent predicted they would cut their employment in the next 4 months. </para>
            <para>The same number said their stocks would run down and more than 30 per cent predicted cutbacks in overtime. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">At this stage there is certainly no decisive evidence that the investment allowance has succeeded. If in fact the assumption of a 7 per cent increase in the June quarter is correct, that will almost certainly be a temporary abb err at ion and not an indication of a long term trend. It is not seriously suggested by anyone in the business community that the investment allowance, extremely costly though it is, has been effective in achieving its primary objective of inducing a greater volume of private capital investment. Indeed, it now seems to have been largely dropped from the political rhetoric of its architects, Messrs Fraser and Lynch. </para>
          <para>The strategy of the present Government in December last year for restoring full employment and economic growth has been tacitly abandoned although legislatively enshrined. It is quite apparent from Tuesday night's Budget Speech that there is no strategy for recovery. The Budget tacitly acknowledges that unemployment will be higher in the next 6 months and at least as high 12 months hence as it is now. It sets out a strategy of reducing real wages. It provides no stimulus to consumer demand. It gives no reason whatsoever for anyone to believe that there will be an economic recovery. The strategy that the Budget revealed with more clarity than any strategy for economic recovery is that it is this Government's desire to make life more comfortable for selected businesses during a recession- a recession which, by the Government's conscious and deliberate decision, will be both deepened and prolonged. </para>
          <para>The objections to these investment allowances are not based simply on their cost. I have noted that the Budget documents estimate that there will be a cost to revenue this year of $200m and a cost to revenue next year of $600m arising from the investment allowance. Of course, there is a time lag of 12 months between the actual investment being made and the cost to revenue. Ideologically-based obsessions with balanced Budgets still dominate the thinking of this Government, notwithstanding the fact that it brought in a Budget which runs to a deficit which, when properly corrected, is just as great as the deficit was last year. I do not criticise the Government for doing that. I assume that it is some concession to reality that even the most case-hardened ideological prejudices have to pay some heed to reality. It must have become apparent to a majority of the members of the </para>
          <para class="block">Government anyway that this ideological commitment to a balanced Budget could not be achieved this year; nor, I forecast, will it be achieved next year. Grudgingly, no doubt, and unwillingly a certain amount of reality has intruded into the policies of this Government. . </para>
          <para>Nevertheless, given that this obsession with having a balanced Budget is paramount in the Government's thinking, the fact that a concession has been granted for a purpose- a purpose which was always questionable and a purpose which it has clearly failed to achieve but which has been so COStlY to revenue- automatically means that a commensurate sum will be cut off government expenditure somewhere else. Of course, the areas in which government expenditure has been cut back to finance this very costly and ineffective investment allowance are the specific purpose grants to the States, which have a very high employment generating potential, the direct capital expenditure on public works by the Federal Government, which likewise has a very high employment generating potential, and such other fields as Aboriginal affairs, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> was quite vocal about yesterday, noting that both the present Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> and the previous caretaker Minister had repudiated the undertakings that they gave to the Aboriginal community and to the Australian people as a whole not to cut expenditure on Aboriginal affairs. That probably does not have very much employment generating potential. Nevertheless it is still one of the consequences of this Government's investment allowance policy. </para>
          <para>In the longer term it just seems to be patently absurd to attempt to justify a policy of subsidising the substitution of capital for labour and then to attempt to justify that policy on the grounds of stimulating the level of employment. There is a fundamental contradiction in that proposition. It is theoretically possible to conceive that new capital investment in a particular industry which is technologically inefficient and therefore noncompetitive may make that industry more efficient and therefore more competitive and perhaps lead to a growth in output so great that it more than offsets the capital for labour substitution, and therefore the total employment in that industry may increase, even though the amount of labour required to produce a given level of production will fall. That is a theoretical possibility in specific industries. It might even be possible that it applies to the Australian shipbuilding industry, although that is pure speculation. </para>
          <para>This policy, however, is not directed at specific industries which are actually technologically inefficient because their capital is too shallow. It is directed right across the board in areas in which it may have some use and in areas in which clearly its only effect will be to displace labour with capital. Any industry which is producing a commodity for which the demand is quantitatively limited must come into that category. To whatever degree that capital displaces labour- of course, if one subsidises capital one encourages that sort of displacement- total employment in that industry will decline. We had a fairly dramatic example of that in Western Australia last October when the Swan Brewery announced that it was proceeding with a $50m investment in a new plant at Canning Vale, I think it is. That decision was not affected by this Government's investment allowance policy- it pre-dated that- but it illustrates the principle. The Swan Brewery announced the investment of $50m in this new plant and simultaneously stated that it would lead to the retrenchment of 300 of its staff. That is about 30 per cent of the brewery's total employment. </para>
          <para>Another area in which the cost to revenue will be quite significant this financial year is in the purchase of very large tractors. These tractors are usually imported. I may say more about that a little later. There is a pretty effective ceiling on the level of agricultural output in Australia which is marketable. There again, the effect of this sort of purchase, which is encouraged by the investment allowance, will be to displace labour from agriculture, which will therefore inevitably accelerate the drift in population from agricultural areas to the city about which the National Country Party of Australia does a lot of grandstanding but for which it appears to have no effective policies to overcome. Of course, the only policies which would effectively overcome the situation would be policies concerning things like growth centres and attempts to move manufacturing industry and tertiary industry into the country areas because the potential for employment in agriculture has been declining for 30 or 40 years and almost certainly will continue to decline. </para>
          <para>In adopting this investment allowance policy as the linchpin of what the Government used to call its strategy for restoring full employment the Government has, of course, repudiated a recommendation of the Mathews Committee. In considering a choice between the indexation of company stocks and depreciation allowances as against an investment allowance policy as a means for assisting business, the Mathews Committee rejected the investment allowance policy and came down on the side of the indexation of company stocks and depreciation. I have noted that the Government has half-implemented now, or signified its intention to half-implement, the indexation of stocks held. It has thereby done 2 things, of course. It has given highest priority to the policy that the Mathews Committee rejected. It has enacted one and endorsed another, thereby rejecting the Mathews Committee's assessment that these 2 measures should be seen not as a complementary measures but as alternatives. </para>
          <para>Continuing a little further with the investment allowance policy and the interaction between the investment allowance policy and the other taxation measures announced in the Budget this week, clearly the major beneficiary from the Government's policy will not be manufacturing industry which has the greatest employment generating potential, but mining. The Government will abolish the coal tax progressively. It has signified its intention, contrary to the recommendation of the Industries Assistance Commission, to allow the write-off of capital expenditure on mining development, ports, associated facilities and so on over a5-year period instead of the 15-year period which the LAC recommended. In addition to that, the 40 percent investment allowance will apply in relation to most expenditure by mining companies. The compound effect of all those measures will be that more than 50 per cent of the capital expended on new mining development will, in fact, be provided by the Government but it will secure no equity. From that I must assume that the Government has no objection to committing taxpayers' funds to mining industry development. Its only objection is to taxpayers ' securing any equity in return. </para>

I have tried to listen in my room to his speech and I have come in here to listen to him. From time to time he does give utterance to the odd economic truth. It is not often, but when it happens it is all the more welcome. I listened to the honourable senator and I thought: That is some of the greatest confusion in thinking that I have heard for many years. What the honourable senator really came out with was a proposition that we go back to a country with handicraft industries employing lots and lots of people, adding practically no value. I think this debate ought to be continued on another day when we have a bit more time to expose some of the rubbish which has been talked this afternoon. Accordingly, I move: </para>
