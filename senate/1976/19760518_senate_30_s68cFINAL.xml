            <para>- I direct my question to the Leader of the Government in the Senate since it has Foreign Affairs and other ramifications. I ask the Minister to indicate to the Senate whether Australian aid rendered to Italy as a result of its recent earthquake is based upon the principles followed by the former Minister for Immigration, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Clyde</inline> Cameron, in the Cyprus debacle, with particular regard to external aid sent direct to the stricken region. Could the Minister give a clarification of the definition of special category migrant which would apply to victims of the earthquake, particularly orphans? Could he also outline the ambit of aid based on the foregoing principles that applied to what might be called a secondary earthquake in the Yugoslav Republic of Slovenia, a matter which he will know that I have raised with the Prime Minister and other Ministers following representations from the Slovene community in Sydney? </para>

I must say that I was somewhat intrigued by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Wells&#39;s decision but I assume that he had full power under the laws of South Australia to take such action. Nobody seems to have taken any action to appeal against that decision so far as I know, but as the honourable senator has an interest in this matter I shall take it up with the Attorney-General and ask whether he can supply a more detailed answer than that which I have been able to give. I must repeat that I assume the honourable and learned judge knew what he was doing and was acting within the laws of South Australia. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> I preface it by reminding you that on 28 April 1976 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Michael</inline> Townley produced a document in this chamber which, by inference, he claimed had been compiled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Henry</inline> Fischer. The document was unsigned and when it was tabled it was seen that 2 pages had been removed previously. Are you aware that on 4 May 1976 the Attorney-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott,</inline> said in another place that the document had not been released by him? Are you also aware that in a Press statement published on 5 April 1976 the Attorney-General denied in more detail that he had released the document? Are you aware also that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fischer</inline> issued a statement through his Sydney solicitors on 3 March 1976 denying the main allegation in the unsigned document? As it appears that all the evidence presented by the honourable senator was unsubstantiated and indeed may have been false, will you take the necessary action to ensure that the honourable senator is dealt with by the appropriate Senate committee in accordance with the Standing Orders, customs and practice of the Senate? </para>

            <para>-I apologise to the honourable senator because he has not had an answer before this date. Honourable senators may be aware, and Ministers in this place are aware, that we are all engaged in a chase-up situation at the moment in trying to get answers to questions which have been on the notice paper for far too long in many cases. As to the remainder of the honourable senator&#39;s question, work is going on in my department concerning the Scott Report. In fact, there have been consultations with some other departments within this area, certainly with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cotton&#39;s</inline> department, as I recall it, which of course is very : interested in the matters contained in the Scott Report and with government procurement in general. At the moment I think it would be preferable if I obtained an early answer to question No. 66 on the notice paper- I hope tomorrow or the next day- and gave to the honourable senator a more detailed and considered answer to the other matters which he has raised this afternoon. </para>

            <para>- I take it that the honourable senator&#39;s question is based on a leaflet distributed in Melbourne by certain groups of people and relating to checks which were made by officers of my Department. In relation to the comments that have been made about inquiry officers raiding the area, the Melbourne office of my Department has advised that during the week from 4 to 7 May 12 inquiry officers in 9 vehicles reviewed 425 unemployment benefit claims in Kensington, an area of dense population and high rise flats. As a result of that review, which involved 581 visits, it was recommended that 13 people be transferred to other benefits, for example sickness benefits; 47 people have returned to employment and benefits were terminated; and recommendations were made that benefits be terminated for other reasons in 72 cases. Sixty people failed to keep appointments and these cases are being followed up. It should be emphasised that there is nothing unusual about this review. It is a routine procedure. The comment that was attributed in some sections of the Press to the Victorian Council of Social Service in the last paragraph of an article, that the Department is investigating suspected defaulters, is misleading. The Department regularly reviews all claims and not just with the intention of finding defaulters. Many people require assistance with claims or are eligible for a different form of benefit. Wherever possible inquiry officers assist these people. </para>

          <para>To answer the question that was addressed to me, there is no substance in the allegation regarding police tactics or whatever else may have been suggested. It was simply the usual review that is undertaken by inquiry officers in the Department to enable the inspection of people who are in receipt of benefits to see whether the appropriate benefit is being paid or whether the benefit should be suspended or discontinued. </para>

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Transport, concerns an article by Peter Samuel which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> of 15 May. I ask the Minister whether the following assertions are factual: That officials in Canberra say it is just possible that the absorption of the South Australian railways into the Federal system may yet be blocked; that agreement on awards and conditions has not been reached with the employees due to be transferred to the Commonwealth on 1 July, and that Australian National Railways officials have done an exercise which discloses that the whole of the existing Adelaide to Port Pirie railway line can be converted to standard gauge for $10m over one weekend? Is it a fact that the proposals of the previous Government for a railway line from Adelaide via Crystal Brook to accomplish the same result would cost $90m for line construction alone? Finally, is the Minister able to comment upon statements concerning the economics of the new railway line from Tarcoola to Alice Springs which was mentioned in the article? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Jessop</inline>was good enough to draw my attention to the article to which he refers and I was therefore able to get some information. I am advised as follows: The Railways (South Australia) Act 1975 and the Railway Agreement (Tasmania) Act 1975 provided for the assets and liabilities of the nonmetropolitan South Australian rail system and the Tasmanian rail system to be transferred to the Commonwealth, together with financial responsibility for these rail systems, on 1 July 1976. The agreements for the transfer provided for the States to operate the systems transferred to the Commonwealth on behalf of the Commonwealth pending a transfer of management to the Australian National Railways. Negotiations with the employee unions concerned are currently continuing with a view to completion as early as possible. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am not aware of the current cost of converting the existing rail line from Adelaide to Port Pirie to standard gauge. However, this conversion was one of the options considered at the time of negotiating the new standard gauge line. The cost of line construction alone of the new main line from Adelaide to Crystal Brook under the Adelaide to Crystal Brook Railway Act 1974 is estimated at about $40m. Finally, the previous detailed evaluation which resulted in legislation to enable the continuation of this line in 1 974 has not been re-evaluated at this stage. </para>

            <para>-My question is addressed to the Minister for Administrative Services. I ask: Is the report correct that the Minister forwarded a submission to the Remuneration Tribunal, for which body he is ministerially responsible, on the subject of salaries of senators and members of the Australian Parliament? If so, was the submission put to the Tribunal by the Minister on behalf of the Government, or was it a submission made in the Minister&#39;s own right as a senator of the Parliament? If it was a submission on the part of the Government, did it receive the approval of Government supporters at any Party meeting? Does the submission mean that if the Tribunal does not conform to the Government&#39;s submission, the Government intends to move in either House of the Parliament to disallow the Tribunal&#39;s determination? </para>

            <para>-I think the honourable senator has asked 4 questions. The answer to the first one is yes. The answer to the second one is yes. The answer to the third one is no, we have to be a government and governments make decisions under their own rules and governments live with their own decisions. As to the fourth question, all I can say is that if the honourable senator likes to speculate, he may go for his life and do so. But why one should form an attitude before the report of a tribunal is presented somewhat escapes me. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs has stated that we will give immediate priority to those nominations already in the pipeline involving people made homeless by the earthquake. We will also give priority to other nominations lodged in the immediate future which are within existing immigration criteria. Nominations outside the normal criteria where special compassionate circumstances exist, such as where families have been deprived of their breadwinner or where children have been orphaned, will be accepted and dealt with quickly. The Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs announced also that staff from the Department in Rome would go to the disaster areas without further delay to help process the nominations quickly. At Sydney and Melbourne the officers of the Department of Immigration will be specially designated to attend to these nominations in an expeditious manner. We hope that this will be of assistance to those people who are victims of and made homeless by the earthquake. </para>

          <para>In answer to the other question with regard to any other assistance that may be given, I state that I believe the Senate would be aware of the $250,000 donation that was given by the Australian Government through the International Red Cross in respect of the earthquake. I am sure that further consideration would be given to any other matters in regard to which we are able to offer some concrete assistance. </para>

            <para>-The question of a national rural bank has been discussed by the Minister for Primary Industry, the trading banks and the Treasurer. It was decided at that discussion about the middle of February to have a working party examine the whole proposal. That is what is happening at present. The question of a farm income reserve fund is equally under examination. It is a very complex and difficult matter, as was the study, and will take some time to resolve. </para>

Is it true that the recent meeting between the Minister and State Ministers was a flop because the Minister had no national compensation scheme to consider? Does the Minister agree that there is an urgent need for such a scheme? Will she say whether she has a scheme to be considered or have her promises about an impending scheme been window dressing to pacify the growing unrest among State governments and others who are gravely concerned about the soaring costs of compensation schemes in Australia? </para>

            <para>- I think it is of interest to hear the suggestion from the honourable senator from Western Australia that the meeting was a flop because the Western Australian Minister for Labour and Industry has publicly expressed considerable satisfaction with the outcome of the meeting which was held in Canberra recently. As far as a national compensation scheme is concerned, I have interest in the preparation of a scheme. The Ministers concerned were invited to Canberra on that occasion for exploratory talks. That was the specific invitation which was tendered to them. It appears to me that they have become accustomed in the past 3 years when coming to Canberra to having a scheme forced upon them rather than having consultation in a co-operative way. The outcome of the meeting which I hoped to obtain was that there should be some concurrence among the State Ministers and the Federal Government about moving towards devising a co-operative scheme in which all parties would participate. I am pleased to say that the outcome of the meeting is that a steering committee has been formed. Meetings have been arranged in June for that steering committee which will have representation from the States, the Territories and the Federal Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the State Ministers concerned had come to the meeting expecting to have a scheme forced upon them I assume that they, likewise, would have brought some matters which they wished to have discussed. As most of them accepted the talks as exploratory and as a steering committee has now been formed, I believe that the preparatory stage is finished and that we can move forward and work together in order to find a common area of agreement whereby a national compensation scheme can be devised. That was the outcome of the meeting. Anything else which was reported may have been an impression of individual State Ministers. As far as I am concerned, the invitation was for exploratory talks. </para>

Is it a fact that earlier this month 3 boys, aged 13, 14 and 16 years respectively, spent 3 days and nights in the maximum security section of the Fannie Bay gaol while on remand? If this is a fact, will the Minister explain to the Senate how such a situation could be tolerated, especially as the Fannie Bay gaol has been described as the worst institution of its type in Australia?

            <para>-The facts generally as asserted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> are true. A 13-year old boy spent 3 days in the Fannie Bay gaol while on remand and two other children, aged 15 years, were similarly remanded. Subsequently, all three were released at the expiry of the remand period. The decision to place the children in Fannie Bay gaol was the magistrate&#39;s and was in keeping with a recent trend adopted by the magistrate to ensure that children who appeared before the court were brought face to face with the possible consequences of breaking the law. The Children&#39;s Court magistrate is aware that the only security facility where likely absconders can be kept under control is Fannie Bay gaol. At present 10 juvenile prisoners are held in Northern Territory prisons, in Darwin and Alice Springs. Of these, 3 prisoners are in Darwin and the remainder in Alice Springs. Two of those held in Alice Springs have been remanded pending committal proceedings to the Supreme Court. </para>

          <para>Discussions have been held with the senior magistrate and the Children&#39;s Court magistrate who have been informed that the Department has prepared Palmerston House as a holding centre which could be used in remand cases, where there is no reason to believe that the individual will abscond, or in case of a first offender who needs to be placed under restraint as part of a rehabilitative program. General agreement was reached and the proposals outlined at the discussions are to be put into effect. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline>may acknowledge that, whilst arrangements have been made to use Palmerston House, it could be said that these may prove unacceptable to the magistrate in cases involving difficult children who are absconders and who have a past history indicating that control would be more difficult. Palmerston House offers no more security than a normal family home and is so constructed that it is virtually impossible to make it anything else. The general matter is under discussion at the moment. I hope that that information gives some advice to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson.</inline></para>

Is the Minister aware that early this month Soviet authorities refused to allow a visit to Russia by <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Charles</inline> Curran, the Director-General of the British Broadcasting Commission, because of the BBC&#39;s refusal, despite pressure from the Soviet Embassy in London, to withdraw an interview with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Solzhenitsyn?</inline> Is the Minister aware also that, in the period since Solzhenitsyn &#39;s release from the Soviet Union, the Australian Broadcasting Commission has screened only one interview with Solzhenitsyn, despite the fact that several other interviews were available and at least one was offered by the BBC to the ABC but was rejected as not suitable? Will the Minister ascertain the specific reasons the ABC considered the BBC program not suitable? Will he ascertain also who made that decision and whether any pressure was applied by the Soviet Union on the ABC similar to the pressure applied without success to the BBC? Will the Minister seek an assurance from the ABC that the apparent decision not to provide an opportunity to the Australian public to hear what Solzhenitsyn has to say is not based on political considerations and that, should the Soviet Embassy in Canberra attempt to apply pressure on the ABC, as it did on the BBC, any such pressure will be firmly rejected? </para>

As to the details regarding the Australian Broadcasting Commission, I am not aware whether the ABC screened one interview or more with Solzhenitsyn. I am not aware, therefore, what specific reasons there may have been for not screening the BBC interview, if so. I am quite sure that the Australian people would be eager to see and to hear interviews with a man such as Solzhenitsyn who must be one of the most courageous men of massive integrity alive in the world today and also one of the great fighters for freedom. On that basis, I will refer the substance of the honourable senator&#39;s question to my colleague in another place and seek from the Australian Broadcasting Commission the information which the honourable senator requests. </para>

              <para>-No. The 3 persons were appointed by letters patent issued by the Governor of Western Australia. It may well have been that one of those persons was appointed on the nomination of the Commonwealth Government. I have always understood that it was a royal commission held under the Royal Commissions Act of Western Australia. It reported to the Governor of Western Australia. The Commonwealth Government was involved only in 2 ways. Firstly, it paid half the Bill; secondly, I think it nominated one of the 3 commissioners and the nomination was accepted. I think the questions asked by the honourable senator are valid and I will ask the Attorney-General to give him an answer at the first opportunity. </para>

I ask him whether he has noticed, in the last annual report of the Australian National Line, that of the $9m loss incurred up to 30 June last for the preceding 12 months $6m was due to industrial disputes? Will the Minister have the situation examined carefully to investigate whether or not the unions are making a target of the Government shipping line to prevent proper shipping services which that line provides, being operated, particularly to Tasmania? </para>

            <para>- I am not able to say when a commissioner with a nursing background will be appointed, but it is part of the Government&#39;s stated policy that one of the full-time commissioners should be a person with a background in nursing. I understand that the Minister for Health has been having discussions with the Australian Capital Territory Health Commissioner. Due to possible changes in Medibank and other things that may need to be resolved, it will be at the time when those things are being considered that the Government will examine the whole structure of the Australian Capital Territory Health Commission. I am sure that if it is at all possible to do so at the time of looking at these difficulties the Government will take the opportunity to fulfil its own policy, that is, to appoint a full-time commissioner with a background in nursing. </para>

I further understand now that the Government of Arabia has agreed to assist the Moslem communities in Australia by providing finance, that it has in the last 2 weeks investigated the situation in Darwin and has agreed to assist the Moslem community there.

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Health refers to the very extensive deletions and other restrictions to the pharmaceutical benefits list and the recent increases introduced by the Government. Is the Minister able to advise whether the Minister for Health has considered the many representations from eminent doctors, other people and members of this Parliament in respect of numerous prescriptions which are necessary for the good health of citizens and which have been specially urged upon the Government by those bodies? Is she able to give any information about this? If she cannot, will she give any information later on in respect of antihistamine prescriptions? Will she also give information about the 3 recommendations from the prominent heart specialist and the petitions which have been presented to this Parliament in respect of milk substitutes? </para>

            <para>-The matter is not a simple one, as the honourable senator knows, and I acknowledge his interest in it. As he will recollect, one of the problems is that some 3 institutions are involved, with differing standards of approach to the question of training of interpreters and translators, and there is a need for some kind of accreditation agency which would set the standard to be attained. The honourable senator will understand also that unless accreditation standards are sufficiently high, job opportunities will not be available at the end, and in recent weeks there has been some evidence that this is so. All I can say at the moment is that a number of actions are being taken both within my Department and outside to try to rationalise the matter. As soon as I can, I will make a statement and let the honourable senator know the position. </para>

            <para>-Is the Minister for Education aware that the special services division of the Victorian Education Department has advised Victorian schools that the National Film Library has imposed a reduction of lending services to schools, the reasons given being the recently imposed staff ceilings and budgetary restraints. In view of the importance of audio-visual aids in education, will the Minister examine the position to see whether the cost savings involved justify deprivation of benefit to Australian schools and Australian school children? </para>

We consider that the Expenditure Committee will allow a greater in-depth examination of public expenditure than that provided by the Senate Estimates Committees and the Public Accounts Committee. </para>
          <para>There is, however, an obvious need for close liaison between these Committees. It is for this purpose that I introduce this Bill to amend the Public Accounts Committee Act to enable the  Chairman  of the Expenditure Committee to be an ex-officio member of the Public Accounts Committee. It is also proposed that the  Chairman  of the Public Accounts Committee be an exofficio member of the Expenditure Committee, but this of course does not need an amendment of the Act. The Bill also proposes to make several formal amendments to the Act in accordance with current drafting procedures. I commend the Bill to honourable senators. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this Bill is to extend the effective operation of the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 to enable grants to be made for aged persons hostel projects for which applications have been lodged but which, for one reason or another, could not be commenced within the time limits imposed by the Act. The amendment will not re-open the legislation for lodgment of applications for new or additional grants. </para>
          <para>The Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 was introduced with effect from 27 September 1972 and was designed to operate for a period of 3 years. The reason for this, as stated by the  Hon.  W. C. Wentworth, the then Minister for Social Services, in introducing the Bill in another place on 14 September 1972, was to encourage the building of additional hostel accommodation for the frail aged within a short period of time. The measure was not introduced as a substitute for the continuing program operating under the provisions of the Aged or Disabled Persons Homes Act 1954-1974 which as honourable senators are aware provides for the Commonwealth to subsidise the cost of building self-contained, hostel and nursing accommodation for aged or disabled persons. </para>
          <para>The objective is that all beds funded under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 are hosteltype, catering specifically for the frail aged and those in greatest need of accommodation because of advanced age and limited financial resources. In introducing that Bill it was intended that by encouraging additional hostel accommodation there would be a lessening of the pressure for admission to nursing homes by people who had no real need for nursing care. Since the inception of the Act 154 grants have been approved which have attracted grants in the region of $64m. When all these projects have been completed accommodation will have been provided for 5700 aged persons. </para>
          <para>Under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 the Commonwealth Government meets the capital cost of providing hostel type accommodation for 2 additional aged persons for every one accommodated in an unsubsidised home, or one additional person for every two in an existing home subsidised on a dollarfordollar basis prior to 1957. To achieve the objective of encouraging early construction of new accommodation the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 presently has a condition that a grant shall not be made in respect of a hostel unless the hostel was approved under section 5 of the Act on or before 27 September 1975 and construction commenced within 12 months from the date of approval of the hostel. Under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 many organisations were approved as eligible and acquired the right to purchase or construct new hostel type beds subject to the availability of Commonwealth funds. The original legislation was amended on 9 December 1974 to enable organisations who wished to do so to transfer their rights to other eligible organisations. These rights were sought by some organisations and this gave a considerable stimulus to the program and created a demand for grants in respect of hostels that exceeded the number that could be funded in 1975-1976 within the Budget allocation of $40m. </para>
          <para>In order to preserve organisations&#39; hostel bed entitlements under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974, the previous Government decided in August 1975 to approve all outstanding proposals under section 5 of the Act on or before 27 September 1975- the last day on which, under the existing legislation, a hostel could be approved- but to defer the making of a grant in a large number of cases because of insufficient funds. This resulted in the previous Government deferring in excess of 300 applications for grants under this legislation. These are valued at in excess of $ 134m. At the same time these organisations were given an assurance by the previous Government that their rights under the Aged Persons Hostels Act 1972-1974 would be preserved even though the making of grants in respect of their projects had been deferred. </para>
          <para>Under the existing Act, projects must be commenced not later than 27 September 1976. If projects are not commenced by that date, as the legislation now stands, eligible organisations would lose their previously approved entitlements. The Government has decided that to enable an annual program of construction to be undertaken and to ensure that the rights of organisations which have acquired entitlements under the legislation are preserved, there should be an extension of the time within which the erection of a hostel can be commenced. An amendment to the existing legislation will give organisations with existing rights 12 months from the date on which a grant is actually approved to plan and commence construction of their hostels. Provided this condition is met, the legislation as amended will authorise the Director-General to actually pay the grant. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

          <para class="block">My second reading speech on this Bill relates also to the Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Amendment Bill 1976 and the Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Collection Amendment Bill 1 976. The purpose of these Bills is to extend the Commonwealth apple and pear stabilisation scheme to cover the 1976 export season for apples and pears. The scheme has operated over the 1971 to 1975 export seasons. The Industries Assistance Commission has inquired into the need beyond the 1975 season for Commonwealth Government financial support for the stabilisation of returns to growers from exports of fresh apples and pears. In its interim report, the Commission recommended the continuation of this scheme on a modified basis for the 1976 season. </para>
          <para>These Bills give effect to the Government&#39;s decision, announced on 27 February this year, to accept the Commission&#39;s recommendations. The recommendations in respect of apples were that the maximum level of price support under the scheme in 1976 be $2 per box and the maximum quantity eligible for support be 2 million boxes. Support should be confined to sales &#39;at risk&#39; to Europe, including the United Kingdom. Previously, stabilisation support for apples covered all apples exported on an &#39;at risk&#39; basis. The Government has also accepted the recommendations of the Commission in respect of stabilisation support for the 1976 pear exports. The recommendations were that the maximum level of price support be 80c per box and the maximum quantity eligible for support be 1.4 million boxes. Support would be confined to &#39;at risk&#39; sales to Europe (including the United Kingdom) and North America, whereas under previous stabilisation arrangements all pears exported on an &#39;at risk&#39; basis were covered by stabilisation support. </para>
          <para>The opportunity has also been taken to convert units and quantities referred to in the legislation to metric units, and to bring the language in the existing legislation into line with current drafting practices. The term &#39;reputed bushel&#39; referred to in the Act has been replaced with the term &#39;reputed box&#39; in accordance with the terminology currently in use within the industry, and approved by the Metric Conversion Board. </para>
          <para>During the 1971 to 1975 seasons the apple and pear stabilisation scheme has provided for the establishment of a support price for the season for each variety of apples and pears. The support price has been calculated each season in line with movements in growers&#39; cash costs as assessed by the Bureau of Agricultural Economics. The &#39;average export return&#39; for each variety was determined at the end of the season from actual sales. Where the &#39;average export return&#39; apples or pears was less than the &#39;support price &#39; a payment equal to the difference was made to growers exporting that variety &#39;at risk&#39;. Overall limits were placed on support to provide for a maximum rate of 80c per bushel on a total of 4.4 million bushels. The maximum quantity eligible for support was increased for the 1972 season only to 4.9 million bushels. Where the &#39;average export return&#39; is greater than the support price a charge was levied on the relevant growers. A limit on the grower charge equivalent to the limit on the payments from the funds has been applicable. Varietal stabilisation funds have been established, into which Government and industry contributions were paid, and from which payments to growers were made. Provision for imposition and collection of the charge liable to be levied on growers in the circumstances I have just outlined, is made in the Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Act 1971 and the Apple and Pear Stabilization Export Duty Collection Act 1 97 1 - 1 973, respectively. </para>
          <para>The purpose of the Apple and Pear Export Duty Amendment Bill 1976 is to limit the rate of export duty that growers may be required to pay in the 1976 season, in accordance with the limits on stabilisation payment proposed for the 1 976 season under the Apple and Pear Stabilization Amendment Bill 19/6. These limits are a maximum of $2 per box for apples and 80c per box for pears. Export duty will also be limited in its application to exports to markets covered by the stabilisation scheme in 1976. The 1974 and 1975 export seasons have seen the operation of special schemes for apples only, supplementary to the Commonwealth stabilisation scheme. This additional assistance was provided jointly by the Commonwealth and State governments. In 1975 a limit was placed on this supplementary support, of 80c per bushel on a maximum quantity of 3.04 million bushels of apples exported &#39;at risk&#39; to the United Kingdom/Europe market. In 1976, similar supplementary proposals have been made to State Governments by the Commonwealth Government for a support program covering apples exported on an &#39;at risk&#39; basis to United Kingdom/Europe in 1976. The quantity of fruit covered by this Commonwealth offer is being apportioned among States. The Government has proposed that this assistance program, which would be supplementary to stabilisation support and funded jointly by Commonwealth and State Governments, provide support totalling Sim equivalent to 500 000 boxes at the rate of $2 per box. </para>
          <para>Economic pressures on the export section of the apple and pear industry have been acute. The export sector, particularly of the apple industry, has traditionally been oriented towards the United Kingdom/Europe market. The profitability of this outlet has been reduced drastically by rising freight rates, currency adjustments and severe international competition. The industry is a labour intensive and high cost one, and is particularly vulnerable to international and domestic inflation. The nature of the apple and pear export trade, which involves long distance transportation of a bulky commodity, sold largely on a speculative basis in Europe and North American markets, is such that the transportation and marketing costs have severely eroded the profitability of much of the export trade. There have been strong representations from the industry particularly from Tasmania and Western Australia, that the level of support recommended by the Commission for 1976 exports of apples would not be adequate and would result in hardship in fruitgrowing regions. The Government considers that there is a case for some liberalisation of assistance, chiefly with respect to the quantity eligible for support. Accordingly, the special export assistance to which I referred covering a further quantity of apples to the United Kingdom/Europe market beyond the 2 million boxes supported by the stabilisation scheme has been submitted to State governments with strong recommendation for their support. </para>
          <para>The extension of the stabilisation scheme will assist in easing the social and regional difficulties associated with the necessary adjustments which are occurring in the apple and pear industry. A considerable number of growers have left the industry, particularly in Western Australia and Tasmania, in recent years. The adjustment which has already taken place in the industry has resulted in a substantial reduction in exports. To illustrate the changes taking place in the industry, the volume of apple exports has declined from 7 million boxes in 1970 to 4.4 million boxes in 1975. Over the same period, apple and pear bearing tree numbers have declined by some 26 per cent. There can be little doubt that the next few seasons will see increased economic pressure on the apple and pear industry and that substantial further adjustment will be required. Because of the regional concentration of the export industry, particularly in Tasmania and Western Australia, the necessary changes will have regional implications. It seems inevitable that the industry will become increasingly orientated towards the domestic market with a substantially reduced and redirected export trade. It is the Government&#39;s intention that this process of adjustment should be orderly, and should not be accompanied by unnecessary individual hardship. </para>
          <para>The Government regards the stabilisation support as an interim measure pending Government consideration of the Commission&#39;s final report on the apple and pear industry. The maximum cost to the Commonwealth of extending the apple and pear stabilisation scheme for the 1976 season would be $5. 12m. It should be noted that depending on the variables which influence the seasonal level of payments under the Commonwealth stabilisation scheme, such as average levels of return for fruit, the maximum commitment may not be fully drawn. In 1975, although $4.7m was committed by the Commonwealth in export support programs, only $3.6m was ultimately utilised. These Bills provide Government support for the 1976 apple and pear season which has already commenced. As such, they provide interim support for the industry for the period during which longer term and more comprehensive proposals for the industry can be considered. I commend the Bills. </para>

          <para class="block">East Timor situation. I register my strong objection to the Government&#39;s gagging that debate when all points of view had not been registered in this Senate. It is all very well for the Government and for the Opposition to be in each other&#39;s pocket but there is another point of view which should have been expressed at that time. I cannot go along with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> said at the end of the debate, that is, that there was a substantial area of agreement between the parties in the Senate on the question of East Timor. I agree that he could have felt that I was of the same opinion as the vast majority of Australians that the East Timorese have the right to self determination. I had made that clear to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> before coming into this chamber. However, what was not adverted to during the discussion was the hypocrisy of the Left on this question which is shown when its attitude, and particularly that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> who initiated the debate, is compared with the attitude that it adopted in 1962 over the invasion by Indonesia of West New Guinea. I certainly hold the same view as I did on the previous occasion. </para>

              <para>- In July 1974 I was one of the first to advert to the problems which could arise in East Timor because of the developing concern in Portugal. At that time I supported the proposition that there should be an act of self determination for the East Timorese people. In 1962, in the committees of the Labor Council, I supported the view that there should be an act of self determination by the people of West New Guinea. </para>

          <para>Let us look at what the current proposers on the Left are saying now and what they said then. There is no better illustration than a comparison of their current bellowing on the subject of East Timor and their silence and acquiescence at the time of the Indonesian takeover of West New Guinea. The 2 actions by Indonesia were very similar, but the response of the Left coalition in Australia has been markedly different in each case. The difference is explained by the fact that at the time of the takeover of West New Guinea Indonesia was very close to the Soviet Union, and the PKI- the Indonesian Communist Party- - exerted strong influence over President Sukarno. Today, of course, an anti-communist government is in power in Indonesia. </para>
          <para>I have relied extensively on the document known as <inline font-style="italic">Keesing&#39;s Contemporary Archives</inline> for information. At that time in 1962 there was an arms deal between the Soviet Union and Indonesia. There are a number of similarities between the Indonesian takeover in West New Guinea in 1 962 and the Indonesian takeover of East Timor in 1975. If it is correct to criticise Indonesia today for its action over East Timor it was also correct to criticise Indonesia for its actions in West New Guinea, but the forces which are beating the drum now about East Timor were silent in 1962. Why were they silent? They were silent because in 1962 the Soviet Union supported the Indonesian takeover of West New Guinea. In the words of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kosygin,</inline> the Soviet Government and people &#39;fully support the demand of the Indonesian people for the return of West Irian to Indonesia&#39;. That was repeated by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Laurie</inline> Aarons in the Communist Party <inline font-style="italic">Tribune</inline> of 20 May 1962, when he wrote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Communist policy is for complete support of Indonesia &#39;s claim to West Irian and complete independence for the peoples exploited and oppressed by Australian capitalism. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">That declaration of attitude by the Soviet Union and by the Communist Party of Australia had the effect of signalling to the Left that it should either support the takeover of West New Guinea or turn a blind eye to it. That is precisely what the Left did in its statements and propaganda organs, including the union journals which it influences. However, in the present circumstances the Soviet Union opposes the Indonesian takeover of East Timor, and only recently when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry</inline> left Australia to speak at the United Nations in support of Fretilin the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> reported on 13 April that the Soviet Embassy in Canberra offered him all possible assistance while in New York. Whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry</inline> took up that assistance or not, the offer itself was significant. In my view, the Indonesian takeover of West New Guinea warranted equal criticism with Indonesia&#39;s latest actions in East Timor. </para>
          <para>As I said earlier, there are some interesting similarities between the 2 events. Firstly, in West New Guinea prior to the takeover there were parties of independence, just as there were parties in East Timor. In West New Guinea those parties were the Democratic Peoples&#39; Party, the New Guinea Party of Unity, the Party of United Young Papuans, the National Party, the Party of the People of New Guinea and the Strength Through Unity Party. In East Timor the parties were UDT, Fretilin, KOTA and Apodeti. The second similarity between West New Guinea and East Timor is that the United Nations was either powerless to act or disinclined to become too deeply involved. Thirdly, in the case of both West New Guinea and East Timor, the Indonesian actions were escalated during a time of elections or their aftermath in Australia. In the case of East Timor there were significant developments immediately before, during and after the time of the caretaker Government last year. In the case of West New Guinea, President Sukarno&#39;s call to all Indonesians to be ready for general mobilisation to liberate West Irian came 10 days after the 1961 general election in Australia. The fourth similarity relates to the fact that both incidents involved a decolonising power which scarcely had a deep interest in the territory concerned. In the case of West New Guinea that power was the Dutch and in the case of East Timor it was the Portuguese. On both occasions the Indonesians&#39; actions warranted criticism by Australia, not ideologically motivated criticism but criticism based on a true regard for Australia&#39;s interests and those of the people who were the subject of the takeover. </para>
          <para>Let me illustrate the hypocrisy and double standards of some of those who are behind today&#39;s protests, those who provide the muscle for the Left controlled operation. I exclude specifically those people who, like myself, support self determination in the case of East Timor and who stood to support self determination for the people of West New Guinea. As an example I illustrate the attitude of the Miscellaneous Workers Union, which is controlled by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ray</inline> Gietzelt. Past and present officials of his union are prominent in today&#39;s campaign over Timor. If one looks at the list published in the Communist Party&#39;s Journal <inline font-style="italic">Tribune</inline> of 21 January 1976 of organisations involved in the Timor campaign, one will see some interesting entries. For example, the Wollongong contact for the Australia-East Timor Association is Len Norriss and his address is given as care of the Miscellaneous Workers&#39; Union, Room 11, 14 Station Street. Len Norriss is the district organiser of the Miscellaneous Workers&#39; Union, and, incidentally, is a member of the Communist Party of Australia. In the <inline font-style="italic">Tribune</inline> list the Newcastle contact is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Keith</inline> Wilson. He is the contact for the Campaign for an Independent East Timor. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wilson</inline> is the secretary of the Newcastle Trades Hall Council, a former full time Communist Party organiser and secretary of the Newcastle branch of the Miscellaneous Workers&#39; Union. But where were the Miscellaneous Workers&#39; Union and its organisers in 1962 when a pro- Communist Indonesia was taking over West New Guinea with the support of the Soviet Union and the support of the Communist Party of Australia? Where were their great ideals in regard to the self determination of the peoples thus affected? </para>
          <para>During March, April, May and June of 1 962 several hundred Indonesian paratroops were dropped by aircraft at a number of points in West New Guinea and the Indonesian attack on West New Guinea escalated rapidly. What was the Miscellaneous Workers&#39; Union doing? I will tell the Senate what it was doing. In March the New South Wales branch, under Ray Gietzelt &#39;s leadership, was sponsoring the visit to Australia of a delegation from the Soviet Union which was actively backing the takeover at that time of West New Guinea by the Indonesians. In May the New South Wales branch organiser of that union, J. J. Dwyer, was in Moscow attending the May Day celebrations at the invitation of the socalled Soviet All Union Council of Trade Unions which, incidentally, was under the control of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alexander</inline> Shelepin, a former KGB boss. Was not it Solzhenitsyn who said &#39;. . . in our country, since the Revolution, there&#39;s never been such a thing as a free trade union&#39;? <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dwyer</inline> was sent to Moscow by the Federal Executive of the Miscellaneous Workers Union. Perhaps- I say this with some irony- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dwyer</inline> was delivering a protest note to the Soviets about their support of the Indonesian takeover of West New Guinea. If so, he was not very successful because on 8 May 1962 Indonesia signed an agreement with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics for the supply of Soviet arms. The Indonesian Foreign Minister said that the arms would be more than enough to face the growing threat from the Dutch in West Irian&#39;. </para>
          <para>Right throughout the period of the Indonesian takeover of West New Guinea the Miscellaneous Workers Union journal <inline font-style="italic">Federation News</inline> made not the slightest protest about the takeover. It maintained absolute silence. The only reference to West New Guinea in the entire collection of the 1961 and 1962 issues <inline font-style="italic">of Federation News</inline> was one paragraph within an item in the 1961 ALP Conference policy decision on foreign affairs and defence. Yet during this period <inline font-style="italic">Federation News</inline> published many items about the involvement of the Miscellaneous Workers Union in the New South Wales Peace Committee. In the September 1961 issue a photograph was published of a Miscellaneous Workers Union banner stating &#39;Peace is Trade Union Business&#39;. Indeed, peace is trade union business, but it must be peace with justice. We must stand for the right of self-determination of all people, whether they are being taken over by a communist power or not. </para>
          <para>Let us have a look at that Peace Committee with which the Miscellaneous Workers Union was affiliated and which the union was lauding in its journal. What was the committee saying about the takeover? The committee in its journal was supporting the Indonesian takeover of West Irian on the basis that West Irian was for 300 years an integral part of the multi-racial colony formerly owned by Holland and then known as the Dutch East Indies. This was the basis for the powerful support from the Afro-Asian and socialist countries for the Indonesian claim to the territory. That is what the committee was saying at the dme of the Indonesian takeover of West Irian. This Committee with which the Miscellaneous Workers Union was involved- the New South Wales Peace Committee- had an equally two-faced attitude. It never once publicly criticised the takeover; indeed, in its publications it supported the takeover. Nor did the journal <inline font-style="italic">Peace Action</inline> for 1961 and 1962 carry any reports from associated organisations, such as the Sutherland Shire Peace and Disarmament Committee, criticising the Indonesian actions. The Sutherland Shire Peace and Disarmament Committee was supporting the views of the New South Wales Peace Committee and of its publication for the takeover of West Irian by the Indonesians. Who do we find is the patron of the Sutherland Shire Peace and Disarmament Committee? None other than the honourable senator who raised the matter of urgency last Wednesday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt.</inline> What double standards is the Senate treated to? </para>
          <para>Similarly, we have the Amalgamated Engineering Union which now forms part of the Amalgamated Metal Workers Unions. What is that union doing at the present time? What was its attitude at that time? If one searches the journals of the Union one finds silence on this question. But like the Miscellaneous Workers Union, the Amalgamated Engineering Union in its journals during the period of the Indonesian paratroop landing on West New Guinea was busy following the Soviet line and also was busy feting delegations from the Soviet Union which in turn was supporting the Indonesian takeover of West New Guinea. The action of the Communist Party and its allies contrasted with the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Arthur</inline> Calwell, the Leader of the Parliamentary Labor Party at the time. It has to be stated, and stated quite clearly, that the Australian Labor Party at the time stood for the selfdetermination of the peoples of West New Guinea, as it stands now for the selfdetermination for the peoples of East Timor. </para>

Their actions and their statements today over East Timor are ideologically motivated. The friends of the communists are not genuinely concerned with the rights of the people of East Timor, and the tragedy is that they are using the people of East Timor for their own ideological ends. The tragedy of that is that the people who genuinely feel for the people of East Timor have a very different job in trying to have their point of view heard. </para>

              <para>- I am not dividing forces. The problem is the double standards that are adopted. Honourable senators saw a motion presented by one senator which demanded selfdetermination of a people against Indonesian aggression. What notice is the Indonesian Government or the Australian Government going to take of that resolution when the same person supported the takeover of another people and denied their right to self-determination simply because of the political colour of the Government at that time? I give this advice to certain members of the Government Parties in the Senate: The next time you are approached to sign a petition about East Timor which contains the statement, &#39;We call for the extension to the people of East Timor of an opportunity to exercise freely their right to self-determination&#39;, ask the organiser of the petition what was his attitude on the independence of the people of West New Guinea when a pro-Communist Indonesia liberated &#39; the country at that time. </para>

          <para>I want to advert to one final matter, namely, the distressing situation in which we saw our newsmen killed in East Timor. I support the protests that have been made in regard to that. But there are some guilty men who have not been exposed. The guilty men are the newspaper proprietors who sent those people in there to obtain a sensational story. Sensational story they got with the deaths of those men. They were sent in unprepared and ill-equipped. I ask: Who are the guilty men? On whose shoulders rest the deaths of those newsmen? Certainly, it rests with the people who physically killed them. But surely the newspaper moguls cannot be absolved from blame altogether in that circumstance. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I apologise to you and the Senate for having taken its time but I hope that the Government will get the message that when a senator wants to speak on a particular matter, the Government should not gag the debate in future. </para>

            <para>- I am tempted to speak very briefly on the utterances of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine.</inline> Many of us have argued that the wrongs of the super powers never surprise us. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has complained frequently in his speeches about what he calls the selective news releases of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I believe that he conducted that sort of exercise tonight. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">He referred to what happened in the incorporation of West New Guinea under Indonesian sovereignty. I do not know whether he was absentminded on this subject or whether his memory failed him, but he would know also that regardless of the machinations of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics or any other country, the United States of America was implicated to the extent that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellsworth</inline> Bunker, a top negotiator who at this very hour is endeavouring to salvage the United States reputation in regard to the future of the Panama Canal, was equally involved in the West New Guinea matter. </para>
          <para>There is a lesson of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> ought be aware. I make these remarks with all due respect to Arthur Calwell who admitted afterwards that when the super powers made a deal there was nothing you could do about it. I am not here to defend honourable senators on the Government benches, but I know that when Arthur Calwell tried to activate the Australian public in regard to West Irian there was a general desire- justifiably- not to engage in warlike adventures. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> conducted some more research into the arguments expounded at that time by senior members of the then Liberal-Country Party coalition, he would know that their theme was: Do not rock the boat. I am not suggesting that the Liberal-Country Party coalition was involved in machinations with Moscow but I do say that it went along quietly with Ellsworth Bunker. The message that I give the Senate, and in particular <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine,</inline> is that the Labor Party on other occasions has urged Australia not to become tied down in a partnership line with any of the super powers but to reserve the right to have our options open. We have been justified by history in taking this stand. </para>
          <para>I think that it is good to know that Bishop Gleason and others are not in the toils of Arthur Gietzelt or his brother Ray. That ought to be made very clear. I do not think that they are taking any notice of either my Senate colleague or his brother. Let us get the matter into its right perspective once and for all. I and many other people were not unaware that  President  Sukarno had Hatta and other socialists imprisoned. But one message came across loud and clear at that time, as it does now. I listened to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> speak on this subject in the Senate recently. I always listen to his views but I do not always agree with them. However, I believe that Government spokesmen on this matter agree with us on this point: Whatever has happened in Timor, we will not send an expeditionary force up there and have another Vietnam situation. </para>
          <para>I do not want to decry anybody&#39;s views but first and foremost there must be no more positioning of Australian forces, either in a voluntary or conscripted capacity, on mainland Asia. That is the major thing. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack has argued about continued negotiations taking place. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur</inline> Gietzelt, is much concerned and impatient to have relief and food sent to East Timor, and then have talk, not war. That slogan has a familiar ring. It is fruitless to be arguing about who did something at a given time. I can give an Irish analogy which I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> would appreciate. I have attended meetings of people who left the Republic of Ireland in the 1920s. They were not quarrelling about what Great Britain did or did not do. They lined up behind either Collins or De Valera and got into bitter arguments on the merits of both, when in effect, both Collins and DeValera deserved praise and not abuse for their activities. It was a pointless argument. It is just as pointless tonight for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> to argue what stand somebody took on an earlier occasion. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> have enough political maturity to know what is contained in the petition when they sign it. I am sure that if I presented them with petitions, sometimes they would sign and sometimes they would say, &#39;It is not on&#39;. </para>
          <para>I conclude on this point: We should have a united front to help these people in desperate straits in Timor. We should not worry whether it is Ray Gietzelt of the Miscellaneous Workers Union or his brother, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur</inline> Gietzelt, who is involved in the matter. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> did a disservice equally to Bishop Gleason and to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen.</inline></para>

            <para>Information of the type requested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> is not normally recorded. Many students apply to a number of institutions, not only in their own state, but also outside their state. The major difficulty encountered in obtaining accurate information on the rejection of applications for admission to tertiary institutions is that there is no satisfactory way of establishing that a student rejected at one university or college of advanced education is not accepted by another university or college for the same or another course. There are also the associated problems of students who are offered places but reject them for a variety of reasons or who, when unable to enter the courses of their first choice, do not take up alternative offers and are therefore counted as rejections. </para>
            <para>The only sources of information which may throw some light on the honourable Senator&#39;s question are the central admission agencies which operate in three States; in Victoria, the Victorian Universities Admission Centre (VUAC) processes applications to all Victorian universities and most of the colleges of advanced education; in New South Wales, the Metropolitan Universities Admissions Centre processes applications to the three Sydney metropolitan universities only; and in South Australia applications to the two universities and the South Australian Institute of Technology are handled centrally. In the other States admission to tertiary institutions is a matter for the individual institutions concerned. </para>
            <para>In summary, the best source of information is the VUAC, which is only a sample and relates to the situation in Victoria only. Relevant figures can be prepared by the centre when it completes its 1976 processing of applications but an appropriate fee would have to be paid. </para>

            <para>- The Minister for Transport has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) No makes or models of vehicles are being considered as such for exclusion from Australia. Any make or model may be imported provided it meets the standards mutually agreed by the Australian Transport Advisory Council. </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>My Department does not determine these standards. It assists in the preparation of recommendations to the Australian Transport Advisory Council, which consists of the State Ministers for Transport and the Australian Ministers for Transport, the Capital Territory and the Northern Territory. It also provides advice to the Australian Motor Vehicle Certification Board on applications made by vehicle manufacturers for the issue of authorities to affix plates indicating compliance with the relevant Australian Design Rules. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>When framing Design Rules the Council and its advisers pay attention to all safety factors. For example, of the 27 current Australian Design Rules related to safety, 14 are aimed at avoiding accidents, a primary safety, as some people like to call it, and 1 1 are aimed at minimising the risk of injury or death after an accident, or secondary safety. The other two rules could be said to have aims in both fields. </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>Firstly it must be said that decisions as to registration are the responsibility of the respective State and Territory registration authorities, which are not within my Ministerial responsibility. However, under the agreed system of Australian Design Rules it is certainly possible for a vehicle with exceptional primary safety to be refused registration if it does not comply with the agreed safety standards. For instance it would be refused registration if it did not have adequate seat belts. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>As a final comment it might be added that primary vehicle safety is extremely difficult to define. There are some high quality vehicles which most experts agree do have exceptional primary safety but nowhere in the world has it been possible to define more than a few individual features such as brakes, tyres and safety rims because of the complexity of the inter-relating factors involved. </para>

Newspaper reports which suggested that there have been cut-backs for the Northern Territory totalling in excess of $150m are not correct. Indeed, cash appropriations for the Northern Territory in 1975-76 have actually increased and further consideration is being given to expenditure programs which have been deferred until the overall review could be completed. </para>

            <para>In view of the honourable senator&#39;s concern, he will be pleased to learn that the present Government has reduced the number of ministerial staff from 242 as at 10 November 1975 under the Labor Government to 166. This reduction in staff numbers will achieve savings in a full year, on current salary and staff allowance levels, of approximately $1.23 million. Savings will also be achieved in the costs of official travel and related allowances for the staff of Ministers not only because of the reduction in staff establishment but also because of restrictions placed on the number of staff who may accompany Ministers when travelling. </para>
            <para>The Government has introduced stringent controls in respect of the employment of ministerial staff. Unlike Ministers of the Labor Government, Ministers of the present Government do not employ relatives in their Ministerial offices or Electorate offices. Before engaging a staff member, Ministers provide me with details of the employment history, academic attainments or other qualifications, and any personal, family or relevant connection of which I, as the Minister responsible for administrative matters relating to ministerial staff, should be aware. These procedures are designed to ensure that members of a Minister&#39;s personal staff have appropriate qualifications and have no conflict of interest that could make them unsuitable for employment on the personal staff of a Minister of State. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Attorney-General. In November of last year, under the previous Government, steps were taken to set up legal aid offices at some 32 additional sites. To date there appears to have been no further work done on this matter. Can the Senate be advised whether there is likely to be any cut in the number of offices to be opened and if so, which offices will be cut? Can the public be assured that all other offices will be opened with all speed? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>I provided some information to the honourable senator and undertook to provide further information. I said in my earlier reply that the Attorney-General has had discussions with representatives of the Law Council of Australia and would be taking up the matter with the State Attorneys-General. The Attorney-General has met with the State Attorneys-General. Following that meeting officers of the Commonwealth and States have met to work out the details of a scheme to rationalise legal aid services for submission to their respective Governments. The Attorney-General is now considering a report of that meeting, together with a number of representations from a wide range of interested groups and individuals. He hopes shortly to meet again with State Attorneys-General to discuss specific proposals. </para>
          <para>The establishment of offices of the Australian Legal Aid Office at 28 new locations approved by the previous Government has been deferred pending completion of the review being conducted by the Attorney-General. The selection of locations for legal aid offices and the opening of new legal aid offices will be matters for consideration within any new framework for the provision of legal aid that is established as a result of the review. </para>

The practice of centralising export meat shipments was introduced to reduce costs and is followed in order to limit the number of port calls by container ships. The high operating costs of these vessels, and the extremely high cost of load.ing containers onto the vessels makes it more economic to restrict the number of port calls and centralise cargoes to main ports at shipowners&#39; expense. </para>

              <para>1 ) and (2 ) I am aware ofthe press reports concerning the experience ofthe Central Methodist Mission in regard to the settlement of British migrants. I have been informed, however, that the Mission did not conduct a formal survey. The views reported in the media were based on the impressions of staff members of the Mission and there are no available statistics on which to reach a definite conclusion on this matter. </para>

          <para>British migrants have constituted 44 per cent of ail migrant arrivals since the commencement of separate statistical recording of settler arrivals in 1959. In view of the size  or  the British community in Australia, it is remarkable that so few have encountered serious personal or other difficulties in settling. </para>
          <para>Surveys with which my Department has been associated indicate that the ability to speak English contributes substantially to the capacity of newly arrived migrants to settle happily and successfully in the Australian community. The British migrant is, therefore, in that respect at a substantial advantage over his non-English speaking counterparts. </para>
          <para>British migrants tend to have less difficulty than those from many other countries in securing recognition in Australia of their professional or trade qualifications and, therefore, tend to have less difficulty in finding employment in this country at a level commensurate with their training and previous employment. </para>
          <para>Several years ago, a survey was conducted under the aegis of the former Immigration Advisory Council, on the departure from Australia of former settlers. This indicated that the departure rate of former British migrants was not exceptional. The survey showed that during the six years after arrival in Australia, approximately 23 per cent of settlers born in Britain and Ireland left Australia for permanent residence overseas. This was only slightly greater than the average of 21 per cent for all source countries and much smaller than the departure rates for many. Moreover in view of the absence of visa requirements up to January 1975 for United Kingdom citizens wishing to enter Australia it would not have been surprising if there had been a higher rate of departure from Australia by British migrants than by other migrants. </para>

              <para>The main reason for my statements earlier this year concerning British migration to Australia was to reassure people in Britain that Australia still welcomes those who qualify for migrant entry to Australia. Under the ALP Government migration from Britain has declined dramatically and I had been informed that there was a belief in Britain that Australia no longer wanted migrants from there, lt is in the interests of Australia and prospective eligible British migrants that this belief be dispelled as quickly as possible. </para>

              <para>Where many variable factors are involved, as with the home loan interests deduction scheme, the concept of an &#39;average taxpayer&#39; has no meaning.

          <para>I note, however, that relatively few taxpayers have sought to have their PA YE deductions adjusted to take account of their entitlements under the scheme, which may suggest that the scheme as originally introduced may not have had all the qualities claimed for it. By contrast, what the Government, looking to the realities, proposes by way of the new home savings grant scheme and the amended deduction scheme will ensure that resources are applied at the points of greatest effective need. </para>

              <para>(a) and (b) The time taken to complete and issue a notice of assessment together with a refund cheque where appropriate is influenced by a number of factors. Returns received from salary and wage earners early in the financial year would on average be processed more quickly than returns received in other periods. The Commissioner of Taxation endeavours to issue all assessments and refunds as quickly as possible after returns are received; in some cases however, it is necessary to verify or obtain additional information before an assessment can be finalised. </para>

          </list>
          <para>As honourable senators will be aware, the Australian Taxation Office has developed a sophisticated computer system to speed up the processing and associated actions involved with finalising assessments. Whilst all returns are examined by specially trained officers, much of the routine work formerly associated with their duties is now being performed by computer process. Apart from assisting with the assessing action, the computer systems amongst other things produce both a notice of assessment and refund cheque where applicable. It is not possible, therefore, to separately apportion the average time taken between the lodgment of a return, the making of an assessment and the payment of a refund; however, the average time taken throughout the Commonwealth from the date of receipt of a return until a notice of assessment and refund cheque is forwarded to a taxpayer is generally of the order of 6 to 8 weeks. It is known that, for 85 per cent of salary returns, assessments and refunds are issued within 6 to 8 weeks from the date the return is lodged. </para>

The earliest date on which a taxpayer liable to provisional tax is required to pay his assessment is 3 1 March following the close of the financial year in which the income was earned, or 30 days after service of his notice of assessment. The vast majority of taxpayers pay the amount owing by the due date or shortly thereafter. </para>

              <para>The administration of the income tax law has been vested by this Parliament in the Commissioner of Taxation, who is an independent statutory officer and who carries out his functions in the manner prescribed by law. The Commissioner follows the policy of requiring all taxpayers to meet their taxation obligations as they fall due unless there are compelling reasons for deferring payment. Continued efforts are directed to ensuring, as far as possible, that all tax due for payment is collected before 30 June. As a consequence of the introduction in this financial year of a new computer system designed to ensure that tax will be assessed at the earliest achievable date, it is expected that the percentage of tax outstanding at 30 June this year will be lower than the corresponding figure for previous years. Operational methods are consistently under review to ensure that the most cost-effective use is made of staff engaged in collecting outstanding tax. </para>

              <para>The Government&#39;s policy includes the reintroduction of a revised Home Savings Grant Scheme to help first-home buyers.

            <item label="(3)">
              <para>The honourable senator&#39;s proposal raises a major issue relating to taxation policy. The Australian income tax system is based primarily on the concept of the ability of an individual to pay. This depends on the total amount of income received, with no discrimination between sources of income. Exempting interest received on certain deposits with savings banks and building societies, as suggested by the honourable senator, would conflict with that basis principle of our tax system. </para>

            <item label="(4)">
              <para>The proposal would have a number of other disadvantages. For example it would not necessarily attract more funds for housing. Without introducing complex institutional arrangements there could be no certainty that the lower costs to the mortgage institutions of attracting funds would be passed on to low-income, first-home applicants. It would not help to reduce the deposit gap. This stimulus to a certain form of saving would, however, give high income earners with high marginal rates of tax, higher after-tax returns from this form of saving than low income earners. The cost to Government revenue could never be confidently known in advance. </para>

            <para>Will the Minister representing the Minister for Transport inform the Senate whether the security arrangements for passenger aircraft at international airports in all of the Middle East countries are commensurate with the security arrangements at the Australian Airports? Secondly, is there any sound reason why spot check electronic surveillance of passengers disembarking in Australia should not be carried out? Thirdly, are the holders of diplomatic passports free from electronic surveillance under the Vienna Convention of a Diplomatic Immunity and Privilege?&#39; </para>

            <para>At an earlier stage in my parliamentary life I was more up to date on the question of surveillance and checks at airports than I am today. There was a very strong international arrangement between most of the principal countries that had either departure or landing facilities for the sort of checks to which the honourable senator refers. Most of the customary checking was done on outward going passengers. I have always felt that there was a case for some checks to be made on people entering a country. The same device- a magnetometer may be used for checks on people leaving as well as for people entering a country. I do not know what the current practice is in other countries. But for a long time there has been an international co-operation arrangement about checks, particularly with regard to hijack problems. I would imagine that it is still operating. I am not totally familiar with the area of diplomatic immunity in checking arrivals at airports. I think it is a very useful question to have asked and I shall try to get full details for the honourable senator&#39;. </para>

            <para>Security arrangements at International Airports are a matter for each State to determine. Member states of ICAO ( International Civil Aviation Organisation) observe the provisions of Annex 1 7 (Security) to the Chicago Convention on International Civil Aviation and use the Annex Standards and Recommend Practices as a guide to development of their own programs which may vary in stringency depending on the security required at any time. </para>
            <para>The potential threat associated with disembarking pasengers is recognised but it has been considered more desirable by leading States for aviation security checks to be performed prior to commencement rather than after completion of a flight. Aviation authorities of countries with airlines operating to Australia have already been requested to ensure that their airlines carry out a search of passengers, their carry-on baggage, and, if the threat at the time justifies it, a search of hold baggage (i.e. baggage accompanying the passenger but not carried in the cabin) prior to arrival in Australia. </para>
            <para>Australia has an obligation to comply with the provisions of Article 36(2) of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic </para>
            <para class="block">Relations which states that the personal baggage of a diplomatic agent shall be exempt from inspection &#39; unless there are serious grounds for presuming that it contains articles not covered oy the exemptions mentioned in paragraph 1 of this Article, or articles the import or export of which is prohibited by the law or controlled by the quarantine regulations ofthe receiving State&#39;. Paragraph 1 refers to articles for the official use of the mission and for the personal use of a diplomatic agent or members of his family. </para>
            <para>The Vienna Convention was drawn up in 1 96 1 well before the emergence of the practice of hijacking and airborne terrorism and of the introduction of measures of protective security to combat these developments. Consequently there is no reference in the Vienna Convention about electronic surveillance. </para>
            <para>Australia also has an obligation under Article 10 ( I ) of the Montreal Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts Against the Safety of Civil Aviation which provides that endeavour shall be made by contracting states in accordance with international and national law, to take all practicable measures for the purpose of preventing offences against the safety of civil aviation. </para>
            <para>Foreign diplomatic and consular missions to Australia have been advised by the Department of Foreign Affairs that members of their staff will be subject to security screening if a security check is nominated for their particular flight. Discreet searching facilities are available for heads of a mission and persons of like status. We acknowledge the obligation to treat such persons with all due courtesy and respect but the airlines are obliged to comply with the direction and permit no exemptions. </para>

            <para>I preface my question, which is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, by referring to the address given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> to the Australian Confederation of Apparel Manufacturers. She spoke of the need to widen the employment opportunities of migrant women by developing their natural skills by, amongst other things, assisting them with language problems. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle</inline> said- I agree with this-that it is futile to expect women who are working in factories all day and at home all night to go out to night school. Therefore I ask: What steps is the Government taxing to facilitate the teaching of English in the work place? </para>

          <para>The following answer is provided to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As the migrant education function is now part of my responsibility, I am able to say that a special six weeks course for use with migrants in industry at the work site, preferably in employer time, was developed by the former Department of Immigration towards the end of 1971. The course provides basic instruction in the English language using the situational method and includes social and cultural content. The course consists of 36 hours instruction and is designed normally to run for a period of six weeks, though the time span may vary depending upon the requirements of shift work and other factors. Using the basic course and following discussion with management of a particular industry, the course can be modified and adapted to take into account safety factors, specialised vocabulary, and factory rules and regulations applicable to the work environment of the particular industry. </para>
            <para>It was not until early in 1973 that the course was developed to any appreciable extent. Statistics are based on the period commencing May 1973 and from that date to the end of February 1976 a total of 394 courses had been held in factories and in industry generally in New South Wales, Victoria, Queensland, South Australia and Western Australia. The number of migrants who have taken part in the course was 5431 and the number of employer organisations involved (some of which have maintained the course on a continuing basis) was 139, representing a wide range of industry. The statistics maintained under the program have not to date differentiated between male and female workers, but it has been estimated that women make up approximately 33 per cent of migrants enrolled in courses in Victoria. Courses in some firms are weighted in favour of women- GloVVeave, Rosella, Kraft and L M Ericcson for example. Across all States the figure would be about 20 per cent. </para>
            <para>The development and further expansion of courses in industry and the extent to which the language needs of migrant women in particular can be reached in this way are areas to which the Government is committed as a matter of policy. </para>

          </quote>
          <para>I provided some information to the honourable senator and undertook to provide further information. I am now able to advise as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The reduction in expenditure on the school building program in the Northern Territory for 1975-76 is approximately $l.lm or approximately 5.25 per cent ofthe forecast expenditure. This reduction in expenditure follows a cut of $26.937m or approximately 97.4 per cent of new program items as a result of the suspension of the 1975-76 Civil Works Program and 45.3 per cent of the total program including revoted works. </para>
            <para>With regard to school maintenance programs, it is anticipated that some $1.2m of a total program of about $1.4m will be committed in the current financial year. </para>
            <para>There has been no reduction in the number of teachers employed in the Territory. Its staff ceiling in 1976 is set at the same level as that which applied in 1 975. </para>
            <para>The number employed on a full-time basis in the Territory increased from about 1230 in October of last year to 1315 at the end of March this year. The Commonwealth Teaching Service is shortly to hold further interviews in order to fill current and expected Term 2 vacancies. At the end of October 1 975 there were 341 teachers in Government Aboriginal schools. In April 1976 this increased to 366. </para>
            <para>Restraints on expenditure have not affected the number of schools on Aboriginal settlements, missions and pastoral properties. These are, however, affected by changes in populations; at August 1 975 there were 49 such schools and at the end of March 1976 this number was 53. The installation of a number of mobile units in some &#39;outstation&#39; communities has been delayed. </para>
