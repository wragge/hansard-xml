          <para>That the Senate expresses its deep regret at the death of the Right Honourable Lord Casey, Baron of Berwick, Victoria and of the City of Westminster, England, K.G., P.C., G.C.M.G., C.H., D.S.O., M.C., K.St.J., a former GovernorGeneral of the Commonwealth of Australia from 1963 to 1969, a member of the House of Representatives from 193 1 to 1940 and from 1949 to 1960, and Minister of the Crown from 1935 to 1940 and from 1949 to 1960, places on record its appreciation of his long and meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">In the history of our country few men have attracted, or earned, the respect due and paid to the late Lord Casey. Not only was his public contribution one of great distinction and lasting value, but also he was a man of integrity and enormous common sense. He was the kind of man who imparted stature to the institutions he served. The Australian people can count themselves immensely fortunate to have had him as a servant over such a long period. </para>
        <para>It is generally recognised that one of Lord Casey&#39;s most impressive characteristics was his immense capacity for work. His industry was remarkable and it was this extraordinary application that enabled him to undertake so many careers in the course of his lifetime. He was at one time or another a soldier, an administrator, a politician, a diplomat and a vice-regal personage. In all of these careers he served with conspicuous success. </para>
        <para>In 1914 he volunteered for the Australian Imperial Force and served with distinction at Gallipoli and on the Western Front. He was mentioned in dispatches and for his valour he won the Distinguished Service Order and a Military Cross. He was discharged in 1919. From 1924 to 1931 he served his country in the External Affairs Department as Australian Political Liaison Officer in London. </para>
        <para>His political career commenced in 1931 when he became a member of the House of Representatives for the seat of Corio, a seat he held until his first resignation from the Parliament in 1 940. During the period of the Great Depression he served in several portfolios. He was Assistant Federal Treasurer from 1933 to 1935 and Federal Treasurer from 1935 to 1939. As Treasurer he took an active role in the development of a national insurance scheme which, for reasons beyond his control, was never implemented. He was also at this time Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, an association he continued after the War and throughout his retirement- an association of great and lasting benefit to that Organisation and to the nation. </para>
        <para>Lord Casey was a liberal in the full sense- a man of progressive instincts, not fearful of change. He welcomed the challenge of a new circumstance, a new job. He was often ahead of his time and keen to play a part in defining a new role for his country. He represented Australia to the world in a critical period of our history. </para>
        <para>In 1940, Lord Casey resigned from the Parliament to become the first Australian Minister to Washington. He expended great energy in ensuring that Australia &#39;s position was well known to the American Administration and to the  President  of that time, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Roosevelt.</inline> In 1942, at the request of the then British Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Winston</inline> Churchill, Lord Casey assumed the position of Minister for State for the Middle East and had the rank of Cabinet Minister in the British War Cabinet. </para>
        <para>Speaking in the early part of this decade about the controversy that surrounded his acceptance of such a post, he remarked that such an appointment in the Middle East was far more important than the post he had left in Washington. He appreciated the need for Australia to recognise that its security depended on events in a number of areas in the world. In 1943 he took up his first vice-regal position as Governor of Bengal. During his time there, from 1943 to 1946, he experienced at first hand contacts with leaders of the Indian nation which would stand him in good stead when he assumed responsibility for Australia&#39;s foreign policy. </para>
        <para>In 1949- in that vital election for Australia&#39;s future- Casey returned to active politics as the representative for the seat of La Trobe. He held the seat until his retirement from politics in 1 960. In 2 tasks he undertook following the 1 949 election he showed again the importance he placed on looking to the future and his concern that Australia should develop into a strong outward looking and tolerant nation. Immediately after the election he became Minister for Works and Housing and he continued his involvement with the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial </para>
        <para class="block">Research Organisation, being Minister in charge from 1950 to 1960. In 1951 he became Minister for External Affairs and he held the post until his retirement. Looking ahead, as always, he worked hard to establish a new set of relationships with countries of our region. His Permanent Head at the time has recently stated that Lord Casey&#39;s statements during his visit to Japan in 1951 marked the first real movement from enmity to close co-operation between Australia and Japan&#39;. </para>
        <para>Lord Casey appreciated the great significance of Australia&#39;s location close to the new states emerging in Asia and moved rapidly to expand our representation in the region. Earlier than most, he foresaw the importance of bringing China into the international community. He was always a realist about the world and never feared to see facts as they were. His advice was wise and his judgment sound. Lord Casey&#39;s career showed that deep patriotism could be combined with an outward looking and humane international perspective. </para>
        <para>In 1965, he assumed a post for which he was uniquely suited- the Governor-Generalship. He had much of value to say. He used the position to dignify Australia and to symbolise the standards of public and private behaviour that we should all strive to achieve. In his life he was assisted at all times by his wife, Lady Casey- a remarkable woman in her own right. She was to him in all of his careers a great comfort and point of courage. This was exemplified by her devoted action of daily attendance at his hospital bed after Lord Casey&#39;s serious motor accident in 1 974. </para>
        <para>Richard Gardiner Casey upheld the highest standards of public life and, in his private life, was unfailingly generous and kindly. What he achieved, he earned by his industry, his courage, his integrity and his humanity. He loved Australia and because of his life we have a better sense of ourselves and what we can become. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I am sure that all honourable senators will join me in extending on behalf of the Government our sympathy to Lady Casey and to her son and daughter at the loss of a husband and a father. Australia has lost a devoted servant. </para>

          <para>- The Opposition supports <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> in his tribute to the late Lord Casey. Richard Gardiner Casey enjoyed a rich, full life as a scientist, soldier, diplomat, politician, writer and, it should not be forgotten, amateur aviator. The nation will best remember him as the highly able Governor of Bengal, a competent Cabinet </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Minister and an influential and well liked Governor-General. While those 3 phases of his long career stand out, he filled many other posts with distinction. He was, for instance, Treasurer as Australia recovered from the Depression, and during the Second World War he was the man selected by Winston Churchill as Minister to the Middle East, with a seat in the British War Cabinet. </para>
        <para>Politics was Lord Casey&#39;s overriding interest, but he always saw political power as a means and not an end in itself. He was no demagogue and never appealed to the mass audience for support. He worked quietly and effectively within his Party and Cabinet and usually away from the spotlight. The criticism sometimes made that Lord Casey had limitations as a politician is belied by his achievements. If Lord Casey left his own political monument it certainly lies in his determination and success in bringing Australia much closer to Asia than many expected during the Menzies era. He had a vision of Australia as a bridge between Europe and Asia. It was said that he was perhaps too much of a gentleman to make a Prime Minister. Lord Casey may have lacked certain attributes deemed essential to be a Prime Minister- it is not for me to judge- but we can say that he was a great Australian and that he served his country with distinction in every role that he played. The Australian Labor Party is saddened by his death and expresses its sympathy to his family. </para>

          <para>- My colleagues in the National Country Party of Australia and I support this motion of condolence. Richard Gardiner Casey was a greatly respected, long-standing friend of science in Australia. Lord Casey was appointed Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research- the forerunner of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation- in 1937, some 6 years after he entered Parliament.  His  death in June of this year marked the loss of a most valued adviser to CSIRO and Australian science in general. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Lord Casey&#39;s contribution to Australian science and technology, through his role in the development of CSIRO, is so significant that it is difficult to measure accurately. It is sufficient to say that his vigorous interests and endeavours are still bearing fruit today. As Minister responsible for CSIRO, Lord Casey was prominent in spelling out the value of science to Australia, generally in terms of increased productivity. He certainly put science before the Parliament and the people of Australia in a way that brought not only attention to but also support for the expansion of scientific research in this country. There is no doubt that without his understanding, sympathy and enthusiastic support both inside and outside the Parliament, CSIRO and Australian science generally would not be as well developed as they are today. Lord Casey relinquished his post as Minister in charge of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research shortly after the outbreak of war. On his re-election to Parliament in 1949 he was again to resume his role of advocate, critic and adviser on science as Minister in charge of the newly formed Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. He retained the responsibility until 1960, when he was elevated to the peerage. He then became a part time member of the CSIRO executive until 1965, when he became GovernorGeneral of Australia. </para>
        <para>The death of Lord Casey brought to a close the life of a great Australian. Many will acknowledge that life as being the most significant in Australia&#39;s history during this century. He left a record of achievement which will live and which will have a bearing on our society for decades yet to come. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> the people of Australian science join the rest of the nation in mourning the passing of Lord Casey. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator SIR</inline>MAGNUS CORMACK (Victoria) From time to time over many years I have had the melancholy duty of sitting in this place when the Senate has been asked to mark the passing of distinguished men who have served this country and of notable companions who have sat in the Senate. But today I have an even stronger sense of melancholy in relation to the motion which has been moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> and supported by the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> and by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster.</inline> I ask the indulgence of the Senate that I may address myself in a few words to the death of a very notable Australian, the Right Honourable Lord Casey. I knew him better than perhaps any other honourable senator with the possible exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> who sits in front of me and who, no doubt, will address himself to the matter later on. I have been most interested, and saddened in a way, to hear of the great and distinguishing qualities which I remember most in the late right honourable gentleman and which have been so readily marked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> and by the Leader of the Opposition. </para>
        <para>In the past 70 years 3 men who have served this Parliament have been ennobled by their Sovereign. One was Lord Forrest of Western Australia of whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> would know very well because of close associates, but certainly I knew Lord Bruce and Lord Casey. I knew Lord Bruce in a minor way but I knew the late Right Honourable Lord Casey in a more intimate way. The interesting thing is that there were 3 factors common to these 3 men, but particularly common to Lord Bruce and to Lord Casey. For example, both these men served in war with distinction. They served in war with great bravery which was acknowledged at the time, when it was recognised. They both entered Parliament to serve their countrymen in their respective philosophical interests. Lord Bruce became a Prime Minister. Lord Casey became the Treasurer and Foreign Minister. Both served their nation in the highest diplomatic posts. Both served the world in various areas which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has already mentioned and which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has acknowledged. Lord Bruce served in the United Nations while Lord Casey became Governor of Bengal and GovernorGeneral of Australia. These are a mere part of the record of the notable events in the lives of both these men. </para>
        <para>In these 3 men whose names I have mentioned there is a singular purpose in common. Notwithstanding all the xenophobic characteristics and qualities which mark all of us from time to time, these 3 men loved their country and their people with a devotion for which it is hard to find an expression. I suggest that Lord Casey was a man of a noble cast of mind, which is important. At the same time he had, as others did too, an enormous sense of compassion for the broad mass of the people among whom he lived. This was not only because he was in a position of power, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> has already mentioned, but also because of a personal sense in that he often served people from his own purse. I can remember meeting a soldier during the war in rather dark days for Australia. The late Lord Casey&#39;s name came up. I asked the soldier whether he knew Lord Casey because he had mentioned his name. The soldier replied that he had seen Lord Casey one day. The soldier added: &#39;He said to me &#34;How are things going?&#34; &#39; The soldier replied: &#39;Not very well. I am having a tough battle &#39;. The soldier was an ex-serviceman of the First World War and a soldier settler. Lord Casey said: &#39;I am sorry to hear that&#39;. About a week or two later the soldier was stupefied when he received a letter from the bursar of a well known Australian school indicating that Lord Casey had made arrangements for the soldier&#39;s 2 children to be educated at Lord Casey&#39;s expense. That is what I mean by saying that Lord Casey not only served the people of Australia where he could exert power on their behalf but also in a most notable and personal sense tried to serve the people amongst whom he lived. </para>
        <para>I think Lord Casey, as I knew him, would have been the last man to claim exceptional intellectual brilliance; but, as was hinted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> I think he fulfilled Thomas Carlyle &#39;s definition of genius, namely an infinite capacity for taking pains. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> remarked on this as well. Lord Casey was a titanic worker of an order and nature that I had never come across before. He was almost Herculean in his labours for the public weal. A younger generation of members who sit not only in this Senate chamber but also in another place will little understand the life of this notable man and will little know how much the men and women of this country owe to men of Lord Casey&#39;s nature. The noble Lord- I hope honourable senators will not shrink when I use that phrase with which Lord Casey would be addressed in a House in which he sat in London- had the companionship of a great and notable woman, Lady Casey, who survives him. Lady Casey is an artist of quality, a writer of sense and style, an historian of competence and a woman of great style in her cast of mind. I think we all share in a most intimate way, if we may, her loss and here in this place acknowledge it. </para>
        <para>In supporting this motion, I should like to conclude with words which are quite old-fashioned by saying without any sentiment: &#39;Farewell. You were a good and faithful servant. You loved your native land, you loved its people and you tended it lovingly&#39;. </para>

          <para>-May I be permitted to add a postscript to the very eloquent and understanding statements that have been made on this occasion. Nothing more in Lord Casey&#39;s history than his participation in the campaign at Gallipoli would be needed to call me to my feet, having regard to my great privilege in later life in working with and knowing him. Be it remembered that he served with distinction not only in the First World War when, as has been mentioned, he won the Distinguished Service Order and Military Cross and was mentioned in despatches, but he served also at the most eminent levels in the Second World War, first in Washington and then, as the choice of no less than Winston Churchill, in Cairo as a member of the British War Cabinet at a time when the crisis was at its peak. In between the wars he gave of his understanding and great capacity as a Minister in the governments of the 1920s and 1930s and again in the 1950s and 1960s. Everybody knows that he gave sterling service in each of the offices in which he was then employed. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>May I refer to just 2 aspects of that service. When I was a Minister and had the privilege one day of accrediting the Ambassador for Turkey at Government House at Yarralumla when Lord Casey was the Governor-General I referred naturally to the conflict in which the Turks and the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps had been engaged and to the fact that Lord Casey had won a decoration in that conflict. Of course, in the aftermath of war it was a matter of infinite satisfaction to both of those great men, each from his respective nation, to recall the respect that war had earned and the good will that peace had allowed. Lord Casey went on to say that Lady Casey&#39;s father had not fought against the Turks but had fought with them in 1888 against Bulgaria and had earned a decoration from the Turks. I should think that that little snippet of insight is unique in history, and I wanted to give expression to it. </para>
        <para>The other aspect of Lord Casey&#39;s service to which I make special reference is the fact that he was not the first but the foundational  President  of the Liberal Party of Australia. Having come back from his great duties in the Middle East and Bengal, he took up the administrative task of building the Liberal Party on its new foundations. He was the Australian  President  at a time when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack was Victorian  President  and I was Tasmanian  President,  and therefore I had an opportunity of working with him.  His  zeal, his energy and his wise understanding of all the problems of administration were responsible largely for the great success of that organisation and the sound basis upon which it was established. This is an occasion on which the Senate does honour to one of the greatest Australians that my time in public life has seen or will see. We pay a special tribute to the assistance and love that Lady Casey gave to Lord Casey in all that work. </para>

        <para class="block">I am sure that all honourable senators were saddened to hear of the recent deaths of former Senators Bull, Aylett and Whiteside, and a former member of the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Failes. Senator Bull</inline> served the Senate from 1965 until 1971, representing the State of New South Wales as a member of the Country Party. He died on 1 1 August last. A man with a strong interest in rural affairs, he was  President  of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council from 1962 until he entered the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> was deeply involved in the Senate&#39;s committee work, serving on the Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling of Cargoes and on the Foreign Affairs Committee. In addition, he chaired the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade. In 1969 his knowledge of the Parliament was respected by his election as  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy President  of the Senate. I am sure that all honourable senators who were here during that period will remember the courtesy and fairness he showed when in the chair. </para>
        <para>Former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> who died on 10 August, was born in Tasmania in 1900. He left school at 16 years of age to work in the Mount Vischoff tin mine on the west coast of Tasmania to help support his family. Later he worked in the coal mining and timber industries in Victoria, returning to Tasmania in 1925, where he became a farmer and began an active involvement in the Labor movement. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> was elected to the Senate for Tasmania at the general election in 1937, taking his place here on 1 July 1938. He remained in the Senate until 1965. He was a member of the House Committee, the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works. He served for many years as a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees. </para>
        <para>Former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside,</inline> who died on 27 July, was chosen by the Parliament of Queensland on 9 October 1962 to represent that State in the Senate. He remained in the Senate until 29 November 1963. Before entering the Senate, former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside</inline> had a long record of service to the trade union movement and to the Australian Labor Party.  His  Party&#39; posts included the presidency of the Queensland Central Australian Labor Party Executive. He was a Queensland delegate to the Federal ALP Executive and  Chairman  of the Labor Broadcasting Station Pty Ltd. In addition, he was Secretary of the Federated Engine Drivers&#39; and Firemen&#39;s Association. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Failes</inline>died on 7 July. He was a member of the House of Representatives from 1949 until his retirement in 1 969. During that time he held the seat of Lawson for the Australian Country Party. After serving with the Royal Australian Air Force, in which he reached the rank of squadron leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Failes</inline> returned to farming and then entered Federal Parliament.  His  parliamentary service included membership of the House Committee from 1954 and membership of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs from 1 956. He was a member of the Select Committee on House of Representatives Accommodation. </para>

He will long be remembered for his intelligent participation as a member of several Senate committees and his impartiality as  chairman  of 2 committees and as  Deputy President.  Senators from all parties recall his friendliness and courtesy. Outside Parliament he was extremely active as a worker in the interests of the rural community, both as a former  President  of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Council and as  Chairman  of the Narrandera Pastures Protection Board. The rural community had no finer advocate in this chamber than Tom Bull. On behalf of the Labor Opposition I extend my deepest sympathy to his family. </para>

        <para>Bill Aylett was born at Wynyard in Tasmania in 1900.  His  early life was not easy. He had to leave school at the age of 16 years and worked in tin mines to support his family. Later he worked as a coal miner, timber contractor and farmer before entering Parliament as a Tasmanian senator in 1938. During his term, which lasted until 1965, Bill Aylett held the position of Temporary  Chairman  of Committees in the Senate from 1943 to 1949 and was assistant to the Minister for Labour and National Service in 1942 and 1943. In 1954 <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> was a member of the Australian delegation to the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association conference in Kenya.  His  career within the Australian Labor Party included the positions of Vice-President of the Tasmanian State Executive and a member of the Federal ALP Executive. The Opposition expresses its regret at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> &#39;s death. </para>
        <para>George Irvine Whiteside represented Queensland in this chamber in 1962 and 1963. He played a long and active role in the Queensland trade union movement and in the Australian Labor Party within that State. During his life he held the positions of Queensland Secretary of the Federated Engine Drivers&#39; and Firemen&#39;s Association and had been VicePresident and  President  of the Queensland branch of the Australian Labor Party. An active sportsman, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside</inline> had been a noted amateur boxer. The Australian Labor Party is appreciative of his work on behalf of his Party and his State and expresses its sympathy to his sister. </para>
        <para>Laurence John Failes represented the electorate of Lawson in the House of Representatives between 1949 and 1969. Born in 1899 he was educated at Sydney Grammar School and later graduated from Hawkesbury Agricultural College. As a farmer and grazier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Failes</inline> was very active in rural organisations and a worthy spokesman in Parliament for country people.  His  parliamentary career followed distinguished service in the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II, during which he rose to the rank of squadron leader. On behalf of the Opposition, I extend my sympathy to his family. </para>

          <para>- Honourable senators in the Australian National Country Party support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> Tom Bull was a practical, down-to-earth man. He used simple words to express a common sense approach to any subject under debate in the Senate, and made use of his vast experiences particularly in the day to day functioning and administration of rural industries, He held clear views on the responsibilities of government towards primary industries and would disagree with his colleagues, even publicly, where he saw this as necessary in the interests of those industries and the people dependent upon them.  His  common sense was <inline font-style="italic">manifest time</inline> and again in speeches touching on the Government&#39;s economic management. I quote from one of his speeches made in 1968, which was, you may recall, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> a time of high employment and low inflation. He said: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>The national wage case is of enormous importance to every wage earner and to the national economy. Every wage earner and every salaried man seeks increased payments. I agree that this is natural and understandable. I agree that every person is entitled to a better standard of living  . . People are entitled to their own cars and to amenities for their homes . . . Every person is entitled to a share in the benefits of increased productivity, and I support this concept. But if increases in wages are greater than the increase in productivity and do not bear close relationship to consumer price movements, the cost of living automatically rises, inflation occurs and wage earners soon lose their newgained increase. This <inline font-style="italic">is not helpful to anybody.</inline></para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">Today all community leaders reiterate that view. Adherence to that piece of home-spun economic logic was a constant plea from Tom Bull, as honourable senators who served with him in this place will clearly recollect. On his passing, the  President  of the Narrandera Shire Council, Councillor Bruce Charles, and the Shire <inline font-weight="bold">Clerk, Mr R.</inline> L. Goss, took the unusual action of issuing a special statement paying tribute to the late former senator. The statement said in part that Tom Bull, in his public life, had set an example of deep responsibility, rectitude and unwavering loyalty to Christian principles. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline>served as a senator from 1965 until 1971. He was  Deputy President  and  Chairman  of Committees for 2 years,  Chairman  of the Senate Standing Committee on Primary and Secondary Industry and Trade, a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee, a member of the Senate Select Committee on the Container Method of Handling Cargoes,  President  of the Australian Woolgrowers and Graziers Councilafter being Vice-President for some yearsManaging Director of the Yarramundi Pastoral Company Pty Ltd,  President  of the Graziers Association of the Riverina, member of the Pastures Protection Board of New South Wales, and Director and  Chairman  of the Narrandera Pastures Protection Board. In 1974 the then New South Wales Minister for Agriculture, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Crawford,</inline> appointed Tom Bull  chairman  of a special committee of inquiry into the whole structure of pastures protection in that State. He was  President  of the Narrandera Pastoral and Agricultural Association. He was a Rotarian. He was  Chairman  of the Narrandera Branch of the Australian Country Party. He was a quiet, gentlemanly, humble, firm and dedicated senator and he worked in a highly effective manner for his Party. Above all, he was respected by all parties in this place. The passing of Tom Bull is a loss to his family. We who knew him well, particularly the National Country Party senators, share the loss with his family and express our sympathy at his untimely death. </para>
        <para>The passing of Laurence John Failes is regretted by me and by my National Country Party colleagues in this place. Laurence Failes was the only member for Lawson in New South Wales. The seat was created in 1949 and was abolished in 1969 and he held it for the whole of that period. Laurence Failes was a quiet man, admired for his efficiency in all his pursuits. He was basically a farmer and grazier who conducted later in life a business that was involved with agricultural machinery. Away from Parliament his greatest love was rifle shooting and he was a member of the National Rifle Association. As has been mentioned, he served in the Royal Australian Air Force in World War II, rising to the rank of squadron leader. During his term in Parliament he was a member of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Foreign Affairs, a member of the House Committee, a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees, a member of the Australian delegation to the Inter-Parliamentary Union Conference in Warsaw and a member of the Select Committee on House of Representatives Accommodation. He was married with 2 sons and 2 daughters and was a member of the Coonabarabran Land Board and the Pastoral and Agricultural Association in that area. Laurence Failes was well known to me. He was a warm man who had a gift and an enriched experience throughout his life. It was an experience which came from being a man of the land elevated by his long term in parliamentary service. My party supports the motion and in respect of former Senators Aylett and Whiteside I express the same deep regret at their passing. </para>

          <para>-I intervene to pay a personal tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tom</inline> Bull. My own leader referred to his impartiality as a  chairman.  At the time when .Tom Bull chaired proceedings in the Senate we had here another party that was masterly at provoking people. Those of us who have a robust debating style were often in situations which required a very fair  chairman  to determine who did the provoking. I say without doubt that on a number of occasions <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tom</inline> Bull acted in difficult situations and he always ruled correctly. I refer to one further quality of Tom Bull. I and my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland, have often and still do put forward the views of unions with rural membership. I refer to the Meat Industry Employees Union and the Meat Inspectors Associaton </para>

            <para>- And the Australian Workers Union, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland mentioned. Among his many rural accomplishments, Tom Bull was an authority on the meat producing industry. Whenever <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Douglas</inline> McClelland and I rose to put a point of view on, say, Meat Board representation, we knew that Tom Bull would not come into us with both feet and dismiss the trade union movement. He recognised its role in the community. That was another quality of his that we admired. In making this personal tribute I naturally identify myself with the sentiments expressed in respect of the other people who have passed on. </para>

          <para>- While supporting this motion of condolence in respect of the 4 men concerned, I should like to take the opportunity of saying just a few words about the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull.</inline> He and his family were friends of mine. It was a personal connection which led to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> being one of those who escorted me- I guess that is the word- into this chamber when I was first admitted in 1970. To me, as a freshman in this Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> was the essence of kindness and generosity. I am sure he offered that kindness and generosity to all people. That was a measure of the greatness of the man. There are a great number of measures of the greatness of Tom Bull. I do not propose to enter upon the total list because I know that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> certainly would not have wanted a series of long discussions and tributes to him. That was not of his character. But let me mention just two or three things that occur to me as being relevant to the measure of the greatness of Tom Bull. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>In the first place, I believe, he was significant because he had a very real understanding and commitment to the family unit as the basic unit of our society. Anyone who knew Tom Bull knew the strength of his convictions and his concern for the welfare of his family and, indeed, of all families in our community. He was a leader in very many fields in his community, as exhibited by the statements today in this chamber. He was certainly a leader in the area of traditional primary production which he knew so well, a leader of all those people involved in primary production and its subsidiary areas. </para>
        <para>Tom Bull revealed greatness as a parliamentarian. He achieved the positions of  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy President  of the Senate. He exhibited, as a parliamentarian, great measures of tolerance, understanding, determination and sincerity. Finally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I believe that perhaps the greatest measure of this man was that he was above all things a humble man. It is with that thought in mind that I add my tribute to the tributes paid here this afternoon. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr President,</inline>I rise primarily to support the motion of condolence on the death of former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside</inline> but before doing so I should like to add to the tributes paid to former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tom</inline> Bull. It has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> was tolerant and I must testify to that tolerance. During his chairmanship I was perhaps one of the turbulent members to whom <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> referred. I remember the day that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tom</inline> Bull took me aside and suggested that aggressiveness was not what achieved most in this place, and I believe him to have been right. He had great gentleness and great tolerance. To his family I express my sympathy and condolences. </para>

        <para>As a Queenslander I must remind the Senate of George Whiteside, a man who had no aspirations to greatness but who, in his time, achieved much for his fellows. He was for many years- I think some 20 to 24 years- secretary of one of the more important unions in Queensland, the Federated Engine Drivers&#39; and Firemen&#39;s Association. He fulfilled that responsibility very well indeed because it led to his appointment as  President  of the Labor Party in Queensland and to his delegation to the National Conference of the Labor Party and to the National Executive. The Australian Labor Party holds these positions in high regard and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside</inline> filled them very well. He also showed some courage in being an ardent follower and supporter of Australian Rules in the very Rugby State of Queensland and for that he must bie commended. He was a patron of the Queensland Australian Football League from 1 973 until the time of his death. Might I say that we were told of his death in a few words on the sporting pages of Queensland &#39;s newspapers. I think that he was somewhat overlooked. Today we take the opportunity to make up for that lack of recognition and appreciation by the media in Queensland. The former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Whiteside</inline> had a great regard for young people. During his lifetime he endeavoured to initiate schemes for their welfare. For those reasons, we regret his passing and give sympathy to his relatives.. </para>

          <para>- I rise to support this motion and wish to speak particularly of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tom</inline> Bull. I speak as one who was closely associated with him not only in this Parliament but also for many, many years in primary industry where we worked very closely together. Tom Bull was a man who was full of energy and dedication. More than that, he demonstrated his deep understanding and integrity; throughout his life and in his associations, and he won respect from all with whom he worked. I was delighted today to hear in this chamber <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges</inline> pay their respects to the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull.</inline></para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>One aspect which stands out very clearly in the life of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> was the contribution that he made to all sections of the community. This applied to primary industry and especially the wool industry which, for many years, suffered from frictions that were not helping that industry. In fact, those frictions held back the progress of the industry. The wool industry owes a great deal to Tom Bull. It owes him gratitude and is in his debt for what he did in bringing about unity in that industry and in finally seeing the establishment of the Australian Wool Industry Conference. Very few people are aware of the hours of work put in by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> and of his dedication and, more than that, of the respect that he commanded.  His  work brought so many people in the wool industry together and resulted finally in unity becoming a reality. </para>
        <para>After his active life in primary industry, when Tom Bull came to the Senate he continued to work with the same dedication and energy, serving on many committees, as has been mentioned today. Eventually, he became  Chairman  of Committees and  Deputy President.  I had the pleasant experience of serving with the late Tom Bull as Vice-Chairman of the old Senate Standing Committee on Industry and Trade of which he was  Chairman.  To me, that was a great experience and a continuation of our very close associations. For his efforts in his local district, his work in the industry with which he was closely associated and his work in this Parliament, many people owe a big &#39;thank you &#39; to the late Tom Bull for the contribution that he has made to Australia as a whole. He will be long remembered for the service that he rendered. I join with my Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> and the Minister for Science, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster,</inline> in extending condolences to his wife and family in their sad bereavement. I extend my sympathy also to the families of the other former senators and of the member of the House of Representatives with whom this motion is concerned. </para>

        <para class="block">Whitside for over 30 years. I met him first in 1942 when I returned from the Middle East and was on embarkation leave prior to leaving for New Guinea. The place was Rockhampton. George Whiteside was then in Rockhampton in his capacity as organiser of the Federated Engine Drivers&#39; and Firemen&#39;s Association. He was conducting an organised tour through Queensland. He offered me transport to Mackay. Honourable senators will know that at that time with the war-time restrictions that were operating and with transport in short supply his offer was greatly appreciated. I have always regarded it as being most significant that from the moment I met him I had a continuing friendship with George Whiteside and I have always regarded it as being significant that I have had a continuing and warm friendship with the people to whom he introduced me. </para>
        <para>In order really to understand the full measure of the man and his worth in the community one would need to have knowledge of the very considerable contribution that he made to the industrial and political life of this country, which was so capably referred to earlier by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Georges.</inline> One of the wishes that lay nearest to George Whiteside&#39;s heart was that Queensland would become a great Australian Rules State. He was as proud of the sport of Australian Rules at the time of his death as he was when he came to Queensland as a young man in the late 1920s. I must admit that, as the  President  of the Queensland Rugby League, I gave away a long time ago any thought of ever converting him to that game. Of course, that only exemplifies his character. He was a man who remained steadfast to the causes in which he believed. </para>
        <para>I should mention that I had the pleasure of meeting the late former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bill</inline> Aylett on only one occasion, even though he retired to the Gold Coast. That was when I delivered a message to him from the then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lionel</inline> Murphy, who I understand was a very close friend of his. He retired from the Senate before I became a member of it, as did the late former <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bull</inline> and, I understand, the late former member of the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Failes.</inline> So I did not know them in the Parliament. I regret the passing of each of them and also the passing of the former Governor-General of Australia, Lord Casey, and I hasten to extend to the relatives of all of them my deepest sympathy. </para>

          <para>When this Government was elected on 13 December last, Australia was in bad shape. </para>

          <para>This Budget will aid that recovery and rebuild confidence further. </para>
          <para>It will do so in part by putting an end to permissiveness in government spending and turning back the recent trend towards bigger and bigger government. </para>
          <para>At the same time it will build further on the social reforms of 20 May so as to assist the most needy in our community. </para>
          <para>It is a Budget for confidence; it is also a Budget for reform. </para>
		  <para>FROM RECESSION TO RECOVERY</para>
      <para>When this Government came to office, Australia was still locked in its most serious postwar recession: that quite unnecessary calamity was the product of three years of Labor Government. </para>
      <para>The major distortions which that Government imparted to the economy in 1974 and 1975 had become deep-rooted obstacles to a return to full employment. </para>
      <para>The economy had been shaken to its foundations. </para>
      <para>At the end of 1975, the private sector was employing no more people than it had been three years earlier, although over that period the labour force had expanded by about 370 000. </para>
      <para>Unemployment had risen to a level unheard of in this country since the Depression of the 1930&#39;s. </para>
      <para>Gross non-farm product in the December quarter, seasonally adjusted and at constant prices, was still almost 5 per cent blow its peak level recorded two years earlier. </para>
      <para>The farm sector was in a state of collapse. </para>
      <para>The share of company profits in national income- one of the flywheels of our whole economic system- remained depressed at around three-quarters of its long-run norm. </para>
      <para>Real business fixed investment fell in the December quarter to its lowest level for almost three years. </para>
      <para>The Consumer Price Index in the December quarter was 1 4.0 per cent above a year earlier. </para>
      <para>Above all, inflation showed no real prospect of a sustained move down. </para>
      <para>This was the economic legacy which we inherited. </para>
      <para>The human reflection of these dry economic facts was to be seen in the devastation of the lives of ordinary people which those events had wrought. </para>
      <para>Hundreds of thousands of people who had thought that savings accumulated by the thrift and industry of their working lives would help to protect their later years suddenly found the real value of those savings cut to ribbons by inflation. </para>
      <para>I mention also the personal tragedies of school-leavers and other young people, and of disadvantaged groups in the community such as Aborigines, who have been denied jobs by the policies of those three years. </para>
      <para>Given this economic legacy, restoring the economy was certain to be a protracted task. </para>
      <para>Before the election we said it would take a full three-year term. </para>
      <para>The Government quickly put in hand a coherent strategy involving all the main arms of economic policy. </para>
      <para>Initial measures to control government expenditures were taken as early as December and followed up by further measures in February. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, in January, major monetary measures were undertaken to drain off some part of the excessive liquidity build-up of 1 975. </para>
      <para>Since that time, especially during the seasonally tight June quarter, monetary policy has been operated flexibly- but always with a view to bearing down against current inflationary pressures while maintaining the capacity of the financial system to underwrite recovery in the private sector. </para>
      <para>We had earlier made clear that, contrary to views in some quarters, we had no intention of depreciating the exchange rate for the Australian dollar. </para>
      <para>In February the Commonwealth sought to bring home to the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission that full wage indexation, by locking the economy into double digit inflation and a disaster level of business profitability, ran completely counter to hopes of a sustained economic recovery and a return to full employment. </para>
      <para>This fundamental truth was initially not widely understood. </para>
      <para>Since then, however, it has increasingly gained understanding and acceptance in the community. </para>
      <para>The full scale review of expenditures which, at the outset, we had put in hand culminated in the Treasurer&#39;s statement on Fiscal Policy Decisions of 20 May. It was given to the Senate by me on the same evening. </para>
      <para>In that statement the Treasurer announced a sharp reduction in the rate of growth of expenditures previously in prospect for 1976-77. </para>
      <para>At the same time the introduction of full personal tax indexation and significant improvements in the manner of assisting families and to Medibank were announced. </para>
      <para>As we have stressed from the outset, we have made our first priority the absolute necessity to combat inflation. </para>
      <para>We have done so not merely because of the direct hardships that inflation obviously brings, but because unless we can brake inflation we shall not succeed in restoring full employment. </para>
      <para>The economy is now showing signs of progress. </para>
      <para>Typical of the early recovery stage in the economic cycle, the areas of strength are still scattered. </para>
      <para>Much of the early impetus to recovery has come from a cessation of the stock rundown which had continued heavily throughout 1975, and from continued strengthening in exports. </para>
      <para>More recently, however, private consumption expenditure has begun to grow. </para>
      <para>In the business sector also there are early signs of confidence regenerating. </para>
      <para>Some healthy gains in capital spending on plant and equipment have already occurred. </para>
      <para>The key question hanging over the future course of the recovery is whether the main components of private demand- consumption and business investment- will firmly join stocks and exports in building a continuing recovery. </para>
      <para>If they do not, that recovery will falter and expire. </para>
      <para>Another key question concerns the extent to which the growth in demand will be met from imports and so not be translated into local production and local jobs. </para>
      <para>The recovery will be threatened if rising demand is associated with a too strongly rising tendency to import. </para>
      <para>The need to qualify answers to these questions indicates that the economy still lacks a fully assured foundation for recovery. </para>
      <para>When one asks, why should that be, there is a very simple answer. </para>
      <para>It is so because both the key questions I have mentioned depend for their outcome on the future of inflation in this country. </para>
      <para>Consumers will step up their spending and cut back on their saving only if they judge inflation to be declining. </para>
      <para>Businessmen will emerge further from their shell-holes and start buying plant, equipment and new buildings, re-stocking and taking on new workers only if the uncertainty wrought by runaway inflation can be removed from their calculations and profits again begin to represent a reasonable rate of return. </para>
      <para>The prospective threat to the recovery from import competition will only be banished if Australia&#39;s international competitiveness does not continue to be eroded for too much longer by cost escalation in excess of that of our trading partners. </para>
      <para>Each of these provisos points unequivocally to the fundamental needs to reduce inflation and, as an integral part of that process, to rectify the wage-profit distortion which the wages explosion of 1974 produced. </para>
      <para>These objectives are fundamental to recovery. </para>
      <para>There have been some favourable developments on the inflation front in recent months. </para>
      <para>The 5.6 per cent rise in the Consumer Price Index in the first half of 1976 represented some advance on the 6.4 per cent and the 7.2 per cent in the second and first halves, respectively, of 1975. </para>
      <para>The Arbitration Commission&#39;s decisions of May and August in respect of wage adjustments for the Consumer Price Index movements in the first two quarters of 1976 hold out hopes for some further moderation of inflation in the remainder of the year. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, the previously very depressed level- though not yet the share- of aggregate profits has begun to pick up. </para>
      <para>In these two respects we are moving in the right direction. </para>
      <para>But we need to go much further- and we need to do so faster. </para>
      <para>Time is of the essence for two reasons. </para>
      <para>First, the sooner wages and profits return to a more normal relativity, the sooner job prospects will improve. </para>
      <para>On the more pessimistic assumption, the downward adjustment in the wage share that is now required would occur slowly via an unacceptably high level of unemployment persisting for a long period. </para>
      <para>The same adjustment can take place much more quickly, and with much less cost in terms of idle resources and production forgone, if the determinations of wage fixing authorities continue to eschew the full indexation of wages for past price increases and wage moderation prevails. </para>
      <para>This is the course the Government has been urging before the Conciliation and Arbitration Commission. </para>
      <para>The second reason why we need to get inflation down more quickly is in order to stop export.ing jobs </para>
      <para>In short, when we come to examine each of our current economic problems we find that all of them have their genesis in the inflationary experience of recent years. </para>
      <para>There is no way in which those problems can be solved other than by dealing with inflation itself. </para>
      <para>That is the key to it all. </para>
	  <para>ECONOMIC STRATEGY AND THE BUDGET</para>
      <para>Consistent with that view, this Budget is therefore an essential element in our anti-inflation strategy. </para>
      <para>First, the Budget takes its place in the on-going process of imposing more effective control on Commonwealth outlays generally. </para>
      <para>Restraint on Budget outlays and on the size of the public sector is necessary to allow and to foster that expansion of the private sector to which we are committed. </para>
      <para>Secondly, through the full indexation of personal income taxation which was announced on 20 May and the other tax changes to be detailed tonight, we are putting in place some of our proposed reforms. </para>
      <para>What these will mean is that the revenue side of fiscal policy will also be working to reinforce wage restraint, to strengthen company profitability and to boost business confidence. </para>
      <para>Thirdly, the substantial reduction in the magnitude of the deficit since we came to office, and of which this Budget constitutes a further step, will help to moderate the flow of liquidity into the economy. </para>
      <para>That is basic to achieving the monetary environment that is necessary if inflation is to be reduced. </para>
      <para>The monetary conditions which might be expected in 1976-77, given the Budget outcome and other relevant influences, will be indicated later. </para>
      <para>Of course, the very need for public sector restraint and tight control of the Budget deficitthe basic thrust of the Government&#39;s fiscal and monetary policies- has been disputed by some. </para>
      <para>Yet all the evidence- in Australia and overseasis that, under the kind of inflationary conditions which we have been and are still experiencing, fiscal and monetary policies of what used to be known as the &#39;pump-priming&#39; kind no longer prime the pump but serve only to turn off the flow of jobs even further. </para>
      <para>The reason is to be found in what I have already said. </para>
      <para>It is inflation that is at the heart of the problem. </para>
      <para>This Government yields to none in its concern for the genuinely unemployed. </para>
      <para>But, whether they know it or not, those who, in the name of reducing unemployment, call for higher government spending, or bigger deficits, or full wage indexation, or devaluation of the Australian dollar, are calling for higher- not lower- unemployment in this country. </para>
      <para>The overwhelming weight of evidence is against such courses. </para>
      <para>They have been tried both here and abroad; and they have failed. </para>
      <para>Let me just mention here- for the case has been fully detailed elsewhere- that experience abroad strongly reinforces our conviction in these respects. </para>
      <para>At this year&#39;s Ministerial Council meeting of the OECD, the main industrialised nations of the non-Communist world agreed on an economic strategy which had as its basic premise the view that:   . . the steady economic growth needed to restore full employment and satisfy rising economic and social aspirations will not prove sustainable unless all Member countries make further progress towards eradicating- </para>
      <para class="block">And I repeat, eradicating-  inflation. </para>
      <para class="block">Consistent with that premise, OECD Ministers underlined the need for caution in the pursuit of expansionary policies and for firm use of fiscal and monetary policies to achieve the general economic climate required for non-inflationary growth. </para>
      <para>As the Communique says:   . . because of the virulence of recent inflationary experience, there is a danger that inflationary expectations could revive quite strongly if the pace of the recovery is too fast. </para>
      <para class="block">Within that general context it was further agreed that:   . . because of inadequate investment in past years in some countries and in certain basic industries, there is a risk of supply bottlenecks at a comparatively early stage of the recovery ... In most countries, policies should be directed more towards promoting investment rather than consumption. In many cases, this will require an appropriate recovery of profits from the depressed levels of recent years. </para>
      <para class="block">On that basis, action was seen as being required both to stimulate investment and to restrain the rise in public expenditure. </para>
      <para>There could be no clearer demonstration of the appropriateness of the Government&#39;s economic strategy. </para>
      <para>I repeat- the speed with which we can restore full employment in Australia and &#39;get Australia moving again&#39; on a sustainable basis will be directly related to the speed with which, in the words of the OECD Communique, we as a nation can &#39;progress towards eradicating inflation &#39;. </para>
      <para>It follows that Australia would stand aloneand against the background of its internationally unfavourable inflation rate would be all the more noticeable for doing so- if we were once again to begin applying a clearly inappropriate pump-priming &#39; policy. </para>
      <para>Whatever the virtues of such a policy may have been under conditions of stable prices, low unemployment and a smaller public sector, they have entirely evaporated under conditions of high inflation, high unemployment and a public sector already bloated beyond belief. </para>
      <para>Having consistently rejected the &#39;pumppriming&#39; expedient, however, the Government has not moved to the other extreme of trying to balance the Budget overnight. </para>
      <para>Rather, this Budget applies the maximum degree of restraint judged to be consistent with promoting confidence and maintaining a steady path towards economic recovery. </para>
      <para>By careful choice of the taxation measures to be announced tonight and those of 20 May, we have matched restraint in our own spending with confidence-strengthening measures to boost the private sector. </para>
      <para>The way in which the various elements of the Budget slot into the anti-inflationary strategy highlights the importance of looking at all our policies- fiscal policy, monetary policy, wages policy and external policy- as a unified and coherent whole. </para>
      <para>No single component of the strategy can fail without putting the basic objective under threat. </para>
      <para>For example, a less firm fiscal stance would undermine the necessary degree of monetary control; or, alternatively, require a return to the kind of overly restrictive monetary policy which would inhibit recovery and the rebuilding of confidence. </para>
      <para>A lax monetary environment would endanger wage and price deceleration. </para>
      <para>A too stubborn adherence to the existing excessive level of real wages- for example, through full wage indexation- would continue to hold inflation high, depress consumer and business spending, hold back the creation of new jobs and prevent unemployment from falling. </para>
      <para>Examples could be multiplied; but I simply say that our strategy is a coherent one. </para>
      <para>All of its separate elements involve difficult decisions. </para>
      <para>Bt the Government and all sections of the community must persist with the fundamental task. </para>
      <para>In doing so, we can take comfort from two things. </para>
      <para>First, we know that the alternatives have been tried and found wanting. </para>
      <para>Secondly, although they are still limited, we are already beginning to see some positive results. </para>
	  <para>OUTLAYS</para>
      <para>Budget outlays in 1976-77 are estimated to total $24,32 1 m, an increase of 1 1 .3 per cent over actual outlays in 1 975-76. </para>
      <para>In 1975-76 the increase was almost 23 per cent and in the year before that is was almost 46 per cent. </para>
      <para>This marked slowing in the prospective rate of growth of Budget outlays in 1976-77 accords with the key role of expenditure restraint in the Government&#39;s overall economic strategy to which I have referred. </para>
      <para>Many of the provisions included in the Budget estimates flow from decisions announced in the Treasurer&#39;s comprehensive statement on 20 May. </para>
      <para>The references to individual provisions which follow are confined mainly to major items. </para>
      <para>Full details are set out in Statement No. 3 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
      <para>Where appropriate, additional information will be announced by the Ministers concerned. </para>
      <para>The decisions reflected in these expenditure provisions are in line with the Government&#39;s broad priorities. </para>
      <para>They reflect, for example, this Government&#39;s philosophy that so far as possible responsibility for spending decisions should remain with private individuals and businesses, and not be assumed by governments. </para>
      <para>More and more Australians are coming to understand that, one way or the another, they must pay for the things they want. </para>
      <para>This Government believes that Australians should have more scope to decide what they want. </para>
      <para>At the same time, these expenditure decisions reflect the Government&#39;s main objectives to: promote confidence in the business sector; institute just social reforms in areas of need; and increase real levels of expenditure in those areas to which it gives priority. </para>
	  <para>EDUCATION</para>
      <para>For example, although the proposed increases in spending on education are less than some would like, this is an area where, notwithstanding our overall budgetary constraints, we have provided for increases in real levels of expenditure and restored triennial programs on a rolling basis. </para>
      <para>In short, education for this Government is a high priority area. </para>
      <para>In all, Commonwealth expenditure on education in 1976-77 is estimated at $2,204m, an increase of 1 5.3 per cent compared with 1 975-76. </para>
      <para>Grants to universities, colleges of advanced education, technical colleges and government and non-government schools by the respective education Commissions account for $1,75 lm, or nearly 80 per cent of the total allocation for 1976-77. </para>
      <para>In each case the budgetary provision represents a significant increase in real terms. </para>
      <para>The Government has given to the education Commissions, for planning guidance only, minimum expenditure levels for 1978 and 1979 which will involve further increases in real terms. </para>
      <para>As previously announced, this planning guidance is: for universities, colleges and schools, 2 per cent growth in real terms per annum; and for technical and further education institutions, 5 per cent growth in real terms per annum. </para>
      <para>The Budget also provides $2m for the Curriculum Development Centre and $ 1 .  1 m for research by the Education Research and Development Committee. </para>
      <para>In addition the Commonwealth extends substantial assistance directly to students. </para>
      <para>This Budget includes a total of $155m in 1976-77 for a range of student assistance schemes, including the Tertiary Education Assistance Scheme and programs of assistance for isolated children and Aboriginal children. </para>
      <para>The Government is aware that many of these allowances have not been increased for some time; meanwhile, inflation has been proceeding. </para>
      <para>Large numbers of students are involved. </para>
      <para>It is not clear to us, however, that existing schemes are the most cost-effective, in terms of directing the substantial sums involved to the most needy and deserving students. </para>
      <para>We have therefore initiated an urgent investigation into the adequacy of existing rates of benefit and the possible rationalisation of the schemes. </para>
      <para>It will be recalled that full-time allowances under the National Employment and Training System were reviewed in February; payments in respect of in-plant and part-time training under that System are also now being similarly reviewed. </para>
      <para>With respect to student assistance schemes, the Government&#39;s decisions will be announced in October and implemented from the beginning of the 1977 academic year. </para>
      <para>The investigation will also cover the question of the reintroduction of tertiary education fees for those classes of students mentioned in my statement of 20 May. </para>
      <para>This does not of course involve reintroducing fees for Australian students undertaking their first degree. </para>
        <para>SOCIAL SECURITY AND WELFARE</para>
      <para>Another in which this Budget provides for a large real increase in expenditures is Social Security and Welfare. </para>
      <para>This is indeed the largest single component of Budget outlays. </para>
      <para>In 1975-76 it amounted to over $5,000m or 23 per cent of total outlays. </para>
      <para>The 1976-77 Budget provides for expenditure of $6, 1 87m, or about 25 per cent of total outlays. </para>
      <para>The Government has already initiated major reforms in this area; some further reforms will be announced tonight. </para>
          <para>Family Allowances</para>
        <para>The new scheme of family allowances- one of this country&#39;s most significant social reforms- is now in operation. </para>
        <para>Under the new arrangements, rates of family allowances have been substantially increased and the tax rebates for dependent children abolished. </para>
        <para>The new arrangements will benefit, in particular, large families with low incomes: those in most need will derive most benefit. </para>
        <para>Some 300 000 low income families- with 800 000 children- with incomes such that they previously derived no benefit- or less than full benefit- from the dependent children&#39;s rebates, will benefit most. </para>
        <para>This accords with the Government&#39;s sense of priorities. </para>
          <para>Pensions</para>
        <para>We are committed to protect pensions against inflation. </para>
        <para>We will continue to honour that commitment. </para>
        <para>In line with it we propose to introduce legislation to tie future pension and benefit adjustments <inline font-style="italic">automatically</inline> to movements in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
        <para>The next two six-monthly increases, in line with movements in the Consumer Price Index, will come into effect in November 1976 and May 1977. </para>
        <para>Effective from the first payday in November the standard or single rate of social service pensions and benefits will be increased by $2.25 to $43.50 a week. </para>
        <para>This reflects the movement in the Consumer Price Index between the December 1975 quarter and the June 1 976 quarter. </para>
        <para>The increase will apply in respect of age, invalid and repatriation service pensions, widows&#39; pensions and supporting mothers&#39; benefits. </para>
        <para>The combined married rate will rise by $4.00 to $72.50 a week. </para>
        <para>Similar increases will apply to unemployment, sickness and special benefits, sheltered employment allowances and tuberculosis allowances. </para>
        <para>In line with the practice initiated by our predecessors, there will be no increase in single unemployment and sickness benefits payable to persons under the age of 1 8 years. </para>
        <para>The increases are estimated to cost $190m in 1 976-77 and $508m in a full year. </para>
        <para>I come now to another significant reform. </para>
        <para>Following a recommendation by the Income Security Review Committee, the Government has decided, with effect on pension payments after 1 1 November 1 976, to abolish the separate property component in the means test for pensions. <inline font-style="italic">(Opposition senators interjecting)</inline></para>

		  <para>Those pensions that are now subject to a means test based on a combination of income and property will in future be subject to a test on income only, including income from property.. </para>
          <para>It will be both simpler and more equitable to take into account for pension purposes the actual income received by a pensioner. </para>
          <para>Many people will gain from this overdue reform. </para>
          <para>It has been clearly inequitable that pensioners should have been means-tested on the basis of a notional return on property, even though in many cases their actual income from such property fell well short of that notional return. </para>
          <para>We believe therefore that this measure will be welcomed by all. </para>
          <para>Transitional arrangements will ensure that no existing pensioner will suffer a reduction in pension as a result of the change; these arrangements are estimated to cost about $7m in 1976-77. </para>
          <para>Repatriation Benefits</para>
        <para>The main Repatriation pensions also will be increased in November 1976 and May 1977 in line with increases in the Consumer Price Index. </para>
        <para>The increases are estimated to cost $ 15.8m in 1976-77 and $38.8m in a full year. </para>
        <para>Along with the proposed changes to the Social Security legislation, we will be introducing legislation to increase automatically the main Repatriation pensions. </para>
        <para>The Minister for Repatriation will be announcing further details. </para>
          <para>Assistance to Handicapped People</para>
        <para>The Government attaches high priority to the provision of adequate facilities and care for handicapped people. </para>
        <para>Under the Handicapped Persons Assistance program funds are provided to help voluntary organisations establish and operate sheltered workshops, activity therapy centres and training centres, and to provide accommodation for handicapped children and adults. </para>
        <para>We propose to increase expenditure on this program substantially over the next three years. </para>
        <para>This Budget provides a total of $30m for these purposes, comprising $2 7m for continuing commitments and $3m for new projects. </para>
        <para>In 1977-78 the total amount will be increased so as to provide not only for continuing commitments but also $ 10m for new projects. </para>
        <para>In 1978-79 the planned provision for new projects will be doubled to $20m in addition to providing for continuing commitments. </para>
        <para>In all, over these three years we shall be providing a total of $ 12 lm under this program. </para>
        <para>Arrangements will also be made so that selected organisations will be able to commence the planning and construction of approved projects now, in the firm knowledge that government funds will be forthcoming at nominated dates over the next three years. </para>
        <para>These arrangements parallel those already announced for aged persons homes and hostels under which up to $225m is to be made available over the next three years to provide urgently needed accommodation for about 15 000 aged people. </para>
          <para>Handicapped Children</para>
        <para>We have decided to increase substantially both the handicapped child &#39;s allowance and the handicapped children&#39;s benefit. </para>
        <para>In recognition of the special financial problems that are involved in the care of handicapped children, the relative increase in benefits in this area outstrips that of any other area of the Budget. </para>
        <para>We have demonstrated our concern for this real area of underprivilege by raising benefits sharply. </para>
        <para>The handicapped child&#39;s allowance will be increased from $10 to $15 a week and the handicapped children&#39;s benefit, payable in respect of handicapped children in institutions, will be increased from $3.50 to $5.00 a day. </para>
        <para>These increases, which will benefit about 2 1 000 children in these categories, will take effect from November and are estimated to cost an additional $3. 8m in 1976-77. </para>
          <para>Senior Citizens &#39; Centres</para>
        <para>We shall provide an amount of $4m for grants to approved senior citizens&#39; centres in 1976-77, and the same amount in each of the two succeeding financial years. </para>
        <para>OVERSEAS AID</para>
      <para>Notwithstanding the need to contain government spending, we are proposing to increase outlays from the Budget on overseas aid, excluding defence co-operation, to $400m in 1976-77; that is, by 14.6 per cent on 1975-76. </para>
      <para>Of this total, $228. lm is allocated to Papua New Guinea, which continues to be the major recipient of Australian aid. </para>
      <para>An estimated $2 6m will flow to Indonesia in 1976-77, being the first year of the new threeyear aid program of $86m to that country. </para>
      <para>Full details of Australia&#39;s overseas aid programs are set out in the accompanying Budget Paper, &#39;Australia&#39;s Official Development Assistance to Developing Countries 1 976-77 &#39;. </para>
        <para>DEFENCE</para>
      <para>In these uncertain times, the highest priority of any responsible Government must be national security. </para>
      <para>Total outlays on defence activities in 1976-77 are estimated at $2 1 78m, an increase of over 1 7 per cent compared with last year. </para>
      <para>The present Government is determined to restore and maintain an adequate Australian defence capability. </para>
      <para>This will require increases in defence expenditure over the years ahead, particularly for the more adequate equipment of the Defence Force. </para>
      <para>A White Paper on Defence is to be issued during this Session and at that time the Minister for Defence will make a comprehensive statement on the Government&#39;s defence policies. </para>
        <para>HEALTH</para>
      <para>The cost to the taxpayer of health care in Australia has rocketed in recent years. </para>
      <para>Last year Commonwealth expenditure on health services amounted to about $2953m, including $ 1 637m on Medibank. </para>
      <para>At $16 12m the Budget provision for Medibank in 1976-77 is slightly less than last year. </para>
      <para>When allowance is made for the prepayment of $2 16m to the States at the end of June for hospital operating costs in the September quarter, the cost of Medibank this year is about $407m greater. </para>
      <para>But for the modifications we have made, the increase in cost this year would have been much greater still. </para>
      <para>Levy proceeds to be collected under the modified arrangements to come into effect on 1 October are estimated to offset the costs of Medibank by $250m in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>As part of the reform of Medibank, the Government will provide $37.5m in 1976-77 towards the deficit incurred by registered hospital insurance organisations- including Medibank Private Insurance- from the payment of benefits to high risk and chronically ill members. </para>
      <para>In addition, $12m has been provided for a subsidy to registered hospital insurance organisations to reduce the cost for those Medibank levy payers who choose to take out basic hospitalonly insurance cover. </para>
      <para>The subsidy is intended to ensure that the cost of such insurance generally will not be more than $2.60 a week for family cover. </para>
      <para>The Government has also decided to make an advance of $ 10m in 1976-77 to Medibank Private Insurance for establishment purposes. </para>
      <para>In line with the undertaking given by the previous Government we have provided $108m for payments to the States in 1976-77 for the development of public hospitals and related health care facilities. </para>
      <para>A further $70m- compared with $54.3m last year- has been provided for payment of grants to States, local government authorities and other eligible organisations under the Community Health Program. </para>
      <para>We have also made a number if increases in other items of health expenditures. </para>
      <para>Commonwealth expenditure on medical research, including the special grants to the Hall and Florey Institutes, is estimated at $ 10.1m in 1976-77; expenditure in 1975-76 was $6.2m. </para>
      <para>New arrangements for financial assistance to the Red Cross Society&#39;s Blood Transfusion Service will result in an increase of $330 000 in the Commonwealth&#39;s subsidy to the Service in 1976-77. </para>
      <para>The provision for the Royal Flying Doctor Service in 1976-77 is increased by a special grant of $800 000 to $2m. </para>
        <para>ABORIGINAL AFFAIRS</para>
      <para>The Government is mindful of its election undertakings and is committed to promoting the welfare and well-being of Aboriginals. </para>
      <para>Unlike our predecessors, however, we do not see the achievement of that objective as being simply a matter of injecting ever-increasing amounts of money into an ever-increasing complexity of insufficiently considered programs. </para>
      <para>An increasing body of evidence has demonstrated the need to re-assess the efficacy of some of the approaches of the past. </para>
      <para>In this re-assessment the Government will have the benefit of the recent Hay Report on the programs involved. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, and pending its consideration of that Report, the Government is providing in this Budget no less than $153m for programs of direct assistance to Aboriginals. </para>
      <para>Although this is $33m less than expenditure in 1975-76, spending on many programs is being maintained at about the same levels as last year. </para>
      <para>In the case of some programs- such as grants to Aboriginal Housing Associations- the provisions in the Budget are to cover outstanding firm commitments, pending further reviews of the objectives, priorities and past administration of those programs. </para>
      <para>In the light of those reviews additional funds will be provided. </para>
        <para>HOUSING AND COMMUNITY DEVELOPMENT</para>
          <para>Welfare Housing</para>
        <para>As announced previously, advances totalling $375m- $ 10.4m more than was provided in 1 975-76- will be available to the States for welfare housing in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>The Government has decided in principle to undertake a housing allowance voucher experiment; $75,000 is provided in the Budget for the first phase of this initiative. </para>
        <para>Should the experiment prove successful, implementation of such a program would give low income families the financial means to select their own rental accommodation on the open market. </para>
        <para>It would provide a new mechanism to make welfare housing sensitive to the needs of the users rather than those of the planners. </para>
        <para>It takes into account the view of the Commission of Inquiry into Poverty that the first principle in the provision of assistance to low income people is that assistance must be linked to the person and not to the house. </para>
          <para>Growth Centres</para>
        <para>The Government has under way a comprehensive review of all major urban and regional development programs, including growth centres and decentralisation, land commissions, sewerage and urban rehabilitation. </para>
        <para>Pending review of the appropriate role for the Commonwealth in relation to growth centres, the Budget provides sufficient funds to preserve the Commonwealth&#39;s options in regard to AlburyWodonga (for which $15m is provided), Bathurst-Orange ($2m) and Macarthur ($2m). </para>
          <para>Other Programs</para>
        <para>Other community development programs provided for in the Budget include: $50m for the National Sewerage Program; $ 1 5. 1 m for land commissions; $ 10.3m for the acquisition of property, planning and site development in the Woolloomooloo Basin in Sydney; and $9.4m to assist with the construction of water treatment plants in the Adelaide area. </para>
        <para>CULTURE AND RECREATION</para>
      <para>A total of $133m has been provided for the Australian Broadcasting Commission; this compares with $ 1 3 7m last year. </para>
      <para>In his statement of 3 June the Prime Minister emphasised that the Government would seek to eliminate unnecessary expenditure on the arts in 1976-77, but maintain important and worthwhile programs. </para>
      <para>The Australia Council has been allocated $23m this year, about the same amount as was provided in 1 975-76. </para>
      <para>Expenditure on construction and running costs of the National Gallery, and on acquisitions, is estimated at $9.3m in 1976-77 compared with $4.6min 1975-76. </para>
      <para>To meet existing commitments, about Slim has been provided by way of capital assistance for leisure facilities in the States, $5m more than was spent in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>The Commonwealth&#39;s role in youth, sport and recreation programs is one of the matters to be examined by the Task Force that has been set up to examine welfare services and communitybased programs in the health/welfare/community development area. </para>
      <para>Pending the Government&#39;s consideration of the Task Force report, the 1976-77 Budget provisions for youth, sport and recreation are being maintained at the amount- almost $ 1.2 m- that is required to meet existing commitments. </para>
        <para>ECONOMIC SERVICES</para>
          <para>Postal and Telecommunications Services</para>
        <para>The Australian Telecommunications Commission will undertake a capital program in 1976-77 which will require funds of $4 15m additional to those available from its own internal resources. </para>
        <para>As already announced, $2 15m of this will be provided from the Budget; the Commission will seek the balance of $200m by borrowing on the local capital market. </para>
        <para>Last year an amount of $392m was advanced to the Commission from the Budget. </para>
        <para>The Australian Postal Commission&#39;s operations in 1975-76 yielded a surplus estimated at about $30m. </para>
        <para>The Commission therefore expects to be able not only to finance its 1 976-77 capital program entirely from internal sources but also to repay $3m advanced to it by the Commonwealth in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>With effect from 1 September 1 976, the fees payable by the licensees of commercial television stations are to be brought into line with the scale which, since 1973, has applied to commercial broadcasting stations. </para>
        <para>The new fees are estimated to yield additional revenue of $624,000 in 1976-77 and make total revenue from fees sufficient to cover the annual operational and capital costs of the Australian Broadcasting Control Board. </para>
        <para>Radiocommunication licences are also to be increased for some classes of users from their present level of $ 1 2 a year to $20 a year. </para>
        <para>The Minister will announce the details; I mention, however, that there will be no increases in fees payable by voluntary bodies such as life saving organisations and rural fire brigades. </para>
        <para>These new fees will operate from 1 October and are estimated to increase revenue by $ 1.2m in 1 976-77 and $ 1 .6m in a full year. </para>
          <para>Air Transport</para>
        <para>The Government is concerned at the continuing high cost to the general public of providing airport and airways facilities. </para>
        <para>The gap between revenue and expenditure in this area was about $77m in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>To help reduce this gap, and as already announced, air navigation charges are to be increased by 15 per cent with effect from 1 December 1976. </para>
        <para>The increase is expected to yield an additional $4m in revenue in 1976-77 and $8m in a full year. </para>
        <para>We are also implementing economies which, without adverse effects on safety standards, will result in expenditure on civil aviation facilities and services in 1976-77 being lower, in real terms, than in 1975-76. </para>
          <para>Rail Transport</para>
        <para>An amount of $60.8m is being provided to subsidise expected operating losses of the Australian National Railways Commission. </para>
        <para>These losses, which greatly concern the Government, are being generated primarily by the Tasmanian and non-metropolitan South Australian railway systems transferred to the Commonwealth under the previous Government. </para>
        <para>A further $36. lm is included to finance the capital program of the Australian National Railways Commission. </para>
        <para>This amount includes provision to continue the construction of the standard gauge railway between Tarcoola and Alice Springs. </para>
        <para>It also includes funds for essential capital works on the Tasmanian railway system pending completion of the inquiry into that system that was announced in my statement of 20 May. </para>
        <para>The separate provision of $2m for the Adelaide to Crystal Brook standard gauge railway project will meet current commitments, pending the findings of the independent committee of inquiry that will be reporting on that project. </para>
          <para>Sea Transport</para>
        <para>The Australian Shipping Commission&#39;s capital expenditure program for 1976-77 requires provision of $63.4m from the Budget. </para>
        <para>This program relates essentially to the provision of terminals and the acquisition of vessels and seaborne equipment by the Australian National Line for use in coastal and overseas trades. </para>
        <para>The subsidy for the operation of &#39;Empress of Australia &#39; by the Australian National Line in its Bass Strait passenger service will be increased by $lm,to$2m, in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>An amount of $ 16m is provided to meet the estimated cost in 1976-77 of the Tasmanian Freight Equalisation Scheme that has been introduced following the report of the Royal Commission into Transport to and from Tasmania. </para>
        <para>The Government is increasing its financial assistance to the Australian Shippers &#39; Council from $90 000 to $120 000 for 1976-77. </para>
        <para>Light dues levied on shipping to recover the cost of providing coastal navigation aids are to be increased from 3 1 cents per net registered ton per quarter to 35 cents from 1 October 1 976. </para>
        <para>This increase is expected to yield an additional $1.7min 1976-77. </para>
        <para>A separate levy on shipping of 1 cent per net registered ton per quarter has been collected to cover the cost of the national plan to combat pollution of the sea by oil. </para>
        <para>An adequate working reserve has been built up and the Government has therefore decided to reduce this levy to 0.8 cents from 1 October 1976. </para>
          <para>Urban Public Transport</para>
        <para>The Budget estimates include almost $65m in assistance to the States for urban public transport projects. </para>
        <para>This amount includes $20m for payments which may be required in 1976-77 to meet the Commonwealth&#39;s share of approved cost increases in respect of previously approved projects. </para>
          <para>Roads</para>
        <para>An amount of $433. 5m will be made available to the States for roads in 1 976-77. </para>
        <para>This includes $35.8m which will be made available in addition to the amounts appropriated under existing legislation. </para>
        <para>An amount of $8m is to be provided to the States in 1976-77 for expenditure on approved planning and research projects in relation to roads and urban public transport. </para>
          <para>Beef</para>
        <para>The Government has accepted the Industries Assistance Commission&#39;s recommendation to continue for a further year the joint Commonwealth/State Government scheme for the provision of concessional carry-on finance to beef producers. </para>
        <para>The Commonwealth will match State approvals in 1976-77 on a dollar-for-dollar basis, subject to a limit of $1 5m on the Commonwealth Government contribution. </para>
          <para>Fertilizers</para>
        <para>The Government has considered the report of the Industries Assistance Commission which recommended that the subsidy of $78.74 per tonne on the nitrogen content of nitrogenous fertilizers be phased out over three years. </para>
        <para>The Government agrees in principle that this subsidy should be phased out and has decided that the rate should be reduced to $60 per tonne on 1 January 1977. </para>
        <para>The subsidy is estimated to cost $12m in 1976-77. </para>
          <para>Rural Reconstruction</para>
        <para>The Rural Reconstruction Scheme, which expired on 30 June 1976, will be extended to 3 1 December 1976 pending finalisation of the Government&#39;s consideration of the Industries Assistance Commission report. </para>
        <para>Of the total of $27m provided for the Scheme in 1976-77, $10m relates to the proposed extension to 3 1 December 1976; the remainder relates to commitments under applications approved prior to 30 June 1976. </para>
          <para>Dairy Industry</para>
        <para>An amount of $13. 5m has been included to meet the Commonwealth&#39;s estimated liability in respect of the Dairy Adjustment Program in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>This is additional to other assistance the Government has offered to the dairy industry by way of underwriting of producers&#39; returns from skim milk powder, casein, butter and cheese, details of which have already been announced by the Minister for Primary Industry. </para>
          <para>Wool</para>
        <para>The Commonwealth has authorised the Australian Wool Corporation to increase the level of support provided under its minimum reserve price scheme to 234 cents per kilo clean on a whole clip average basis. </para>
        <para>This is equivalent to 275 cents per kilo clean on the previous 2 1 micron basis. </para>
        <para>Notwithstanding this increased level of support, it is expected that the Corporation will be able to repay in 1976-77 $245m of advances made by the Commonwealth to the Corporation in previous years. </para>
          <para>Water Resources Assessment Program</para>
        <para>The Government has decided to continue its support for the Commonwealth/State Water Resources Assessment Program for another three years; the provision for 1976-77 is $6.7m. </para>
          <para>Productivity Improvement Programs</para>
        <para class="block">The Government is increasing, from $66 000 to $177 000, its support for programs designed to improve productivity at plant level. </para>
        <para>LEGAL AID</para>
      <para>An amount of $20m (including $3. 7m for legal aid for the Aboriginal community) is included in the Budget for legal aid, compared with expenditure of $ 16.3m in 1975-76. </para>
      <para>The Attorney-General is negotiating with the States with the object of bringing all forms of legal aid under the control of statutory Legal Aid Commissions and thereby effecting savings in the administration of legal aid. </para>
      <para>Pending completion of the negotiations, the Government is maintaining legal aid activities at their present level. </para>
      <para class="block">To help offset the sharp rise in costs of legal  aid to the Commonwealth over recent years, new and increased fees will be levied in Federal Courts; these fees are estimated to yield $2. 5m this year and $3. 5m in a full year. </para>
        <para>PAYMENTS TO THE STATES AND LOCAL GOVERNMENT AUTHORITIES</para>
      <para>One of the topics to which, since taking office, the Government has accorded a very high priority is that of the financial relations between the Commonwealth, State and local governments. </para>
      <para>The tax sharing scheme- the central element in our program of reform- is to a large extent now settled with the States. </para>
      <para>Under Stage 1 of the scheme, the States will be entitled to 33.6 per cent of the Commonwealth&#39;s personal income tax collections, excluding any special surcharges or rebates. </para>
      <para>On present estimates, which are necessarily subject to a considerable margin of uncertainty, this puts the States&#39; entitlement for 1976-77 at $3,716m. </para>
      <para>This would represent an increase of $643m, or about 2 1 per cent, over the comparable grants in 1975- 76, and is presently estimated to be $89m more than the States would have received under the old formula. </para>
      <para>The State Governments&#39; Loan Council programs for 1976-77 will total $ 1,356m, an increase of 5 per cent compared with 1975-76. </para>
      <para>Local government also will have an annual entitlement to a share of personal income tax. </para>
      <para>An amount of $140m is to be provided in 1976- 77- an increase of 75 per cent over last year. </para>
      <para>In recent years specific purpose payments to States and local government authorities have grown very fast; in 1974-75 the increase was no less than 92 per cent and in 1975-76 it was a further 34 per cent. </para>
      <para>After adjustment for the hospital prepayments to the States in late June, specific purpose payments are presently estimated to increase by about 9 per cent in 1 976-77 </para>
      <para>Lumped together, net payments to States and local government authorities in 1976-77 are estimated to total $9,077m- an increase of 13 per cent after adjustment for the hospital prepayments. </para>
      <para>If allowance is made also for the non-recurring payments made for unemployment relief in 1975-76, the increase in 1976-77 becomes 15 per cent. </para>
      <para>This represents a significant increase in real terms and is a slightly faster increase than is in prospect for all other Budget outlays. </para>
      <para>The greater part of the funds we are providing to the States is untied and can be used by the States in ways of their own choosing. </para>
      <para>The States have always said they want greater freedom to make their own decisions and determine their own priorities. </para>
      <para>That is why we have increased our provision to them of untied funds relatively more than funds for specific purposes. </para>
      <para>The States now have the capacity to spend these untied funds in ways of their own choosing- be it welfare housing, or sewerage programs, or whatever it is to which they choose to give priority. </para>
      <para>The State Governments, along with the Commonwealth, must play their part in the battle against inflation. </para>
      <para>At a time when there are complaints about the level of funding of State Government programs the Commonwealth finds it particularly strange to find some State Governments actually supporting the even higher increases in their cost levels which full indexation of wages would bring. </para>
      <para>There is a need for restraint in the expenditures of State Governments as well as in the expenditures of this Government. </para>
      <para class="block">The figures I have just given clearly show that the States are not being asked to bear any undue share of the task. </para>
        <para>NATURAL DISASTER RELIEF</para>
      <para>The Budget includes an amount of $26m for relief payments in 1976-77 following natural disasters. </para>
      <para>This amount comprises continuing payments following floods and cyclones during 1975-76 and recently announced drought relief assistance to Western Australia. </para>
      <para>The Government has also undertaken to support, in accordance with the natural disaster assistance arrangements with the States, expenditures by the Victorian Government on certain drought relief measures. </para>
        <para>GENERAL GOVERNMENT</para>
          <para>Civil Works</para>
        <para>We have approved a total program of $293m . for new works to be committed to construction in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>A total cash allocation of $4 10m has been set for expenditure during the year on new and already committed projects; this compares with actual expenditure of $425m in 1975-76. </para>
        <para>For the Darwin Reconstruction Commission a new works program of $50m and an expenditure figure of $140m have been determined; actual expenditure in 1975-76 was $1 10m. </para>
        <para>The approved new works program for the National Capital Development Commission is $153m, with a cash allocation of $195m compared with $ 1 88m in 1 975-76. </para>
        <para>For the remainder of the works program the limit on new works is $90m, including $50m for the Northern Territory, and the cash allocation is $75m; actual expenditure last year amounted to $127m. </para>
          <para>Canberra</para>
        <para>The Minister for the Capital Territory has already announced details of increases in general municipal rates and in water and sewerage rates in the Australian Capital Territory. </para>
        <para>Action is in hand to limit the subsidy to the Canberra bus service to $5.4m in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>There will be increased revenue from bus fares and paid parking spaces in Canberra. </para>
        <para>The Minister will be issuing details. </para>
          <para>Staff Ceilings</para>
        <para>Soon after taking office the present Government introduced new staff ceilings which were mainly responsible for reducing Commonwealth employment in the area covered by staff ceilings by 2.8 per cent in 1 975-76. </para>
        <para>This compares with a growth in Commonwealth employment in the area concerned of about 4 per cent per annum in the three years to 1974-75. </para>
        <para>On 14 June the Prime Minister announced a further overall reduction of 1.2 per cent in these staff ceilings to be achieved by 30 June 1977. </para>
        <para>This comprised a 1.6 per cent reduction in the ceiling for Public Service Act employees and a 0.9 per cent reduction in the ceilings for certain Commonwealth Government authorities. </para>
        <para>These lower ceilings have been reflected in the detailed Budget estimates. </para>
        <para>The Prime Minister indicated at the time that the 1976-77 ceilings set in June were provisional, being subject to further review and possible adjustment in the light particularly of the Government&#39;s Budget decisions. </para>
        <para>Following further consideration in the Budget context, the Government has decided upon an objective of achieving a further reduction of 2 per cent in staff ceilings for Public Service Act employees during 1976-77, making the objective in this area a 3.7 per cent reduction in all. </para>
        <para>This further reduction is estimated to produce a saving to the Budget of about $22m in 1 976-77. </para>
        <para>Accompanying- though lesser- reductions in the staff ceilings for certain Commonwealth Government authorities will mean that, after allowance for the reduction previously announced, the total reduction in ceilings now being aimed at during the course of 1976-77 amounts to 2.5 per cent. </para>
        <para>The Government reaffirms its intention to achieve these reductions without sacking anyone and without creating personal hardship. </para>
          <para>Continuing Expenditure Control</para>
        <para>Following the change of Government we were able to keep total Budget outlays for 1975-76 within the original Budget estimates for the first time since 1968-69. </para>
        <para>We aim to repeat that performance again in 1976-77. </para>
        <para>We will not let up in our efforts to achieve savings and eliminate waste and inefficiencies wherever they occur. </para>
        <para>Because so much expenditure tends to be committed before the year starts, effective expenditure control must begin at the stage of commitment. </para>
        <para>To this end, new administrative arrangements have been developed for the regulation of forward expenditure commitments by departments and authorities which depend on the Budget for the whole or part of their finance. </para>
        <para>Limits within which departments and relevant authorities may make commitments during the current financial year- but which are to be financed from appropriations in future years- were determined as part of the Budget process. </para>
        <para>These limits can be increased only by specific Government decisions. </para>
        <para>We see the development of these new administrative arrangements as making a major contribution to the improvement of overall financial management in the area of Commonwealth administration. </para>
        <para>RECEIPTS</para>
      <para>I turn now to the receipts side of the Budget. </para>
      <para>Government spending cannot be massively increased as in recent years without also significantly increasing the overall tax burden. </para>
      <para>This remains true notwithstanding the enormous deficits which have been allowed to open up between the outlays and the receipts side of the Budget- and which in due course have to be closed. </para>
      <para>With that latter important qualification, it is also obvious that, by prudently reining in the rate of growth of government spending, it becomes possible not only to avoid further increases in the tax burden but also to contemplate reducing it. </para>
      <para>In 1976-77, for the first time since the last Liberal-National Country Party Budget of August 1972, there will be no increases in the major indirect taxes. </para>
      <para>I contrast this with the 1975-76 Budget proposals for indirect tax increases which- even excluding the coal export duty- represented additional levies totalling $602m in 1975-76 and $688m in a full year </para>
      <para>Over the three years 1973-74 to 1975-76 the total of all the increases in taxation in this area lifted the annual level of taxation by over $ 1000m. </para>
      <para>In this Budget, I repeat, there are no proposals to increase excise on cigarettes, or on beer, or on spirits, or on petrol. </para>
      <para>Moreover, because of our success to date in restraining expenditures, 1976-77 will see our first steps towards positively relieving the burden of taxation. </para>
      <para>The decisions involved- those already announced and those I am about to announceaccord with our basic philosophy that individuals and businesses should have more say in spending decisions which concern them, and governments less. </para>
      <para>At the same time they are intended to strengthen confidence among consumers and investors, and thereby advance the recovery of the economy. </para>
        <para>PERSONAL INCOME TAX</para>
      <para>The most important step in relieving the burden of taxation-the indexing of personal income tax- has already been taken and has been in operation for pay-as-you-earn purposes since 1 July. </para>
      <para>It represents perhaps the most significant reform of the personal income tax system in our time, and certainly the most costly in terms of revenue forgone. </para>
      <para>We have taken this step both in fulfilment of our objective of getting the Government&#39;s hands out of taxpayers&#39; pockets, and for wage policy reasons. </para>
      <para>Individuals, rightly in our view, attach considerable importance to their own command over their incomes and their ability so far as possible to spend those incomes as they see fit. The indexation arrangements which are now part of the income tax law will prevent the automatic increase in effective tax rates which used to come about as rising money incomes resulting purely from inflation took taxpayers further up the progressive rate scale. </para>
      <para>The law now provides for annual adjustments to prevent that. </para>
      <para>A change to the law will now be needed if a government seeks to increase effective real rates. </para>
      <para>This brake upon financial profligacy is a major step towards &#39;keeping governments honest&#39; with their taxpayers. </para>
      <para>The new arrangements are described in Statement No. 4 attached to the Treasurer&#39;s Budget Speech. </para>
      <para>The cost of indexation and the changes associated with it is estimated to be $ 1050m in 1 976-77 and $ 1 2 1 Om in a full year. </para>
        <para>VALUATION OF TRADING STOCK</para>
      <para>The Government made it quite clear in its election policy statements that it was not prepared to see inflation continue to add to the tax burdens of individuals and businesses. </para>
      <para>We allowed ourselves a period of three years to give full effect to the necessary remedial legislation. </para>
      <para>So far as personal income tax is concerned, we have already fulfilled our undertaking by indexing the system as from 1 July 1976. </para>
      <para>We have now considered relieving businesses also from the impact of inflation on their tax burdens. </para>
      <para>In the kind of highly inflationary situation which Australia has recently been experiencing, firms have serious problems in financing the rapidly growing costs of an adequate and appropriate level of trading stocks. </para>
      <para>They have problems, too, with financing the soaring costs of replacing plant and equipment when depreciation allowances for taxation purposes are based on historical costs. </para>
      <para>Since coming to office the Government has given careful thought to the most effective ways of providing relief to firms beset with problems of these kinds arising from our recent high rates of inflation. </para>
      <para>In doing so it has had the benefit of the views originally stated by the Mathews Committee and, more recently, by Professor Mathews personally. </para>
      <para>It has also sought and received the views of leading representatives of the accountancy profession and of a wide sweep of industry interests. </para>
      <para>The Government has now decided to take a substantial step in relation to a system of trading stock valuation adjustments applying to taxable incomes earned in the 1976-77 income year. </para>
      <para>Meanwhile, we are continuing to examine the impact of inflation on depreciation allowances and other aspects of business financing and profitability, with a view to bringing in appropriate legislation within the Government&#39;s current term of office and having regard to the availability, in the meantime, of the investment allowance. </para>
      <para>The key features of the proposed system of trading stock valuation adjustments will be: </para>
      <para>The adjustments will reduce taxable incomes in respect of income year 1976-77. </para>
      <para>On practical grounds, the accent of the scheme will be, so far as possible, on simplicity. </para>
      <para>With that in mind, we propose the use of a general index for calculating the trading stock valuation adjustment. </para>
      <para>Specifically, the cost of a firm &#39;s trading stock as at 1 July 1976 will be revalued for income tax purposes by reference to the percentage increase in the &#39;goods&#39; component of the Consumer Price Index between the June quarter of 1 976 and the June quarter of 1 977. </para>
      <para>It is not proposed to bring the adjustments back into assessable income in later years in the circumstances proposed by the Mathews Committee- the adjustments will reduce tax, not defer it; in terms of the jargon, there will be no &#39;clawback&#39;. </para>
      <para>It will be necessary to lay down some safeguards against misuse of the system to avoid tax that ought to be paid; the precise nature of these is at present under consideration. </para>
      <para>By way of illustration I mention that, had such a scheme been operating fully in the current year on the basis of 1975-76 incomes, it is estimated that the cost to revenue this year would have been of the order of $ 700m. </para>
      <para>What the full cost of the final scheme would be in 1977-78 cannot of course be foreseen at this stage. </para>
      <para>That would depend among other things upon the rate of increase in the index during the current year. </para>
      <para>We have said that the scheme would be phased in. </para>
      <para>At this point it is clearly not possible for us to say how far, by this time next year, we shall feel able to go. </para>
      <para>We shall go as far as we can. </para>
      <para>What we do now undertake is that 50 per cent of the full adjustment will be allowed next year as deductions from 1976-77 incomes. </para>
      <para>There are other aspects of the system of adjustments which require further study and which we are therefore not in a position to announce at present; these include, for example, the safeguards I have referred to and the categories of trading stocks to be included in the scheme. </para>
      <para>Legislation to be introduced in the next Autumn Sittings will provide full details. </para>
      <para>In settling those details, the Government will have discussions with professional and industry groups where appropriate. </para>
        <para>PRIVATE COMPANIES</para>
      <para>The Government has undertaken to ease the distribution requirements for private companies under Division 7 of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>
      <para>In this regard we have had the needs of small businesses particularly in mind. </para>
      <para>We attach importance to the spirit of free enterprise which small business symbolises. </para>
      <para>For distributions in respect of taxable incomes of the year 1975-76 and subsequent years the retention allowance for trading or business income will be increased from 50 per cent to 60 per cent. </para>
      <para>This will increase by one-fifth the amount of after-tax income which a private company can retain without incurring Division 7 tax. </para>
      <para>No change is being made to the 10 per cent retention allowance for property income or to the rule that there be no retention allowance for dividends that one private company receives from another. </para>
      <para>At the same time, the law will be amended to terminate the &#39;excess distribution&#39; provisions of Division 7, which permit a company which makes more than the minimum distribution in one year to make less than a minimum distribution in a later year without incurring Division 7 tax. </para>
      <para>With the proposed increase in the retention allowances there will no longer be any practical need to retain these highly complex provisions, which have also been of some concern in connection with schemes of tax avoidance; they are accordingly to be withdrawn subject to appropriate transitional arrangements. </para>
      <para>The increase in the retention allowance is estimated to cost about Sim in 1976-77 and $30m in a full year. </para>
        <para>INCOME FROM MINING</para>
      <para>The Government has had under consideration the report of the Industries Assistance Commission on the income tax arrangements applying to the mining and petroleum industries. </para>
      <para>In the light of that report it has decided on certain amendments to the law, bearing in mind both the Government&#39;s desire to see a healthy and efficient mining sector and the IAC &#39;s observations on the desirable relationship between the levels of tax on income from mining and on income from other business sources. </para>
      <para>The changes proposed are: </para>
      <para>Petroleum exploration expenditure and allowable capital expenditure on the mining of petroleum will be deductible against income from any source. </para>
      <para>Allowable capital expenditure of any mining company on the development of a mine or field will be deductible on a diminishing value basis, as at present, by reference to a maximum life of mine or field of 5 years, instead of 25 years as at present. </para>
      <para>Allowable capital expenditure on facilities used for the transportation of minerals, including petroleum, will now be deductible on a straight line basis over either 20 years, as at present, or 10 years, at the taxpayer&#39;s option to be exercised with the first claim for a deduction. </para>
      <para>The categories of expenditure covered by the present provisions giving deductions for allowable capital expenditure on mineral transport facilities will be extended to cover expenditure, presently not deductible, on port development such as harbour surveys, initial dredging, navigational aids and breakwaters. </para>
      <para>The amendments will apply first to capital expenditures incurred after today. </para>
      <para>They have no cost in 1976-77 but the revenue to be foregone in the first full year is estimated at $60m. </para>
        <para>CRUDE OIL LEVY</para>
      <para class="block">In the last Budget an excise of $2 per barrel was introduced on the production of crude oil, condensate and naturally occurring liquefied petroleum gas. </para>
      <para>Under existing policy any company discovering oil would receive import parity less the production excise. </para>
      <para>Many oil exploration companies have put to us that costs are so high today as to make commercial production from new oil discoveries of the size likely to be found in Australia unattractive at this level of return. </para>
      <para>The Government accepts that the levy represents a substantial deterrent to companies considering exploration for new fields. </para>
      <para>It has therefore decided that oil from discoveries after today will be free from the production excise. </para>
      <para>The result will be that all production of crude oil from future discoveries will receive full import parity at the nearest refinery port. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that this will significantly affect the level of activity within the oil exploration industry. </para>
        <para>COAL EXPORT DUTY</para>
      <para>The coal export duty introduced in the last Budget applies at two rates- $6 per tonne for , high quality coal and $2 per tonne for other coal, apart from certain lower grade coal which is exempt. </para>
      <para>The Government has always regarded this as an entirely inappropriate form of tax, </para>
      <para>The quality of deposits varies markedly, but within and between the two categories which are subject to duty the effects of the duty fall in a quite haphazard manner. </para>
      <para>Marginal fields pay the same rate of duty as economically more profitable fields, or in some cases more. </para>
      <para>The imposition of this levy has had undesirable effects both on existing producers and on potential developments. </para>
      <para>It is the intention of the Government to remove this particular levy, but for budgetary reasons which will, I think, be obvious it is not possible to remove it at one stroke. </para>
      <para>It will however be reduced <inline font-style="italic">immediately,</inline> in what the Government regards as a first step towards completely phasing out this particular tax within three years. </para>
      <para>The Government is taking these steps towards phasing out this levy to encourage the healthy development of the industry. </para>
      <para>If the States take advantage of this situation to increase their own royalties the Government will have to review its position. </para>
      <para>So far as immediate steps are concerned, the Government will remove the duty from noncoking coal and will reduce the rates on coking coals by 25 per cent- from $6 to $4.50 per tonne in the case of the higher rate of duty and from $2 to $ 1 .50 per tonne in the case of the lower rate. </para>
      <para>These changes, to apply immediately, will cost an estimated $33m in 1976-77 and $37m in a full year. </para>
        <para>INVESTMENT ALLOWANCE</para>
      <para>Legislation to introduce an investment allowance was passed in the Autumn Sittings of the Parliament. </para>
      <para>During those Sittings and since, representations were received on a number of aspects of the allowance on which changes in the law were sought. </para>
      <para>In the course of its deliberations on the Budget the Government has carefully considered all of these representations and having done so has decided that the present scope of the allowance should remain unchanged. </para>
        <para>PAYROLL TAX</para>
      <para>The present level of the exemption from payroll tax in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory is to be increased to the level recently adopted by the States. </para>
      <para>The present exemption of $20,800 will become $41,600 per annum; above $41,600 the exemption will phase out by $2 for every $3 by which the annual payroll exceeds that amount. </para>
      <para>The new exemption will apply from 1 January 1977. </para>
      <para>The change does not have any significant effect on Budget revenue. </para>
        <para>INCOME EQUALISATION DEPOSITS</para>
      <para>The Government has now considered the IAC report on &#39;Rural Income Fluctuations- Certain </para>
      <para>Taxation Measures &#39;, which dealt with two broad questions: the averaging arrangements for primary producers, and a proposal for a scheme of income equalisation deposits for primary producers. </para>
      <para>The Government has decided to continue the averaging system in its present form, but will take up the proposal for a scheme of income equalisation deposits. </para>
      <para>Commencing with income year 1975-76, deposits lodged with the Government under the latter scheme will be deducted from the assessable income of the year of income in respect of which they are lodged, and included in assessable income of the year in which they are withdrawn. </para>
      <para>The scheme will enable primary producers to act themselves to even out the effects of fluctuating income on their tax liabilities over a period of years. </para>
      <para>Details of the scheme will be available when the legislation is introduced; the scheme will, however, include the following features: </para>
      <para>A minimum limit of $100 and a maximum limit of $100,000 is to be applied to the total value of a taxpayer&#39;s holdings. </para>
      <para>It will not be possible to withdraw deposits within the first 12 months after lodgment (other than in exceptional circumstances such as natural disasters, death, or financial stringency); however, there will be no maximum limit on the period for which an amount may be left on deposit. </para>
      <para>The scheme will apply to primary producers, but in determining taxable income from which deposits may be purchased, no distinction will be drawn between income obtained by primary producers from farm or non-farm sources. </para>
      <para>Interest is to be paid on the deposits at a rate, initially 5 per cent per annum, to be prescribed by regulation. </para>
      <para>The present Drought Bonds Scheme is to be discontinued under appropriate transitional arrangements. </para>
      <para>Present holders of Drought Bonds will be offered the option of transferring to the new scheme. </para>
      <para>It is estimated that the revenue forgone in 1976-77 will be about $2m; the full-year cost of the scheme cannot be estimated at this stage. </para>
        <para>ESTATE DUTY</para>
      <para>We undertook to increase the exemption from estate duty where the whole or part of the estate of a deceased person passes to a surviving spouse. </para>
      <para>This is an area of the law where personal tragedies abound. </para>
      <para>Even in current tight budgetary circumstances we have seen the need to pay special regard to rectifying the present situation. </para>
      <para>We shall therefore fulfil our undertaking in this Budget. </para>
      <para>We shall introduce a special deduction to apply where an interest in an estate passes to a surviving spouse. </para>
      <para>The deduction will be $50,000, or the entire net value of the spouse&#39;s interest in the estate if that is less than $50,000. </para>
      <para>The existing statutory exemptions, and the rebate of part of the duty in respect of a primary producer estate, will then apply as at present to the remainder of the estate. </para>
      <para>With the introduction of this special deduction, the deduction introduced in 1974 for an interest in the matrimonial home passing to a surviving spouse will be terminated. </para>
      <para>This was in any case an unsatisfactory provision, as it discriminated between different types of assets and was available in full only if the gross value of the interest in the home did not exceed $35,000. </para>
      <para>The new deduction will apply regardless of the nature of the assets and will not be reduced where the value of the relevant interest exceeds $50,000. </para>
      <para>In the case of an estate passing wholly to a surviving spouse, no duty will now be payable on an estate of up to $90,000 (or $98,000 for primary producer estates). </para>
      <para>About 20 per cent of presently dutiable estates will cease to be dutiable, and the impact of duty on larger estates will be considerably reduced. </para>
      <para>The new provisions will apply to estates of persons who die after today. </para>
      <para>The cost of this measure is estimated to be $2m in 1 976-77 and $ 1 4m in a full year. </para>
        <para>BUDGET OVERVIEW</para>
      <para>In the aggregate, outlays in 1976-77 are estimated to increase by 11.3 per cent to $24,32 lm. </para>
      <para>Receipts are estimated to increase by 18.8 per cent to $2 1,7 13m. </para>
      <para class="block">The overall deficit is therefore $2,608m. This is $977m less than the actual deficit of $3585min 1975-76. </para>
      <para>This latter figure would of course have been much greater had it not been for the actions taken by this Government immediately it came to office. </para>
      <para>When allowance is made for overseas transactions, the domestic deficit in 1976-77 is estimated at $1879m; this is over $1000m less than the domestic deficit of $2 905m last year. </para>
      <para>For all the reasons I have stated earlier this hauling in of the deficit this year is appropriate. </para>
      <para>But, over and beyond that, it can fairly be claimed that the deficit in prospect for 1976-77 differs in important respects from those of 1975-76 and 1974-75. </para>
      <para>The &#39;mix&#39; of the prospective deficit this year is vitally different from those of the last two years. </para>
      <para>It is particularly striking, for example, that the lower deficit in prospect for 1976-77 is estimated to come about after forgoing revenue of no less than $ 1250m on account of personal tax indexation and the investment allowance. </para>
      <para>Had we not chosen to make those desirable reductions in the burden of personal and corporate taxation the deficit would have been about $ 1360m and the domestic deficit would have been down to around $630m. </para>
      <para>Not only is the reduction in the deficit appropriate to the evolving economic recovery but it is also being achieved after a major reduction in taxes which will play its own part in enhancing that recovery. </para>
      <para>More generally, this Budget reflects the Government &#39;s determination to press on with the major social, economic and administrative reforms that were outlined by the Prime Minister last November. </para>
      <para>It continues the drive to restore to individuals the economic independence that was so markedly eroded by the policies of our predecessors. It puts people first. </para>
      <para>It points towards the re-enhancement of the role of the private sector and away from the threat of big government. </para>
      <para>It emphasises the importance of free enterprise. </para>
      <para>For the first time in recent years, it gives real incentive for individuals and companies to venture and to succeed. </para>
        <para>THE ECONOMIC OUTLOOK</para>
      <para>Against that background, I believe there will be general agreement that this Budget is above all a fiscally responsible one. </para>
      <para>Among other things it represents another step towards a better &#39;mix&#39; of fiscal and monetary policies than has existed in recent years. </para>
      <para>The joint thrust of this Government&#39;s fiscal and monetary policies to date has slowed the growth in the monetary aggregates in recent months from the grossly excessive rates of 1975. </para>
      <para>This Budget stays firmly on that track. </para>
      <para>The reduction we are effecting in the Budget deficit will reduce the Government&#39;s call on financing from the community. </para>
      <para>It thereby provides more scope for maintaining financial conditions appropriate to continuing recovery in the private sector while holding growth in the overall monetary aggregates at appropriate rates. </para>
      <para>Thus, the technical estimates at the moment suggest that with the monetary regulators at settings appropriate to continuing recovery in the private sector, a Budget outcome of the kind foreshadowed here, along with other factors affecting the financial system, could be consistent with growth in the broadly defined volume of money (M3) in the 10-12 per cent range during 1976-77. </para>
      <para>That range, which is subject to the usual hazards of forecasting, will no doubt change over time as circumstances unfold. </para>
      <para>Depending upon those circumstances it could also be necessary and appropriate for policy to be adjusted in the light of events as they develop. </para>
      <para>As of now, however, it gives a broad indication that growth in the monetary aggregates will be a notch or so slower than last year. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that, notwithstanding all the qualifications which necessarily attach to it, this broad indication of the monetary outlook will provide the private sector with a greater degree of certainty regarding that aspect of policy in the year ahead than it has previously enjoyed- particularly in recent years. </para>
      <para>It should help, for example, to allay fears of either excessive financial tightness or financial ease. </para>
      <para>Consistent with the aims of government policy, an outcome along these lines would contribute to reducing inflation while ensuring adequate funds to underwrite recovery. </para>
      <para>Within that broad monetary framework, the decisions of the wage-fixing authorities will be crucial to the speed of the wind-down in inflation that, one way or another, has to be achieved. </para>
      <para>Provided there is significantly less than full flow-on of price increases to wages, an improvement of several percentage points in price performance, and a possibly somewhat greater deceleration in money wages, can be had in 1976-77 as as whole. </para>
      <para>By the end of the period, we should be down to single digit rates. </para>
      <para>With some productivity gains accruing in the upturn, a noticeable rise in the profit share would then be in prospect. </para>
      <para>With such a gradual winding-down of inflation and inflationary expectations, recovery in demand and activity would be unlikely to proceed at more than a modest pace. </para>
      <para>Under those circumstances, both private consumption expenditure and business investment should, during 1976-77, become established as sources of continuing growth in demand for domestic production. </para>
      <para>Over the year as a whole they should, on that basis, record moderate increases in real terms. </para>
      <para>Unhappily, seasonal conditions appear likely to permit little if any increase in farm production overall; however, developments along the lines I have mentioned could reasonably be expected to result in gross non-farm product growing by about 4 per cent for the year as a whole. </para>
      <para>Given a more widespread recognition, on the part of all those principally concerned, of the central role which current rates of inflation are playing in holding back the recovery and keeping unemployment high, it is possible to envisage a more optimistic scenario. </para>
      <para>But until the evidence of that more widespread recognition comes up on the board- for example, in the determinations of the wage-fixing tribunals and in the co-operation with those decisions of the trade union leadership as a whole- we cannot plan on that. </para>
      <para>Even the more gradual recovery prospects, however, would be consistent, after allowance for labour force and productivity growth, with some gradual reduction in unemployment during the course of 1 976-77. </para>
      <para>It would be rash to predict any early reduction in unemployment; movements in the remainder of calendar year 1976 are unlikely to be great. </para>
      <para>But 1977, all going well, should see the start of a more concerted fall. </para>
        <para>CONCLUSION</para>
      <para>This Budget embodies and advances the Government&#39;s overall economic and social strategy. </para>
      <para>The economy is now set on the right path and the combination of expenditure and tax measures in this Budget will help it along that path. </para>
      <para>For the first time in several years there are now good prospects of staying on a growth path we can sustain. </para>
      <para>Inflation- and therefore unemployment- will not be wiped out overnight, but even on a not over-optimistic view of things they will be steadily reduced by the budgetary and other policies to which this Government is adhering. </para>
      <para>After only eight months since, on coming to office, we confronted the full enormity of our inheritance, these policies are now beginning to produce results. </para>
      <para>At the time the Budget also reflects the Government&#39;s priorities both as between private and public spending, and within the public sector itself. </para>
      <para>It is, as I said at the outset, both a Budget for confidence and a Budget for reform. </para>

Accordingly, programs in both fields have already been pruned, and any further reductions in budgets would seriously impair the effectiveness of the reduced programs. </para>
          <para>From a marketing viewpoint, the Commonwealth contributes funds to the overseas promotional activities of the Australian Dairy Corporation, the Australian Egg Board and the Australian Honey Board. In the 1975-76 financial year, some savings will be made, as the Commonwealth contribution will be reduced from a matching dollar for dollar basis to 70 per cent of the amount spent by authorities.

The questions related to the new investment allowance as it might apply to imported tractors. I undertook to refer the questions to the Treasurer who has supplied the following answer </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Government has estimated that the cost to revenue of the new investment allowance, during its 40 per cent phase, would be some $500 million in a full year. It has not estimated what percentage of this might be attributable to the purchase of large imported tractors by taxpayers paying tax at high marginal rates. </para>
          <para>The honourable senator appears to be under the impression that the investment allowance is solely directed towards stimulating Australian manufacturing through increasing demands for its products. That is not so. The allowance is directed also at increasing the productive capacity of the economy through the upgrading of the capital stock and in that sense does not discriminate between imported capital goods and those of domestic manufacture. Presumably the tractors in question will increase the productive capacity of those producers making use of them. </para>

            <para>I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I refer to question No. 461 dealing with the importation of second-hand motor vehicles, a question which I had on the notice paper and in respect of which I received an answer prior to the recess. Whilst the Minister was able to provide me with information about the number of vehicles imported during the last 5 years and the amount of revenue collected, can he tell me why his Department cannot provide me with the names of the persons and companies who imported these cars? </para>

          <quote>
            <para>As indicated in the earlier reply to question No. 461, over 24 000 second-hand motor vehicles were imported in the period. To provide the specific detail now required by the honourable senator would require a very substantial commitment of departmental staff resources and ensuing expense to extract such data. </para>
            <para>In addition, the Commonwealth Statistician who is, <inline font-style="italic">inter alia,</inline> responsible for the collection, compilation, tabulation and publication of statistics, including statistics of imports and exports, is legally constrained by the Census and Statistics Act 1 905, 1 973 to not, except as allowed by that Act, divulge the contents of any form filled up or information supplied. </para>
            <para>Under that constraint, the Statistician does not disclose the names of persons or companies involved in import or export transactions. </para>
            <para>The Bureau of Customs, as a primary source of such import and export data to the Statistician, has followed a practice, which I believe to be appropriate, of also not making public information which the Statistician would not disclose. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>In view of the fact that the Australian Postal Commission and the Australian Telecommunications Commission are now expected to be financially self-sufficient and to contribute to their own capital expansion, what safeguards can the Minister give that the interests of families living in remote areas which would be patently unprofitable to service are being protected? </para>
          </quote>
          <para>The Minister for Post and Telecommunications has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Both the Postal Services Act and the Telecommunications Act provide that the Commissions, in performing their functions, shall have regard for the special needs of Australian people who reside or carry on business outside the cities. </para>
            <para>Recent marketing initiatives by the Postal Commission include reductions in charges for boxholders not served by a postman or mailman and for users of the private mail bag services. Lower rates announced for local bulk postings of mail permit lower volumes of postings to attract the concessional rates in smaller communities than postings in metropolitan areas. When telephone tariffs were last raised there was no rental increase for subscribers connected to noncontinuous telephone exchanges and the construction charge beyond the 8 kilometre point has been retained despite cost rises since 1973 when the present charge was determined. The service targets for Telecom Australia in 1975-76 included provisions for continuous services to be provided for 10 per cent of the 14 600 subscribers who had noncontinuous service and for automatic service to be provided for 1 1 per cent of the 146 000 subscribers connected to manual exchanges. </para>
            <para>These examples indicate that both Commissions are responsive in a practical way to the special difficulties of families in remote areas. Services available through both Commissions are under periodic review with the objective of providing the best national service possible at the least cost. Recent decisions to hold the basic letter tariff at its present level during 1976 and to retain existing charges for the telephone service into 1976-77 should be pleasing to all users in a time when costs have risen significantly. </para>

          <para>The Minister for National Resources has now provided the following answer to the honourable Senator&#39;s question: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>As reported in its 1974-75 Annual Report, the Australian Atomic Energy Commission is making a detailed study of the Australian requirements for research reactor irradiation facilities to the end of this century. The study is taking account of the reactor needs within the community for both scientific research and radioisotope production. At the same time, the Commission is reviewing the capacity of its existing reactor HIFAR to meet these needs. </para>
            <para>The study is expected to be completed in early 1977. Any new reactor recommended as a result of the study could not be operational before about 1 982 due to the lead time for design and construction involved. A new reactor would be equally as accessible to the scientific community as is HIFAR. Present indications are that Lucas Heights would be the most suitable location for such a reactor. </para>

            <para>No. The Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 came into <inline font-style="italic">force on</inline> 19 June 1975. </para>
            <para>The purpose of this Act is to supersede certain provisions of the laws of Queensland that have the effect of discriminating against Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders and denying their basic rights. </para>
            <para>The Act deals specifically with the following areas: </para>
            <para>Entering on Reserves </para>

            <para>In addition to this Act, the Racial Discrimination Act became effective in law from 31 October 1975. This Act has a more general application to discrimination based on race, colour, descent or national or ethnic origin, and makes it unlawful for a person to do an act involving racial discrimination which impairs the enjoyment, on an equal footing of fundamental rights and freedoms. This Act also contains provision which guarantees equality before the law in the enjoyment of rights without discrimination based on race, and which are designed to supersede State or Commonwealth laws that discriminate on ground of race in relation to the enjoyment or rights. </para>
            <para>This Act also prescribes acts of racial discrimination in respect of access to places and facilities available to members of the public, the disposal of land, housing and other accommodation, the provision of goods and services to the public, employment, and the right to join trade unions. </para>
            <para>Complaints of infringements in relation to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders (Queensland Discriminatory Laws) Act 1975 should be made by the person affected to his legal adviser. The Government fully funds the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service (Queensland) to provide legal advice and assistance to Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders in Queensland. That service employs field officers and retains solicitors who can be consulted by any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander who wishes to enquire about his rights or wishes to take legal action to enforce his rights under the Act. </para>
            <para>The Racial Discrimination Act 1975 provides that the Commissioner for Community Relations shall enquire into alleged infringements of the Act and endeavour to effect a settlement. Where the Commissioner certifies thatsettlement has been attempted but has not been achieved, legal proceedings may be brought for an injunction, damages or order directing specified acts to be performed or other remedies set out in the Act. Advice in relation to infringements of this Act can be obtained from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islanders Legal Service (Queensland) who can provide representation of the person complaining where settlement has been attempted but not achieved. </para>

            <para>There was no fishing industry in the commercial sense at Melville Bay although there is subsistence fishing in these waters. There is no evidence to date of any deleterious effects to the fish resources of Melville Bay from the red mud disposal system used by Nabalco. There have been occasional fish kills due to accidental spillages of noxious materials from the cooling water outfall, but these have been infrequent and the fish kills have been considered insignificant. </para>
            <para>Many people have attributed a virulent occurrence of the condition known as &#39;ciguatera &#39; on the seaward side of Gove Peninsula to some part of the mining operations. However, ciguatera is known throughout the Indo Pacific region. It has been known since the very earliest European explorations and although its origins are obscure there is no evidence at present linking the mining operations with this condition. </para>

            <para>I do not have precise information regarding the admission of new students to the University of Queensland in the second semester of 1976. The level of quotas set by universities and colleges of advanced education to achieve recommended student numbers and the method of application of those quotas are matters for determination by individual institutions themselves. Total enrolments in universities rose from 148 000 in 197S to 1S3 000 in 1976 and in the case of colleges from 125 000 in 1975 to 134 000 in 1976. </para>
            <para>Recommended student numbers on which the funding of universities and colleges of advanced education was based in 1976 are set out in the reports of the two tertiary Commissions for that year. The reports were based on guidelines laid down by the previous Government and were endorsed by the present Government. I draw to the honourable Senator&#39;s attention that the number of equivalent full-time undergraduate students enrolled at the University of Queensland in 1976 was 12 850 which was 550 above the level recommended by the Universities Commission. </para>

            <para>- The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is as follows:  (1), (2), (3) and (4) On 20 May 1976, both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer announced that $73. 3m would be available for children&#39;s services in 1976-77. This compares favourably with the $63.29m expected to be spent in the current financial year. The Prime Minister has announced that in the coming financial year priority will be given to funding child care projects in high need areas and that ways of meeting this priority within the level of funds provided will be examined during discussions with the States. I will ensure that the points the honourable senator has raised are taken into account as the program develops. </para>

            <para>The Department of Environment, Housing and Community Development and the former Department of Environment have taken an active role in the control of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). PCBs are not manufactured in Australia and it has, therefore, been possible to effectively restrict the quantities and uses of PCBs under a Customs (Prohibited Imports) Regulation specially introduced in 1973. The Australian Environment Council has also taken an active interest in PCBs and commissioned a study to investigate present patterns of use of PCBs, their disposal and their presence in the environment. </para>
            <para>As regards the occurrence of PCBs in Austraiian rivers, monitoring of PCBs has been undertaken by various State Departments and in one case only has evidence of PCB contamination been found. In this case, tests by the Queensland Water Quality Council some time ago found PCBs in three small tributaries to the Brisbane River. It is understood that the sources of contamination were determined and controls introduced to prevent further discharge of PCBs. Continuing sampling of the Brisbane River and its tributaries would indicate that release of PCBs into the waterways has ceased. </para>

            <para>The Royal Australian Navy Surveying Ship, HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Flinders</inline> is currently undertaking a hydrographic survey in Dampier Strait in Papua New Guinea. <inline font-style="italic">Flinders</inline> arrived in Papua New Guinea waters from Cairns in late April and returned to Cairns in early July having visited Port Moresby, Rabaul, Kavieng and Lae for fuel and stores during her deployment. </para>
            <para>The purpose of the hydrographic survey is to obtain the necessary data to enable the publication of Nautical Chans of the Dampier Strait area which are suitable for the use of the shipping which operates in this area. At present only small craft with local knowledge can pass through Dampier Strait because the existing Nautical Charts do not have sufficient information shown on them for a ship to make a safe passage through the Strait. This survey is a continuation of the hydrographic surveying programme, commenced in the early 1960s, to survey all the poorly charted areas in Papua New Guinea. </para>
            <para>The area being surveyed is Dampier Strait which lies between Umboi Island and the western end of New Britain and also includes the area from Dampier Strait along the south west coast of New Britain as far as Arawe Harbour. This area of some 1500 square miles, extends from the beach to the 300 metre depth contour and includes all known islands, reefs and underwater obstructions. </para>
            <para>The survey programme being undertaken was drawn up in conjunction with PNG authorities under arrangements agreed between Australian and New Guinea authorities for hydrographic surveys of New Guinea waters. The Government of PNG was informed in advance of the survey programme and an invitation was extended to them to send observers or persons requiring hydrographic survey training to the ship for the duration of the survey. </para>

The total cut on Queensland State forests is divided equally between native softwoods (largely cypress pine), plantation softwoods, native eucalypts and rainforest species. In Western Australia the main species of millable timbers are jarrah, karri and wandoo in the native forests and radiata and pinaster pine in plantations. In the Northern Territory the three millable species are cypress pine, stringy bark and paper bark. In the native forests millable and non.millable species are frequently intermingled and no attempt has been made to assess the proportion of the forest occupied by each. In the case of plantations virtually 100 percent of the area is occupied by millable species. </para>

              <para>On the State Forests trees felled are continually being replaced by younger trees reaching maturity and by generation or by replanting. On some forests over 100 per cent of the original volume of millable timber has already been harvested and the standing volume would still be at least equal to the original standing volume. The percentage by area which has been harvested has not been determined. Areas are left untouched because they are too stony, too steep, or to protect streams, or they have a scientific interest, or are of scenic value. It is thought that the area left untouched in Queensland and Western Australia would be of the order of one fifth of the total area. </para>

            <para>There are a number of solar energy research projects currently being undertaken in Australia, both by recipients of grants from the Australian Research Grants Committee (ARGC) and by the CSIRO. For details of such projects and some preliminary results, I would refer the honourable senator to the reply to Question No. 611 on Solar Energy Research which appeared in the Senate Daily <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline> of Wednesday, 2 June, 1976. </para>
            <para>It is agreed that such research may have some valuable application to the energy needs of developing countries, and the transfer of relevant technology in this field to developing countries is fully supported in principle. Moreover, Australia provides financial and technical assistance to the Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), one priority of which is the development of appropriate energy sources in the region, and also the Department of Science is involved in work in this area in the forum of the Association for Science Co-operation in Asia. Unfortunately, as a result of current budgetary constraints no additional funds from aid sources can be made available for solar energy research activities at this time, in view of other programs given higher priority by recipient governments. </para>

        <para>Still in Western Australia, we may look forward to the successful proving of significant gas reserves at Barrow Island, which, when added to those of West Tryal Rocks, would considerably add to the Northwest Shelf reserves and thus may to some extent modify current development plans under discussion and those mentioned above. </para>

          <para>The comprehensive review of the Department&#39;s activities was aimed at identifying the relative priorities of different areas of work and the resources which should be available for them. As a result of that review, some 105 positions, 62 of which were substantively vacant, were withdrawn and, simultaneously, steps put in hand to fill 108 other positions which were substantively vacant. Further details of the classifications of positions withdrawn and numbers substantively vacant are provided in an attachment. </para>
          <para>The redeployment of resources will make for a more efficient operation of essential activities. While the withdrawal of the positions is seen as permanent, should further changes be necessary these will be dealt with in the normal way. The changes affected all Divisions of the Department, including the three Manpower Divisions concerned with development and operations of manpower policies and programs, including industrial training. As already indicated, the objective is to ensure a more efficient and effective role of the Department in the total range of its work, including industrial training. </para>

            <para>The program to combat oriental fruit fly in the Northern Territory will not involve full quarantine checks at any airport in the infested area in the immediate future. Some sample checks however will be made during times of maximum fruit production. </para>
            <para>It is considered that if quarantine checks are to be introduced, the destination airports would be the most appropriate location in view of the widespread infestation of oriental fruit fly now known to cover an area of 300 000 square kilometres in the top end of the Territory. In this area there are cattle stations which regularly have direct movements to southern States by light aircraft as well as the main airports and a considerable amount of road traffic moving south. </para>

          <quote>
            <para>The Public Service Board has advised that trial schemes of flexible working hours were first introduced into the Public Service during the term of the previous Government, following reports on overseas developments, and interest displayed by staff, staff organisations and departments. </para>
            <para>There is a trend in the Australian work force towards varied working arrangements, particularly for office workers. All State Public Services and a number of private employers have approved some form of experimentation with flexible working hours. The Board has instituted arrangements designed to monitor closely the effects of flexible hours trials in the Service to ensure that they are managed in a way that maximises efficiency and economy. </para>
            <para>The Public Service Board is currently examining departmental evaluations of their trial flexible working hours schemes. Preliminary analysis indicates: in general, trials of flexible working hours have been successful, and the benefits to both staff and management outweigh the disadvantages departments do not consider that efficiency has been significantly affected by the introduction of flexible working hours schemes of flexible working hours offer scope for a better match of working time to workload, and can provide a capability to give service to the public over a longer span of hours staff morale and job satisfaction have increased as a result of working flexible hours. </para>
            <para>There appear to be grounds for retaining flexible hours as a permanent feature of public service employment. It is recognised, however, that flexible working hours schemes require careful attention by management to operate effectively, and the Public Service Board will continue to oversight their operation and draw to the attention of departmental management any deficiencies that may become apparent. </para>
