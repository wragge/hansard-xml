I was sworn in as  President  of the Senate in August 1974, and the following months were possibly the most turbulent in the history of the Senate. No vote of no confidence in me as  President  of the Senate was taken during that period.

            <para>- The coup, the overthrow of a properly elected government, I adjourned the Senate at 20 minutes past two until the ringing of the bells. There was no further sitting of the Senate. The Senate was dismissed summarily. There was no information given to the then Leader of the Government in the Senate and none given by the then Leader of the Opposition in the Senate who was well aware of the whole of the coup. The practice of State Premiers substituting people of a Party different from that of the senators those people replace and so affecting the balance of power in this chamber has altered the whole concept of proportional representation. It is making a sham and a farce of the method of election to this chamber. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The method employed has caused me very great concern. The Senate has been made a pawn in a premeditated and calculated manipulation by forces outside this Senate. The sequence of events over a period was such that this Senate could act as a House of review; it could act as a States' House. But that has now been set aside. The Senate now, as has been proved, can be manipulated to the point that it no longer can serve its proper purpose. </para>
        <para>The fact that we had today as a  Deputy  of the Governor-General, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick who consulted with the Governor-General and with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Ellicott</inline> on these matters, without notifying the Senate and without notifying the  President  of the Senate, was to me a direct insult to the Chair in this chamber. I hope that the incoming  President  will be aware of these discourtesies and will take every step to persuade the Senate to make the necessary provisions so that what happened will not be allowed to happen again. I submit myself to the will of the Senate. </para>

          </talker>
          <para>- Honourable senators, I am deeply conscious of the honour you have done me this morning in electing me as your  President,  as I am conscious of the heavy responsibilities which devolve upon this office. It shall be my constant endeavour to be found worthy of your confidence and with your co-operation and confidence, honourable senators, I trust that this the Thirtieth Parliament- and the Senate in particular will give satisfaction to each honourable senator and to the people of Australia. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The institution is greater than the person and that shall ever be in my mind. I wish to pay a tribute to my predecessors, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honourable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator the</inline> Honourable Justin O 'Byrne, for the services they have rendered to this chamber and the Parliament. I shall strive to emulate the best of examples. I thank you all. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WITHERS</inline>(Western AustraliaLeader of the Government in the Senate)- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I claim the right as your nominator to be the first to address you by that title in this chamber. On behalf of all Government senators, and I am sure on behalf of all senators, I'con.gratulate you on your election as  President.  Your reputation for honesty, integrity and dignity fits you well for this high office, the highest the Senate can bestow. All honourable senators are aware of your politeness and courtesy at all times. </para>
        <para>You have served in the Senate since 1967. Before that you were a member of the South Australian House of Assembly for the electorate of Barossa, a truly befitting electorate for someone like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Laucke.</inline> You have a long and distinguished record of committee service including the chairmanship of the Senate Standing Committee on Social Environment from 1971 to 1973 and membership of the Senate Standing Committee on Finance and Government Operations and the famous Senate Select Committee on Offshore Petroleum Resources. In addition, you were the  deputy chairman  of the Senate Select Committee on Air Pollution from 1968 to 1969. </para>
        <para>As well as your dedicated Committee service, you have been a distinguished member of this chamber. Nobody would be more respected around the Parliament in a personal sense than yourself. We on the Government side know that your personal qualities will maintain the dignity of your new office. I am confident that you will act as the servant of the Senate and at all times will uphold the dignity of the chamber and protect all senators equally. The office of  President  which you now hold is a great one carrying with it many obligations and many responsibilities. Most importantly, it is your duty to ensure that the business of the Senate is conducted properly without fear or favour to either side. I know- we all know- that you will carry out that responsibility properly and honourably. Like your predecessors, I am sure that you will bring great credit and honour to the Senate. </para>
        <para>We all recognise that in <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Laucke</inline> you have a partner who will be of enormous assistance to you in both the ceremonial and non parliamentary duties that the office of  President  demands. Like you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> she is respected on all sides of this chamber. I conclude my remarks on behalf of Government senators by wishing you and <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Laucke</inline> well and by assuring you that whatever that can be given to you in carrying out your new role will be there for the asking. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I again congratulate you. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WRIEDT</inline>(Tasmania-Leader of the Opposition in the Senate)- May I also, on behalf of the Opposition, offer my congratulations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> I am not so conversant with your background and with the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers.</inline> I did not do my homework as well as he has done, mainly because I had not anticipated that you would be elected- I say with great respect. Nevertheless, I can vouch for many of the things that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> has said and I think that all of us around the chamber would agree that you have established a reputation for politeness to people, which is important, and fairness. None of us are under any illusions as to the difficulty encountered by all Presidents at various times in this chamber. We look to the  President  for guidance. We look to him for impartiality. In the ensuing months the many new senators will be looking to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir, for</inline> those very qualities, and I am sure that we can expect you to show them. </para>
        <para>Very rough passages inevitably lie ahead for all of us. Even a person of your calm temperament, I am sure, will not be able to give us completely calm voyages all through the period of your Presidency. I can say on behalf of the Opposition that we will endeavour to ensure that the work of the Senate is expedited properly and fairly. That does not mean, of course, that we will not be fighting at every opportunity to expose the Government's errors, to expose errors which we believe have occurred in the past and about which we will continue to remind the Australian people. I once again congratulate you. 1 hope that your term as President, will not be too long, and that after the change of government at the next election the same traditions will be able to be carried on as I am sure you will endeavour to carry on during your term. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr President,</inline>I offer you my heartfelt congratulations on having been installed in the Chair of the Presidency of this Senate. You have been an outstanding member of Parliament, first serving in the South Australian Parliament, as has been mentioned by the Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline> Your interest in the Commonwealth Parliament for many years, your interest in community service and your interest in the service of business in your State warrant your elevation to this high position. You were first elected to the South Australian Parliament in 19S6, representing the Bar ross a area. You were re-elected in 1959 and again in 1962. You were Government Whip in the South Australian Parliament between the years 1962 and 1965. You have served the Australian Senate since 1967. You were a very experienced Temporary  Chairman  of Committees and your work on committees has pointed you out as an admirable man for the office which you now hold. I offer you my congratulations, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> and the congratulations of my National Country Party colleagues on assuming your high office. </para>

I offer you every support, as do my National Country Party colleagues. Your duties will be onerous. We look forward to your long and distinguished service as  President  of the Senate. </para>

It is one of the highest offices in the land and any honourable senator who achieves the distinction of being  President  of the Senate should be and would be a worthy incumbent of the office. I had the good fortune to travel with you on the famous Senate Select Committee on Off-Shore Petroleum Resources and during that time I was able to learn of the many gentlemanly qualities that you possess. I think that you will bring those qualities to the Chair and that you will bring impartiality. I offer you in a humble way the benefit of my experience at any time in conference. As my Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt,</inline> said, I cannot wish you permanency in the job but while you occupy the Chair I feel that you will do the Senate very proud. Congratulations. </para>

I hope that you will have a great deal of satisfaction in your office. Your friends and colleagues in South Australia are very pleased by your preferment and we all wish you well. You have had a long and distinguished career in business affairs, in public affairs and in Parliament and you will bring the skills derived in those areas to the execution of the important duties that you are now commencing. You have important duties to discharge and I know that you will use your best endeavours to fulfil the important tasks of this high office. I am perfectly sure that you will maintain from the Chair a standard of fairness to all, but you will remember that this is a House of Parliament where there are strong convictions and strong opinions. These strong convictions and strong opinions are expressed here, and I think they are necessary if Parliament is to be effective and efficient. They are also necessary if legislation is to receive proper attention. I know that in your duties you will seek not only to encourage but also to protect the expression of those deeply held political views and convictions. We wish you well, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President.</inline> We pay tribute to you and we pay tribute to your wife. We offer you our support and goodwill and, as I said earlier, we hope that you will have many satisfying years in fulfilling your duties as  President  of the Senate. </para>

      <para>Senators, Members of the House of Representatives: </para>
      <para>We assemble at a time when large areas of New South Wales and Queensland are being devastated by severe flooding. It is a terrible experience for those affected and my Government expresses its deepest concern for their plight. The Government is consulting with the States in taking action to ensure that all proper assistance is available. The Natural Disasters Organisation is operating smoothly. </para>
      <para>Following the decision of the Australian people in the election last December for both Houses of Parliament, my Government believes that the Australian people have given it a strong directive to bring under control the highest unemployment for forty years and the worst prolonged inflation in the nation's history. The Government believes that excessive government intervention in the life of the nation is a major factor in economic instability. </para>
      <para>My Government's immediate objective is to bring inflation under control so that there can again be jobs for all who want to work. </para>
      <para>The Government's long term objective is to prevent the growth of centralised bureaucratic domination in Australia, the increasing dependence of individuals on the state. It is to encourage the development of an Australia in which people have maximum freedom and independence to achieve their own goals in life, in ways which they decide. </para>
      <para>As part of this approach the Government will place great emphasis on directing welfare assistance to those in real need. Unless there is a concentration on those in real need, schemes of assistance do not provide maximum possible assistance to the disadvantaged and become excessively costly. The Government does not believe that the poor and disadvantaged can be best helped by increasing the dependence of everyone on what the Government chooses to provide. </para>
      <para>My Government believes that adequate opportunities for the disadvantaged as well as the most rapid improvement in social service provision, are dependent on people being free and encouraged to achieve their best. The disadvantaged must be helped in ways which leave them the maximum independence. </para>
      <para>At the root of the economic crisis is a steadily increasing tax burden required to finance, at the expense of the private sector, an ever-growing public sector. Measures to deal with this crisis will advance Australia towards the long-term goal of a society based on freedom and on the mutual respect freedom makes possible. </para>
      <para>The Government's strategy to achieve its objectives can be summarised as follows: </para>
      <list type="decimal">
        <item label="(1)">
          <para>There will be a major direction of resources away from Government towards individuals and private enterprise; </para>

      <list type="decimal">
        <item label="(5)">
          <para>The total wealth of Australians will be expanded by the encouragement of enterprise, and by the reassertion of the Government's role in establishing an appropriate legal framework for economic life; </para>
        </item>
        <item label="(6)">
          <para>In all policy areas the Government will be alert to opportunities to increase the freedom of Australians to choose without exploitation- the kinds of goods, services, and styles of life they want, and to minimise direction by Government and the unnecessary redirection of resources through the Government's bureaucracy. </para>
        </item>
      </list>
      <para>Control of inflation is the Government's first consideration. Unless inflation is brought under control there will be no adequate employment opportunities, no soundly based return to prosperity. </para>
      <para>The Government has already begun to implement its economic program to achieve this objective. It is a full three year program. </para>
      <para>The budget deficit must be lowered, otherwise inflationary pressures will intensify. The very rapid growth in government expenditure in recent times has been accompanied by enormous waste. The Government has taken a number of actions to reduce expenditure and inefficiency. </para>
      <para>Immediate economies have been made in administrative expenses. These affect, among other things, overtime, travel and subsistence expenses, advertising, consultancy work, the activities of commissions, boards of inquiry, and so on, as well as expenditure by Ministers and other members of Parliament. </para>
      <para>The growth of the Federal bureaucracy has been halted by the announcement of revised staff ceilings. Further revisions to these ceilings to reduce the size of the service were announced last week. </para>
      <para>There has been an initial review of the Government's spending programs and, with the other measures taken, expenditure reductions worth about $3 60m in the current year have been achieved. Savings from these decisions in later years will be considerably greater. </para>
      <para>The Government has also appointed an Administrative Review Committee to review administrative expenditure, achieve maximum administrative efficiency, and eliminate waste and duplication within and between Government Departments, and between Commonwealth and States. The committee will report progressively. </para>
      <para>The Government has been forced to examine all expenditures in terms of their priority. Choices have to be made. It will be necessary to economise on some worthwhile projects which are not urgent, in addition to continued action against waste and duplication, to effect the necessary transfer of resources to the private sector. Only if this is done can prosperity and productive job opportunities be restored. </para>
      <para>While the Government in these ways is seeking to cut the costs of public administration, it also seeks to promote worthwhile innovation in the Public Service. The Government will give close attention to the Report of the Royal Commission on Australian Government Administration when it is received. </para>
      <para>Concurrent with action to bring the deficit under control, the Government has announced a number of measures to further restrain inflation, encourage investment in plant and equipment and expand job opportunities in the private sector. </para>
      <para>These measures include a new 40 per cent investment allowance and the relaxation of conditions applying to the interest deductibility of convertible note issues. </para>
      <para>The Government has introduced a major set of monetary measures to take up excess liquidity and encourage investment. The package included a special new security, the Australian Savings Bond, which was outstandingly successful in supporting the February loan raisings. </para>
      <para>The Government will continue the suspension of the quarterly tax instalments for the three instalments that would have been payable for the 1976-77 financial year. </para>
      <para>Alongside its assistance to manufacturing and other industries, the Government has taken action to assist the rural community to overcome its present crisis. Rural industries will not be neglected as they have been in the past. </para>
      <para>Government support for industry- primary as well as secondary- will be based on reports of the Industries Assistance Commission. The Government, of course, makes policy in this area. The Government is pursuing energetically proposals for a Rural Bank and a Farm Income Reserve Fund. </para>
      <para>An important contribution to economic revival and the expansion of job opportunities will be made by the Government 's policy for Australia 's resources. The prime objective of the Government's national resources policy is to return resource development to its proper role in the nation's economy and to restore overseas users' confidence in the Australian mining industry's long term reliability. </para>
      <para>The Government seeks to assure its overseas trading partners, including Japan, that we will be a stable and steady trading partner. Reliable access to overseas markets for a range of Australian products will be sought. </para>
      <para>The development of the North- West Shelf is a high priority and the Government is working closely with the Western Australian Government and private enterprise to bring the gas on-stream at the earliest possible date. </para>
      <para>The Government will energetically promote overseas trade and participate actively in the discussion of trade problems in the Conference on International Economic Cooperation and the forthcoming Unclad Ministerial Conference, as well as in the Multilateral Trade Negotiations being conducted under the auspices of GATT. </para>
      <para>The Government will encourage measures aimed at improving the efficiency, economy, and adequacy of our transport services. In achieving these objectives it will work through Commonwealth, State and industry advisory bodies and it will review means of strengthening the Australian Shippers ' Council. </para>
      <para>Action will be taken to give effect to the Government's commitment to develop a relative freight equalisation scheme for Bass Strait traffic. </para>
      <para>The Government will ensure that business activity is regulated by law to prevent exploitation of consumers. It will also review existing regulations to ensure that they are in the public interest and do not needlessly hamper business efficiency. The Government will review the operation of the Trade Practices Act and closely cooperate with the States in protecting the consumer. </para>
      <para>Australia will not return to a soundly based prosperity without understanding and cooperation between all sections of the community. The Government needs broadly based advice from the community and in this regard will be looking to such bodies as the Economic Consultative Group and the proposed tripartite national consultative council in the industrial relations area. With this in mind the Government has established the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs to develop and maintain close contact with consumers and business. In the field of transport, improved communication and cooperation with the States will be undertaken through the Australian Transport Advisory Council, the Marine and Ports Council and the Transport Industries Advisory Council. </para>
      <para>Talks are to be held with union and employer groups on the future role and operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal. </para>
      <para>A major step in the Government's strategy and an important support for community cooperation will be the introduction of tax indexation. </para>
      <para>In the next Budget, the Government will begin implementing its tax indexation policy. The greater the support given to the Government's economic program, the greater the first step can be. This reform will compel governments to be honest- if they want more money, they must legislate for it. It will protect the average Australian and the low income earner against higher tax levels caused by inflation, lt will check Government-induced inflation. It will be more effective in protecting the incomes of wage and salary earners than any other single measure. </para>
      <para>The Government intends to increase the capacity of Australian workers and employers to decide the leadership of their organisations. Legislation will be introduced providing for officially conducted secret ballots in elections for officials in organisations registered under the Conciliation and Arbitration Act. The Government is also proposing to ensure that members receive each year a report on the activities of their organisation and its finances. These measures will be discussed with the trade union movement before legislation is introduced. </para>
      <para>To re-establish a pattern of co-operation in national affairs and reverse the excessive centralising of power in Australia, the Government proposes to make the most important reform of the Federal system since Federation. Its core will be the principle of tax sharing. The possibilities of this new approach to Federalism are demonstrated by the recent Premiers' Conference. The working of our governmental system has been corroded by the absence of reasonable financial autonomy for the States. Under this Government, the States will have access to a secure proportion of personal income tax revenue. This will both make possible more effective community participation in State and Local Government and a more rational use of the Government's resourced. </para>
      <para>In making these reforms, particular care will be taken over the special circumstances of the less populous States to ensure that they are in no way disadvantaged. </para>
      <para>To assist in achieving co-operation between the various spheres of government, an Advisory Council on Inter-governmental Relations will be established. </para>
      <para>In line with its policy of devolving governmental authority, the Government will progressively act to confer executive responsibility on the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory with the objective of advancing the Territory to Statehood. A joint Federal and Northern Territory Legislative Assembly committee will be set up to work on arrangements for the transition to Statehood. </para>
      <para>For the A.C.T. the Government will propose legislation to ensure that the A.C.T. Legislative Assembly has responsibility for the financial management and decision-making related to Canberra's local affairs, although the Parliament will retain a reserve power of disallowance. A task force has been established to make recommendations on the framework for the transfer of appropriate authority to the Assembly. </para>
      <para>Action to restore Australia's economic well being and decentralise Government decision making is essential to the Government's ability to provide better and more effective assistance to the disadvantaged. The Government will not permit economic recovery to take place at the expense of those who are less well off. </para>
      <para>The Government proposes to introduce to the Parliament amending legislation to increase social service pensions and benefit rates every six months in accordance with movements in the Consumer Price Index. Similar legislation will be introduced to increase repatriation compensation payments. </para>
      <para>The Government will proceed with a review of the income security system as a whole, including the effectiveness of guaranteed minimum income proposals in overcoming poverty. </para>
      <para>The possibility of expanding the area of choice in services available to the disadvantaged and those in real need, while fully maintaining support, will be investigated by the Government. </para>
      <para>It is believed by the Government that voluntary welfare organisations are a critically important part of the Australian welfare system. Accordingly, financial assistance to them will continue. In addition, the Government will assist voluntary bodies by placing public service resources at their disposal through improving opportunities for transferability of staff between the Government and the non-government sector. </para>
      <para>Medibank will be retained and the Government will ensure it operates efficiently. The Medibank Review Committee has been established to examine the program in this respect. </para>
      <para>Measures have been taken to ensure that only those genuinely eligible receive unemployment benefit. The Government will do everything in its power to ensure that these measures are applied with a sensitivity and understanding that respects the dignity of the unemployed, and that there is a simple, understandable and effective appeals system to protect applicants for benefits against arbitrary action by officials. </para>
      <para>The Government believes that education is a prime means for individual self development. An education system to achieve this end must be based on equality of opportunity and the pursuit of excellence. </para>
      <para>Legislation will be presented to Parliament early in the session to provide assistance to the States for education in 1976. This legislation will authorise funds for the programmes of the Schools Comm mission, Universities Commission, Commission on Advanced Education and the Technical and Further Education Commission, which are now proceeding. </para>
      <para>The Government has requested reports from these Commissions on the triennium 1977-79 by the end of March. </para>
      <para>The relevant Commissions will be asked to give close attention to measures designed to achieve greater equality in teaching and facilities, and in particular to giving effective educational opportunities to the disadvantaged handicapped, Aboriginal, isolated and migrant children. </para>
      <para>The functions of the Commissions and how they relate to State programs and responsibilities will be examined by the Government. Proposals are being considered for a single Tertiary Education Commission to perform the functions currently undertaken by the Universities Commission and the Commission on Advanced Education. </para>
      <para>The Government intends to proceed with the establishment of the maritime college at Launceston. </para>
      <para>The Government gives high priority to the provision of trade union training. It is particularly concerned that training opportunities, and the composition of National and State Union </para>
      <para class="block">Training Councils recognise the important position of women in Australian employment. </para>
      <para>The Government's foreign policy will reflect a greater self-reliance, and willingness to develop friendly and cooperative relations with all countries. The Government will continue fully to support international initiatives for the reduction of world tensions. </para>
      <para>Within South East Asia Australia has particularly good relations with the ASEAN group of countries. The Government will seek ways of expanding cooperation with them both individually and as a group as well as maintaining and developing substantive communications with all countries in the Asia-Pacific area. </para>
      <para>My Government's diplomatic effort will give greater emphasis to the Asia-Pacific region. It will seek to extend and deepen Australia's relations with Japan. In response to messages from the Prime Minister of Japan, expressing the wish for the early conclusion of a treaty of friendship and cooperation between the two countries, the Government has made decisions which will enable the negotiations delayed last year to proceed. Bilateral relations with China will be further developed. </para>
      <para>The Government believes there is a need to pay more attention to relations with countries with which we share common philosophical commitments. </para>
      <para>Priority will be given to the protection of Australian interests in areas adjacent to our continent. In the Indian Ocean the Government supports United States Efforts to balance the Soviet presence while hoping mutual restraint will keep the balance of forces at the lowest practical level. Conscious of the steady and systematic development since 1968 of Soviet naval capabilities in the Indian Ocean area and its use of facilities there, and given the need of the United States to have adequate logistical back-up in an area where developments could affect global stability, the Government supports the United States development of Diego Garcia facilities. </para>
      <para>The Government believes Australia has a continuing responsibility to assist in the progress of Papua New Guinea and will, therefore, continue a comprehensive program for cooperation and development. The Government looks forward to the visit of Papua New Guinea's Prime Minister and to having early discussions with him. The Government also accepts that it has a responsibility to assist with the economic advancement of developing countries. </para>
      <para>The nation's security is a prime concern of the Government. The Government will watch the international situation closely to ensure timely warning of any changes adverse to the nation's security interests. It will maintain and foster the valuable defence relations with Australia's allies and other friends, including close associates in the neighbouring region. </para>
      <para>The Government will ensure that the nation has at its disposal an adequate defence force that is properly trained, equipped and supported. </para>
      <para>Thorough assessments of equipment needs are being undertaken as part of the review of the Defence Program. Once the priorities are determined my Government will act without delay to acquire the chosen equipment. An order for medium range transport aircraft for the RAAF is expected to be placed within the next few months. </para>
      <para>A plan for a new cadet system is being drawn up. The new style cadet corps will retain the essential virtues of cadet training, but will seek to rely more heavily on voluntary support from the community. </para>
      <para>The Government places importance on improving the Defence infrastructure, and has directed that a number of studies be undertaken in relation to our Western seaboard. These include an examination to expedite completion of Has Stirling in Cockburn Sound, and the early establishment of a Joint Services training area at Yampi Sound. </para>
      <para>The new Defence organisation established by the Defence Reorganisation Act will facilitate the development of a Defence Force in keeping with Australia's needs. A Defence Council has been established to facilitate the access by the Minister for Defence to all relevant advice and information concerning the control and administration of the Armed Services and to ensure that the views of the services are reviewed by an appropriate body. </para>
      <para>The Government is firmly committed to furthering equality of opportunity for women in education, employment, and in public life. It will encourage the full participation of women in all aspects of Australian life to ensure that their contribution of skills and talents is used to the full. The Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation Scheme to be introduced shortly has been amended to make better provision for women employed by the Government. </para>
      <para>The Government recognises the major contribution that migrants have made to Australia. </para>
      <para class="block">It will intensify action to meet the needs of migrant and ethnic communities in Australia. </para>
      <para>In order to consult adequately with migrant communities, the Government will see that consultative committees are established in every State. </para>
      <para>It will cooperate with the States and migrant communities in disseminating ethnic languages and cultures. </para>
      <para>It favours the provision of migrant advisory services and assistance schemes in industry and will encourage industry to take a greater responsibility for the welfare of migrant workers. </para>
      <para>The Government will make available adequate numbers of bilingual staff in public hospitals and government departments. </para>
      <para>The thrust of the Government's policy in Aboriginal Affairs is to promote self-management and self-sufficiency for Aboriginals. To this end the Government will be considering ways of providing opportunities for Aboriginals to play a significant role in setting their long-term goals and objectives, priorities for expenditure, and in evaluating existing programs and formulating new ones. </para>
      <para>The Government will introduce legislation to establish a new Home Savings Grant Scheme. The Government will review the Housing Loans Insurance Scheme. </para>
      <para>The Government is conscious of the need to protect and improve the nature of the environment. </para>
      <para>To provide a coherent national approach to pollution control, the Government will discuss national environmental standards and criteria with the States. As soon as those discussions have been concluded, legislation will be introduced. </para>
      <para>The implications of the affirmation by the High Court that the Seas and Submerged Lands Act 1973 is valid for the administration of all offshore operations, are now under close study and appropriate revised arrangements are being worked out in cooperation with the States. In these consultations the Government will seek to work out an appropriate basis of cooperation with the States not only in relation to particular industries but in particular for the protection of the marine environment. </para>
      <para>The subject of privacy will be referred to the Law Reform Commission. The terms of reference will be settled after consultation with State Attorneys-General. After consideration of the Commission's report the Government will introduce appropriate legislation. </para>
      <para>The Government will continue to implement the Family Law Act. </para>
      <para>Australia has a fine record of achievement in the creative and performing arts. </para>
      <para>It is the Government's intention to encourage their continued growth and development, and to emphasise the development of young talent. The Government also believes thai the States and private interests can play a crucial part in the healthy and vigorous growth of the arts. </para>
      <para>The Government will give effect to the National Gallery's policy of giving first priority to purchasing Australian Art. Australia's National Gallery should hold the very finest work of Australian artists of all periods. </para>
      <para>The Government will support a more vigorous sponsorship of exhibitions which will give more Australians ready access to the art and culture of other countries. </para>
      <para>The Government will continue to encourage the rapidly growing Australian Film and Television Industry. </para>
      <para>Further development of the creative and performing arts will add greatly to the depth and value of life in Australia. </para>
	  <para>Senators and Members,</para>
        <para>The purpose my Government has set itself is not merely to give Australia prosperity, predictability and stability. It is also to develop in a rational and sensible fashion a new and exciting role for government- one which places more reliance on the commonsense and reason of the Australian people. </para>
        <para>Australians are increasingly well educated, they have a high capacity to participate in and shape the decisions that determine their future. My Government is determined to develop these possibilities in the process of government in a manner never before undertaken. </para>

          <para>- I would like to thank honourable senators very much for electing me  Chairman  of Committees and for the honour they have conferred on me. But I am mindful of the responsibility that goes with the position. I realise that the job holds a lot of responsibilities and I recognise also from past experience in the position of  Chairman  of Committees that one must have the co-operation of all senators. I would hope that I would be able to obtain that because I recognise that if the Senate is to operate efficiently- I think that we would all like it to operate efficiently- a standard must be set and maintained by all. I believe that the person occupying the Chair is the one who should give a lead in this. I will endeavour at all times to give a lead when I am occupying the position of  Chairman  of Committees. I would hope that I could obtain the co-operation of all senators. I look forward to working with you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> in the interests of the Senate and senators. </para>

          <para>- On behalf of the Government I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> on his return to this important office of the Senate. We are all delighted to see him back in the post he held so ably between 1965 and 1969. He won the respect and admiration of all of us who sat here in that period for his fairness and firmness.

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WRIEDT</inline>(Tasmania-Leader of the Opposition)- I cannot say that I am so delighted at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> 's election. Just as I said to you this morning, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I hope that his stay in the office will be as brief as possible. Nevertheless I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> on behalf of the Opposition. I know that he will continue the sense of fairness for which he is noted in this place. In that regard I look forward to his occupancy as  Chairman  of Committees, but I must stop at that. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator WEBSTER</inline>(Victoria-Minister for Science)- I, of course, am delighted to congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tom</inline> Drake-Brockman on his election as  Chairman  of Committees. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has been a member of the Senate since 1958 when he was appointed under section 15 of the Constitution by the Western Australia Parliament. He was re-elected in 1964, 1970, 1974 and 1975. He was a Commonwealth Minister for 3 years. He. was Minister for Air between 1969 and 1972 and Acting Leader of the Government for a period in 1972. Additionally he was a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees for 3 years and  Chairman  of Committees between 1965 and 1969. He was Acting  President  of the Senate for a term during 1966. All honourable senators who know of Tom Drake-Brockman 's worth will realise that we have the services of an outstanding senator. In addition to his outstanding parliamentary service <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> has been an active sponsor of rural interests for many years. This followed his outstanding military service as a member of the 10th Light Horse and his service in the Royal Australian Air Force including active service overseas for which he was awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross. </para>
        <para>Today is a unique day, no less for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman.</inline> He is the only senator since Federation to have been elected to the position of  Chairman  of Committees on a second occasion, there being an intervening period between the 2 elections. That is of great credit to him. I am sure that all honourable senators present are aware of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Drake-Brockman</inline> 's outstanding capabilities which uniquely qualify him for the position of  Chairman  of Committees. </para>

You have been kind enough to permit me to catch your eye and I am grateful that you have provided me with this unusual opportunity to address the Senate on the motion for the adjournment on the very first day on which the Senate sits. My reason for addressing the Senate is that we have witnessed today the most unusual circumstances that have existed, as far as I am aware, in the parliamentary history of this country. They are unusual in the sense that I recollect that only one member of the Australian Labor Party was sitting on the Opposition benches. But, be that as it may, the reason I am on my feet is that speeches have been made congratulating various people on doing this, that and the other and remarking, by inference, how important it is to see that the parliamentary institution is maintained. I want to say to honourable senators who are gathered here at the present moment that the reason we have ceremony in a parliament is so that men and women can sit together and be associated together in ceremonial circumstances which are the means by which friction is avoided. </para>

            <para>- I think that the unprecedented action of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack in speaking in the adjournment debate on the first day of sitting has achieved its purpose. It shows how much the Government forces were concerned about the absence from the chamber of the Opposition on this occasion and how embarrassed they were by it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack, as an upholder of ceremonial procedure, was greatly embarrassed by it. I do not want anyone to believe that we members of the Labor Party derived any enjoyment from being absent from the ceremony today. We believe in conventions; we believe in the practice of parliament; we believe in parliamentary democracy. It is only because that was so disrupted and destroyed by the unconstitutional action of a person who calls himself a Kerr - </para>

I am sorry to do this so early in your career, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> but it seems to me to be rather unusual that you have allowed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McClelland and other members of the Opposition as chimpanzees without any redress from you whatsoever. The most highly insulting remarks were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack and yet you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> were very prompt to act on points of order taken by the Opposition. I hope that will not be the pattern of your behaviour, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> while you occupy the chair. </para>

              <para>-Senator Wheeldon, the interpretation you have placed on those words is incorrect in my opinion. I would have pulled up <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack on what he said if I had had the same impression as you did. </para>

              <para>- I regret causing all this concern in the Senate. I think some of the blame must be taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> I accept your ruling and I accept <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers'</inline> remark that to reflect upon the representative of the Crown is unparliamentary. I take it that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers</inline> accepts that to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr was part of a plot is some reflection upon the representative of the Crown and, therefore, should not be said in this Parliament. If that is so, and only because it is unparliamentary, I shall not proceed with that line of argument and shall withdraw the remarks that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> was part of the plot. But it is well known that he had a conversation with the Chief Justice of the High Court of Australia. It is well known that he was in consultation with the Leader of the Opposition at that time and sought advice from outside the Executive Council as to what he should do in a constitutional crisis. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>Possibly I am free to say that Malcolm Fraser and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Garfield</inline> Barwick were part of a plot and that  His Excellency  the Governor-General was the instrument by which the plot they conceived was put into operation and that he unconstitutionally dismissed a government which had been elected by the people of Australia and which had the full confidence of the people's House. After that Government was dismissed a motion of no confidence was carried against the appointed Prime Minister by the people's House. Contrary to the whole Constitution a government that was given a mandate to operate for 3 years was dismissed by an individual who came into this House today expecting us to pay homage to him. We find no credit in that, but Government senators cannot accept the fact that we should not have been here to pay homage and to condone the action that was taken on that occasion. I think it is a justification of the Australian Labor Party's attitude. No honest Labor man in Australia- the Labor Party represents 42 per cent of the electorate- will in the future attend a function where <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Kerr is in attendance. During last week I had unfortunately to decline donating to a charitable organisation because its sponsor is a man who does not have the respect of a large number of Australian citizens. That is part of the sacrifice. If there were any honesty and decency in the individual he would resign his post of Governor-General of Australia in view of the large number of  Her  Majesty's subjects who disagree with the action that was taken. </para></speech>

            <para>- I am sorry that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack had to make such a hasty and rather clumsy exit as I should have liked him to have heard what I had to say about him.  His  sanctimonious little sermon to the Senate would have been more acceptable if he had shown a little more courtesy and good manners earlier in the day. It did not go unmarked on this side of the chamber that a couple of the rivals that you had for your election to the Presidency of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President- Senator Young</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson-</inline> had the good grace to stand in their places and to compliment and to congratulate you. I am sure that we all admire them for their sportsmanship m so doing. But we noticed that the man who has just left us so rapidly and who read us such a sermon in good manners and civility did not have the grace to do so. So his words fell on our ears with a great clang this afternoon. He does not uphold the best traditions of this place. I wish he had stayed to hear me say this about him. I do not think he shed any credit on himself at all today. I hope that the affairs of the Senate will be conducted in this session with a greater attention to civility than we have had from a man who should be an exemplar of civility in this place. </para>

            <para>- I feel it would be remiss of the Senate to overlook a motion of condolence that has been moved in another place this day on the death of the Premier of the People's Republic of China, Chou Enl a i. It is of great importance to us as a part of this hemisphere that we pay diplomatic tribute to this great person who has gone into history on this occasion of great national grief for the 800 million people of his country with whom he shared their march into liberation from domination by colonial people in other parts of the world. I am advised that a motion on this matter will be moved in the Senate tomorrow. I had not been previously advised of this. I knew that a motion had been moved in another place and I wanted personally to pay this tribute to the great leader of this very fine race of people, the </para>

            <para>- I inform the Senate that I knew that the motion adverted to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Byrne</inline> was to be moved in another place. In fact I think 3 such motions were moved in the other place today: One concerned the deceased Prime Minister of Malaysia and one the deceased Prime Minister of Nigeria. I have been informed that the practice of the Senate has been not to move motions of condolence on the first day of sitting; otherwise these motions would have come before the Senate this day. I know a number of honourable senators wish to speak to these motions and they will be moved at the first opportunity tomorrow. </para>
