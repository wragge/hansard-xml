          <para>- by leave- The Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, announced on 22 September that the Department of Repatriation would be renamed the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs and would have certain additional functions. I now inform the Senate that the former Department of Repatriation has today been renamed the Department of Veterans &#39; Affairs and that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Durack</inline> has been sworn in as Minister for Veterans &#39; Affairs. I take this opportunity to mention that the Department of Veterans&#39; Affairs, with its additional responsibilities for defence service homes and war graves, is identified under its new name in an issue of the Administrative Arrangements Order approved by the Executive Council today. </para>

        <para>Various proposals-some with larger effect than others- have been put to the Government from the Administrative Review Committee, and from other sources, which have been accepted as part of the Government&#39;s ongoing objective of achieving economy and effectiveness in its administrative arrangements. Some areas are still subject to examination- for example, by the Task Force on Co-ordination in Welfare and Health. Functions which are being transferred between departments are set out in tabular form in a brief document which I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Education. I refer particularly to Press statements today relating to student allowances and to other educational schemes. I refer also to the Minister&#39;s own statement of 30 September. I inquire specifically about the tertiary education assistance scheme and about the matter of isolated children. In the latter case, the Minister will recall that this was the subject of a recent Senate inquiry. Is the Minister able to give any response to the Press report which appears today? Can he give the Senate any information in relation to the 2 particular areas of education regarding allowances and funding? </para>

            <para>- I hope in the near future to make a detailed statement to the Senate on the 10 or 1 1 individual student allowances which are now current. Included in those allowances will be both the tertiary allowance referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Davidson</inline> and the isolated children&#39;s allow.ance. The interdepartmental committee which was considering the matter and which has made a report to the Government had the benefit of the Senate standing committee&#39;s report on isolated children. I should add also that the Government has acknowledged that the lack of increase in the tertiary allowances since January 1975 has created hardship amongst those students who wholly or predominantly are forced to live on those allowances. Those matters will be taken into consideration when we announce the new allowances. </para>

            <para>As it is now clear that some positive steps are necessary to ensure the employment of more young people, particularly apprentices and appropriate trainees, will the Minister consult with his colleague with a view to lifting staff ceilings in relation to the employment of young people in particular and to review programs wherever possible which might possibly ensure that young people will be employed? </para>

          <para>In addition to the inducements which have been recently announced by the Minister and which might be currently under review by him, can the Minister give any indication that staff ceilings in government departments and/or in statutory authorities might be lifted to allow the induction of more apprentices, even though the level of apprentices might be higher than would be necessary under the apprenticeship Acts? </para>

            <para>- I acknowledge the very considerable interest which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop,</inline> and I think also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa,</inline> have shown in this matter. Following the previous occasion on which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> raised the matter in the Senate I had some inquiries made. I have ascertained that in directions which have been given by the Public Service Board to all departments in regard to their administration of the staff ceilings special note has been taken of the matter which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> raised. The Board has requested departments to have regard to the long term needs of the Public Service for high quality and skilled staff. That, of course, takes into account particularly the matter of trainees. The need to recruit trainees in all departments, and presumably in all skills, should not be neglected in the administration of the staff ceilings. This, of course, is within the policy laid down by the Government for staff ceilings this present year. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>There is no intention on the part of the Government to abandon this overall ceilings policy, but certainly it is the intention of the Government that departments should have regard to the need to take in an adequate number of people for training purposes. I will however pass on to the Minister the concern expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop.</inline> In conclusion, I should like to refer also, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop</inline> has done, to the new initiative by the Government in the youth employment scheme. I re-emphasise that the subsidy applicable under that scheme is available to participating employers, whether they be in the private or the public sector. So that would be another avenue for enlarging the opportunities for training. </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I refer to the recent action by Telecom officials and other Government officers at Darwin in confiscating the transmitter which provided communication with the resisting Fret i lin forces in Timor. Does the Government agree that such government action may well lead to the false assumption by the Indonesian authorities that the Australian Government desires to suppress the disclosure, to Australians and the world, of continued fierce resistance by the East Timorese and of continued Indonesian atrocities in East Timor? What does the Government intend to do to ensure that the Australian public has full access to facts relating to the Timor situation and is not dependent on Indonesian propaganda for news of the war in East Timor? </para>

              <para>-The honourable senator should not interrupt. Merely because something is being done unlawfully and the Government enforces the law people should not make assumptions. As the honourable senator well knows, one of the problems is that in this place too many people make assumptions about too many things. As to the latter part of the question, I think the activities of my colleague, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, in this area have been such that he, to the best of his great ability and with his enormous energy, has got as much information as he could out of East Timor. I think everybody will admit that the activity of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock</inline> in this area has been constant, unremitting and uncompromising. All I can add in conclusion is that I am certain that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Peacock</inline> will continue in the future to use his best endeavours to see that some self-determination is brought about in East Timor. </para>

            <para>- The case that has been referred to by the honourable senator is one in which the unemployment benefit was terminated because the recipient had not passed the work test as administered by the Commonwealth Employment Service. With regard to the Press report about unemployment benefit being terminated as a punitive measure, I know of no spokesman who acted for me and made that statement to the Press. The only member of my staff who spoke to the newspaper concerned states that that was not a statement that was made. Therefore, I would have to accept the part of the honourable senator&#39;s question which relates to that report as being irrelevant as it is soundly based on a newspaper report which had no foundation. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Regarding statements being made clearly to a person who is seeking unemployment benefit, it would be understood that a person must pass a work test to be eligible for the benefit. In this case, the Commonwealth Employment Service gave a report that the recipient did not pass that work test. For this reason, the unemployment benefit was terminated. At the time when my Department wrote to the recipient attention was drawn to the fact that an appeal may be lodged against that report. An appeal form was sent to her. It would be understood also that a person may reapply for unemployment benefit and then, subject to the work test being satisfactorily completed, be eligible to obtain unemployment benefit in the future. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I refer to the problem being experienced by Timorese corning to Australia, in many cases to be reunited with their families in the eastern States of Australia, and also in Darwin, Northern Territory, where several hundred refugees are living. The <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> today reports this matter on its front page under the heading <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Mr Fraser,</inline> please bring back our men&#39;, and outlines the problem as being one of not being able to save quickly enough for the fares before the option expired on 30 June. Is not the report erroneous and is not the true situation that, as there has been no contact with Timor for several months, aircraft or shipping cannot go there by either a regular schedule or charter, that the Australian Government has indicated it would permit the Timorese to enter Australia and that, as in the Darwin case, finance would have been and still is available for the chartering of aircraft? Can the Government give an assurance that it is very aware of the plight and hardship in which Timorese refugees are living in Australia and that it is the Government&#39;s intention to find ways and means of assisting communication between Timor and Australia to help the people of Timor, to assist in providing urgently needed supplies and to use its influence to bring Timor back from a&#39; state of siege? </para>

            <para>- I do not know that I am able to answer all of the questions that were raised by the honourable senator. It will be recalled that the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs announced on 28 May that Timorese evacuees in Australia could apply for resident status and that those evacuees who decided not to apply for resident status would have their tern,porary entry permits extended to 30 June. It is therefore open to those Timorese evacuees who have opted to obtain resident status to nominate their relatives overseas for migrant entry to Australia. This applies whether they are in East Timor or elsewhere. The normal migration entry criteria would apply and spouses, dependent children and parents of the evacuees would be eligible for migrant entry if they satisfied health and character requirements. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The Government is aware of the difficulties of people resident in Timor, and of the evacuees. Those who have not sought permanent residence may still nominate their spouses and minor dependent children for entry to Australia, and this applies to relatives abroad, whether in Timor or elsewhere. However, in keeping with the policies applying generally to sponsorships, other relatives may not be nominated by persons who are not permanent residents of Australia. </para>
          <para>The extensive action that has been taken by the Government to facilitate the residence in Australia of Timorese evacuees demonstrates the Government&#39;s awareness of their plight and the hardship they have suffered. As far as the Department of Foreign Affairs is concerned, it has been stated on behalf of the Minister that it has always been the Government&#39;s hope that the situation in East Timor will gradually return to a more normal state. The Government has tried to assist this process by its recent decision to channel assistance to the people of East Timor through the Indonesian Red Cross in the hope that this contribution will help to alleviate some of the difficulties they are in as a result of the upheavals of the past month. Any other matters raised I will refer to the Minister to get an answer for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. The Minister will be aware that there is yet another strike in the oil refining industry in New South Wales. Can he advise whether this industrial disturbance is based upon some issue of wages or upon some issue of work conditions or safety? If it is not, can he explain to the people of New South Wales the basis on which they have been threatened with loss of jobs, extra costs and extensive community disruption? </para>

The issue of jurisdiction is being litigated in the High Court of&#34; Australia.

I may be in a position later in question time to enlighten the Senate further on the matter. </para>

            <para>-The Government regrets the circumstances in Rhodesia which led to the arrest and conviction of Bishop Lamont. The Government earnestly hopes that the situation in Rhodesia will change soon and that actions of that kind will no longer be necessary. One of our problems is that Australia has no official dealings with the Rhodesian regime, which it does not recognise. Therefore we are really not in a position to convey any protests to the Rhodesian Government. </para>

            <para>-The Government has announced its objective of transferring to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly executive responsibility for all State type activities in the Northern Territory. At the present time the Government sees no reason why this schedule cannot be achieved within the time span suggested by the Prime Minister in his policy speech delivered prior to the election held in 1975. The transfers will take place under this Government in an orderly and evolutionary manner and we can be assured that they will take place within the time frame A committee of officers which has been established to facilitate the transfer of the responsibilities will examine and report to the Government on the issues involved in the transfer of particular functions. The reports of that committee undoubtedly will have an important influence on the order in which the transfers take place. Although an indicative timetable for the transfers has been set down more planning is required and the preparation of a planning document is considered to be important. A number of matters could intervene and change the whole timetable and, of course, not the least of these will be the wishes <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the people in the Northern Territory that the transfer of functions proceed at either a quicker or a slower rate.  </para>

            <para>- I have noted reports relating to this matter over a number of years. There is a feeling that preservatives and other additives in food and drinks may have some harmful effect on humans. The CSIRO has over a number of years investigated this matter. My understanding of the situation at the present time is that there is no proof that preservatives or additives are harmful substances. I shall refer to the Minister for Health the honourable senator&#39;s question as to whether the Government is proposing legislation on this matter and I shall seek an answer for the honourable senator. </para>

No doubt the Minister is aware that there is concern about the inability of telephone subscribers to check their telephone accounts with any degree of accuracy because of the lack of information given on the accounts. Does the Minister agree that Telecom Australia has meter readings associated with each telephone service and that the inclusion of these readings on telephone accounts would be of some assistance to subscribers? </para>

If the honourable senator wishes to find out why the Australian Broadcasting Commission made this decision and she cares to write to me, I will arrange for her letter to be sent to the  Chairman  of the Commission for an answer. However, I can assure the honourable senator that this Government in no way ever interferes with the functioning of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Therefore, what has happened to scripts for the Boyer lectures or in regard to any other administrative action taken by the ABC is a domestic matter for the ABC.

I refer to an answer I was given to Senate question No. 922 in which I asked for information about appeals relating to a number of social security benefits. I have been surprised by the wide variation from State to State in the percentage of appeals upheld. Figures for two separate 3-monthly periods, especially for unemployment benefit, show similar State by State variations. Has the Minister or her Department made any study to determine why there is such a wide variation? Can any suggestion be made as to why these variations exist? </para>

I have arranged for the Social Security Appeals Tribunal members to meet with me within the next few weeks- I think it is next month- and we will use this as an opportunity to exchange information on how the Appeals Tribunals are functioning in the States. I do not say that we are seeking uniformity among the tribunals because they are bodies which study the needs of their own States and work in their own way, but undoubtedly the experience of the tribunals over the months in which they have been operating will be of interest to members of tribunals in the States and certainly to me. I will look at the matter raised in the honourable senator&#39;s question and in the answer to question No. 922 and will certainly use this as a basis for one of the items of discussion at the meeting we have arranged. </para>

            <para>-This matter is of great importance to this country. There is a need at present for research capacity in terms of the extended responsibility this country may have when a 200-mile limit is adopted. The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation has planned for many years- I think the first plans were laid down in 1968- for a research vessel of large capacity to be built for this work. It is hoped that, in the not too distant future, this type of vessel can be secured for Australia. Most other countries have a number of research vessels for this type of work. Australia has leant upon the Royal Australian Navy for much of the research work that has been carried out. The honourable senator mentioned oceanographic research work. In modern times a great deal can be gained in this field from the use of satellites. Australia is not backward in taking advantage of the enormous amount of information on our offshore areas that is available through satellites. This matter certainly will be pursued by the CSIRO and other research institutes under the control of the Commonwealth Government. </para>

            <para>- I am not aware of the circumstances regarding the Western Australian demonstration as described by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters,</inline> but I accept the facts as she states them. I am not aware that the march was led by a member of the Communist Party. I understand that Communist Party banners, nevertheless, were used in a number of demonstrations. I am aware that throughout Australia a relatively small proportion of students were involved in the decision to take part in this strike. The proportion of students involved represented less than a fraction of one per cent of the actual enrolment on campus. I am aware that a number of people, including particularly some holding radical views, have been fermenting students on campus. I understand that in one sense some students are suffering hardship. Quite clearly they are suffering hardship because adjustments in their allowances have been delayed unjustly over the years. I equally believe that it is a pity there is not more student participation in the election of office bearers on campus so that we get a truer reflection of the nature and attitudes of students and a greater student participation in decision making. If this were done I think the results would be significantly different from what they are today. </para>

Being mindful of the number of refugees from various countries who have come to Australia for safety and who would like to remain, and taking into consideration also many migrants who have permanent resident status and many Australian citizens who are unemployed and unable to gain employment and who are consistently being called dole bludgers by supporters of the Government, I ask: What action will be taken against Miss San tangelo, who was refused migration to Australia on the basis that she does not have a skilled trade? I point out that her visa is for 6 months as a visitor only, her passport is clearly stamped &#39;Employment Prohibited&#39; and she was made aware that she was not entitled to seek employment before she left Italy. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Transport: Has the question of the siting of the proposed Omega station on Macquarie Island been considered? If it has been considered why is the site regarded as unsuitable? Is it solely because that island is part notwithstanding the fact that it is some 9S0 miles south-east of Tasmania- of the State of Tasmania? Is it true that the State Labor Government in Tasmania- notwithstanding the general acceptance of the report of the all party committee of this Parliament which investigated the question of an Omega station in Australiaremains blindly opposed to the siting of an Omega station anywhere within the State of Tasmania? </para>

            <para>- I was a member of the Joint Foreign Affairs and Defence Committee of this Parliament during the Omega hearings. I am aware of the considerable information that was provided to the Committee regarding Omega. In an appreciation of the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Rae</inline> I remind the Senate that it is envisaged that there will be 8 Omega stations throughout the world in countries with different attitudes and philosophies. Each station will be capable of being controlled wholly by the country concerned. It will be able to be turned on and off by the country concerned at any time. The Omega stations will not be able to transmit any messages; therefore they are not of any defence significance. I am aware that it is vital in the use of the Omega system throughout the world that a station should be sited in the south and southeast area, in general, of the Australian continent, so there would be great benefit for navigation by commercial vessels and by commercial aircraft. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I am aware that Macquarie Island was one of the islands considered. I am not aware of the positive rejection of an Omega site by the Tasmanian Government, whether on the island of Tasmania or on Macquarie Island. If a rejection were based upon the threat of some retaliation or because of alleged military uses it would be based on utterly false premises because there is no military significance attached to the establishment of an Omega station. I understand that the sites are now under discussion. Indeed, I have noticed that my colleague in another place, the Minister for Transport, has been talking of sites in the Gippsland area. I will direct the substance of the honourable senator&#39;s question to the Minister for Transport. I will particularly seek clarification regarding Macquarie Island and also will seek clarification of whether there has been a response in the negative from the Tasmanian Government. </para>

There would be some very substantial economic advantages, both in the resources spent and in the employment created. </para>

              <para>-No, I said I was not aware of it. This is a very interesting piece of information and I think the Senate ought to be grateful to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> for bringing it forward. He asked me, to my surprise, about the double standards of the Communist Party. Long ago I gave up being surprised at anything the Communist Party did- right from the time of the Stalin-Ribbentrop pact of 1939, which I suppose led to the holocaust of the Second World War in which I forget how many hundreds of millions, but certainly millions, of people perished. Honourable senators should not laugh at that. That war was brought about by the double standards of the Communist Party and the Nazis in getting together in the one bed. </para>

              <para>-The honourable senator should come back to 1939 and all the things that have happened since then. Of course, after the Nazis attacked the Communists it became a different sort of war. We even had the Communists in this country starting to support the war whereas before they did not care overmuch whether the Communists or the Nazis burned Jews or shot them; they were all in the same boat. Therefore, I am never surprised at the double standards of the Communist Party. There have been double standards ever since communists started to be about. I shall pass the other 2 questions asked by the honourable senator to my colleague in the other place and seek the information for the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>-One of the important achievements of the present Government is that during a period of financial restriction it has seen fit to make money available during this financial year for at least the commencement of the building of a vessel for marine science research purposes. The honourable senator, who comes from Queensland, will know that the Institute of Marine Science is located at Townsville and that work commenced under the former Government has proceeded under this Government. I think it was on about <inline font-style="italic">4</inline> September this year that the present Government called for tenders for the building of a research vessel intended to be located at Turtle Bay. It is hoped, and I think some assurance can be given, that the vessel will be completed and available to the Institute in 1977. The vessel is to be of a size of approximately 24.4 metres and has quite heavy associated equipment. I think tenders close on approximately 20 October this year. Those wishing to register should do so with the Shipbuilding Division of the Department of Industry and Commerce in Sydney. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. It refers to the question that I asked earlier of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Guilfoyle,</inline> who has told us that the work test applied to Miss Demos of Newcastle was applied by the Commonwealth Employment Service. I ask the Minister: Was the work test in fact merely a report from the potential employer of the girl? Did the Commonwealth Employment Service take the word of the potential employer without checking with the young lady who had applied for the job for her side of the story? What guidelines are issued to Commonwealth Employment Service officers concerning dress and appearance of persons to whom this work test is applied? </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations. It is corollary to the question asked by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> By way of preface, I point out that I have a Press release of 3 September by the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations, the third paragraph of which refers to joint Commonwealth and State action on common wage agreements. Instead of putting the cart before the horse would it not have been better to advance the work of this working party than to attempt under the guise of a State award to indulge in an industrial hijack of Sydney refinery workers? </para>

            <para>-The Government certainly believes and hopes that in all industrial disputes there will be the greatest opportunities for consultation and co-operation. That is no doubt what the efforts of the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations are intended to achieve in many spheres and in particular by the means which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> has mentioned. I take this opportunity to reply further to both questions asked in relation to this dispute? Earlier in question time I said that I hoped to get some further information. I have obtained that information. I understand that a meeting was held this morning, which was adjourned until tomorrow, and that it is the intention of the State branch of the Australian Workers Union to recommend to the meeting tomorrow that an application be made to the High Court to endeavour to resolve the very vexed and real legal problems which arise in regard to the conflicting jurisdictions of State and Federal laws in these matters. It is to be hoped also, and perhaps expected, that the recommendation of the employees will be to return to work pending the litigation before the High Court. I understand also that the oil companies- the employers have indicated that they will not seek to impede in any way the return to work by these men under whatever jurisdiction is determined, so there is some reason to hope that by tomorrow good sense will prevail and this dispute will be resolved. Presumably the technicalities of this dispute will be resolved in the High Court. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Social Security a question concerning transport assistance for the handicapped. Can she give some indication whether the Government accepts the recommendation of poverty commissioner the Reverend George Martin for the repeal of the sales tax exemption on new cars purchased for the purpose of transporting handicapped working people to and from employment? He recommends in its place the payment of a transport allowance to handicapped persons unable to use public transport, and the provision of subsidy on a $4 to $ 1 basis for the purchase of a car for travel to and from work. As the present provisions are too narrow to enable handicapped persons seeking work to purchase a new car, even if it were financially possible, will she investigate this as a matter of urgency, since persons who are both disabled and unemployed find the present position frustrating and demoralising? </para>

            <para>- I have been interested in the matter that has been raised by the honourable senator. I agree with him that there is a benefit available to those people who are able to purchase cars which assist them in transport and that this benefit is not available to others who are not able either to use cars or to purchase them. I am aware of the recommendations in the Martin report. The National Advisory Committee on the Handicapped has also drawn attention to this aspect. It is a matter that has had some consideration by the Government. I accept many of the things implicit in the question. I hope that in the future we will be able further to assist handicapped people in the matter of transport. </para>

          <para class="italic">
            <inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline>The Report I have just tabled is the first on variations to the plan of lay-out of the City of Canberra to be presented to the 30th Parliament. The previous variations Report was tabled on 7 October 1975. The proposed variations on this occasion consisted of 126 items. Three items were withdrawn and were not considered by the Committee. </para>
          <para>Because this is the first such Report to the 30th Parliament from the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory, and as there have been some adjustments to the matters dealt with by the Committee, it seems appropriate to refer briefly to the Committee&#39;s responsibilities with respect to variations to the plan of Canberra. </para>
          <para>Clause 1 (a) of the Committee&#39;s resolution of appointment makes provision for the Minister for the Capital Territory to refer to the Committee proposed variations to the plan of lay-out of the City of Canberra and its environs, based upon the plan gazetted in November 1925 as subsequently modified or varied. </para>
          <para>Section 12a of the <inline font-style="italic">Seat of Government (Administration) Act</inline> 1910 provides that variations to the plan may be made by the responsible Minister at any time but that the variations are subject to publication in the Government Gazette. Following publication, a 12-day period is provided for, during which no modification or variation can be made and when objections to the proposed variations can be lodged by the public. </para>
          <para>Since its establishment on 8 November 1956, it has been the responsibility of the Committee to consider proposed variations to the plan and report to the Parliament upon them. Based upon the Committee&#39;s Report, the Minister for the Capital Territory then tables an instrument by which the Report of the Committee is transferred into legislative authority. It is still possible for either House of the Parliament to pass a resolution within 6 sitting days of the tabling of the Minister&#39;s instrument, disallowing the modification or variation made by the instrument. Should this happen, the variation ceases to have effect. </para>
          <para>This procedure provides the Federal Parliament with a continuing oversight of the development of the National Capital. The Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory acts as the Federal Parliament&#39;s agent in this regard. </para>
          <para>The variations which are the subject of the present Report are a combination of new developments, drafting adjustments and revisions to the plan. </para>
          <para>Both the present Committee and its immediate predecessors held discussions with the Department of the Capital Territory to determine a new format for the plan, following criticism by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Fox in <inline font-style="italic">Kent</inline> v. <inline font-style="italic">Cavanagh</inline> (one of a series of cases concerning the construction of the Black Mountain telecommunications tower). His Honour was of the opinion that the <inline font-style="italic">Seat of Government (Administration) Act</inline> 1910 required a more meaningful and clearer notice of intention to be given. The Committee noted these comments and has made a recommendation to this effect. </para>
          <para>Because the City has grown to the point where it has become impractical for the plan of lay-out to be published as a single item a new format was devised, dividing the plan into several smaller units. This permits the inclusion of more information and greater accuracy. The Committee has requested the inclusion on the plan of- </para>
          <list type="decimal">
            <item label="(">
              <para>1 ) roads in proposed park-lands; </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(2)">
              <para>rural roads; and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(3)">
              <para>cycle paths. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>The Committee has also asked to be informed of changes or proposed changes to service yards and parking areas. Because of those changes, the authorities who deal with the plan have undertaken a thorough check of all aspects of it as it has been varied since 1925. </para>
          <para>As a result, over 80 items included in the Report I have just tabled involve additions to, or corrections of, the plan in respect of existing roads. </para>
          <para>There are 3 particular variations which concerned the Committee during its Inquiry and I shall make a short observation concerning each. </para>
          <para>The first variation involved the inclusion of the existing alignment of Cop pins Crossing Road which forms a link between the Belconnen and Weston Creek districts. An objection was made on the grounds that its inclusion suggested an intention to upgrade and develop the road as a formal connection between the two districts. Officers of the National Capital Development Commission assured the Committee that this was not the present intention. The purpose of the inclusion of the road on the plan was to conform with the Committee&#39;s request that existing rural roads be included. </para>
          <para>The second variation sought the modification of the existing alignment of access roads at the summit of Black Mountain. The Committee was concerned that the proposed variation might involve destruction of, or otherwise adversely affect, part of the existing nature reserve. The Committee has been assured by the Department of the Capital Territory that there will not be any interference with the reserve. On this basis, the Committee has approved the variation. Should any encroachment upon the reserve subsequently become necessary during the course of construction of the road, that matter would necessarily require a proposed variation to the City plan, and would therefore be referred to the Committee for consideration. The Committee believes this requirement provides adequate protection for the nature reserve area. </para>
          <para>The final variation to which I wish to refer involves the deletion of a section of Coorong Street between Ainslie Avenue and All am bee Street in Reid to allow for medium density development and community facilities on this location. The effect of the deletion and closure of the street would be to provide a larger development site. Objections to this proposed variation were received indicating, in particular, concern at the possible effect on traffic flow that such a closure might cause. The Committee considered the objections and has included in its Report each main point of objection and the response of the National Capital Development Commission to those points. </para>
          <para>While the Committee has agreed to recommend closure of Coorong Street to allow the development to proceed, it has also recommended that public participation in planning should be broadened by the National Capital Development Commission and the Department of the Capital Territory building up their liaison with community groups and individuals with respect to any variation which might affect those groups or individuals. The Committee believes this process is of benefit to the planners, the authorities and the local residents. </para>
          <para>The Committee has also made some observations concerning problems for public involvement in proposed variations to the plan and in respect of drafting errors on the plan. To contribute to overcoming these difficulties, the Committee has recommended that a more detailed description of each item be provided in the Schedule &#39;A&#39; to all gazetted proposals, and that the Department publish a copy of that Schedule in full as an advertisement in the Canberra Times at the same time as the Australian Government Gazette dealing with the proposed variations is published. </para>
          <para>The Committee has also recommended that the Department of the Capital Territory give final approval of the drafting of all proposed variations prior to gazettal. The Committee believes this will help to ensure that incorrectly drafted proposed variations are not submitted to the Committee for its consideration. </para>
          <para>The Committee has however, recommended to the Parliament the implementation of the 60th and 6 1st Series of proposed variations to the plan of lay-out of the City of Canberra and its environs. </para>
          <para>I commend the Report to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- by leave- The Government has decided to appoint an independent committee of inquiry to review the objectives, structure and programs of the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation. Over the last 50 years, CSIRO has earned a high reputation within Australia and overseas. This has been achieved by conducting research programs which have been predominantly of high quality and sound practicality. During these years, the executive and staff of CSIRO have made significant contributions to fundamental and applied science and sought to link the two together. They have helped us to increase our knowledge of the physical and biological environment through which we move and on which we depend. They have developed new technologies through the application of scientific principle to everyday problems. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The last major review of CSIRO was held almost 30 years ago in 1948-49. Since then, science has become increasingly diversified and the Government has come to support science and technology in a multiplicity of ways. Inevitably, the role of CSIRO has changed. It is appropriate at this time to engage in a rethinking of the objectives of CSIRO for the future- to conduct an independent examination of the ways in which the organisation&#39;s vigor, its ethos, and its capacity to deal with the challenge of the future can be sustained. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>When the Government brought down the Budget in August, the Treasurer announced that additional funds would be provided for Aboriginal affairs programs in the light of reviews then in progress. They have now been completed. </para>
          <para>These responsible and necessary reviews were prompted by allegations from many quarters that inefficient procedures and lax administration in some programs had led to waste and denial of real benefits for those whom the programs were designed to help. </para>
          <para>The fears that excessive administration costs and other expenses associated with consultants and poor planning were siphoning off- some would say &#39;ripping off&#39;- too much money were not new. This concern was expressed by the present Government when in Opposition, as well as many Aboriginal groups and organisations interested in Aboriginal welfare. </para>
          <para>Aboriginal assistance programs, as honourable members are aware, have in recent years received massive injections of funds, with each succeeding year showing ever increasing allocations in an attempt to relieve the very serious handicaps in housing, education, health and employment under which Australia&#39;s Aboriginal people suffer. </para>
          <para>The provision of large sums of money alone however, is no panacea for all the ills that beset people so disadvantaged. </para>
          <para>To think otherwise will cause people to speak of dollars only as the measure of performance when a real social value for money spent is what should be looked for. </para>
          <para>When allegations of waste in government funded programs are made it is the responsibility of government to respond and investigate them. </para>
          <para class="block">Taking into account the importance this Government attaches to Aboriginal affairs it was therefore vital that these investigations were carried out as soon as the Government came into office. I do not believe that the public by and large, objects to the principle of channeling generous amounts of money into Aboriginal assistance programs. This support has in fact been clearly demonstrated by opinion polls. But in response to this principle and any government&#39;s endeavours to uplift Aboriginals we want neither over indulgent idealism nor the over zealous pursuit of economic efficiency. The one saps Aboriginal motivation and public support, the other frustrates the will to achieve and fails to recognise the social dynamics of lifting up a down-trodden people. At the same time there is no substitute for clear direction in long term goals mutually agreed with Aboriginals and basic planning and sound administration of programs and projects to fulfil those goals. The public, whose money it is we are spending, is concerned that Aboriginal people are benefiting. Aboriginals, also, are concerned that the funds available are being spent with greatest direct benefit to their people, and not lost along the way. It was this concern that led the Government to initiate a number of reviews into various aspects of Aboriginal affairs. </para>
          <para>The most far-reaching of these reviews was that headed by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Hay. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> was appointed by the Government last January to inquire into the effectiveness of the delivery of services to Aboriginals by my Department. </para>
          <para>When I announced <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay&#39;s</inline> appointment to conduct this inquiry I said that the purpose of the examination was to ensure that the funds being made available for the Aboriginal community were being spent for the maximum benefit of Aboriginals. In view of much ill informed comment on the purpose and result of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay&#39;s</inline> inquiry it is well to recall to the House the terms of reference which were publicly announced at the time of his appointment. They were: to assess the effectiveness of the services financed; to recommend improvements in the delivery of services and their financial arrangements in the interest of Aboriginals and the community at large; and to establish whether there were any areas of waste and inefficiency. The emphasis, it will be seen, is upon the effectiveness of services delivered and the interest of Aboriginals, a conjunction which is, of course, deliberate and a reflection of the Government&#39;s obligation toward the Aboriginal people. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> completed his task and reported to the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Malcolm</inline> Fraser, on 4 June. </para>
          <para>As a result of these inquiries, the Government has taken steps to tighten administration and has acted promptly to honour its promises, repeated many times, that more funds would be provided for Aboriginal affairs during the present financial year. It is now with satisfaction I can announce the Government has decided to provide an extra $25m for Aboriginal programs this year, bringing the total available for expenditure to $ 177.6m during 1976-77. </para>
          <para>The additional money will be allocated to those programs where the greatest need has been established- in particular on urgently needed housing through grants to the States and by direct grants to Aboriginal Housing Associations and to stimulate employment opportunities. </para>
          <para>Although I have given emphasis to these 2 most crucial areas, the extra funds will be of benefit to all programs and provide room for new initiatives which are under examination. When Aboriginal organisations and communities and the States have been advised, I will be in a position to provide details of the break up of the $25m. It is no coincidence that the provision of funds for housing has come under the closest scrutiny by the Hay and other inquiries. It is understandable that the temporarily reduced funds for housing alarmed and worried many people, not least those Aboriginals in need of housing, for without adequate housing there can be only limited improvements in health, limited opportunity for children to succeed at school and limited hope of gaining regular employment. There is also little chance for the foundation of family stability and the growth of self-respect. This is the poverty cycle. To break it, housing must be provided. </para>
          <para class="block"> As one travels around Australia the thing which bears down upon you so heavily is housing and the constant reminder by the voice of the people and the sight of intolerable living conditions of the great cost to the future of what should have been done by society in the past. It is all the more important then for the Government to have the benefit of a report like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay&#39;s</inline> to provide a sound administrative foundation on which to build its liberal reform and welfare policies. In relation to the additional funds available to the States for housing it is my intention to formalise agreements with the State governments on the terms and conditions applying to their grants for Aboriginal housing programs. I am currently looking very closely at proposals on such agreements keeping in mind the desirability of directly involving Aboriginal people themselves in such programs. </para>
          <para>The decision to increase finance to Aboriginal housing associations, bears directly on the progress being made by many associations and the faith which the Government has in these programs, started under an earlier Liberal- Country Party Administration, reflecting as they do the principles of self-management and self sufficiency expressed in our Aboriginal affairs policy. To assist Aboriginals in this matter, the Department of Construction has offered its professional and technical assistance in the field particularly in remote areas- in a consultant and supervisory role to help further development of Aboriginal Housing Association programs. In the fields of employment and enterprises- other areas subjected to the closest scrutiny- additional funds will be made available to help alleviate the serious employment problems amongst Aboriginals and to support and stimulate realistic Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander enterprises which can lead to economic independence and self-reliance. </para>
          <para>In conjunction with my colleagues, the Ministers for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle),</inline> Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> and Employment and Industrial Relations <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Street),</inline> I have been studying both short and long-term measures which will be brought forward quickly for consideration by the Government including possible ways of converting the payment of unemployment benefits within communities into the funding of worthwhile work projects. These proposals will cover training for employment and the provision of job opportunities through suitable programs for Aboriginal communities especially in remote areas. The link between education and employment is possibly of greater importance to Aboriginals than others as formal education is brought more within their reach. It is a matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and I are giving special attention. One of the recommendations of the Hay Report in this field was the necessity to include training components in aid programs wherever possible in order to open up new opportunities for Aboriginals who might otherwise remain unskilled and unemployable. </para>
          <para>Although, as I have said, the 2 areas most to benefit from the additional funds are housing and employment, other smaller but important programs which have very substantial social benefits will also gain from an injection of more money this year. One such field is culture and recreation which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> found offered, for a comparatively small outlay, significant benefits to a large number of people. This decision I know will be welcomed by Aboriginal people, whose lives in many places centre around the community hall and whose social contact with other Aboriginal groups is largely through the performance of their sporting teams. The provision of funds for these purposes can be instrumental in forming the nucleus for community development and through this, self esteem. I have seen a number of examples of Aboriginal community spirit matched by government funds producing just such self-esteem and a new sense of social involvement where previously Aboriginals were out on the fringe. </para>
          <para>While speaking of community development, I would particularly mention the suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> of the compiling of &#39;community profiles&#39;. Such profiles will give the Government a better understanding of development through the totality of different&#39; programs meeting various needs in the one community. In this way, the task of assessment of success and particular requirements will be made much easier as well as contributing to the Government&#39;s determination to improve the co-ordination of operations throughout Aboriginal affairs. In working out the contents of community profiles, the family allowances received by a community will be taken into account. I should mention here that the family allowance scheme, which is estimated to provide $16m directly to Aboriginal families, is not regarded as a substitute for special Aboriginal programs. It will however have special significance for Aboriginal families. As the Prime Minister pointed out to the House on 25 August the family allowance scheme involves funds which go directly to Aboriginal families and gives them an independence and capacity to spend those funds as they believe best in their own interests. </para>
          <para>Another procedure which will contribute to the efficient and effective utilisation of funds is the Government&#39;s intention to exercise its right to inspect books of account of organisations through which its programs are carried out. This recommendation, contained in the Hay report, in no way implies that the Government intends to interfere with the autonomy of Aboriginal organisations nor does its decision to exercise this right reflect on the competence of the Aboriginal recipients of government funds. The advantages of this practice will be twofold- to provide a better and faster information flow to the Government by providing a means through which difficulties will be detected as soon as they arise, and by aiding Aboriginal people to become more confident of themselves in managerial procedures and administration as they are given more freedom and responsibility in handling programs. It will also involve Aboriginals in the budgetary process for mutual agreement on how funds are to be used. </para>
          <para>The Government has accepted the further recommendation by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> that Aboriginal recipients of government finance should make a contribution by way of cash or by voluntary effort, as a normal condition of grants. In this way there will be a commitment on both sides in a co-operative effort geared to success. The close involvement of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs in this way will also be reflected in our desire for a greater involvement by other specialised Government departments such as Social Security and Employment and Industrial Relations. I have already mentioned the willingness of the Department of Construction to act in a supervisory capacity to improve efficiency procedures in Aboriginal Housing Associations. </para>
          <para>In addition to the reviews I have mentioned which have been completed or are in progress, I have now instructed my Department to conduct a number of in-depth investigations into almost all other areas where Government funds are being spent, to better define objectives and refine administrative procedures against the background of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay&#39;s</inline> recommendations. These reviews will also ensure that funds allocated in this and future years will be used most effectively for direct benefit of Aboriginals with as little administrative outlay as efficiency permits. In now allocating $25m more for Aboriginal assistance, the Government is honoring the Treasurer&#39;s Budget undertaking. It is also sticking by its resolution to see that the money available is being wisely spent. It is as well to remind ourselves that comparing the level of funding with that provided by a previous AdministratIon in past years is of little consequence. Comparisons of funding programs from one year to the next are not necessarily of greatest importance. What needs to be considered is whether the money available has been used to optimum effect, whether there has been a re-ordering of priorities or whether improved administrative rearrangements have been achieved. An extra $3m was provided to the Aboriginal Loans Commission for housing because of the importance the Government places on home ownership; grants-in-aid to the States for health and education programs were reduced and grants to Aboriginal organisations working in these fields increased because of our commitment to working through Aboriginal organisations; an extra $ 1.56m was provided for employment support programs which will enable funding support of a new initiative in placing Aboriginals with private employers; the Aboriginal Advancement Trust </para>
          <para class="block">Account was abolished in favour of normal line item appropriations and funding of some programs was transferred elsewhere, such as publications through Aboriginal Arts Board now under the Arts Council. What is important, I can assure you, is the intention of this Government to see that Aboriginal affairs programs directly relate to Aboriginal needs while increasing the involvement of Aboriginals in the concept of self-management. </para>
          <para>Sound administration of any Government program requires ongoing reviews and evaluations. The first and most extensive of these reviews has been that conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr David</inline> Hay. The Government was fortunate in securing the services of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> who has a distinguished record as a diplomat and as Administrator of the Territory of Papua New Guinea from 1967 to 1973. The Government is indebted to him for his diligence and for the sensitivity and understanding he displayed in his conduct of the inquiry. I also wish to recognise, as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> has done in his report, the efficiency and dedication demonstrated by officers of my Department in assisting him during this period of intensive review. Also I would like to express my appreciation of the cooperation which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay</inline> also acknowledged of numerous other people involved in supplying information on which the report is based. Important among these are Aboriginal organisations and communities. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hay&#39;s</inline>report and the reviews I have instituted are major steps forward fulfilling the commitment in the Government&#39;s Aboriginal affairs policy statement to &#39;demolish unnecessary political barriers between Aboriginals and the programs intended to assist them towards self management&#39;. On 26 August I was bold enough to say that it was a time for optimism not gloom in Aboriginal Affairs. So it is and so it will continue to be under the present Government. A firm foundation has been laid upon which to go forward. In August, the Prime Minister told this House that the Government would make a decision as to whether the Hay report should be published when reviews were complete and action had been taken on what additional funds would be provided on the basis of those reviews. </para>

          <para class="block">In order to co-operate with the Government in dealing with a number of papers before the adjournment of the Senate I should like to make a couple of remarks now but I should like to continue my remarks at a later stage. The Hay report has been widely distributed since 12 June this year. It has now become an official document and I think it bears out statements I have made in this chamber previously that it was a report that the Government could not afford to introduce before the Budget was brought down in the current sessional period of Parliament. There was an obvious desire on behalf of the Government to blame the Aboriginal people for the miss pending of funds when, in fact, the Hay report clearly indicates that it was not the Aboriginal people but certain sections of the bureaucracy consultants and others- who had done, to use a slang phrase, the financial rip-off. The previous statement of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> that $25m in additional funds would be made available is an apology to the Aboriginal people of Australia and an apology to the vast section of the Australian electorate which believes that the funds should not have been cut off. It will be a year before many of these things start operating again. There is not enough clarity in the statement as to how the money will be spent or the fields in which it will be spent. The housing associations and the building program, in particular, may take a year to get off the ground again as a result of the sudden cut in funding. I believe that both the report and the statement ought to be the subject of a major debate in this chamber. I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later date. </para>

          </para>
          <para>The Government has today taken decisions to enable more expeditious handling of Lebanese migration to Australia. The Government has taken its decisions in circumstances where there is no immediate prospect of an end to the conflict within the Lebanon and there is thus a long-term migration situation of probably increasing dimensions. After it became necessary to evacuate the Australian Embassy in Beirut late in March 1976, special arrangements were introduced to facilitate processing of applications from Lebanese at Australian posts in nearby countries. The normal immigration criteria were relaxed for Lebanese who had suffered hardship as a result of the conflict within the Lebanon. As from the end of June our Lebanese migration operations were centred in Nicosia in Cyprus and there are now 3 Australia-based migration officers and 7 locally-engaged staff operating through our Nicosia office. They have to handle the large volume of Lebanese migration as well as a workload in relation to Cypriot migration. </para>
          <para>The numbers of applications and nominations for Lebanese to come to Australia have continued to increase. By way of example, applications received in Nicosia totalled 247 in June, 1076 in July and 1 149 in August. In the first three weeks of September 579 applications were received in Nicosia at a time when the inflow of Lebanese had been regulated by the Cypriot authorities and there had been bad weather in the area restricting entrance to Cyprus by sea. On 9 September 1976 I announced initiatives to speed up the processing of nominations submitted in Australia for close relatives from the Lebanon of Australian residents to come to Australia. Special projects have been undertaken in close and continuing association with the Lebanese communities in Sydney and Melbourne for representatives to travel overseas to arrange for group movements to Australia of those accepted. Those initiatives were in line with the Government&#39;s continuing concern to effect the reunion of close family relatives overseas with Lebanese residents in Australia. </para>
          <para>The scale of Lebanese migration is demonstrated by the fact that under the special project up to 22 September 1976 nominations received in Sydney and Melbourne covered totals of 2 129 and 392 persons respectively. It is anticipated that another 1000 persons will be nominated in Sydney. It is likely, therefore, that there will be a substantial increase in the numbers of Lebanese arriving in Australia in the near future. In the period from 1 January to 17 September 1976 more than 2600 Lebanese have been issued with visas for entry to Australia. In the period 1 January to 30 August 1976, 1324 persons showing Lebanon as their country of last residence arrived in Australia. In view of the escalating workload associated with processing applications and nominations in Nicosia, a senior officer of the Central Office of my Department was sent to Nicosia on 4 September 1976 to report on the most effective way of organising our operation in Cyprus. The decisions taken by the Government today were based in part on the recommendations in his reports. </para>
          <para>An important consideration affecting the decisions taken has been the increasing problems caused by the large number of Lebanese within Cyprus. There are at present about some 8000 persons from the Lebanon in Cyprus and this situation is causing a range of problems for both the Lebanese people themselves and the people and authorities of Cyprus. It is important that delays in processing potential Lebanese migrants from Cyprus be kept to a minimum. Accordingly the Government today has approved the sending of a task force of experienced officers to Cyprus as a matter of urgency to handle nominations and applications for migration to Australia. With the arrival of the task force there will be nine Australia-based officers in Cyprus, including a medical officer, so that medical examinations can be completed quickly on the spot. The Australiabased officers will be supplemented by locally engaged staff including interpreters. The task force will remain in Cyprus for 3 months and the special immigration operation in Nicosia will then be reviewed. My Department&#39;s officers on the spot have been making a Herculean effort to cope with the situation. They have been working more than 12 hours a day but the number of unresolved applications and nominations has continued to mount. The task force will enable the backlog to be cleared quickly. </para>
          <para>The Government has also decided to define more clearly those persons normally resident in the Lebanon who are eligible to migrate to Australia under the present circumstances. This will assist Australian residents in deciding whether to nominate their close relatives overseas and will also enable the Cypriot authorities to determine whether individual Lebanese should be allowed to enter Cyprus for the purpose of migration to Australia. As from 1 October 1976 the following persons normally resident in the Lebanon will be eligible to come to Australia, after meeting normal health and character requirements: Spouses and dependent children of Australian residents: Parents, both aged and dependent and those who are non dependent and of working age, of Australian residents; nominated brothers and sisters of Australian residents; persons eligible under the normal acceptable occupations list. The dependants of persons in the above groups, where appropriate, will also be eligible. These criteria will apply until the end of this year and then be reviewed. In order to ensure that those Lebanese accepted move quickly from Cyprus thus allowing others to enter Cyprus for processing without causing increasing pressures in that country, it has been decided that visas issued to Lebanese from 1 October 1976 be valid for 3 months. A new requirement is to be introduced to apply generally, that is, to persons of any nationality, that persons must be permanent residents for a minimum of one year before being eligible to nominate persons overseas for migration to Australia. This requirement will not apply to nominations of spouses and dependent children. </para>
          <para>In the current circumstances of high levels of unemployment in Australia there may be employment difficulties for Lebanese migrants, many of whom are unskilled or semi-skilled. I shall be consulting with the Lebanese communities to enlist their support in ensuring the successful resettlement of their relatives in Australia. This consultation will cover means whereby the Lebanese communities themselves can assume wider responsibilities for post arrival resettlement of their relatives. The action I have announced tonight is a clear testimony to the desire of the Government to deal humanely and effectively with the unfortunate circumstances in which so many Lebanese relatives of Australian residents now find themselves. It will mean added pressures on Australian services in the short term but the inconvenience and difficulties these involve must be seen against the situation of continuing despair and personal hardship which these people face. </para>

            <para class="block">That the Senate take note of the statement. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I think that the statement, which we have all perused, bears out Professor Barrie &#39;s contention that Australia and New Zealand will find in the immediate and, I suppose, the distant future every time there is a brush fire war in some part of the world we will be the main recipients of migrants and we will have to meet that responsibility. I do not think it is a question of disputing the contents of the report. I simply say that perhaps it has limitations. I fear that successive governments over at least the last 5 years have looked at an intake of 5 000 people a year for specific refugee categories. Unfortunately, each of these upheavals gets worse than the one before it. The magnitude of the civil war in Lebanon far exceeds that of Cyprus, which in itself was quite big. I hope that without waiting until next year we will get interim reports from the Government on the more or less 5 000 refugees a year we take and how we will rationalise this intake as between Lebanese and people from a host of other countries, some of which already have turmoil and others which could be on the verge of it. </para>
          <para>Another point I make- I think it is important to the Lebanese community, and the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> will appreciate it- is that on page 1 of the report a lot of emphasis is placed upon the provision of additional officers in Cyprus. That is good, but I think anyone would know that there are other Lebanese who find themselves in Syria and in Egypt. A number have surfaced even in Western Europe. I believe that we ought to have been a little more specific. I think we should prepare a master list based on information provided by people in Australia who sponsor refugees who are waiting in Syria or Egypt, or even those who might have gone into other parts of Europe away from Greece or Cyprus. I have not been able to obtain this information. Is there such a master list? </para>
          <para>I refer to the Nicosia scene. I have received criticism to the effect that the big difficulty is that when refugees arrive at the refugee offices they might be there for a week or longer before they are actually interviewed. I know the magnitude of this problem from when a member of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bishop&#39;s</inline> staff was in Cyprus. I strongly suggest to the Minister that when a person arrives in an area like that he should be given some acknowledgement a disc or something- so that he may maintain his turn in queue. I think it is a simple matter. I have heard people say: &#39;My brother has been there for 3 weeks. He has been told to come back again. &#39; I emphasise that I am not critical of the officers there. I know the difficulty of their position. This is rather akin to an outpatient ward in a hospital where the hospital tries to treat the patients in order by noting their arrival. I make those constructive suggestions to the Minister confident that the time is not far distant when we will be able to have quarterly statements dealing with this refugee problem. </para>
          <para>Finally, I think we should not be unaware of the fact that as Canada and Australia are bearing the brunt of this humanitarian work we might have a good look at whether we are getting value for our money as far as the United Nations Refugee Commission is concerned. The Commission was very lax in relation to interim billeting in Cypress, as the Minister indicated in an answer she gave me. There are one or two other areas of the globe where the Commission has done very little. It has been very slothful. I believe that some of these United Nations agencies are suffering from hardening of the arteries. If Australia and Canada are rightly part of what has been called the New World meeting the full impact of the refugees we should have a bigger say in the determination of the United Nations Refugee Commission &#39;s policy. </para>

            <para>- It is not my practice to delay the proceedings of the Senate by speaking on the adjournment motion unless I think there is something of some considerable importance that ought to be raised. I believe that this is the case this evening. With other members of the Australian Parliament I was recently in India for a period of approximately a week. Certain episodes which were drawn to my attention while I was in that country and subsequently are such that I believe they should be raised within this Parliament. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I wish to say first of all that I was there as a guest of the Government of India and was treated with the greatest courtesy and consideration while I was in that country. Certainly no hindrances were placed in my way in doing anything that I wished to do while I was within India. I certainly feel very great reluctance in accepting the hospitality, as I did, of another country and immediately after having received that hospitality being critical of the Government which was my host while I was in that country. But I feel obliged to do so on this occasion. </para>
          <para>I might say in passing that I have always regarded myself as a friend of India. I believe that India is a great country with great traditions. I think that particularly over the past 30 years during which India has had its independence it has been one of the great bastions of the democratic system. That India, the second largest country in the world in terms of population, a country with some 600 million inhabitants, a country with almost every difficulty that could beset any country, a country of endemic poverty and vast problems of over-population, with terrible problems of differences of religion, ethnic origin, caste and language, has been able not only to stay together as a nation in a peaceful way which I think would be a model to many other countries where the sectarian differences are much smaller than they are in India but where there has been much greater violence, has been a great credit to the Indian people and to the governments which have been in office in India during that period. </para>
          <para>Certainly any criticisms that I have to make now would not be to the effect that the Government of India is engaging in any racial or religious persecution. I imagine that there is no Moslem in India who could complain about his treatment by the Government of that country. Certainly the same could be said, I believe, of any of the other smaller religious groups. I have heard no complaints of persecution from Christians in India, or from Parsees, Jains, Buddhists or any of the other religious denominations which are to be found in that country. In fact, I believe that the Indian Government has leaned over backwards to show that it will not discriminate against people whatever their origin. Anglo Indians, Eurasians or anybody else, I believe, cannot say that they have been discriminated against. In fact, even if we take a small community such as the Jewish community, we find that there are about 4 synagogues at the present time in Bombay. Although India has generally supported the Arab position on the Middle East, no one can claim that there has been any interference with the rights of the Jewish inhabitants of India. In fact General Jacobs, who commanded the Indian troops in the recent war in Bangladesh, is Jewish. </para>
          <para>I would not suggest for one moment that in any way the Indian Government is departing from any of those high principles which it has followed while it has been in office. What I would suggest to the Senate is that something very serious is happening in India, that is, that there is a very steady erosion of the democratic parliamentary system within that country. I do not believe that the progression in this unfortunate direction has as yet reached the stage where India could be condemned by comparison with a great many other countries. Certainly if India were compared with China or the Soviet Union or, for that matter, with its neighbour Pakistan or with the Philippines or Spain or most of the countries in Latin America, India indeed is a very democratic country and it probably still ranks amongst the most democratic countries in the world. </para>
          <para>What is tragic about India is that the tendency is away from parliamentary democracy and the rule of law. For that reason I believe it is doubly tragic. What makes it even more tragic is that </para>
          <para class="block">India, this great country, has been the example which democrats throughout the world have been able to quote to those who have said that it is only a few rich people in Sweden, New Zealand, Canada or Switzerland who can afford to have the parliamentary democratic system and that as long as there are real economic and communal difficulties democracy does not work. I believe India has shown that it could work. Although the rate of progress towards economic justice has undoubtedly been very slow and there are very many poor people and very many underprivileged people in that country, progress has been made and that progress has been made within a democratic system. In the past year, since 26 June 1975 when the emergency was proclaimed by the Indian Government, I believe it is becoming increasingly the case that one can no longer make the same boast about Indian democracy that one could make previously. </para>
          <para>While we were in India where, as I have said, we were treated with the greatest courtesy, we were given quite a considerable amount of time with the Indian Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Gandhi,</inline> a person for whom in the past I think all of us have had the greatest respect. </para>
          <para>When I met her, I raised with her the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr George</inline> Fernandes,  chairman  of the Indian Socialist Party and  president  of the All-India Railwaymen &#39;s Association. I do not intend to dwell on the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fernandes</inline> because I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa</inline> wishes to say something about this matter also. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fernandes</inline> is today before the court. I am concerned about the case of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fernandes.</inline> I do not know whether the allegations that he was carrying explosives or conspiring with people to set off explosives are true or false. I have no idea. I have never met him. But these allegations have now been made against him. Other allegations have been made against him as well. I believe that this is what is very serious. For example, in a report from the <inline font-style="italic">Times of India</inline> of 25 September, it is mentioned in the course of the charges which were being laid against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fernandes</inline> in the New Delhi Chief Magistrate&#39;s Court that, amongst the acts which should apparently be regarded as offensive to the Government and people of India was the fact that a certain person had been secretly carrying abroad with him letters from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fernandes</inline> addressed to some foreign dignitaries and organisations like the Socialist International seeking their help and support. </para>
          <para>It seems to me that the very fact that a matter such as that is raised at all in the course of a charge being heard against a man for a criminal offence, shows already a most serious tendency within that country. Why should not the  chairman  of the Indian Socialist Party communicate messages to Willy Brandt or Bruno Kreisky or the general secretary of the Socialist International, the party with which his party is affiliated and with which the Australian Labor Party is affiliated also.  His  is not the only case which gives grounds for concern. If I may say so- I say this with the greatest respect- I did not receive a satisfactory reply from <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Gandhi</inline> to the matter which I raised with her regarding <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fernandes.</inline></para>
          <para>I have just recently received a letter which was written by Lord Fenner Brock way, a Labor member of the British House of Lords, a man who for many years advocated freedom for India. He has raised the matter of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr M.</inline> S. Hod a; a symbolical, to use Lord Fenner Brock way&#39;s word. Lord Fenner Brockway said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoda</inline> was the secretary of the International Transport Workers Federation and representative in Britain of the Socialist Party of India. He had done noteworthy constructive social work in India and had strongly supported Indira Gandhi in the past. Lord Fenner Brock way went on to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hoda&#39;s</inline> duties required him to travel abroad but the Indian Government had impounded his passport apparently because he had been active in Britain on behalf of the prisoners in India. That is one more example. </para>
          <para>At the present time there are approximately 30 members of the National Parliament of India being held in prison under the emergency. Those imprisoned cover a whole gamut of political parties, from the Swatantra Party, the conservative private enterprise party; through the Jana Sangh, a very right-wing Hindu communal party; through the Socialist Party of India; through the Congress (O)- the Congress Party (Organisation), the Opposition Congress Partythrough to the Communist Party (Marxist), a party which broke with the Soviet Union some years ago. The only political parties which are supporting the Congress Party of the Government in the actions that it is taking are the Communist Party of India, the pro-Moscow Communist Party- without trying to judge why it is doing these things, I would imagine that the foreign policy interests of the Soviet Union would play some part in it- and the Moslem League, a small communal party representing the Moslems who apparently, for whatever reason, do not wish to become involved in a serious disagreement with the Government. All of the other major political parties and movements, including the bulk of the trade union movement in India, are opposed to the present action which is being taken by the Indian Government. </para>
          <para>Amongst those people who are being detained or who have been detained under the emergency some have been released from time to time- are one of Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s closest collaborators, a former  Deputy  Prime Minister of India, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Morarji</inline> Desai, who is at present still in detention; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Basu,</inline> the  Chairman  of the Communist Party of India (Marxist)- honourable senators can see that those imprisoned cover a wide range of political views because <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Desai</inline> was quite a conservative Indian nationalist members of the Socialist Party; <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Modi</inline> of the Swatantra Party and members of practically every other Opposition party. There are many thousands of people at present being held in India under the detention provisions of the emergency. </para>
          <para>A Bill is now before the Parliament to amend the Constitution of India. I do not wish to go into great detail on this matter, but there are two or three very significant provisions in this Bill. The first, but perhaps the least important although very important indeed, is that the right will be taken away from the Supreme Court of India to adjudicate on matters relating to amendments to the Indian Constitution. There will be no judicial authority to supervise the validity of consti.tutional amendments insofar as they deal with the basic human rights which have been guaranteed in the past within the Indian Constitution. . Another proposal is to the effect that the  President  of India- another constitutional amendment makes it clear that the  President  of India can act only on the advice of the Government of India- can amend the Constitution for a period of 2 years; that is to say, for all intents and purposes the executive government has the right to amend the Constitution. Another very important provision is that in the event of a state of emergency being imposed- either any future state of emergency or the current state of emergency there will be no recourse to the courts with regard to the preservation of the basic human rights which in the past have been guaranteed within the Indian Constitution, which have been one of the bulwarks of the Indian Constitution and which, I would suggest, has been one of the reasons why in India in the past there has been such tolerance and such harmony, when we consider the difficulties between the various communal groups within that country. </para>
          <para>I do not wish to insult and deride the Indian Government, but I do believe that those people who believe in the democratic system, people who are not enemies of India, should make it clear to India that we are very seriously disturbed about what is happening in that country. Already, a number of people and organisations I would name the Socialist International itself- have protested about the treatment of the Indian Socialist Party in particular but of other political parties in general. There have been protests from other people. Recently a group of leading West Germans including Guenther Grass, the German novelist, and Max Frisch, the Swiss novelist who has been a leading fighter for civil liberties both in Eastern Europe and Western Europe, have conveyed their protests to the Indian Government. I believe that we have an obligation to do the same. </para>
          <para>The argument has been put forward that the emergency is&#39; necessary because of the desperate conditions which at present prevail in India. I believe that this claim can be refuted by the fact that in the past in India when there were wars on two occasions with Pakistan and on another occasion with China, the Indian Government never found it necessary to impose any emergency. I believe that there are other domestic reasons relating to the insecurity of the present Government in India, primarily as a result of the recent Gujarat State elections in India in which the Indian Government Party was badly defeated by the Opposition parties which has led it to believe that there were some prospects of its being defeated in the coming elections for the National Parliament. Therefore they want to prevent that happening by imposing an emergency, by delaying the elections and by amending the Constitution. Also this action has been taken to overcome a decision which was taken by the Supreme Court of India- rightly or wrongly I do not know- that the Prime Minister of India was not eligible, in effect, to continue in the office of Prime Minister. I think that the actions that she has subsequently taken were a very severe blow to the democratic system in that country by her not accepting the decision of the court on this matter. I believe that this action in itself has assisted in the undermining of democracy in India. I wish to prolong the matter no further, only to say that what is happening in India is causing great distress to democratic people throughout the world. As has been seen in other countries, once you start off on the road of taking away the constitutional rights of people by whittling down democracy it is usually an unending process. It goes on and on until there is no democracy left at all. </para>
          <para>I would like to conclude by quoting from a statement which was issued by the National </para>
          <para class="block">Committee for Review of the Constitution, a group of members of the various opposition parries in India. I believe these words are most pertinent to the situation. It states: </para>

            <para>It is well known that the emergency provisions of the Weimar Constitution were misused in Germany by Hitler to establish his personal dictatorship. When the Constitution of India was drafted, it was perhaps never envisaged that emergency would become a constant feature of the national life and the safeguard against the abuse of emergency powers would be nullified by a systematic erosion of checks and balances provided in the Constitution such as a free press, judicial review and fundamental rights. Exercise of emergency powers particularly during the last one year has demonstrated the need for a thorough review of the emergency provisions so as to provide effective safeguards to protect the interests of the people against arbitrary and oppressive actions of the executive. </para>

          <para class="block">That is the Committee that made the recommendations regarding the constitutional amendments- are calculated to emasculate the concept of checks and balances in respect of the exercise of executive authority by seriously diminishing the scope of judicial review. It is not difficult to envisage that once the powers of independent courts are eliminated <inline font-style="italic">from</inline> such a vital- field as elections, the very concept of free and fair elections would disappear and peoples&#34; right to govern themselves would be seriously compromised. </para>
          <para class="block">Elections have been promised by. the Government, but as they will be held, so it seems, during the state of emergency, it will be an offence for people to comment on the emergency during their candidature. Through the censorship it will not be possible for reports of Opposition speeches to be circulated throughout the country. Opposition members will be able to hold meetings but only in halls of a limited size where a very small number of people in a country of 600 million will ever be able to hear what the Opposition is saying. I am not suggesting that we should engage in violent abuse of India, but I believe that members of this Parliament, by whatever means they have available, should make it clear to the Indian Government and its representatives that we are disturbed about what is happening there; that we are alarmed by the fact that democracy appears to be in the process of being destroyed in India. At the same time we should express to them the hope that the very high regard all democratic people have held for India over the last 30 years will not be destroyed by the arbitrary actions which have been taken over the past year. It is not yet too late. In a year&#39;s time, if the present process continues, it well could be too late. </para>

            <para>- I support the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> tonight. I want to speak about the trial of George Fernandes that started in India today. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> said, George Fernandes is  Chairman  of the Socialist Party of India and he is also the National Secretary of the Indian Railway Workers union. It is very important to point out at this time that in all the period Fernandes has been in gaol the Indian Railway Workers Union has refused to appoint anybody as National Secretary in his place. This is the esteem in which he is held by the men with whom he used to work. He has been charged by the Indian Government with anti-national activities. He appeared in court today in chains. He has also been charged with sabotage and on other counts that really amount to sedition. The matter of Fernandes &#39;s imprisonment and trial is of concern to many members of the Senate, especially those of us who have just returned from the visit to India about which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> just spoke. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> said, we raised this question with <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Gandhi.</inline> Whilst she spent a great deal of time with our delegation- in fact, over one hour- her answers about Fernandes were unsatisfactory as far as we were concerned. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The treatment of George Fernandes &#39;s mother and his brothers is also something that should concern us all. I have a letter dated 24 May from the mother of George Fernandes to the  President  of India which sets out the sort of treatment that she and her 2 sons received while the Indian police were looking for George Fernandes. It ought to be pointed out at this stage that the mother and the 2 brothers- a catholic family from Kerala have had nothing to do with the career of George Fernandes but they have suffered, and suffered very badly, at the hands of the Indian police. I seek leave to have this letter incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Ilansard</inline></para>

            <para>It is with a heavy he an that I am writing this letter with the hope of obtaining justice at your hands. I am 65 years and my 75 year old husband is a heart patient. My third son Michael Fernandes has been detained under the Isa since December, 1975. </para>
            <para>On Saturday May 1, about 9 p.m. my 44 year old second son Lawrence Fernandes,  was taken away from our residence by the Police. They began questioning him about the whereabouts of my eldest son George Fernandes and then subjected him in a most inhuman, reckless and ruthless manner to third degree methods of physical torture. Besides beating him with clubs (until five of them were broken to pieces) they used a banyan tree root to clout him with and booted him and slapped him. They threatened that if he did not reveal the whereabouts of George Fernandes he would be thrown on the Railway tracks and killed under a moving train leaving no evidence of their hand in his death. After thus reducing him to a condition of a physical and nervous wreck, he was kept in a solitary confinement in different police lockups in the most unhygienic condition until May 20 during which period he was subjected to further torture and interrogation. He was kept without food for three days, and was not give proper food on other days, nor allowed cigarettes. During all these 20 days he was allowed bath only on three days and made to remain in the same clothes in which he was when he was taken away on May 1 . He had become unconscious as a result of this inhuman treatment. He was taken to different doctors and hospitals, each time under a different and false name impersonating him as a Police Officer for treatment to keep him alive. On one night a doctor was brought to the Police Station itself for treating him. </para>
          <para>On May 9, my son was taken by police car to Davangere and on May 10 produced before the Magistrate as though arrested in Davangere on the previous day. </para>
          <para>He was continuously interrogated, refused lawyer&#39;s help and not allowed to contact home. He was threatened with dire consequences if he reported to the Magistrate about the torture. Finally on May 20 he was produced in the 2nd Metropolitan Magistrate&#39;s Chambers during lunch time and then removed to the Bangalore Central Prison where he was detained in a cell meant for condemned criminals. </para>
          <para>The whereabouts of my son Lawrence had not been informed to us. On May 20 upon being informed by a lawyer, I went to the prison with the lawyer but was not allowed to meet my son. On the 2 1 st after waiting for over three hours I was taken to the cell to see him but not the lawyer. I found him looking dead. He was unable to move except without two persons helping him about and then too with great pain and limping. His left side is crippled and is unable to talk freely without faltering; he has lost at least 20 kg during these 20 days. </para>
          <para>Yet another page was added to this act by serving on him on May 22 an order of detention under MISA, which also he been kept in the same cell. </para>
          <para>Are my two sons being held hostage for George Fernandes whose whereabouts or condition my entire family is totally unaware of? Is it morally right that my family should be so harassed and tormented for the political views held by my son George Fernandes&#39; </para>
          <para>Whatever I have stated here is on the basis of what the family could gather from Lawrence during the visits to him in the cell. For obvious reasons it is not quite exhaustive. I urge you in the name of all that is good in civilised conduct of human beings and their Governments, and in the name of justice to order a thorough judicial inquiry into this barbaric torture etc. and take suitable action against the concerned authorities. </para>
          <para>I also urge that he should be transferred to a good hospital and specialist medical and psychiatric treatment be given to him and daily visits to him by the family allowed so that he may regain his mental and physical health and become a human being. </para>

            <para>- Fernandes &#39;s trial begins today. We found out when we were in India that the Government plans to call 257 witnesses to press its case against Fernandes. It would appear that the Government is determined to prosecute him successfully. I believe, and I know <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> share my point of view, that this case will be a litmus test for civil liberties in India. I believe we should be watching a number of things. We should be watching the extent to which Fernandes is allowed access to legal advice even though <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs Gandhi</inline> told us that he will be able to get legal advice from overseas. We ought to be looking at whether or not he is able to call his defence witnesses freely. We ought to be looking at the capacity or lack of capacity on the part of the Press to report the trial proceedings. I point out that the <inline font-style="italic">Indian Express,</inline> a newspaper that we were all reading less than a fortnight ago, has today been closed down. The charge against the <inline font-style="italic">Indian Express</inline> is that its rates were not paid. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
		  <para>We ought to look at the conduct of -the prosecution, the credibility of the witnesses, the objectivity of the court, the final verdict and the grounds for reaching that verdict. In short, I believe that Indian democratic freedoms are in the dock with George Fernandes today. All those committed to democratic principles in this Parliament should be concerned about it. At a time when Amnesty International identifies abuse of basic human rights in 1 12 countries- India is one of those countries- all Australians should be watching the current situation in India. Should Fernandes be convicted, I believe it will be another stage reached in the erosion of civil liberties in that country. </para>
          <para>I hope that the Minister for Foreign Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Peacock)</inline> will take a moral stand on the Fernandes case and will press the Indian Government for his early and unconditional release from detention. I also believe that all senators should hope that the Indian state of emergency will be lifted, that freedom of the Press, freedom of speech and freedom of assembly and association will be restored and that the national elections that are set down for February 1977 will take place. </para>

            <para>- I would also like to say a few words on the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon.</inline> As I did not know the matter was to be raised tonight, I am afraid my contribution must be expressions without much consideration. I think all in this Parliament have been concerned in general for a year now about what is happening to what was one of the most important democracies in the world- India. I recall discussing with the head of Amnesty International only a few weeks ago while I was in the Soviet Union the situation in which people who believe in democracy in that country found themselves. The point was made to me that in fact they may be a very small minority in the Soviet Union but also that those who believe in democratic rights are now in a minority in the world. We in the world in that category are in a minority now and therefore there is more need for us to raise our voice when we see another country unfortunately removing itself from the democratic process. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I believe that all members, particularly those in the Amnesty organisation in this Parliament, have been concerned for some considerable time at what is obviously a train of events which we have seen time and again in other countries. We see it happening in India. Perhaps one should emphasise the fact that the right of free speech and the right of the Press in India- it was an important and valuable Press- are being quickly taken away from the Indian people. It is clear that in a country of that size the opportunity the Press was able to give of expressing all kinds of different views- political, religious and otherwise is terribly vital to the people of that country. Obviously it is a matter which is under complete challenge. </para>
          <para>I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon</inline> on raising this matter tonight in the calm and sensible way in which he has done. He is quite right in saying that no good is to be served by our berating the Indians at this time. It is important that we press them firmly though, pointing out what was possible, what were the traditions under which that country was formed, and what were those things which its first leaders regarded as vital to the Indian people. I think it is important that those of us who live in a part of the world where democracy continues should be making a lot of noise constructive noise- and getting in touch with India and other countries in which this retreat from democracy is taking place. Therefore, as one Government senator representing, I believe,, the views of most honourable senators on this side of the chamber, I join in saying that these matters are well raised tonight by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wheeldon.</inline> I hope that we will be quite active in our fight for democracy in India. </para>

            <para>- In the House of Representatives on 18 February last, the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> answered a question without notice from the Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam.</inline> The Prime Minister, in his answer, stated that the Government had not at that time determined its attitude to the report of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament. During the course of his reply, the Prime Minister did mention that, as a result of the recommendations of the Joint Committee, all Ministers had been asked to make declarations of their pecuniary interests to him. He also stated that all ministerial staff had made, or were in the process of making, similar declarations to the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers).</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I take the time of the Senate this evening to urge the Government to take immediate steps to implement the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests. Those involved in the political life of this nation seem always to have been regarded as something less than honest. To my mind, this conclusion is patently incorrect for an overwhelming number of members of Parliament. Nevertheless, the editorial writer of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 3 September this year, succinctly outlined what a serious and sensitive area this is. In part, the editorial on that day read as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>No members of any Australian Parliament will be safe from the more unsavoury kind of innuendo that links their political business with financial pleasure until a code of conduct is set down, backed up with rules of disclosure and reinforced by stiff penalties for offenders. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">One of the most notable facts about politics in Australia in recent times has been the steady, progressive decline in citizen confidence in their institutions of government in general, and in the Parliament in particular. This decline in confidence is freely discussed in the Press, is the subject of lectures in government at our universities, and is accepted by most, if not all of us, in the Parliament. Yet remedial action has been slow in coming. I am certain that a most important step in the restoration of public confidence is for Parliament to enact enforceable legislation requiring public disclosure of financial holdings and assets of members of Parliament, their staff and other office holders. </para>
          <para>The New South Wales Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran,</inline> announced on 1 September that he would later this year, or early next year, introduce legislation requiring members of the New South Wales Parliament to reveal their pecuniary interests. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran&#39;s</inline> statement has been greeted with satisfaction by all those who were appalled by recent revelations in the New South Wales Parliament concerning the incomes of Ministers in the previous Liberal-Country Party Government in that State from their milk quotas. Soon after <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran&#39;s</inline> announcement, the Victorian Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer,</inline> revealed that he would like to establish a code of business conduct for members of the Victorian Parliament. </para>
          <para>I do not intend to debate the relative merits of the different approaches adopted by these 2 States. Nevertheless, I do contend that both <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> are to be commended for taking action in this important sphere. One consequence of the separate announcements of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wran</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hamer</inline> has been to underline the Federal Government&#39;s inaction. It is not satisfactory to demand that Ministers merely make declarations to the Prime Minister and that ministerial staff make similar declarations to the Minister for Administrative Services. It is to be hoped that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fraser,</inline> following his reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Whitlam</inline> on 18 February, has sought to reach a decision on the Government&#39;s attitude to all the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Pecuniary Interests. After all, this Committee was drawn from both sides of both Houses of this Parliament. It is worth reminding members that the Committee&#39;s report, tabled in this House almost one year ago, was the result of a unanimous decision of the members of that Committee. </para>
          <para>There is a greater onus on the Federal Government than simply to make its intentions clear. It is equally as important for the Government to set the lead to those States of Australia which have neglected to come to grips with the very real problem which confronts members of Parliament- the problem of conflict of interest. In particular, I urge the Government not only to set an example by preparing and passing through the national Parliament suitable legislation, but also to use its considerable influence to have the Queensland Government introduce similar legislation. </para>
          <para>All honourable senators will be aware of the claims regarding conflict of interest involving Ministers in the Queensland Government. These claims abound and, although some have been proved beyond doubt, they are almost unbelievable in their audacity. </para>
          <para>Undoubtedly, the most celebrated case involved the revelation in 1970 that 6 Queensland Cabinet Ministers had received handouts of preferential shares from Comalco. Years later, in an interview with David Frost, the Queensland Premier, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen,</inline> confided that, when matters in which a Queensland Government Minister had a pecuniary interest came before Cabinet, that Minister left the Cabinet room and did not take pan in the discussion. Thus, when an issue involving Comalco comes before the Queensland Cabinet, a most peculiar situation must prevail. Obviously, many members of the Cabinet would be obliged to leave the room and wait outside whilst the matter was discussed by the remainder of their Cabinet colleagues. </para>
          <para>Allegations and counter-allegations about the pecuniary interests of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> have continually surfaced throughout his term as Premier of Queensland. Many of these allegations have involved mining ventures in which the Queensland Premier has held an interest, including Email (No Liability) and Artesian Basin OU Co. Pty Ltd. These issues are a matter of public record and have been discussed at length in Parliament and in the media. No doubt people have made up their own minds by now on the integrity or lack of integrity of the Queensland Premier with respect to his business dealings. </para>
          <para>Some honourable senators may wonder why I would tonight raise the name of the Queensland Premier. I do so because I have been prompted to speak on this occasion on the need for urgent action on the Joint Committee report by what I consider to be an appalling situation that currently exists in the State of Queensland. About 2 months ago, I became aware of details which I shall outline to the Senate this evening. I do admit that, for reasons which will soon become clear, I have until now been reluctant to raise the matter in this place. I am led to believe that a number of newspapers and other media outlets wanted to report the matter. Facts about the details I am about to outline were made known at the National Party conference in Cairns in July this year. I have been informed that the Premier&#39;s Press Officer, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Allen</inline> Callaghan, threatened the Press that if it reported the details it would face libel action. After I speak tonight, that threat, of course, will have no force at all. </para>
          <para>Since I became aware of the matter, which involves a stunning conflict of interest on the part of the Queensland Premier, some mention of it has been made elsewhere, despite the threats of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Callaghan.</inline> The matter was featured in an article by Robert Cameron and Marian Wilkinson in the <inline font-style="italic">Nation Review</inline> on 3 September 1976, and also in a pamphlet which has been circulating in Brisbane. Nevertheless, let me state that I wanted to be certain of my facts before mentioning the matter in this chamber. I am extremely conscious of the fact that any criticism I make of the Queensland Premier could be construed simply as an attempt by me to score political points against him, given his treatment of my nomination to succeed the late Bertie Milliner in this place. It is well known how <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> supported an unwarranted attack on my character at the time of the casual vacancy in 1975. This, however, did not affect my objectivity. </para>
          <para>My criticism of the Premier tonight is by no means an attempt to play politics. The issue I am about to outline is far too serious for that. The facts that I shall now recount provide the strongest impetus I have yet heard for legislative action, not only in Queensland but in the Federal </para>
          <para class="block">Parliament to guard against an apparent conflict of interests on the part of political leaders of this country. The facts which I have been able to obtain already indicate a remarkable web which involves a firm named Nema Holdings Ltd, the State Works Department and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen.</inline> In fact my investigations have shown - </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">-Yes, Mr President,</inline>I shall. I think, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr President,</inline> as I proceed you will see that my facts are well researched and my motives proper. In fact, my investigations have shown that there are at least 12 interconnected companies involved. There could really be more. Tonight, however, I shall mention only the more significant ones. It is also worth reporting to honourable senators that during the course of my investigations there were some not too subtle attempts to prevent me from obtaining information about companies registered in Queensland. </para>

          <para>Returning to the State Works Department in Queensland, let me state that it has long been recognised by building workers in that State as a reference point for awards and for conditions of employment. Recent decisions by the Queensland Government, however, have led to a great deal of construction work, previously carried out by building workers employed by the State Works Department being let to private enterprise. Therefore, because the Works Department has been receiving fewer contracts, many hundreds of building workers have been retrenched. Some who are closely connected with the building industry in Queensland have put the figure as high as 1200. </para>
          <para>The responsible Minister in Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Lee,</inline> and also the Premier, have suggested that those retrenched from the State Works Department will be employed in private enterprise. This remains to be seen. The older worker often encounters difficulty in finding work when he is retrenched in the building industry. It is worthwhile remarking that, such are the physical demands of the building industry, anyone of my age or older is put into the category of an &#39;older worker&#39;. I suspect that a large proportion of those who are retrenched will be unable to find positions with private builders, will leave the industry and will, consequently, be required to adapt to a lower standard of living to which they had been accustomed. </para>
          <para>One of the firms which has quite literally hit the jackpot because of the Queensland Government&#39;s new policy is Nema Holdings Ltd. Nema Holdings has captured a large share of State Government contracts. These include renovations to the State Works Department administration building, contracts for Macgregor, Kedron and Coorparoo State high schools, Royal Brisbane Women&#39;s Hospital and the administrative centre of the State Harbours and Marine Department. In all, some 20 State Government contracts worth at least $5m have been awarded to Nema Holdings Ltd. Nema Holdings Ltd gained public listing late in 1975 following a merger of Nema Constructions Pty Ltd and Highland Gold Development No Liability. This was a backdoor listing. Nema, previously not listed, used the listing of Highland Gold Development as an entry to stock exchange listing. </para>
          <para>All indications are that Nema Holdings has done very well in its first year of operation. It has diversified by acquiring two other companies, Queensland Bait Supplies and King Turner Engineering. The value of work that Nema Holdings Ltd had on hand at 3 1 January this year was about $llm. Seemingly, much of it is Queensland State Government contracts. The company has capital of $480,000 in 2 400 000 shares of 20 cents each. Its shares, incidentally, have throughout the year sold at above par value. </para>
          <para>Now, how is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> connected with Nema Holdings? The interdependence of a large number of companies in Queensland makes it difficult to set out all the facts in this case. I shall, however,, now detail the more important ones. One large shareholder is Oil min No Liability, formerly Ex Oil. Oil min, of post office box 237, North Quay, has 140 000 shares in Nema. It is interesting to note that Oil min &#39;s address is the same as that of Trans oil No Liability, which has 60 000 shares in Nema and 20 1 000 shares in Oilmin. </para>
          <para>I have not yet mentioned a shareholding of the Queensland Premier, but I shall now do so. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> has 2 1 000 shares in Oil min which, you will recall, has 140 000 shares in Nema. So, because of his significant shareholding in Oilmin, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> has an indirect share in Nema Holdings. The story does not stop there. Another very large shareholder in Oil min is Artesian Basin Oil, one of the directors of which is Florence Isabel Bjelke-Petersen of Kingaroy. Remember, Oil min has 140 000 shares in Nema Holdings. Artesian Basin Oil owns approximately one million shares- about 37.5 per cent -in Oil min and 49 per cent of the shares in </para>
          <para class="block">Artesian Basin Oil are owned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen.</inline> Thus the Premier of Queensland is, indirectly but quite substantially, a shareholder in a company which is obtaining a large proportion of its business from contracts let by the Queensland Works Department. </para>
          <para>To complete the picture, one of the directors of Nema Holdings Ltd is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr C.</inline> W. Siller. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Siller</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> have apparently been business associates for over 20 years. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Siller</inline> himself, as well as being a director of Nema Holdings, is also a director of Oil min, Trans oil, Pet rom in N.L. and Oil Drilling and Exploration Ltd. It is worthy of note that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Siller</inline> is also on the management committee of the National Party in Queensland, being a metropolitan zone vice-president of the Party. In May 1974 he was unsuccessful in his bid to gain a seat in the House of Representatives when he stood as a National Party candidate for the Federal electorate of Brisbane. Allow me to quote from a letter Nema recently sent to its employees. In this letter, it spoke of a &#39;small, indirect interest&#39; which the Premier has in the company. While the evidence suggests that &#39;small&#39; is not the appropriate adjective in this case, it is interesting that in no way did the company deny that the Premier had an interest. The letter read as follows: </para>
          <quote>
            <para class="block">TO ALL NEMA EMPLOYEES </para>
            <para>There have been rumours that since Nema became a Public Company in December 1975 it may be winning State Works Department Contracts because the premier of Queensland has held a small indirect interest in Nema since that date. </para>
            <para>Nema has been tendering for State Works Department Contracts since 1969. The rate at which it has won Contracts since December 1 973 is almost exactly the same as the rate for the 12 months ended December 1 975. </para>
            <para>The Contracts which Nema wins are won on open competitive tendering. This means that tenders are opened publicly for the information of all. </para>
            <para>I have been associated with Nema for the whole time that Nema has been tendering <inline font-style="italic">for State</inline> Works Department Contracts and I firmly believe Nema wins contracts because of its efficiency in tendering and the reputation it has built up over the years in completing contracts won. </para>
            <para>The Rum ley and Stockwell families still control Nema and there is no truth in any suggestion that Nema has obtained State Works Department Contracts in the way the rumours suggest. The Rum ley and Stockwell families do not operate that way. </para>
            <para class="block">Bill Stockwell 10 September 1976. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Let me stress that I do not allege that Nema has been given favourable treatment because of its association with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen.</inline> I make no claim that Nema has not won its contracts on its own merits. I certainly have seen no evidence to suggest that this is so. What I am stressing is that a conflict of interest exists with the political leader in the State of Queensland. Indeed, the Queensland Premier&#39;s conflict of interest in this case is plain and indisputable. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> &#39;s record of personal financial involvement in matters subject to decision by his own Government is unequalled by any politician in this country. Any politician with but a speck of decency who found himself in this position would resign. </para>
          <para>I urge the media not to be silent on this issue. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> happened to be a Labor politician- heaven forbid- he would be hounded mercilessly by the media and forced to hand over to someone who exhibited integrity in his leadership. The fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Bjelke-Petersen</inline> is a member of the National Party does not absolve him from the searching scrutiny of the media.  His  party membership and his position certainly give him no licence to make personal profit from contracts let by his own Government. </para>
          <para>In concluding, I repeat that there is an indisputable need for legislation to implement the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Pecuniary Interests of Members of Parliament. I certainly hope this Government is prepared to act on those recommendations and that in doing so it will urge the Queensland Government to move likewise. </para>

		    <para>BACKGROUND INFORMATION REGARDING THE 242Z ACCIDENT ON AUGUST 30 1976</para>
			<para>The Facilities</para>
			<para>The facility in which the accident occurred is designated the Z plant and is part of a group of plutonium processing facilities located near the center of the S70 square mile Han ford Reservation. The complex is about 27 miles from the City of Richland and 9 miles from N Reactor. </para>
			<para>The process equipment involved in the accident is located inside a closed, stainless steel, glove box approximately 4 feet by 8 feet by 9 feet in height located in a small <inline font-style="italic">room</inline> in the 242Z Building. The physical damage was limited to this one room. </para>
			<para>The Americium Purification Process</para>
			<para>The process was purification of Americium for its ultimate use by industry as a neutron source for making special measurements. For example, Americium is used in nondestructive tests of materials and logging of core drillings from oil wells. </para>
			<para>Purification of the Americium is accomplished by using an ion exchange column consisting of a tank filled with beads of an organic plastic material or resin. An Americium bearing solution which is a byproduct stream from purification of plutonium, is introduced into the resin which collects the Americium. Subsequently, the Americium can be removed from the resin by use of a nitric acid wash. </para>
			<para>The process is a well-established one and is similar to the process used in a home water softening device. </para>
			<para>The Accident</para>
			<para>Early Monday morning, Messrs McCluskey and Blunt were operating the processing equipment in the small room described above. </para>
			<para>Apparently, when the chemical reaction occurred, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline> was near the front of the closed glove box and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Klundt</inline> at the far end of the room. </para>
			<para>When the reaction occurred, the glass windows in the front of the glove box were shattered outward and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline> incurred multiple superficial cuts and first and second degree acid burns on the face and shoulder, and Americium contamination from the nitric acid and resin which sprayed into the room. </para>
			<para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Klundt,</inline>who was not injured by the chemical reaction itself, assisted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline> from the room and in the process, incurred Americium contamination. </para>
			<para>Two nurses from the 24 hour first aid stations located in the areas and an ambulance arrived at the scene within minutes. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline> &#39;s clothing was removed and decontamination and treatment were begun immediately. He was given clean clothes and driven by ambulance to the Emergency Decontamination Facility located adjacent to Kadlec Hospital in Richland, Washington. </para>
			<para>There he was immediately treated, and additional decontamination efforts undertaken by trained physicians and radiation specialists of the Han ford Environmental Health Foundation and Batt elle Pacific Northwest Laboratory. </para>
			<para>Throughout these activities <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline> was fully conscious and able to co-operate in his treatment. </para>
			<para>Meanwhile, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Klundt</inline> was given preliminary decontamination and a clothing change in the processing facility. He was then transferred to the first aid station in the 200 West Area. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Klundt</inline> has remained in the 200 West Area for treatment. </para>
			<para class="block">Treatment for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline></para>
			<para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline>&#39;s treatment is being accomplished by several Han ford Environmental Health Foundation physicians and nurses together with outside specialists in surgery and ophthalmology. The burns from the nitric acid, which have been likened to a severe sunburn, have required no special treatment. </para>
			<para>The cuts required removal of glass particles, but none has thus far required suturing. Activities to decontaminate the cuts and the body surface consist of repeated washings of the patient with cleansing solutions. The speed with which this process can be accomplished in this case is slowed by the presence of the burns. </para>
			<para>Immediately upon his arrival at the Decontamination Facility, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline> was administered a chelating agent This chemical speeds the normal body functions to remove the Americium deposited in the body. Applications of this chemical will continue to be administered daily under careful medical observation to assure no adverse side effects from the chemical. </para>
			<para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey</inline>has experienced blurred vision related to the nitric acid burns but the attending specialist believes there will be no significant permanent impairment. </para>
			<para>No determination of the long-term body retention of Americium can be made until decontamination of the body surface is completed. This process is expected to take as least several weeks. </para>
			<para>Measurements of the internal deposition or body burden are made by measuring the quantity of radioactive material eliminated and radiations from the body. Three types of analyses are used: ( 1 ) analysis for radioactive materials in urin, (2) analysis for radioactive materials in faeces, and (3) counting the radiation coming from the body with sensitive counting equipment, commonly called whole body counting. The first two techniques are being used to estimate <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCluskey&#39;s</inline> body deposition at this time. The third method cannot be used because the external contamination must be removed to permit the use of this sensitive measurement. </para>
			<para>Based on the preliminary analyses it is expected that the internal deposition will considerably exceed guidelines for occupational exposure and is considered to be a serious matter by ERDA and its contractors. </para>
			<para>These guidelines have been issued by the National Committee on Radiation Protection and Measurement, and the International Commission of Radiological Protection for quantities of radioactive materials deposited within the human body. These quantities are calculated to limit the radiation dose to levels considered acceptable by the majority of the scientific investigators expert in the field of radiation effects. The recommendations are accepted generally within the United States and the international community. The limits are set at levels well below those that would be expected to produce any detectable effect on the individual. </para>
			<para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCIuskey</inline>has requested that detailed clinical data, including his specific body burden and radiation exposure, not be publicly released, and pursuant to the provisions of the Privacy Act, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCIuskey</inline> &#39;s wishes must be respected. </para>
			<para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCIuskey,</inline>who is 64 years of age, is not incapacitated; he is in good spirits and is responding well to the treatment just described. </para>
			<para>Treatment of Mr Klundt</para>
			<para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Klundt</inline>who incurred no injuries in the accident and who received substantially less contamination than did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr McCIuskey,</inline> is receiving similar decontamination treatment, including administration of the chelating chemical. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Klundt</inline> is 43 years of age and is in good spirits and fully able to co-operate in his treatment. </para>
			<para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Klundt</inline>has also asked that his privacy be protected with regard to release of detailed clinical data, including specific body burden and radiation exposure. </para>
			<para class="block">Cause of the Accident </para>
			<para>As indicated earlier, the cause of the accident is being investigated by both the operating contractor ( Armco) and a team appointed by the ERDA Richland Operations Office Manager. </para>
			<para>While it will be at least a couple of weeks before the investigations will be completed, there is enough data at this point to indicate that the force which ruptured the glove box windows resulted from a chemical reaction of the nitric acid with the resin and the ion exchange column. It is also believed that the probable cause of the reaction itself was the degradation of the resin pellets from extended exposure to radiation from Americium in the column, making the resin more susceptible to the reaction which occurred. </para>
			<para>Normal operating procedures are designed to prevent radiation-caused degradation of the resin. The investigations will determine whether the procedures were adequate and/or whether they were properly followed. It would not be appropriate <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> speculate as to what the ultimate outcome of the investigations might be and we will be issuing no further statements until significant findings have been made. </para>

        <para class="block">I have spoken to some people very well versed in nuclear energy and it is open to doubt whether some of the statements are correct.

        <para>I am disturbed at a statement which appeared in the weekend Press, and I refer now to today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> and a reported statement made in Perth at the weekend by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr T.</inline> M.

Of course, the Premier of Western Australia, and I give him credit for this, has said that that is not acceptable, and neither should it be. Yet it poses in many minds a query about the great danger we are facing when we find that people who supposedly are experts in physics are suggesting that Australia ought to be used as a dump for nuclear waste. I am hoping that many people in Australia will take notice of what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Sabine</inline> has said and will make some very strong informed comment on it. The Governor of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Mark</inline> Oliphant, is reported in today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> under the Adelaide date line of Monday as saying that he was surprised and appalled that a man of science had suggested Australia be used as a nuclear waste dumping ground.

            <para>- There have been 3 matters raised in the adjournment debate tonight and I will deal with them in inverse order. As to the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLaren,</inline> I am sure that the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> will read this speech with interest, but I will make just one comment on it. As I recall, what <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Sabine</inline> said in Western Aust ali a was not just that Western Australia should be used as a dumping ground for nuclear waste. To say that that was the burden of his speech would be to take him out of context. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline>raised certain matters. I agree with him that the matter of pecuniary interests is a very interesting subject and that the Joint Parliamentary Committee on Pecuniary Interests of Members of the Parliament brought in a very interesting report. I wonder whether the report would have been in the same vein if the Committee had taken into account the judgment in what might be called the Webster case. Maybe the Committee did or maybe it did not. Our colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Webster</inline> was before the Court of Disputed Returns on a pecuniary interest matter. The learned Chief Justice, in his judgment on the qualification of a senator, did not adopt the narrow view of pecuniary interests that so many people think it is all about. </para>

It is not the narrow issue which people think. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Colston</inline> made a clarion call for the Press to take up the cause. I invite him to make that speech in public in Brisbane. I am quite certain the newspapers would be happy to print it. Without trying to give away free legal advice, they would be somewhat immune from the laws of defamation if their report was fair comment on a matter of public importance. He should put himself to the test in the courts. </para>

            <para>The Government is aware of the serious drought situation facing primary producers in the agricultural and pastoral areas of southern Australia and has considered ways and means of assistance. It has recently announced that financial assistance would be provided to the drought affected States to help finance a number of relief measures which would be of direct assistance to primary producers. </para>
            <para>The Government also announced that it was prepared to consider sympathetically any further applications for drought assistance from the State Governments. </para>
            <para>The feasibility of establishing a national grain reserve, as a basis for livestock feeding in times of drought has been considered by the Australian Agricultural Council on a number of occasions. The Council is of the opinion that the development of drought strategies, whether based on feeding, agistment, or sale of stock, is a matter to be determined by individual property owners in the light of their own particular circumstances. </para>
            <para>Time of occurrence, duration of, areas affected and severity of droughts are unpredictable and consequently the quantities of grain required for a reserve and their location is a matter of considerable uncertainty. There are however ample stocks of grain currently available from the Australian Wheat Board for stock feed purposes. </para>

            <para>I have seen the article in question. </para>
            <para>The statement that &#39;Australia is bankrupt&#39; is reported to have been made by the Premier in the context of his remarks on the very difficult budgetary and economic situation confronting the Commonwealth Government. I interpret the statement as a colourful description of the parlous state of the nation&#39;s finances at that time. During the previous two years, Budget outlays had increased by over 75 per cent and, even after allowance for this Government&#39;s efforts to rein back this excessive growth, a further large increase in outlays was inevitable in 197S-76. A massive deficit of $2.6 billion had occurred in 1974-75 and a deficit very much greater than that was in prospect for 1975-76 at the de this Government took office. </para>
            <para>Governments, because of their access to the money printing presses, cannot become technically &#39;bankrupt&#39; in the usual sense of the term. However, when Governments pursue policies which force them to have the kind of excessive recourse to the printing presses which characterised the period of our predecessors, they can be said to have become bankrupt of any sense of responsibility. Perhaps that was also the sense in which the Premier was using the term. </para>

Over a period of time some duplication may occur in coverage of statements as between publications. But the extent and significance of this is debatable as the publications differ in overall content and objective, are issued at different times and have differences in overall circulation. Furthermore, the statements may be in full in one publication but only summarised or in extracts in another. The degree of duplication is not considered wasteful of resources. </para>

Printing costs of two of the Department&#39;s publications and the editorial costs of all three in question are absorbed in normal departmental expenses; neither they nor the components relating to Ministerial statements are separately identifiable. The printing costs of the third publication are estimated at $72,000 in 1 976-77; it is not possible to identify the component relating to Ministerial statements but it would be small. </para>
          <para>Postage costs for the three Foreign Affairs publications are estimated at $54,295 in 1 976-77; the inclusion of Ministerial statements would make little or no difference to this amount.&#39; </para>

The Treasurer has provided the following answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>There is no contradiction between the two statements. The export shortfall referred to by the Treasurer was calculated with respect to the twelve months ending February 1976. During that period, because of world recession and import restrictions in some of our major markets, the growth of exports slackened compared with growth rates achieved in earlier years and what might otherwise have been expected in the period under reference. </para>
            <para>By contrast, the Prime Minister&#39;s remarks were directed towards the level of exports in June 1 976 and the prospects for export growth in the period ahead. The developing recovery in world economic conditions had a favourable effect on trading conditions for several major Australian exports in the second half of 1973-76. Over that period growth in export receipts accelerated markedly, reaching new peaks in the three months to August. </para>
            <para>As to the future performance of the export sector, although unfavourable seasonal conditions will reduce production of some important rural commodities in the present year, demand for Australian exports is strengthening and a high rate of exporting in overall terms is likely to be maintained in the foreseeable future. </para>
