          <para class="block">I ask the Minister: What legislation? If, as we believe, there is no legislation, is it not a fact that the 6-week period requirement is the result of a direction by the Minister to the Director-General not to take into account any circumstances in which an unemployed person may need a benefit in this 6-week period? Is it the Government&#39;s intention to introduce legislation to cover this detail? </para>

            <para>- With regard to the answer given yesterday, I referred to the fact that an unemployment benefit is not paid until 6 weeks after a person has become voluntarily unemployed. That was the situation relevant in the case under consideration and it was the basis of the sit-in conducted in the Department in Melbourne. Early this year the Government announced that one of the guidelines for the payment of the unemployment benefit would be that a period of 6 weeks would elapse before such benefit would be paid if a person became voluntarily unemployed. Under the Social Service Act there is a capacity for the Director-General to pay a special benefit to persons whom he considers to be in necessitous circumstances. The Director-General reviewed the case put to him by the people conducting the sit-in and made the determination. Following many representations from the Social Action Group in Victoria there were considerable discussions with the Group about the application of special benefit. I re-state what I said yesterday, that under the Social Services Act the Director-General has the discretion to pay a special benefit to a person in necessitous circumstances. He makes the determination. He is the person able to do so under the Act. </para>

              <para>- I ask a supplementary question of the Minister for Social Security. My question referred to the non-payment of benefits for a period of 6 weeks following voluntary unemployment. Is it not a fact that the Minister has instructed the Director-General not to exercise discretion in the case of people who have voluntarily left their employment and apply for a benefit in this 6-week period? </para>

              <para>- I say again that the special benefit provision has been in the Social Services Act for a very long time. There is no direction to the Director-General about the exercise of his discretion in paying a special benefit to persons in any situation. The special benefit does not relate only to unemployed persons; it can relate to any person in immediately necessitous circumstances. The 6-week period for eligibility for unemployment benefit was announced by the Government earlier this year. The Commonwealth Employment Service, which is the body that determines eligibility for unemployment benefit, has made it perfectly clear that there is a 6-week period in which there is no eligibility for unemployment benefit if the person becomes voluntarily unemployed. I have given no direction to the Director-General with regard to payment of special benefit in any of the circumstances raised. In particular, I have given no direction to the Director-General with regard to the 6-week period for eligibility for unemployment benefit. As I have said repeatedly, it is for the Director-General to decide on the payment of special benefit in any of the circumstances in which he considers it is essential. </para>

            <para>-I did see an article-I think, in the Melbourne Press- which indicated that the Victorian Government had conferred such a right on the police with regard to the tertiary institutions in Victoria. I should make these points clear: The universities are autonomous organisations. As far as possible, the Federal Government respects their right to conduct their own affairs. Constitutionally, they are the creatures of State legislation, not of Commonwealth legislation. Therefore the primary role of supervision, if such is necessary, must stem from the States, not from the Commonwealth. It is natural, therefore, that the Victorian State Government has intervened with regard to Victoria. Against that background the Commonwealth Government would not seek, unless invited to do so, to use Commonwealth police in such an atmosphere. Clearly the State governments, the universities and the State police can make whatever arrangements they wish. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Since the point is an important one, I reiterate what I have said in the Senate previously: There is no immunity on campus from the ordinary law of the land. One must understand quite clearly that the university campus confers on nobody any special privileges with regard to the law. A university student, an academic or a nonstudent an outsider coming on to the campusis subject to the law of the land, the same as any citizen elsewhere. Therefore it is clear that it is the responsibility of the university authorities to see that the law of the land is observed, and it is the responsibility of the police to see that breaches of the law do not occur. It is against that background that I was interested to see the item in the newspaper. </para>

            <para>-Senator Wriedt was good enough to let me know that he wanted some information about this matter. This is my current state of knowledge, to which I may be able to add other information next week: Australia has a history of worthwhile agricultural co-operation with many countries, including the U.S.S.R. This has operated in the past without any backing or any kind of formal agricultural co-operation agreement, although it is understood that this situation may need to be varied across the board. Because of his past position <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> knows extremely well the interest of the Union of </para>

          <para class="block">Soviet Socialist Republics in formalising arrangements for agricultural co-operation with that country. He says that, without any doubt, the U.S.S.R. has made suggestions about the form which that agreement might take following on the discussions last year. The Minister has told me to say that he is very much interested in developing the relationship with overseas countries. He has had discussions about the Government&#39;s consideration of the terms of the agreement. The matter is under close attention at present. The Minister is consulting with various other Ministers about the situation and I shall keep the honourable senator up to date as best I can. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister for Social Security. I draw her attention to page 215 of the report of the AuditorGeneral which was tabled in the Parliament yesterday, where the Auditor-General refers to frauds perpetrated by beneficiaries&#39;. He says that these are predominantly in relation to the unemployment benefit. He makes the observation that there has been a large increase in the number of frauds. Since the account of the Auditor-General lacks detail and since we are anxious to avoid any hasty or intemperate judgment, I ask the Minister whether she will arrange for more information to be made available to honourable senators on the numbers and types of these frauds? </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister for Education. Has the Minister received a letter from Professor Badger, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide, concerning student allowances and expressing the view that the tertiary education allowance is now well below the poverty level? If the Minister has received this representation, has he had an opportunity to study its contents? Is he in a position to report to the Parliament on this matter? </para>

            <para>- My recollection is that some two or three days ago I received a letter from Professor Badger, the Vice-Chancellor of the University of Adelaide. I read it and noted his comments regarding the present tertiary education allowance scheme and the effect of the level of allowance on those who are wholly supported by it. I would take that into account. To enable them to understand the situation honourable senators should be reminded that the present TEAS allowance was fixed at June 1 974 cost of living prices. The then Government, the Whitlam Government, in the Budget of August last year decided not to make any increase in the allowances. So the allowances, on June 1974 prices, were projected into this year by a decision of the then Whitlam Government and at a level well below the ordinary cost of living. Since then 2 things have happened. Due to the Whitlam Government policies inflation ran up to 17 per cent or 18 per cent, eroding the allowances, and unemployment moved up to 300 000, destroying the opportunity for students to get jobs. Where students depending fully on the allowances cannot get jobs, it is beyond doubt that they are suffering real hardship. </para>

            <para>- My question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations is about unemployment but it refers particularly to the subject of reduced apprenticeship employment in government departments and statutory authorities resulting generally, I think, from the reduction in capital works programs and staff ceiling policies about which I have asked questions fairly recently. I have been advised about the National Employment and Training scheme and the apprenticeship support schemes. I ask the Minister. As it is now clear that some more positive steps are necessary to ensure the employment of more young people, particularly apprentices and appropriate trainees, will the Minister consult with his colleague with a view to lifting staff ceilings in relation to the employment of young people in particular and to review programs wherever possible which might possibly ensure that young people will be employed. I suggest to the Minister that while it may be likely that improved apprenticeship support to employers and improved training schemes might be partly effective, a more positive role is to take more apprentices into employment. </para>

            <para>- I can assure the honourable senator that the Liberal Party and the National Country Party have no intention of adopting the rather peculiar and almost lemming-like desire of the Opposition to stay in Opposition. As I recall it, I said something yesterday to the effect that we once played around with a Labor-type system and went into opposition. After seeing how the Labor system worked out, the shambles which the Labor Government got itself into and the disputation that occurred, by a vote within the parliamentary Liberal Party- I think it was an almost unanimous vote- we abandoned that system and said that the proper way to conduct a party was to elect a leader, put full trust in him and let him select the Ministry. We have had experience over 23 years and that system has worked well. On the other hand, the Labor Party has a different system and has managed in 27 or 28 years to have only 3 years in government. I think that is proof of the pudding. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>It is not for me to comment on how the Labor Party conducts itself; I wish it great joy in what it is doing. At the moment it elects its leader for 18 months at a time, but its problem is that it really cannot find one. I thought that a potential leader was going to announce yesterday that he would enter Parliament but he quit for some reason or other. I suppose it is an interesting exercise for a party in opposition to spend most of its time worrying about the powers of a Prime Minister. We prefer our system. It is by far the best system that we have discovered and if the Opposition really wants proof of the capacity of the Prime Minister to choose wise and capable Ministers I invite its observation of the front bench in this place. </para>

Can the Minister inform the Senate when such agreements will be adhered to and when sufficient funds will be made available for the Authority to undertake its commitments this financial year? Is the Minister aware of considerable public opinion in AlburyWodonga that the Government is attempting to abandon the development of this and other growth centres? </para>

            <para>- I address my question to the Minister representing the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. Last week the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs and the Minister for the Northern Territory indicated that leases were being processed by the Government to enable Aboriginal fringe dwellers of Alice Springs to be provided with town services to allow those people to have electricity, water, showers, toilets and camping and housing facilities. In all, 6 or 7 leases either were completed or were being processed, with others being held in reserve for future use. In one or two cases the land was not available. Has a group of people in Alice Springs indicated to the Government that the Aboriginal people will not co-operate in the acceptance and handling of leases unless they receive all land requested as a package deal? If this is the case, what action does the Minister intend to take to ensure that the people concerned realise that by not accepting the leases, the aged, the children and other Aboriginal people will continue to live in an unhygienic, deprived state, lacking the basic facilities for a reasonable existence? </para>

            <para>- I understand that the Central Austraiian Aboriginal Congress has issued a Press release indicating that the Government&#39;s decisions on the granting of leases for certain town Aboriginal land claims fall short of Aboriginal expectation. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs has announced already that he is seeking to work in co-operation and harmony with all members of the community in Alice Springs- Aboriginal and non-Aboriginal- to find appropriate solutions to alleviate the plight of many disadvantaged Aboriginal people in the area surrounding Alice Springs. </para>

            <para>- I ask a question of the Minister for Social Security. I refer to a statement made by the Minister in the Senate on 25 August. In that statement the Minister referred to the establishment of a national consultative group on social welfare to advise the Minister on current issues in social welfare which come within the responsibility of the Commonwealth. The Minister also referred to the proposed establishment of a social welfare consultative committee in each State and Territory to keep the Government informed of problems or difficulties encountered in the administration of Commonwealth welfare programs. Can the Minister indicate whether the Australian Capital Territory will be represented on the proposed national consultative group? Can the Minister indicate what action has been taken to establish a social welfare consultative committee for the Australian Capital Territory? Can the Minister say whether all organisations involved in social security and welfare work in the Territory will be considered for participation? Finally, can the Minister say when an announcement on the establishment of the Australian Capital Territory committee and the other committees is likely to be made? </para>

            <para>- I have previously announced that a national consultative committee and State consultative committees are being formed. I expect shortly to announce the names of those people who have been appointed to those committees. In consultation with the Minister for the Capital Territory and the Minister for the Northern Territory I have finalised proposals to set up territorial committees which will work with me in an advisory capacity. I envisage that the State committees and the territorial committees will have approximately 6 members drawn from social welfare professionals, local academics in the social sciences, local government personnel, voluntary organisations and client welfare groups. The names of these people will be announced quite soon. The names of the prospective members of the Australian Capital Territory committee are under active consideration. I feel sure that with these consultative committees the Government will ensure that all questions of importance in the social welfare field will receive active consideration and attention. </para>

Is the Minister aware of the desperate state of the apple and pear industry in Australia? Is the Minister also aware of reports that there have been vast increases in the imports of canned apples from New Zealand? Does the Minister know that many Australian canneries have large stocks of canned apples on hand from local fruit growing areas? In these circumstances, can the Minister say what action the Government proposes to take to stop the dumping of New Zealand surpluses on our domestic market at a time of depressed conditions in Australia? </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister for Social Security. No doubt the Minister is concerned, as we all are, about the sharp increase in food prices for the month of August. A 1 .4 per cent increase in the consumer price index was registered for that month, according to the Statistician. As the consumer price index increase for the September quarter is expected to exceed 3 per cent and for the December quarter is expected to exceed approximately 5 per cent- the former by reason of the big increases in food prices and the latter consequent upon the commencement of the Medibank levy on 1 October- I ask: Will the Minister give serious consideration to consumer price adjustments to pensions before next May and thus prevent the hardships pensioners will otherwise suffer through the reduced purchasing value of the pensioner dollar? </para>

            <para>-Honourable senators will be aware that the policy of the Government is to have at 6-monthly intervals automatic adjustments in accordance with the consumer price index movements. There will be an increase to all pensions in November this year and in May next year. The Government has not given consideration to giving another increase earlier than May next year. An increase has already been provided for November this year. I have been looking at some interesting figures which show the cost of implementing some of the suggestions made. I think it would be appropriate if I were to release information about the hundreds of millions of dollars that are involved in some of the proposals that have been made by some of the pensioner associations recently with regard to earlier increases. At an appropriate time I shall give the honourable senator some of this information to let him see the very real difficulty that would exist in doing more than we have committed ourselves to do, that is, to have the 6-monthly increases and to pick up the quarterly movements in the consumer price index. I accept that difficulties caused by increases in prices are sustained by people on fixed incomes and in lower income levels, but the policy is for 6-monthly automatic increases. I think the cost of doing more than that at this stage would be prohibitive. </para>

            <para>- I ask the Minister for Science: Is it a fact that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation Dairy Research Laboratory has just announced that it has developed a process known as UHT, that is ultra-high temperature, for preserving milk? Does this enable milk to be kept without refrigeration for up to 6 months? Further, in what way does this development differ from the UHT milk produced for at least the last 5 years by Bakers Milk in Tasmania? </para>

            <para>- I am unable to answer the direct question asked by the honourable senator. My understanding is that the treatment of milk by ultra-high temperature is not a new process; it has been available for some years. It involves the treatment of milk by flash heating at above the normal temperature. Whereas a temperature of approximately 72 degrees is used for the pasteurisation of milk, under this process the milk is heated for some 3 seconds to 140 degrees. This treatment, plus the innovations in packaging, allows milk to remain in its fresh form undeteriorated for up to 12 months. I am unaware that Tasmania has had this process available, but I do realise that some remote areas in Tasmania are unable to get supplies of milk quickly. To be able to supply such areas is one of the benefits of this type of treatment. I shall obtain the answer for the honourable senator and give it to him. </para>

            <para>-Yes, these allegations have been made by the local trade union secretary as part of his normal operations to keep his union members happy and no doubt to show that he is earning his pay. The people involved in the main are not employed by the Commonwealth Government as part of the Department of Administrative Services but are employed by the Christmas Island Phosphate Commission. I think an arbitrator is there at the moment in response to a long standing request by the employees on Christmas Island for an arbitrator to go there to fix rates of pay and industrial conditions. This Government appointed an arbitrator a month or so ago to do this. I understand he is at present on Christmas Island hearing claims put forward by the union. I think I should not comment further except to say that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby,</inline> the Commissioner of Community Relations, was written to by the same union secretary. If there is any substance in the allegations I prefer to await the report of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Grassby</inline> rather than come to a judgment myself. </para>

No doubt he would agree that it is very desirable, if we are to have strong government, that we also have strong opposition, and opposition where we can clearly understand where the leadership is. He will probably agree also that we need choice as far as possible in this community, as our Liberal philosophy advocates. Does he see any reference or possible reference to this aspect in the current predicament of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Robert</inline> Hawke who appears to find no possibility of getting into these august chambers? Has the Government considered in any way the possibility, since the Labor Party will not make any supreme sacrifices, that we on this side might make a sacrifice to find a place for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke</inline> so that the Labor Party may have some choice in leadership? </para>

            <para>-Perhaps, in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> &#39;s terms, I am about to become an indecent Minister. With regard to the broad philosophical thrust of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> &#39;s first question, I think it used to be accepted almost as fundamental that the better the Opposition the better the Government. In the 3-year period between 1972 and 1975 the Opposition was the best that has been seen in this Parliament for many years. Funnily enough, at that time the country had its worst government. Therefore I am not quite certain whether that fundamental proposition is still true. With respect to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke,</inline> I suggest that as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> is from the same State he might like to offer his seat in the Senate to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Hawke.</inline></para>

            <para>- I direct a question to the Minister representing the Treasurer. The question refers to the fact that a single parent will be made to pay the Medibank levy at the family rate. How can the Minister justify this levy rate when the tax rebate for married persons is $610 per year while the rebate for a single parent is only $350 per year? As it is acknowledged that the single parent family faces greater financial difficulties already, will the Minister investigate this matter further to see whether a more equitable rate can be struck for the single parent in line with statements by the Minister for Social Security that special groups will be catered for under new Government legislation. Further, will the Minister take action to rectify the anomaly wherein if a working husband and wife decide to pay the levy separately at single rates to a maximum of $2.90 a week the Taxation Department would demand that the husband pay an additional $ 1 50 at the end of the year to cover his wife and the $ 1 50 paid by the wife would then be refunded? </para>

            <para>-I do not have at hand the cost of the Royal Commission conducted by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Coombs</inline> but I will obtain it for the honourable senator. It should be readily available. As to the basis of the costing of it, the honourable senator will know that we have been continuing the policy of previous governments, namely, that the price of these reports is based on what it actually costs the Government Printer for labour, material and the other normal administrative inputs in this area. We are not attempting to recoup the cost of the Coombs Commission because I imagine it would be about $lm. One would have to write a <inline font-style="italic">Gone With the Wind</inline> to get the sort of sales required to recoup that cost. The price of these reports is commercially based. As against that, in the case of each of these reports a large number of free issues are distributed. Free copies go not only to honourable senators and other members of this Parliament but also to public libraries, university libraries and the like.

It is not as though the people directly affected, through their union representations, were being disadvantaged by being asked to pay for it. I think somebody suggested yesterday that some report cost $1,000 a page. Perhaps that person was referring to the same report. </para>

I understand that the Joint House Department is responsible for displaying those photographs. The photographs are provided by the Parliamentary Library. I take it that they are the most up to date photographs and that the same photographs are provided for the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook.</inline> An interesting point arises out of this question. I understand that after the election honourable senators and members of the House of Representatives were asked to supply biographical notes and photographs. The photographs used are not provided by the Senate. Before the preparation of the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook</inline> the Parliamentary Library canvasses members of both Houses of the Parliament to supply it with up to date photographs or, if this is not possible, it would arrange to have the photographs taken.

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for the Capital Territory, refers to a situation which has arisen in the Australian Capital Territory this week as a result of the Government&#39;s new policy of bus passes for school children. Several small children already have been left stranded at bus stops because they did not have bus passes. One particularly distressing case has been brought to my attention: A 5-year-old girl was put off a bus because she did not have a bus pass. She was approached by a passing stranger who attempted to force her into a car. She was rescued from that situation by another passing motorist. So she came to no harm. However, in the light of this situation, will the Minister undertake to review the new system of bus passes which already has caused distress and potential danger to A.C.T. school children? In the meantime will the Minister give bus drivers a clear and direct policy instruction that they are not to leave children without passes stranded at bus stops? Will the Minister confirm publicly that financial assistance is available from the Welfare Branch of the Department to parents who are unable to afford the $10 a child bus pass fee? </para>

If the matters that the honourable senator has put forward are correct and if the events to which she referred did occur, the situation certainly should be looked at. I see no reason why any child should be put off a bus in this early stage of the new system. The honourable senator put forward 2 proposals. The first was that drivers be instructed correctly. I certainly think that instructions should be given clearly to drivers. The second was that in certain circumstances parents of children who are unable to afford the fee can obtain assistance. I will attempt to bring back to the Senate at the earliest opportunity a statement on the matter. </para>

            <para>-Yes, the honourable senator may be sure that there will be an immediate investigation. I have started that already. I think I ought to say one or two things to the Senate. This matter goes back into the past, long before my time. It also goes back into a confusion of departments in earlier days. These activities are old Department of Supply activities, I take it. That Department no longer exists. The activities belong partly to the Department of Defence. How they get into the Department of Industry and Commerce at the moment defies my understanding. It does not actually make Mirage aircraft or anything of that kind; but that does not matter. I have had some information gathered together. The matter needs to be followed through, and it will be followed through. The honourable senator should be in no doubt about that. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The information which I have so far- it may take some time to relate- is that the Mirage agreement provided for advance payments of the total agreed contract value to be made on agreed dates, independently of the dispatch value of parts and materials ex French works to Australia. That seems to me to be a strange way to do things. The Chief Purchasing Officer, London, placed orders on the French contractors for supply of parts and kits of parts to a stated value, but the orders did not list and price all individual parts. Parts and materials were dispatched against unpriced packing notes, and Australian representatives at the works checked the items against the packing notes before dispatch. The French contractors were required to follow dispatch of parts with fully priced invoices. This process was observed in the early stages of the program but progressively got in arrears. In due course invoices ceased to flow, and in terms of reconciling parts with invoices an amount of $34m is outstanding because we have been unable to obtain invoices from the French contractors. I would have thought that we would have stopped paying them then. Thorough checking, of goods received against packing notes was carried out in Australia. This was a duplication of the process also being carried out in the French works by Australian representatives. </para>
          <para>A great deal of effort it is said, has been expended in trying to solve the blockage of invoices from French suppliers, and every possible means at our disposal has been pursued in order to be certain that goods have been received in accordance with the orders. There has been no evidence of non-receipt of items. It is intended, therefore, to try to tidy up this matter with the Treasury in an accounting sense. Looking at this matter, at first blush my impression is of a need for it to be thoroughly investigated and for processes to be laid down so that we can be perfectly sure that what we pay for we get. </para>

It relates to the joint statement made by the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications on 9 September dealing with ethnic radio. In that statement the Ministers say that the Australian Broadcasting Commission would be asked to assume responsibility for ethnic radio. I ask the Minister: Firstly, has there been an answer to that request that the ABC assume that responsibility? Secondly, what additional arrangements have been made for further funding for the ABC to provide for the additional work of catering for ethnic radio? Thirdly, in view of the fact that the licences of stations 2EA and 3EA expire on 1 October and that there is considerable concern about the future of those stations, what has the Government determined about their immediate future? </para>

I am aware of the Government&#39;s intention to invite the Australian Broadcasting Commission to operate ethnic radio. I am aware that part of that policy is to ensure separate and discrete- I think the word is- administration and funding from the present situation. I am unaware whether the Australian Broadcasting Commission has responded or what particular funding arrangements have been made. I am unaware of the particular question relating to the 2 radio stations. Because of that I will draw the attention of the Minister to it and invite him to give a reply to the honourable senator. </para>

I am hopeful that in the immediate weeks ahead we will be able to make some announcement as to the Interim Council. In any case, discussions on a number of aspects have taken place in an informal way with the Tasmanian Government. The matter is not standing still. The whole question of the interface between the Launceston College and the technical colleges has to be considered. The questions of land and sites are at the moment receiving attention. The Government is keen for the Maritime College project to get moving as fast as possible and I will look to an early announcement. </para>

Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to the fact that the current level of unemployment in Tasmania is the highest in Australia, having more than doubled in the last 2 years, whereas notified vacancies have shrunk by more than 25 per cent? As background I state that in the worst affected occupations there are 1 89 unemployed for each rural vacancy, 21 unemployed for each semiskilled vacancy and 54 unemployed for each unskilled vacancy. Has the Minister&#39;s attention been drawn to the latest published figures on school leavers which show that 21.3 per cent of last year&#39;s school leavers in Tasmania have not yet obtained a job, as compared with the national figure of 14.2 per cent? Does the Minister agree that this is a situation which calls for very urgent and drastic action? Will the Minister consider establishing a joint task force between the Federal and State governments to examine ways and means of overcoming this problem? </para>

            <para>- I preface my question which is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Primary Industry by reminding him of the recent takeover of the north west Katherine Meatworks. Is the Minister aware that the company has reduced freezer pack size from 60 lb to 30 lb? Does this increase the handling and associated costs of a meatworks which is already in some degree in financial difficulty? Does the Minister realise that the company, in addition to exporting prime beef, is exporting offal and brisket? Is the Minister also aware that the company is apparently subsidising the export of brisket by about 10c per lb. Will the Minister take appropriate steps to investigate the matters referred to with a view to encouraging more effective management of a meatworks badly needed in this pan of the Northern Territory to provide both killing facilities for local beef producers and to sustain the economic and employment situation in a very isolated area? </para>

          </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will be aware that prior to the election the Government parties undertook to abolish the Prices Justification Tribunal and to use the machinery of the trade practices legislation to promote fair prices. </para>
          <para>Subsequent to the election the Government received representations from trade unions and other sections of the community to retain the Tribunal. In the light of these representations the Government undertook to review its pre-election undertaking and to have consultation with interested parties. </para>
          <para>Public submissions on the future of the Tribunal were called for and, in response, submissions were received from individuals, firms, business organisations, trade unions and consumer groups. </para>
          <para>The great majority of these submissions urged retention of the Tribunal. Most of them asserted however that the operations of the Tribunal should be modified. </para>
          <para>A number of submissions argued against the absorption of the functions of the Prices Justification Tribunal into either the Trade Practices Commission or the Industries Assistance Commission. </para>
          <para>The future of the Tribunal was discussed at length during the June meeting between the ACTU, other peak councils of the trade union movement and the Government. These discussions were followed by lengthy consultations between officers of the Department of Business and Consumer Affairs and officials of the ACTU. The Tribunal&#39;s future was also discussed at the July meeting between the Government and the National Employers&#39; Policy Committee. </para>
          <para>In addition, separate discussions have taken place between the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs, the Minister for Employment and Industrial Relations and employers&#39; representatives. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs also canvassed the future of the Prices Justification Tribunal with the Australian Federation of Consumer Organisations, business associations, and individual manufacturing and retail firms. </para>
          <para>As a result of these discussions the Government has decided to retain the Prices Justification Tribunal but in a significantly modified form. </para>
          <para>The Government has concluded that it would be unwise to transfer the functions of the Tribunal to either the Trade Practices Commission or the Industries Assistance Commission. However, the changes proposed to the operations of the Tribunal will assist in eliminating duplication of functions between the Tribunal and the two Commissions. </para>
          <para>It is the Government&#39;s belief that the emphasis of the Tribunal should change from that of a price approval body to that of a price surveillance body. </para>
          <para>Figures supplied by the Tribunal indicate that since its inception nearly 90 per cent of price increases have been approved on the basis originally notified to the Tribunal. This clearly demonstrates that there is a high level of price responsibility on the part of Australian business and that there is considerable scope for reducing the administrative costs to business of complying with the notification requirements of the Act. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that if the number of companies required to notify price increases is significantly reduced there will not only be considerable savings to firms but the Tribunal itself will be able to devote more resources to investigation of those areas where there is evidence of price abuse. </para>
          <para>It is envisaged that greater use will be made of those provisions of section 1 6 of the Act which enable the Government to refer specific matters to the Tribunal for inquiry and report. This section was never invoked by the previous Government. </para>
          <para>The Government is concerned to ensure that the cost to Australian businesses of servicing the requirements of regulatory agencies should be reduced as much as possible. It believes that this objective will be served by the changes proposed to the operations of the Prices Justification Tribunal without affecting the capacity of the Tribunal to act in appropriate cases. </para>
          <para>It is proposed that the number of companies required to notify price increases be reduced in two ways. </para>
          <para>Firstly, the turnover threshold for price notification will be increased from $20m to $30m. </para>
          <para>It is estimated that with a new annual turnover level of $30m the total number of companies covered by the notification provisions will be broadly equivalent to the total number of companies when the Tribunal was established in 1973 and substantially less than the number of companies presently covered. </para>
          <para>Secondly, the Government believes greater use should be made of the exemption provisions of the Act. </para>
          <para>At present the Tribunal has power to authorise the exemption of an individual company or groups of companies. </para>
          <para>It is proposed to amend this section of the Act to give the Tribunal power to exempt companies which meet certain criteria. These criteria will include companies which experience effective and extensive competition and smaller subsidiary companies. </para>
          <para>A proper application of these criteria and other criteria to be developed will undoubtedly lead to a large number of companies being exempted from the notification requirements of the Act. </para>
          <para>The Government is determined to ensure that the operations of the Tribunal do not interfere with the generation by companies of adequate levels of profitability bearing in mind the critical importance of profitability to investment and employment. </para>
          <para>The Senate will be aware that during its early months of operation the Tribunal required companies to absorb a proportion of increased costs not covered by increased productivity. The limitations imposed on companies by the administrative constraints of the Tribunal were heightened in that period by more intensive import competition and monetary tightness. As a result, company profit shares fell by almost one-third from their historic levels of around 1 5 per cent of GDP to 10 per cent. </para>
          <para>Honourable senators will also recall that in 1974 the former Prime Minister wrote to the  Chairman  of the Tribunal requesting that in future the Tribunal pay particular attention to the encouragement of investment. Whilst the present Government fully supports this proposition it believes that in the interests of confidence such a principle should be put beyond all doubt and not merely rest upon a letter to an independent Tribunal from the responsible Minister. </para>
          <para>The Government therefore proposes amending the Act to make it clear that in all its determinations the Tribunal should pay full regard to company profitability with a view to maintaining investment and employment. </para>
          <para>Other changes will simplify the Tribunal&#39;s administrative and public inquiry procedures, will extend from 30 days to three months the period in which an approved price increase may be applied by a company and will provide for the Tribunal to report half-yearly on the main price increases within major industry groups and the principal reasons for them. </para>
          <para>In order that early effect may be given to the Government&#39;s decisions announced today, the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs has requested the  Chairman  of the Prices Justification Tribunal that the Tribunal consider using the existing exemption procedures of the Act to exempt from notification on a company by company basis those companies whose turnover fall between $20m and $30m per annum in advance of the actual legislative change giving effect to this particular decision. </para>
          <para>Furthermore the  Chairman  of the Tribunal has agreed that the Tribunal will anticipate the amendments proposed to the exemption provisions of the Act by immediately commencing the preparation of schedules of companies which might qualify for exemption from the notification requirements of the Act under the amendments envisaged by the Government. Further details of action in this area will be announced by the Tribunal. </para>
          <para>These steps will ensure that no unnecessary delays occur in giving effect to the new charter proposed by the Government for the operations of the Tribunal. </para>
          <para>It is intended to effect appropriate legislative changes as soon as possible. </para>

              <para>- This notice of motion relates to an amendment of the Australian Capital Territory City Area Leases Ordinance, which repealed and remade, in modified form, the provisions in the principal Ordinance which make it a criminal offence for a lessee to use his lease for a purpose not specified in the lease. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>The Regulations and Ordinances Committee recalled the opinion which it expressed some years ago, when criminal penalties were inserted in the Ordinance, that breach of lease purpose is a civil matter and is not appropriate for the criminal jurisdiction. In relation to the present Ordinance, the Committee considered the provisions objectionable in that a person who committed a merely technical or trivial breach of a lease purpose in relation to a residential lease would be subject to the penalties provided by the Ordinance. It was considered that such a person ought to have a defence, for example, something to the effect that the breach he committed did not disturb the planning of the city. The Committee also considered that another provision in the Ordinance was unnecessarily harsh. This was a provision whereby a lessee would be guilty of an offence if he failed to furnish a statement in response to a notice requiring him to state the name of a person using or occupying a lease. </para>
          <para>The Minister for the Capital Territory has considered the views of the Committee, and has given an undertaking that the Ordinance will be amended so that the question of breach of lease purpose will be transferred from the criminal law to the civil law. Where it is considered that a lessee has used his lease for a purpose not authorised by the lease, an application may be made to the courts for an order directing the lessee to take such action as may be necessary to stop the unauthorised use of the land. In the event of noncompliance with a court order, the court will be empowered to impose a penalty. </para>
          <para>The Committee considers that these proposed amendments will properly safeguard the rights and liberties of lessees, and put leases back into the civil law where they belong. The Committee deprecates the tendency to introduce criminal penalties into areas, such as contracts, which properly belong to the civil law. This morning the Minister for the Capital Territory <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Staley)</inline> gave me an assurance that he will have the whole of the Ordinance reviewed so that the Committee will have a further opportunity to consider the Ordinance. </para>
          <para>I would also like to point out that the difficulties involved with the Ordinance arise from the decision, which apparently was taken very many years ago, to use lease purpose clauses as an instrument of town planning, instead of a proper town plan in the form of a law to which all citizens must conform. In view of the Minister&#39;s undertaking to amend the Ordinance, 1 withdraw the notice of motion standing in my name. I would like to thank the Minister for his cooperation in relation to this matter. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>Honourable senators may recall that when introducing the National Health Amendment Bill 1976 the Minister for Health <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Hunt)</inline> stated, in another place, that the provisions in the </para>
          <para>Bill would be fully discussed with registered health benefits organisations in view of the sinificance of the provisions for those organisations. At the time when the Bill was being debated I also gave an assurance, on behalf of the Minister, that during the winter recess the provisions of the Bill would be carefully considered in the light of the comments made by honourable senators and members, and others, with the objective of achieving the most suitable arrangements for conducting private health insurance. The Bill before the Senate provides for further amendments to the National Health Act which the Government is proposing as a result of its discussions and deliberations during the winter recess. </para>
          <para>The Government is confident that the adjustments which have been made will assure smooth and more effective operation of the new arrangements when they take effect on 1 October. As has been stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Catchlove,</inline> speaking on behalf of the Australian Hospital Association, and I quote: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The Government proposals for reorganising Medibank, have we believe, made the first real attempt to come to grips with the enormous escalation in health costs, while maintaining the principle of universal health insurance. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">There are a number of provisions in the Bill which introduce new proposals, which I will explain. One of these is clause 20, which includes in Part VI a new division 1 A- benefits for certain contributors to standard hospital benefits tables. The new division provides for the payment of a subsidy by the Commonwealth to registered hospital benefits organisations in respect of persons who contribute to the standard hospital benefits tables of registered organisations but not to the standard medical benefits tables. This covers the situation of people on low to medium incomes wishing to retain the choice of their own doctor while in hospital. This combination of Medibank standard cover by payment of the levy plus private insurance for hospital-only will be cheaper for people in the low to medium income range. </para>
          <para>When introducing the National Health Amendment Bill 1976, 1 indicated to honourable senators that the cost of this hospital-only insurance for a person remaining in Medibank standard was estimated at $ 1 35 a year or $2.60 a week- at the family rate- and would be payable in addition to the levy. When the contribution rates for Medibank private health insurance were being determined it became apparent that the family contribution rates for the standard hospital benefits tables would exceed $2.60 a week. It seemed likely that this would be the case with most other major organisations. </para>
          <para>Because of its concern to keep the cost of this type of insurance within the reach of those with low to medium incomes, the Government decided to give a subsidy to hold the family contribution rate to $2.60 a week and the single contribution rate to $1.30 a week. This level of hospital insurance will cover contributors for public hospital charges in shared ward accommodation where they choose to be treated by their own doctor. The maximum rates of Commonwealth subsidy are based on the difference between the contribution rates for the standard hospital benefits tables for privately insured persons in Medibank private and $1.30 a week for single rate contributors and $2.60 a week for family rate contributors. For the information of honourable senators, privately insured persons are those who are covered for standard medical benefits and standard hospital benefits through registered organisations. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for the rates of $1.30 a week for single contributors and $2.60 a week for family contributors, and for the rates of Commonwealth subsidies, to be varied by regulations. Clause 13 of the Bill substitutes a new section 73BB, which provides for the establishment and operation of reinsurance accounts by registered hospital benefits organisations. The decision to vary the existing reinsurance account provisions was made following discussions with representatives of registered health benefits organisations and the changes are designed to cause the arrangements to operate more equitably and efficiently. Basically, the reinsurance arrangements enable an organisation, after it has paid standard hospital benefits to a contributor for 35 days of hospitalisation in a year, to debit to its reinsurance account benefits payable to that contributor for the remainder of&#34; that year. The Bill provides for the reduction of the qualifying period from 60 days to 35 days. This does not, in any way, affect the benefits entitlement of any contributor. It will ensure that the $50m a year the Government has undertaken to pay towards the reinsurance arrangements will be utilised. Provision is made for the qualifying period to be varied by regulations. </para>
          <para>The new provision also varies from the existing section 73BB in the way in which it provides for a contribution year to be determined for the purposes of the reinsurance account. The section provides that where standard hospital benefits have been paid to a contributor for 35 days of hospitalisation in any year, the contribution year commences on the first benefit day unless that day falls within a previous contribution year. Special provisions covering special account contributors as at 30 September 1976, provide that where they attract hospital benefits for a continuous period of 35 days of hospitalisation from 27 August 1976, benefits in accordance with the standard table may be debited to the reinsurance account from 1 October 1976. In this case the contribution year for the contributor commences from 27 August 1976. Where a special account contributor has received hospital benefits for hospitalisation after 30 September 1975, benefits in accordance with the standard table may be debited to the reinsurance account on or after 1 October 1976 when the days attracting benefits first exceed thirty-five. In this case the year of the contributor commences on the first day of the days aggregating to the 35 days. </para>
          <para>As a result of the Government&#39;s decision that the Health Insurance Commission should operate registered hospital and medical benefits funds, it is not considered necessary for the Minister to have the power in all situations to direct an organisation to accept a person as a contributor. I believe that competition between organisations will render this unnecessary. However, it is considered that the Minister should have the power to direct an organisation to accept a person as a contributor, where he is satisfied that there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person was not accepted as a contributor to a standard benefits table on health grounds. Clause 1 4 of the Bill provides for this change in the Minister&#39;s power of direction. </para>
          <para>Clause 1 7 of the Bill substitutes a new section 73d. The new provision is similar in objective to the repealed provision. It enables a registered organisation to request the Minister to direct that services or treatment of any kind, provided or arranged by the organisation, be treated as the payment of benefits in respect of those services or that treatment. The provision specifies the manner in which an organisation shall make the request and the action to be taken by the Minister upon receipt of such a request. The Bill, in clause 22, enables an application to be made by a registered organisation, for the Administrative Appeals Tribunal to review a direction, or refusal to give a direction, by the Minister under new section 73d. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides for the repeal of the condition of registration, in sub-section 73ba ( 1) of the Act, that organisations continue to provide benefits for contributors to standard tables for 2 months after the period in respect of which contributions have been paid. This provision was only necessary to enable levy relief certificates to be issued. The Bill provides, in its stead, for it to be a condition of registration that a contributor to a standard table, whose contributions have fallen into arrears, shall be entitled, within a period specified in the rules of the organisation, being a period of not less than 2 months, to pay the arrears of contributions and retain benefits entitlements. </para>
          <para>I would like also to draw the attention of honourable senators to clause 3 of the Bill which substitutes new definitions of &#39;the standard hospital benefits table&#39; and &#39;the standard medical benefits table&#39;. The definitions have been varied to relate the benefits payable in accordance with these tables to the fees and charges applying in the States in which contributors receive treatment. The changes ensure that appropriate benefits are payable where a contributor or a dependant of a contributor incurs expenses while temporarily absent from his normal State of residence. A further amendment to these definitions enables regulations to be made prescribing additional benefits to be paid from the standard tables. This power is already contained in existing sub-section 73ba (2). However the amendment limits the scope of the prescribing power to the standard tables. A consequential amendment is made in clause 12 which omits sub-section 73  ba  (2). </para>
          <para>Clause 5 of the Bill amends section 57b to broaden the eligibility criteria for Commonwealth additional nursing home benefits. The purpose of the amendment is to enable these benefits to be payable in respect of all eligible persons, other than those who are privately insured in both the standard medical and hospital benefits tables. This amendment will mean that people entitled to the benefits of Medibank public will be entitled to these benefits and will remove an anomaly in the existing legislation. The Bill includes a number of technical amendments relating to references to dependants of contributors. These amendments are necessitated by the inclusion, by the National Health Amendment Act 1976, in section 4, of a revised definition of &#39;contributor&#39; which does not include a reference to dependants of contributors. The amendments in the Bill cause provisions where appropriate to apply to dependants of contributors as well as to contributors. </para>
          <para>Clause 23 of the Bill amends the eighth schedule to the Act by the substitution of a new table incorporating variations made to that table by regulations. The amendment has effect from 1 February 1976, the date of effect of the regulations. The amendment of the table in the eighth schedule is a statutory requirement authorised by section 55c of the Act. The Bill also provides for the continuation of Commonwealth payments in respect of late claims lodged by contributors to any organisations deregistered, with effect from 1 October 1976, under the transitional provisions in section 42 of the National Health Amendment Act 1 976. 1 commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>The Bill includes provisions relating to the payment of medical benefits for pathology services and to the hospital agreements between the Commonwealth and the States. The provisions relating to the payment of medical benefits for pathology services are based on recommendations of the pathology services working party established by the Government in April 1976. They are designed to curb the use of the medical benefits system to finance the rendering of unnecessary pathology services and to curb high Medibank expenditure on pathology services. It is proposed that the existing levels of benefits should continue to be payable where: Pathology items are rendered by a recognised specialistpathologist, at the request of another practitioner; the number of items performed does not exceed three; and the person in respect of whom the items are rendered was not at the time they were requested a private patient or out-patient of a recognised hospital. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides for lower benefits to be payable where pathology items are rendered by recognised pathologists other than in the circumstances I have described or are rendered by other medical practitioners. The lower benefits are to be calculated on fees equivalent to 75 per cent of the scheduled fees for the 3 most expensive items, of the items determined during one day by a practitioner to be necessary for a patient. Where the number of items performed in either of the circumstances to which I have referred exceeds three, the Bill provides for benefits for the items, other than the three most expensive items, to be calculated on fees equivalent to 20 per cent of the fees that would otherwise apply. </para>
          <para>The payment of lower rates of benefits for items in excess of three recognises the lower pro rata costs, particularly overheads, involved in performing a larger number of items. However, it is envisaged that there will be cases where it is inappropriate to apply the reduction principle and provision is made in the Bill to enable the Minister to direct that it be not applied in particular cases. To assist in the achievement of the objectives of these provisions the Bill further provides that the recognised pathologist rendering the pathology service as a result of a request must include on his account or receipt, or on the assignment of benefits form, where the doctor enters into such an arrangement with the patient, the name of the requesting practitioner and the date on which the request was made. Where the service was rendered otherwise than as a result of a request, the medical practitioner must include on one of the documents to which I have just referred, a statement that, on a specified date, he determined that the services were necessary. The Bill provides that medical benefits are not payable unless these details are supplied. </para>
          <para>It is proposed that other changes based on recommendations of the pathology services working party be introduced from 1 January 1977, after final details have been determined and the legislation approved by Parliament. In view of the effective and representative participation of the medical profession in developing these revised arrangements, I anticipate that high quality pathology services will continue to be available throughout Australia and that the lower levels of fees for benefits purposes contemplated by the proposals will be generally accepted. </para>
          <para>I wish to turn now to the provisions in the Bill relating to hospital agreements between the Commonwealth and the States. The Bill provides for the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with the States, on revised bases, for and in relation to the provision of hospital services. The purpose of the Bill is to enable the Commonwealth to enter into agreements with the States on the revised bases under which the Commonwealth will share with the States the net operating costs of recognised hospitals. The Government proposes that the agreements should come into operation in respect of periods commencing on 1 October 1976 as the States Grants (Hospital Operating Costs) Act 1976 applies only in respect of periods up to 30 September 1976. The Bill provides for the repeal of schedule 2 to the Health Insurance Act 1973, which sets out heads of agreement and for a new Schedule to be substituted. The heads of agreement set out in the new schedule have been determined following discussions with representatives of all State governments. </para>
          <para>The Government has been concerned at the open-ended nature of the Commonwealth&#39;s financial commitment under the hospital cost sharing arrangements. It considers that it should have an adequate knowledge of, and opportunity to express its views on, the ways in which the costs it is to share are incurred and the need for them to be incurred. Head 5 in Schedule 2 in the Bill provides for a mechanism to be included in the agreements which will meet the Commonwealth&#39;s needs in these respects. It is envisaged that the committees established to give effect to that head will comprise Commonwealth and State officials and that the budgets and variations to the budgets formulated by the committees will be subject to approval by the Commonwealth Minister for Health and the relevant State Minister. </para>
          <para>Head 4, which is subject to head 5, provides for the Commonwealth to meet 50 per cent of the net operating costs of recognised hospitals in a State during the period of the agreement, or, an amount equal to the total of the amounts paid by the State from its own resources towards meeting those costs, whichever is the less. This was the basis for cost sharing in the former invalid agreements and the Government proposes that it be retained with the safeguards, against open.endedness, that will be provided in giving effect to head 5. </para>
          <para>The heads also provide for all eligible persons, other than privately insured persons, to be entitled to receive, free of charge, care and treatment as hospital patients in recognised hospitals. Such persons are also to be entitled to receive, free of&#34; charge, out-patient services at recognised hospitals other than particular services. The heads do not prevent an agreement from providing for privately insured persons to receive such care and treatment and out-patient services free of charge. The Government has advised the States that it seees this as a matter for decision by each State. I wish to remind honourable senators that a privately insured person in this context is a person who is covered for benefits in accordance with both the standard hospital benefits table and the standard medical benefits table operated by health insurance organisations registered under the National Health Act. </para>
          <para>I also wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to head 9 which permits particular outpatient services to be subject to a means test, or charges, or both a means test and charges. This head has been included to give recognition to a situation that existed under the former invalid agreements whereby some States applied means tests or raised charges in respect of a small range of out-patient services such as dental services and those States intend to continue those arrangements. It is the firm intention of the Government that the range of services in this category should remain small and that the general principles relating to the provision of out-patient services should not be eroded. </para>
          <para>The Bill, at the request of the States, provides for the repeal of provisions in the Act which authorise the making of daily bed payments of $16 a day to recognised hospitals. Amounts equivalent to these payments will be included in the Commonwealth payments to the States under the agreements. The Bill also provides for payments under the Act to recognised hospitals in the Territories to reflect the change in the financing of recognised hospitals in the States. Accordingly, it provides for daily bed payments to such hospitals to be discontinued. The daily bed payments of $16 a day will continue to be payable to private hospitals. Provision has also been made in the Bill for the validation of Commonwealth payments made in accordance with the former invalid agreements. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

            <inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows-</inline>
          </para>
          <para>The Government announced, during June 1976, its decision that the Health Insurance Commission should be authorised to carry on private health insurance business in competition with the private health insurance organisations registered under the National Health Act. The Bill before the Senate provides for the Commission to perform this role. The Bill provides for the functions of the Commission to include conducting medical benefits funds and hospital benefits funds. It further provides that the Commission, in carrying out this new role as a registered organisation under the National Health Act, shall be subject to all the provisions of that Act and regulations relating to the conduct of medical and hospital benefits funds by registered organisations. The Commission therefore will have the same rights and obligations under the National Health Act and regulations as other registered organisations. </para>
          <para>The Government proposes that to the greatest extent practicable the Commission should use the same staff, buildings and equipment in carrying out its private health insurance functions as it uses for its other functions. The Bill provides for it to be a duty of the Commission to do this. However, it is important, in view of the Commission&#39;s competitive role, that the costs associated with its operating medical and hospital benefits funds be clearly identified. It is also important that the Commission should not gain a competitive advantage due to its being exempt from taxation by virtue of its being a statutory authority. The Bill therefore provides for the Commission to determine, and whenever appropriate, re-determine, principles in accordance with which it is to apportion to its private health insurance functions and its other functions, costs related to its functions as a whole, such as salaries. These principles are to be subject to approval by the Minister for Health who shall consider the advice of the Auditor-General in relation to the principles before approving them. </para>
          <para>The Bill further provides for the Commission to determine notional amounts of expenditure it would have incurred in respect of its private health insurance functions had it not been an authority of the Commonwealth and exempt from taxation. Examples of these costs that private health insurers have to meet are payroll tax, sales tax, stamp duty and rates. The amounts determined are to be paid into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. </para>
          <para>The Bill also provides that the Minister may pay amounts to a State, a State authority or local governing body equivalent to the amounts which he considers would have been payable to them in connection with the Commission &#39;s private health insurance operations had the Commission not been an authority of the Commonwealth and exempt from taxation. The principles for apportioning costs together with any changes in those principles from the previous year, and the principles for determining the notional costs, are to be set out, by way of a note, to the annual financial statements of the Commission. This will ensure that a statement of the principles will form part of the annual financial statements and accordingly will be subject to the scrutiny of the Auditor-General. </para>
          <para>Separate financial statements are to be prepared, in the form approved by the Treasurer, for the Commission&#39;s private health insurance operations and its other functions. The whole of the Commission&#39;s financial activities are to be audited by the Auditor-General. The Commission is to submit its annual financial statements to the Auditor-General before submitting them to the Minister and the Auditor-General is to report on the statements to the Minister. Copies of the annual report of the Commission together with the financial statements and the Auditor-General &#39;s report on the statements are to be tabled in each House of the Parliament. </para>
          <para>The Bill provides for the financial separation of the Commission&#39;s private health insurance operations to be reinforced by providing for the Commission to maintain separate bank accounts for those operations from 1 April 1977. The commencing date of 1 April 1977 provides a period during which the Commission will be making the necessary administrative arrangements. There is provision in the Bill for the Commission to receive capital advances out of moneys appropriated by the Parliament to enable it to establish and conduct its private health insurance operations. An amount of $ 10m has been included in the Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 1976-77 for this purpose. The Bill before the Senate also provides for the Commission to borrow moneys with the approval of the Treasurer for its private health insurance operations and for it to invest moneys standing to the credit of its hospital and medical benefits funds. </para>
          <para>Provision is made for the Treasurer at his discretion to guarantee the repayment by the Commission of amounts it borrows. The Government&#39;s intention is that the Treasurer would provide such guarantees only in the early years of the Commission&#39;s private health insurance operations before it has built up reserves which it could give as security for its borrowings. It is not intended that the guarantees should be used to enable the Commission to borrow on more favourable terms than are generally available. I consider that the framework within which the Government proposes the Commission operate as a registered health insurance organisation will enable it to compete on equal terms with other registered organisations. </para>
          <para>I wish to draw the attention of honourable senators to one other provision in the Bill. The Bill provides for the repeal of existing Part 1 1a of the Act which provides for persons to be exempted from the health insurance levy by becoming Medibank contributors. These provisions have become redundant as a result of the proposal to introduce individual and family levy ceilings. I commend the Bill to the Senate. </para>

You went on to refer to the fact that you had refused me leave to ask a supplementary question because you considered or you inferred this morning that my supplementary question was going to be frivolous. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Deputy President,</inline> I question that. I want to state categorically that my supplementary question was not going to be frivolous.

              <para>Representatives of Mount Isa Mines Limited made submissions to me about the proposed land rights legislation prior to the introduction of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976. Submissions made by the Company related to provisions in the previous Bill affecting the interests of mining companies and particularly the interests held by Mount Isa Mines Limited in the McArthur River area. After the introduction of the Bill, when consideration was being given to the possible deferment of hearings on a number of matters part-heard by the Interim Land Commissioner, my Department contacted the Company by telephone to inquire whether it was, as previously advised, anxious that the hearings on claims in the McArthur River area should be completed as soon as possible. It was indicated that the Company did not wish to press for an early resumption of hearings pending finalisation of the Land Rights Bill. The basic decision to defer further hearings of claims by Aboriginals to traditional land in the Northern Territory until after the passage of the Land Rights Bill had been taken by the Government in May in the context of its consideration of the provisions of the BUI. </para>

In 1973 some members of the Aboriginal community at New Mapoon initiated a move to return to their traditional land at Mapoon. After extensive consultation with officers of my Department, funds were provided at the community&#39;s request to assist members to re-establish themselves on their traditional land. The Mapoon Community Council was established to assist in this regard. Since December 1975 the people who had moved from New Mapoon back to Mapoon have since moved to other locations and no one has lived at Mapoon since then.

            <para>Telecom Australia has advised that Football Park has been mainly used for football on one half day per week from approximately April to October each year, and on the odd occasion it has been a venue of other public entertainmentsports events, etc. </para>
            <para>While Telecom Australia recognises the community need for public telephones by providing this service, often on an uneconomic basis, it is necessary to require that each public telephone receive at least a minimum amount of use to partially compensate towards the high cost of its provision and maintenance. </para>
            <para>Although public telephones may be provided in restricted areas, the likely use of public telephones installed within Football Park would fall far short of that required to support one or more installations. </para>
            <para>Consideration has also been given to the provision of public telephones outside Football Park but here again the likely use would be insufficient to cover costs. </para>
            <para>In Telecom Australia&#39;s negotiations with the South Australian National Football League several offers have been made with regard to provision of red coin telephones to be leased by that organisation, but so far the offers have not been taken up. </para>
