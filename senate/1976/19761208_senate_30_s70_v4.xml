          <quote>
            <para class="block">To the Honourable the  President  and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled: The humble petition of the undersigned citizens of Canberra and electors in the Divisions of Fraser and Canberra respectfully showeth: </para>
            <para>That in response to the National Capital Development Commission proposals for urban development of the foothills of Mount Ainslie and Mount Maura we wish to make it known that we are opposed to any urban development of these foothills beyond that which already exists, for the following reasons. </para>
            <list type="decimal-dotted">
              <item label="1.">
                <para>The foothills are important to Canberra as a city with an outstanding international reputation for promoting balance between urban development and the preservation of environments which complement that development, a balance which would be lost if urban development is permitted to extend any higher on the foothills. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="2.">
                <para>The area is of significant scenic value as an integral part of the Walter Burley Griffin Canberra plan, a plan which has been adopted by Canberra&#39;s citizens and which embodies the concept of a garden city; the natural bushland of the foothills being a vital element of that concept. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="3.">
                <para>Having this unique woodland area in the centre of the National Capital provides a readily accessible facility which enables people to identify with what remains of their bushland heritage. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="4.">
                <para>The foothill woodlands have considerable educational value in their flora, fauna, geology and geography in close proximity to students of diverse age in the formal and informal education process. This value will increase as Canberra&#39;s population increases. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="5.">
                <para>The foothills have recreational value to a wide range of people for trail walks, school outings, children&#39;s recreation and development, leisurely walks for more elderly residents, for fitness and training exercises, for orienteering and for relaxation and retreat from the pressures of urban life. This recreational value will increase particularly if areas in old Canberra as it now exists are developed to house a larger population. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="6.">
                <para>The foothills remain one of the best surviving examples of Eucalyptus melliodora and Eucalyptus blakely: woodland. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="7.">
                <para>The foothills and the mountain together form an environment which sustains special members of Australia&#39;s fauna, the grey kangaroo and swamp wallaby, which can be frequently observed grazing on the foothills. The area is in practice an open fauna reserve in the heart of the National Capital. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="8.">
                <para>Canberra residents and local residents in particular have come to appreciate the foothills as a permanent element in the landscape of their city. Local residents in particular have made investments and lifelong decisions on the basis of the performance of the bushland which exists at this time on the foothills. </para>
              </item>
              <item label="9.">
                <para>The foothills are a unique and irreplaceable property asset to the community as a whole, an asset which should not be transferred to a very small minority as would occur if urban development is permitted. </para>
              </item>
            </list>
            <para>Your petitioners therefore humbly pray that the Government recognises the recreational, educational and environmental value to the Canberra community and to the National Capital of the bushland of the Mount Ainslie, Mount Maura area of which the foothills form a vital and integral part and that the Government takes measures to ensure that there is no residential, commercial, roadway or other urban infrastructural development beyond that which already exists on these foothills and that the Government takes measures to ensure the preservation of this area as a nature reserve for the benefit of the present and future generations. </para>
            <para>And your petitioners as in duty bound will ever pray. </para>

            <para>On behalf of the wide cross section of thousands of Australians of Hungarian origin, who understand Hungarian, and have knowledge of the more than a thousand year old Hungarian culture, and have good taste, protest in this way as a last resort, because all our efforts to date for a fundamental change have been in vain. </para>
            <para>Your petitioners most humbly pray that this Senate in Parliament assembled should help the Hungarian speaking community to regain confidence in the democratically elected Senate known for its conscientious and wise judgement in restoring peace and faith in democratic principles, which unfortunately are missing from the present management set-up of the Ethnic Radio broadcasters. The petitioners aim is to help with advice, and not to control the broadcasting, and for this we would very much appreciate the opportunity for a small selected delegation to meet the Ministers concerned. </para>

I ask: Is it correct that an interdepartmental committee has been considering a number of options to enable the transfer of a greater share of the cost of education from the Commonwealth to the States? Does the report of the Id deal with the roles of the 4 education commissions? Were the 4 commissions represented on the Id?

            <para>-During the course of this year, by the use of interdepartmental committees and other methods, the Government has been gathering information with regard to, in the first place, the co-ordination and rationalisation of education throughout Australia- a move which is regarded as highly desirable not only by the Commonwealth but also by the States and which was regarded as such by the previous Whitlam Government- and has been looking at the question of cost sharing with regard to education. It is true that one or more interdepartmental committees have been looking at these matters. It is not the practice of governments- this one or ones of the past- to give details concerning interdepartmental committees. There has been full consultation with all the elements of my Department and the commissions in what has been undertaken. I am hopeful that, in the early future, we may be able to announce to the people of Australia the outcome of the Government&#39;s deliberations on these significant matters. </para>

            <para>- I have a question for the Minister representing the Treasurer. It concerns the deductibility of superannuation contributions for taxation purposes. Following the 2 recent royal commissions on taxation, Ligertwood and As prey, both finding that self-employed people were unjustly treated in the deductibility of superannuation contributions from assessable income, it appears that this injustice is continuing in that taxation paid by self-employed people appears to help fund the employer contribution to Commonwealth Government employees&#39; superannuation and yet self-employed people receive no similar matching benefit. As this injustice has been recognised and rectified in other countries such as New Zealand and Canada, is it not possible for our Government to take similar action? </para>

            <para>-If any such rectification of the taxation legislation is required, it would be contemplated by the Government that it would be done in the Budget context. I think the honourable senator would be aware that both the Prime Minister and the Treasurer have said on a number of occasions that the Government has put to searching study the whole question of taxation in Australia. The Government is awaiting the results of those investigations. When Cabinet has made up its mind as a result of those investigations, no doubt the Prime Minister or the Treasurer will make a statement on them. </para>

            <para>- I preface my question to the Minister representing the Minister for National Resources by reminding him of statements by members on the Government side during the debate on uranium and at other times that uranium was needed to help solve the energy crisis caused by the ever-decreasing reserves of oil. I remind the Minister that in answers to questions No. 1286 and No. 902 he indicated that there were only 20 years&#39; reserves of U308-they will expire in about 1995-37 years&#39; of crude oil and 38 years&#39; of natural gas. In the light of this information which has been supplied by the Minister I ask him how he can justify his Government&#39;s stated policy that uranium is needed to help overcome the energy crisis, especially as uranium reserves will not even outlive oil reserves? Will the Government now accept the fact that there is and will continue to be an energy crisis even if uranium is used, and will he therefore urge the Government immediately to appropriate substantial funds to foster research into alternative energy sources? </para>

I do not know whether that is what the honourable senator is really interested in or whether by his question he is more interested in trying to make an argument that uranium ought to be left in the ground. If he is trying to say that, I think he ought to say it straight out. One would imagine that with the continuing population explosion in the world Australia, as one of the more fortunate nations, has an obligation to see that disadvantaged people around the world have access to our resources of all sorts. I would hope that that would be the view of the Opposition also. </para>

            <para>- My question is directed to the Minister representing the Minister for Environment, Housing and Community Development. As the performances of Australian athletes at the last Olympiad have now been analysed and I understand are in the process of being studied by the Government with the intention of endeavouring to improve our standards with better training methods and facilities and greater Government sponsorship of overseas competition, will the Minister consider supplying to all sporting bodies comprehensive literature denouncing the use of anabolic ster i ods by many overseas countries to achieve questionable improvement in their athletes&#39; performances, with scant or no consideration of the present controversy raging in medical circles as to the long term injurious effects on such athletes? I urge the publication of this material on 2 grounds; firstly and most importantly, to protect the health and well being of our young men and women and, secondly, to ensure that at least the Australian athlete will be able to exhibit all the high ideals of true amateurism and not be tempted to succumb to this outright cheating by the use of drugs to attain tainted international honours. </para>

I think it is of importance that it should be put under study. I will bring the question to the attention of my colleague, the Minister, in another place. </para>

However I am game enough to ask the Leader of the Government, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Withers,</inline> a question. I remind him quickly that on 28 November the Treasury announced a 17.5 per cent devaluation. On the next day the Prime Minister said there would be no tariff cuts. On 1 December a tariff review was promised on imports not competitive with Australian made goods. On 2 December interest rates rose. On 7 December the Australian dollar was up valued, the Cabinet decided on tariff cuts and abolished the Treasury. Has not this Government, which obtained office by a series of questionable confidence tricks only 12 months ago, now found that retribution has set in and that the people of Australia and the business community, are in a state of abject uncertainty? When can the people of Australia expect someone to turn on a kindly light to show the way amid the encircling gloom? </para>

            <para>-I assume that is supposed to be a question; I rather thought it was a speech. I cannot understand what the honourable senator is all excited about. Perhaps what he is really suggesting to us is that we should follow the example of our predecessors and have a different Treasurer about every 6 weeks, with a different program and a different problem. When one looks at the chaos and the confusion, the sackings of Ministers and all the rest that happened in the period the Opposition held office I think it sits rather ill on Opposition supporters to come into this place with all this sanctimonious humbug in an attempt to lecture us on what is happening at the moment. The real problem is, of course, that the Opposition is enraged that the Government&#39;s economic policies are working and that inflation is coming down. </para>

I must say, however, that business confidence is far better this year than it was under our predecessors who spent almost 3 years destroying it totally. The memories of honourable senators opposite who are interjecting really are very short. Business, consumers and taxpayers had so much confidence in the Government of last year that it suffered the greatest electoral defeat in the history of the Australian Parliament.

            <para>- My question, which is directed to the Minister for Education, is related to the study of human nutrition in Australia, especially in the light of the widespread occurrence of problems of over-nutrition and poor nutritional practice in our society at present. Is the Minister aware of a recent gift of $500,000 from a private citizen, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alexander</inline> Boden of Sydney, to establish Australia&#39;s first chair of human nutrition within the University of Sydney? Does the Government place a high value on the study of human nutrition and are there any plans for the Government, possibly in the form of collaboration between the Department of Education and the Department of Health, to attempt to match this private endeavour and to extend the study of human nutrition within our universities? </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Baume</inline>asks me, in effect, 3 questions. He asks, first of all, whether I am aware of a very significant gift made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Alexander</inline> Boden. I am aware of that gift. I have had the privilege of meeting <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Boden</inline> and acknowledging to him the importance of what he has done as a good Australian in a significant area. The fact that the first chair of human nutrition is to be established at the University of Sydney is of major importance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> may be aware that only recently a seminar on nutrition was held, I think, at the University of New South Wales. I was privileged to open that seminar and I spent the whole day there. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I think it is important in answering the honourable senator&#39;s question that I should make a number of points. Or course, at that seminar stress was placed on the fact that malnutrition in the sense of bad diet was affecting primarily Aborigines and that, in terms of mature aged diabetics, we had a problem of obesity. There is some under nourishment in Aboriginal children. But the overwhelming report of that symposium was that today obesity is identified as the primary cause of cardiovascular disease and, in statistical form, is identified as being significant in malignancies. Taken together, this operates in terms of the major threat to the health and survival of the Australian people. That being so, I have been asked whether the Commonwealth Government would co-operate in educational plans for nutrition in Australia. Again, overwhelmingly the medical evidence is that prophylaxis prevention is infinitely better than palliative if some kind of cardiovascular disease has occurred. </para>
          <para>I have invited the various authorities to submit their plans to the Government. I understand that the Curriculum Development Centre of the Commonwealth Department of Health is looking at projects in the health nutrition area. We would be immensely interested in this. I am also informed that the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation is undertaking valuable work in this regard. I do want to stress that as has been represented to me, the primary threat to health in terms of degenerative disease in Australia is in fact malnutrition in terms of obesity. </para>

Consideration of these matters is going ahead in my Department and to the extent that I have had time to do so in recent weeks attention has been given to this matter by me. I have a timetable which we hope to meet as far as government decisions on these matters are concerned. I expect that there will be a series of Government decisions during the autumn session. Very likely, legislation will be introduced in regard to a number of these matters in that session. In view of the size of the report and the complexity of a large number of these matters I think there is little likelihood of any actual announcements of decisions being made in the coming weeks. But as I said, I would expect a number of announcements of decisions and perhaps legislation to be introduced in the autumn session. </para>

            <para>- I have some information on this matter from the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. I understand that his Department did approve migrant entry of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stewart,</inline> subject to completion of health and character requirements in May of this year. Unfortunately <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stewart</inline> could not be interviewed and could not undertake the health and other formalities during a visit to Calcutta by an immigration officer in late July. Similarly, because of the number of applications already in the pipeline in Calcutta, it was not possible to interview <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stewart</inline> on the next trip there in mid-October. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stewart</inline> has been sent a telegram inviting him to visit New Delhi to complete formalities. The only available alternative is for him to wait for the next visit by an immigration officer to Calcutta in the first week in February. The main reason for the delays in processing applications in New Delhi is the lack of available officers in Bombay and Calcutta earlier this year. This has added to delays in processing applications. I will refer the question to the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs to see whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Stewart&#39;s</inline> entry can be expedited. </para>

            <para>- I do not have the precise figures on this matter before me. I will get them for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas.</inline> It is true that in recent years the deficits of State railways have accelerated in an astronomic fashion and are now dominating the budgets of the State governments. In the case of those State railways which have been transferred to the Commonwealth, this will represent a significantly heavy drain upon the Commonwealth. It is true that if the deficits continue they will represent a highly significant part of the actual personal income tax paid by individual taxpayers. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Thomas</inline> mentioned the figure of 7 per cent. I am not informed of the figure but I imagine it would be in that vicinity. There are a number of major problems concerning financing of the deficits. The overwhelming problem is the steady decline in consumer usage of public transport in Australia. This is a world-wide phenomenon as the honourable senator will know. Endeavours are made by expert study to offset this problem by improving the quality of the rolling stock and the quality of service. My colleague in another place has these matters under study. It is an intractable problem. I will bring the question to the attention of the Minister and get the specific details on the arithmetical problems posed to me. </para>

            <para>- I direct a question to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick.</inline> It follows the one he has just answered. Is the Senate to understand that the Government has no intention of making any offer for the transfer to the Commonwealth of the railway debts the 4 States which have not up to now made an arrangement with the Commonwealth for such a transfer? In view of the information the Minister has just given, which indicated clearly the increasing enormous financial burden on the States as a result of their railway debts, is the Government considering some alternative means whereby the railway debt problem of those States may be alleviated? </para>

            <para>- It does not solve the problem of the under-utilisation of public transport simply to transfer the debt from State to Federal taxpayers. That is, in effect, the essence of what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wriedt</inline> is saying to the Senate. The question would be more sensible, if I may say so, if it where directed to methods of solution of the problem. I am unaware of any plans that the Commonwealth Government has to offer the States in respect of any take-overs by the Commonwealth. The Commonwealth Government has expressed it views at various times regarding the nature of the takeovers in the other States. I have no doubt in the world that my colleague in another place has many concepts which through co-operative federalism would enable help and encouragement to be given to the States to improve their rolling stock and increase public utilisation. However, it is because of the essential paternalism of the Federal Opposition that it cannot conceive that problems can be solved at State level if the States are given the incentive to resolve those problems. The whole of the bedevilment of the 3 years of the Whitlam Government was the belief which was peddled that the States should not even be helped to resolve their problems and that the only solution was a central takeover. That concept is rejected by my Government. </para>

I am able to advise that recently I received a letter from one of the organisations referring to the establishment of such an institute, and the letter gave me information on the progress which the organisation had been able to make. The sorts of matters referred to me were the substantial support it had found in the community for the establishment of an institute and the discussions which it had held with the Canberra College of Advanced Education regarding the siting of an institute in that establishment. Perhaps my colleague the Minister for Education has some knowledge of the progress of that matter. The letter which came to me gave me that sort of information, and I have referred it to the Department for study to see what assistance it might be appropriate and possible for us to give towards the establishment of the institute. I have nothing further to add at this stage. </para>

I refer to a petition organised by the Australia-Israeli Medical Association, signed by 260 doctors throughout Australia and delivered to the U.S.S.R. Embassy in March 1976, seeking justice for <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Mikhail</inline> Shtern of Vinnitsa Ukraine, who for an extended period has been under arrest and denied migration to Israel. Is the Australian Government prepared to make representations to the U.S.S.R. authorities in support of the representations of so many Australian citizens who are concerned with the treatment of <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Shtern,</inline> in breach of basic human rights? </para>

            <para>- My question is addressed to the Minister representing the Minister for Post and Telecommunications. I refer to the joint statement by the Minister for Immigration and the Minister for Post and Telecommunications some 3 months ago about the future of ethnic radio in Australia and subsequent questions which I have directed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Carrick</inline> and the answers thereto. I now ask the Minister Has the Government yet determined the future of ethnic radio and what structure will apply to the administration of ethnic radio in Australia? Has the Australian Broadcasting Commission continued to decline to take responsibility for ethnic radio? Did the Minister for Post and Telecommunications say in Sydney 3 weeks ago that, if the ABC continued to decline to assume responsibility for it, he would establish an ethnic radio commission? What is the present position? </para>

Because I am not aware of it, I cannot answer what would logically flow from it and that is the allegation that some alternative may be involved. My understanding was that the ABC was considering the matter but that it felt that it would need some time in which to work out the method of handling ethnic radio. I am not aware therefore of any new changes but I shall direct the question to the Minister concerned and ask him to provide the relevant facts. </para>

            <para>- My question concerning cigarette advertising in the Australian Capital Territory and the Northern Territory falls somewhat between the responsibilities of the Department of the Northern Territory, the Department of the Capital Territory and the Department of Health. I understand, after some initial hesitation, that it will be taken up by the Minister representing the Minister for Health. I ask: Has the present Government altered in any way, either by making more restrictive or by relaxing, the regulations in relation to display advertising of cigarettes and tobacco products in either the A.C.T. or the Northern Territory? What are the present restrictions on the advertising of tobacco products in the Australian Capital Territory and Northern Territory, excluding restrictions on the use of electronic media? </para>

            <para>-I have no hesitation in giving the information that I have on this subject. As I understand it, except in the Federal Territories, legislative power to regulate cigarette advertising in media other than radio and television is vested exclusively in the States. The first State to attempt to introduce such legislation was Tasmania, where the Bill was defeated in the Upper House of the Parliament. The matter was discussed again at the 1976 Health Ministers conference but the States foresaw difficulties in applying restrictions to advertising of articles such as clothing and smoking accessories. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Discussions are being held with the Department of the Capital Territory on the whole question of cigarette advertising and smoking generally in the Australian Capital Territory. However, it is important that any action taken in the Territory be in concert with the States. The Government has made no alteration to the law in respect of the advertising of cigarette and tobacco products in either of the mainland Territories. Apart from the prohibition on advertising in the electronic media, there are no restrictions on the advertising of cigarettes and tobacco products. The question of the possible introduction of restrictions on tobacco advertising and on smoking in public areas is being examined and initial discussions have been held by the Department of Health with the authorities concerned. </para>

He will be aware of a recent statement by the Minister he represents to the effect that the Prices Justification Tribunal would be expected to hold back price increases caused by devaluation and that the Tribunal would be able to use its initiative under section 16 of the Prices Justification Tribunal Act for this purpose.

            <para>-Senator Tehan referred to a statement by the Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs. I think I should again refer briefly to that statement in view of some aspects of his question which I do not think are quite in line with what my colleague said. The Minister for Business and Consumer Affairs stated that he has conferred with the  Chairman  of the Prices Justification Tribunal concerning possible price abuse following the devaluation of the Australian dollar; that he had requested that special attention be given to price notifications coming before the Tribunal where increases were being sought in consequence of the devaluation and that he had asked that particular attention be given where there may have been some evidence that increases were occurring in respect of goods which had been purchased by re-sellers prior to devaluation. Those are the major points to which the statement by the Minister was directed. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>As to the question whether the Government will consider making any changes to the procedures of the Prices Justification Tribunal in order to implement the requests that have been made, the answer is that the Government is not considering any such changes. Amendments to the Prices Justification Act were passed by the Senate the other day. The Government is not contemplating any changes in its procedures or powers other than those that, as I said earlier, were passed this week. The Government is satisfied that the power contained in section 1 6 of the Act, whereby the Tribunal may of its own volition and motion investigate any complaints that may be made to it or any indications that it has of unjustified price increases, is a sufficient power, particularly as it is coupled with a power conferred on the Minister to request a specified investigation. These powers are not limited to cases where there is the requirement of notice by a company before it increases its prices. </para>
          <para>I think it should be further pointed out that these procedures have worked successfully during the year. That is, of course, one of the reasons why the Government has decided to maintain the Prices Justification Tribunal. In fact, I am advised that no cases have been brought to the attention of the Government or the Tribunal of companies having endeavoured to put up prices or having put up prices when the procedures of the Tribunal are being followed. So, even though some time may be taken by these inquiries, companies have nevertheless observed those requirements and have not endeavoured to beat the Tribunal in putting up prices contrary to the procedures which are laid down in the legislation. </para>

In an earlier question on notice I asked the Minister what steps the Government had taken to implement the Racial Discrimination Act and I was told in reply that all parts of the Act became operative on 3 1 October of this year. I ask: How can that answer be correct, since the conciliation committees provided for in section 23 of the Act have not yet been established and the Community Relations Council provided for in section 41 of the Act has not yet been established? Further, when will the first report of the Commissioner for Community Relations be tabled in the Parliament?

I have just conferred with my colleague, the Minister for Social Security, and she has not heard of any legal challenge to the ruling referred to which has been discussed at great length in recent days in this place. I will pass the question on to the Attorney-General to see whether he knows anything about it. I will also refer the question of legal aid to him. </para>

I refer to the article in today&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> on the ambiguous nature of the discretion of the Director-General of the Department of Social Security in refusing or allowing the unemployment benefit to be paid to school leavers. If the Director-General can grant the unemployment benefit if he is satisfied with the procedures under section 107(c)(m) of the Social Services Act, will the Minister instruct him to withdraw the letters currently going out to applicants saying that they will not be paid before the end of the school vacation? </para>

It was the Director-General who decided that he would send a letter to all the people who applied for the unemployment benefit.  His  discretion and responsibilities under the Act are defined, and it was in terms of those that he sent the letter referred to by the honourable senator. </para>

            <para>-I am terribly sorry to disappoint the honourable senator, but I have not read the article. As I have said, I have much more useful things to do with my life than to spend it reading newspapers. I am surprised how honourable senators opposite manage to occupy themselves all day by just reading newspapers. That is all they seem to do here. There seems to be no capacity for original research; no capacity for original thinking or reading. They just live off the newspapers. It is amazing that they have the time each morning. They must rise early to have read them all by 10 a.m. Perhaps the reason the honourable senator refers to yesterday&#39;s newspapers is that he has not had time to read today&#39;s newspapers. I do not know whether <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Reason</inline> said what is claimed. It is a nice set of words to use. It is quite a good throw-away line. I even enjoyed the humour of it myself. As I have said, it is a nice humorous statement but I do not think it is in accordance with the facts. The Government is quite satisfied with what it is doing. I am quite certain that the public at large also feels that way. We are doing all right; do not get worried. </para>

I refer him also to a subsequent statement made by the Minister at that meeting, as well as a statement made by the Prime Minister in his weekly electoral broadcast, to the effect that as a result of devaluation average farm income would increase by some $17 a week to $143 a week. Given the fact that $150m would provide $17 a week for slightly fewer than 170 000 people, is the Government asserting that Australia has only 170 000 farmers? If not, which, if either, of the mutually exclusive statements from the Prime Minister and/or the Minister for Primary Industry is true? </para>

            <para>- Some days ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> directed a question to me regarding confusion which has arisen out of library grants in the State of Victoria and the bewilderment of some parents and citizens associations in that regard. I said that I would seek the information, and I have done so. I might add that there must be a fair amount of confusion on this matter because I have received correspondence from a large number of people. The situation is that in 1976, under the Schools Commission capital grants program, $29,280,000 was allocated to Victoria for capital expenditure on government schools. Provision was made for a recommended minimum of $2.6m of that amount to be expended on library buildings and resources. This has not been a legislative provision. It was merely an expectation on the part of the Schools Commission. Honourable senators will be aware that the actual disbursement of funds to government schools in Victoria is the responsibility of the Victorian Government. It decided how the $29,280,000 was to be distributed. Similar provisions will again apply in 1 977. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The changes in the capital allocation referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> and attributed to the Victorian Minister of Education, relate to the comparable legislative provisions of the States Grants (Schools) Act 1973-74-that is the biennium legislation- and the States Grants (Schools) Act 1976. In 1974 and 1975 the Commonwealth Government specified through legislation how much was to be expended on capital projects in government schools for each of libraries, special education, disadvantaged schools and general buildings. In 1976 the Commonwealth left it to the States themselves to determine the actual amounts to be expended on each element of the capital grants program. One amount only was specified in the legislation and the Schools Commission, in its 1976 report, included a recommended distribution of this amount to the various elements of the program. The matter therefore is one for the Victorian Minister of Education. He decides on the allocation of funds made available by the Commonwealth for expenditure on capital projects, including library buildings and resources in government schools in Victoria. </para>
          <para>The $900,000 mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> is related to non-government schools. In 1976, $7,050,000 was allocated for capital expenditure in non-government schools in Victoria. Of this amount, $900,000 was for library buildings and resources. I have approved the payment of the bulk of this amount as individual grants to non government schools in Victoria. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> may, quite inadvertently, have confused the amounts allocated for government and non government schools. But the essential fact is that the matter is specifically one for the Victorian Minister of Education. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Yesterday Senator Mulvihill</inline>asked me a question concerning the Migrant Community Services Branch of the Department of Social Security. In my answer I undertook to seek advice on the first 2 parts of his 3 -part question. Briefly, he asked whether the staff utilisation review had recommended that the Migrant Community Services Branch had been disbanded and absorbed into a new structure, and if so, what justification had been given for this change. I can advise <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulvihill</inline> that a review has been undertaken within the Department of Social Security which will make recommendations to the Director-General on whether there needs to be a rationalisation of staff resources. I understand that a draft discussion paper, in the form of an internal document which canvasses options for rationalisation of staff resources within the Social Welfare Division of the Department in which the Community Services Branch is located, has been distributed amongst officers who might be directly affected if any of the options canvassed in that paper were to be taken up. I emphasise that this paper is a discussion document only. No final recommendations have been made to the Director-General. I can assure the honourable senator and others interested in this matter that the needs of migrants in our communities are of paramount importance to us. It is to give services to migrants particularly in matters of social welfare and social security, that we review these matters from time to time. </para>

            <para>-I seek leave to table before the Senate the report of the Committee on the Teaching of Migrant Languages in Schools. The Committee was set up by the Commonwealth Government, with the agreement of the State Ministers for Education, in November 1974, with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr J.</inline> W. Mather, Assistant Secretary, Special Programs Branch, Commonwealth Department of Education, as its  Chairman.  The Committee was asked to bring together up-to-date information about the extent of the teaching of languages of migrant groups in government and non-government schools, with some details of the composition of the groups and levels of primary and secondary education at which teaching is done. It was also asked to seek and collate views about desirable courses and to make suggestions about possible lines of action. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>The major recommendation of the Committee is that education authorities should create widespread opportunities for children to study migrant languages and cultures in schools. The Committee emphasised that schools themselves should take the initiative in deciding to what extent and in what ways migrant languages and cultures should be studied after consultation between school principals, teachers, parents and the community. Such consultation would help the school to be able to respond to the expressed educational needs of the children in its area. The Committee also suggested that education authorities consider establishing a co-operative program, of limited duration and with defined funding, to implement its detailed recommendations for the teaching of migrant languages and cultures in schools. </para>
        <para>It is pleasing to note that the Committee&#39;s recommendations endorse the Government&#39;s stated policy on recognising and encouraging the multi-cultural nature of the Australian community. The Government&#39;s policy on Immigration and Ethnic Affairs states that Australians should be encouraged to develop an understanding of the cultures, language and history of migrant source countries, that appropriate ethnic studies should be introduced into teacher training curricula and that ethnic communities should be consulted and supported in their own programs of ethnic education. Schools are in a position to play a key role in relation to the overall implementation of this policy. The Prime Minister further stated in his policy spe&#34;ech in November 1975: &#39;The transmission and perpetration of ethnic languages and culture in Australian and ethnic schools will be encouraged and supported &#39;. After this tabling the report will be publicly released so that it may be widely discussed. </para>

        <para>I think every honourable senator appreciates the importance of this project I think the Minister for Education <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Carrick)</inline> will appreciate the comments I want to make. I will give a positive example of the effectiveness of these operations. Many of us know of situations in which teenage illegal migrants have passed a technical college examination of a far higher standard than exists in Australia. Emergency operations have been carried out by bodies such as those mentioned in the report to salvage such persons I do not say this in a disparaging way- and get them into the Australian work force quickly. I instance the case of a number of eastern European illegal migrants, metalliferous miners, who after speaking to the Australian Workers Union and certain employers, and following liaison with the Department of Immigration and Ethnic Affairs, were given crash courses in their occupation. I am pleased to say that now the door has been unlocked each of them has entered a key industry. </para>
        <para>The report refers to the women who voluntarily visit migrants&#39; homes. I think they are doing a tremendous job. I know that the secretary of my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sibraa,</inline> is one of those girls who give up two or three nights a week. This is the product of a bipartisan approach. It breaks the sound barrier with married women. After all, we believe that it is vital to reunite families. I could say a lot more but on that theme I seek leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para>

          <para>That the Senate take note of the paper. </para>
        </quote><para class="block">In presenting this progress report to the Senate, I want to comment on the nature of the inquiry and to draw attention to some interesting aspects that have been noted by the Committee in the evidence it has reviewed so far. The first point I would like to make concerns the terms of reference of the inquiry. The Committee has interpreted the terms of reference as intending it not just to confine its investigations to employment of musicians within the Australian Broadcasting Commission itself but also to seek the views and opinions of individuals and other organisations which also are involved in the welfare, training and employment of professional musicians in Australia. The Committee has adopted this approach so as to develop a background or perspective against which it can carry out a more accurate appraisement of the role of the Australian Broadcasting Commission as an employer of professional musicians in Australia. </para><para>In the event, this approach has proved to be of value because it has given the Committee a wide range of opinions and comments from a large cross section of the Australian music fraternity, including individuals and organisations which have some association with the Australian Broadcasting Commission orchestras, and also those which compete with them. The Committee is assessing these comments and will be giving the Commission an opportunity to respond to them at a later public hearing. </para><para>Apart from issues which have a direct bearing on the ABC orchestras, the inquiry has also highlighted a number of other important aspects concerning the Australian music scene to which the Committee will make reference in its final report. In making some observations on the origin of this reference, there seems to be little doubt that this matter was referred to the Committee by the Senate as a result of reports that were circulating earlier this year suggesting that internal economy measures under consideration at the time by the ABC would include the possible dismantling of some of the Commission&#39;s six symphony orchestras. </para><para>The Committee assumed that this would be an important issue in the inquiry but written and oral evidence presented by the ABC at public hearings suggests that, at that time, the Commission had no such cut-backs in mind. Further evidence has indicated that the then reported cut-backs were based mainly on speculation. However, in spite of the evidence, the Committee has noted since it began its public hearings, that there have been further reports that the Commission&#39;s orchestras are vulnerable to cut back. It is evident that this latest concern for the ABC&#39;s orchestras has been fuelled by the reported critical ABC budgetary position and the recent release of the Industries Assistance Commission and Green reports, both of which have queried the ABC&#39;s need for six symphony orchestras. Although there has been much public discussion on the future of the orchestras, only a limited amount of this concern has been reflected in written and oral evidence received by the Committee so far in this inquiry. </para><para>Finally, I would like to mention some of the interesting issues that have emerged from the Committee&#39;s review of evidence at this stage. It has been suggested that the ABC orchestras should move away from their traditional concept of &#39;broadcast orchestras&#39; and be used in a wider community context such as more live performances at concerts, greater use in school concerts and to provide a more extended service to such organisations as state opera, ballet and theatre companies as well as choral societies. There has been a significant amount of evidence relating to a &#39;proficiency gap&#39; between the music standards of graduates from the tertiary training institutions and those required for entry into an ABC symphony orchestra. The Committee has been told of the need for more effective music education at the primary and secondary school levels aimed not only at instrumental instruction but also at educating future generations for a better understanding and appreciation of fine music. </para><para>There is evidence pointing to a general shortage in Australia of musicians who are of a standard suitable for permanent employment in an ABC symphony orchestra. This shortage is particularly acute in string instrumentalists. The Committee has been told of the need for more post graduate music training to narrow the gap between the training institution and the professional career. It has been contended that there is a lack of employment opportunities for resident Australian soloists and that many seek employment opportunities overseas. In addition to the evidence taken in this inquiry, the Committee will also be taking note of the IAC and Green reports and will be presenting its final report early in the 1977 autumn sittings of the Senate. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para>

            <para>-This report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on the Australian Capital Territory examines and makes recommendations concerning the system of waste collection, disposal and management in Canberra. The Committee has placed particular emphasis on the need to find some alternative to the traditional landfill method of disposal, which makes little provision for the recovery and re-use of important resources. The report stresses the need to preserve many resources such as metal, glass and paper which are often indiscriminately disposed of in the existing system of waste collection and disposal. The Committee has therefore examined alternative waste collection methods, both for domestic and other waste materials, and has examined new technology available to separate resources before final disposal or for recycling. It is essential that these matters are constantly reviewed by planning and management authorities so that proposals for the introduction of new arrangements or disposal techniques in the Capital Territory should be the most effective available given the size of the Territory and the related region, which may be associated in this respect, and the need to re-use important materials. This is a responsibility we should be ready to accept and on which we should begin to take action now to preserve vital resources. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>There are a number of recommendations concerning recycling and the need for increased public awareness of the benefits of measures to conserve valuable materials which are currently disposed of simply as &#39;waste&#39;. This need to recycle resources led the Committee to question some aspects of the National Capital Development Commission&#39;s and the Department of the Capital Territory&#39;s approach to the landfill method of waste disposal. This is not to suggest that any existing method for disposal could entirely replace the landfill method. The need for landfill will remain for the foreseeable future. But a number of measures could be taken to overcome some apparent problems with this means of disposal. For example, &#39;tips&#39; should be sited so as to cause the least inconvenience to the public. Access roads and approaches should create the least possible nuisance to residents, either as a result of heavy traffic at particular times or because of litter falling from trailers and trucks on their way to disposal sites. We refer to problems that have arisen, for example, in Belconnen. These sites should also be managed so that they can be converted to community use in the shortest possible time after the landfill process has been completed. It was also felt that if the authorities encouraged separation of recyclable items for collection and re-use, the impact of landfill could be reduced. This led the Committee to question the &#39;total collection&#39; system suggested by NCDC and the Department of the Capital Territory. This method does not in the Committee&#39;s view do enough to facilitate recovery of resources and might, in effect, discourage separation and recycling. </para>
        <para>The Committee has therefore suggested a scheme whereby separate containers would be supplied to householders for the collection of particular classes of waste such as paper, glass and metal. An intensive and concerted advertising and information campaign would be required to ensure the public co-operation essential for the success of the scheme. The Committee has recommended that a pilot study be conducted to test the scheme&#39;s feasibility. We do not claim to have found an answer to the waste disposal problem. But the Committee was impressed by the necessity for communities to begin examining and, where possible, introducing systems for the collection and disposal of waste whereby resource conservation, recovery and recycling are seen as essential goals. The Committee is not as concerned that its proposed scheme be implemented in every particular as to be assured that the authorities in the Australian Capital Territory will begin to move in the direction indicated by the philosophy behind the proposals. We consider moves in this direction to be essential and inevitable for all communities. We hope the recommendations of the Committee will be seen as contributing to this process of reassessing assumptions and testing new means of collecting and disposing of the vast quantities of &#39;waste&#39; materials generated by our society. The Committee was also concerned to find a number of deficiencies in legislation in the Australian Capital Territory relating to the issues before it. These arise in such areas as the enforcement of regulations which deal with littering, pollution of the air and disposal of radio-active waste. The Committee has directed the attention of the Minister for the Capital Territory and his Department and the Australian Capital Territory Legislative Assembly to these matters, which, should be dealt with as soon as practicable. </para>
        <para>In this brief statement I have not attempted to deal with all of the issues considered by the Committee or on which it has made recommendations. The subject is one of such complexity that the Committee might well have extended its inquiry. Although this reference has been with the Committee for two years, the present Committee had only one member of the former Committee among its members. The Committee has also undertaken a considerable workload during the current period of sittings. Senators will recall that two substantial reports on proposals to vary the plan of Canberra have been presented in the past 2 months. Thus, while the Committee could well have dealt with some aspects of the reference before it in greater detail, for example, the financial implications of various schemes of collection and disposal of waste, it was considered that the report should be presented at this stage as a contribution to the growing debate on the issues with which it deals. I would also draw the attention of senators to the bibliography which will be printed with the report. This was prepared by the staff of the Parliamentary Library. The Committee was impressed with the range and comprehensiveness of this bibliography and felt that it should be made available to the Parliament and the public through this report. Unfortunately printed copies of the report will not be available for distribution today. It was not possible for printing to be completed. Copies of the report will, however, become available within the next 2 weeks. </para>
        <para>I conclude by thanking all members of the Committee for the time and effort they have put in to producing this report at a time when the Parliament has been particularly busy. I would also thank, on behalf of all members of the Committee, the staff of the secretariat, both past and present, who have put in an enormous amount of effort to ensure that this report could be presented before the Parliament rises. I know that all senators are aware of the contribution which staff of the parliamentary departments frequently make in such circumstances but I would pay special tribute on this occasion to the work of the Parliamentary Joint Committee staff. I commend the report to the Senate. </para>

Included in the reference is a request that the Committee pay particular regard to the National Water Policy Statement. I merely ask the Committee to examine also the work, the report and the recommendations of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution because this reference today represents and opportunity to make an historical advance on the work carried out between 1968 and 1970. </para>

            <para>- Last evening I pointed out that the former Government could have accepted my motion on compensation for dispossession which was carried by the Senate. The former Government could have implemented some of the recommendations contained in my speech to that motion. Unfortunately the then Government did not see fit to do that. I shall not pursue the matter at this stage. But I feel that it is relevant now to point out those facts to the Senate and to members of the former Government. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Malcolm Fraser)</inline> and his Government have stated categorically that the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill must be passed by this Parliament this session. I am proud to say that the Government places a great deal of importance on what this Bill means to my people and intends to keep faith with them. I intend to do nothing to prevent that from happening. I agree with the Government, the Prime Minister and the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> that this is an important Bill, the passage of which means keeping faith with the Aboriginal community of this nation. Much can be said of the Bill. Some concern has been expressed about it. As I said during my speech last evening, this Bill is perhaps not the ultimate or the best. Perhaps there are provisions in it which are not in accordance with the thinking of some people. But it is a Bill of great significance. I want to see it passed by this House. I had hoped that a bipartisan approach to this important Bill would have been adopted by all members of this chamber. </para>
          <para>We, the Aboriginal people of this country, have known many atrocities and much suffering in the past. We are conscious of what we have been deprived and of our dispossession. But Aboriginal people in their natural habitat are a kind, gentle people. We are now seeking compensation. Some of us are demanding compensation. We want this compensation. We want recognition of our entitlements. But we want to retain our former attitudes. We do not want to do what white men did to us. We want to work in harmony. I believe that my elders in the tribal situation in the Northern Territory would wish this. We do not want to dispossess other people. We do not want to force on other people that which was forced on us, but we do want what is rightfully ours and we want just treatment in whatever is to happen in relation to land rights in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>I have sat as a member of this chamber for some 5Vi years now. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> that, in that 5Vi years, I have never seen one member of the Australian Labor Party vote against his Party. He follows directly down the Party line because he dares do nothing else. Members of the Opposition have constantly challenged members on this side of the chamber to do what they do not have the courage to do. On occasion, I have practised my right of conscience and I have taken that short walk across the chamber. I have never seen a member of the Labor Party do that. I have never seen <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> do it. Surely being human beings- being people- we must have a conscience and there must be times when our consciences differ from our party view. But honourable senators on the other side of the chamber are not prepared to take that action. Yet they challenge us to do what they do not have the courage to do. </para>
          <para>The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs foreshadowed a motion in the other place for the establishment of a joint parliamentary committee comprising the 8 members of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Aboriginal Affairs and 6 senators- three from the Government and three from the Opposition. The motion provides that the committee be required to report by 3 1 May 1 977 and that it should have the following terms of reference: Firstly, to examine and report on the operation of the provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 relating to the identification of traditional owners of Aboriginal land and the means of establishing the views of such owners to the satisfaction of the relevant land councils; secondly, the adequacy of provisions of the law of the Northern Territory relating to entry to Aboriginal land, the protection of sacred and significant sites, wildlife conservation and entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land; and, thirdly, any other matters referred by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. </para>
          <para>I will be nominating to be a member of that committee. I hope that members of the Opposition also will nominate to be on that committee. Then we will be able to examine this Bill and make sure that the spirit of it is carried out, we will be able to examine what the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is proposing in these very important areas in relation to complementary legislation, we will be able to ensure that the Aboriginal commissions are doing their jobs satisfactorily, that they are the servants of the traditional owners and that they will be working to ensure that the rights of the traditional owners are preserved, and we will be able to exercise an oversight to ensure that the Aboriginal people, that my tribal elders in the Northern Territory, will have their lands and that their lands will be protected. As I said last evening, I intend to stay in this chamber, God willing, for a long time yet. I, as the lone Aboriginal voice in this Parliament, together with my colleagues- men like Fred Chaney, Peter Baume, Alan Missen and quite a few others who have shown a great concern in regard to this Bill and who will be supporting me- will be watching very closely the implementation of this land rights Bill to ensure that my people are not deprived of that to which they are rightly and justly entitled. </para>
          <para>For a short time, a very short time, I would like to address myself to the members of my race. I am proud to say that some of them are sitting in the galleries today. I was very proud last evening when I saw a particular gentleman sitting in the galleries. I direct myself to the presence of Professor Stanner, a man who has fought for years for land rights for and just treatment of the Aboriginal people. As I have said, I would like to address myself for a short time to my own people. I ask them not to be fooled and not to be taken in by the grandstanding that sometimes takes place in this chamber and outside of it. </para>

              <para>-There are 160 000-plus of us. If you will be patient and listen to what I have to say I am sure that you will agree with me when I say that this Bill is only catering for approximately 27 000 Aborigines. In this country there are 160 000 people who, under the terms of my motion, are entitled to compensation for dispossession. Whilst I am proud that 27 000 of my people are being catered for, I say to this chamber and to this nation that the time has come when the remainder of that 160 000-plus have to be recognised and compensated for their dispossession. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue>
          <para>During the course of the speech in which I moved my motion I referred to many things pertaining to compensation for dispossession. I suggested that the time had come when the Government must recognise the fact that the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders were once in possession of this nation and should introduce legislation to compensate the said indigenous people for the loss of their land. This has notappened. All that has happened is that Aborigines have been the recipients of charity- charity of the government of the day. We have seen examples of that on so many occasions. When I became a member of this Senate in 1971 the Liberal-National Country Party Government was in office. It allocated money for what was termed Aboriginal advancement. When the Australian Labor Party came to office it allocated money for Aboriginal advancement. </para>
          <para>There have been changes of government since then. There has been an increase and then there has been a decrease. Who knows what will happen next if we continue under the system that exists at the moment? What will happen in the future is that as governments change and the attitudes of people change, so will the amount of money allocated for Aborigines change, according to the will of the government of the day or its sympathy or non-sympathy or whatever the case may be. But, under the terms of my motion, the setting up of a compensation fund to be administered by competent Aborigines, the setting up of a statutory body, would enable Aborigines to use the money to which they are justly entitled in compensation for their dispossession of almost except for that provided for under this Bill- the entire nation. This nation has to answer that question some day, and the sooner the better. Professor Colin Tass wrote an article on this subject just recently. I think all members of this chamber should read it because much, if not all, of what he said is true. The matters that he pointed to as being things that could happen in the near future also bear listening to. I am happy that a section of the Aboriginal community is being catered for under this Bill. I will not be satisfied and I know that thinking Aborigines will never be satisfied until the governments of this country recognise Aborigines as the original owners of this entire nation and bring in compensation for dispossession. I will look to that day and I will continue to work for that day. I support the Bills and hope that they will be carried this day. </para>

              <para>-I do not have to be in the chamber to listen to debate. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> knows, we have piped music from this chamber into our offices. We can work and listen at the same time without any trouble. I was extremely interested in what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> had to say. My interjection was only to imply that even if only one Aboriginal was to be concerned by this legislation, he was entitled to the protection of this Parliament. The debate has been an extremely sensitive one. The subject is a very sensitive one. I listened particularly carefully to what my colleague from the Northern Territory, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson,</inline> had to say yesterday. I must congratulate him on his speech. I think he covered most areas very concisely and spoke with the true feeling he has for the Aboriginal people. I was not able to listen to another speech that was made about 8 weeks ago in Melbourne. It was also a very sensitive speech. I would like to quote part of it into the record to show the sensitivity of feeling that was expressed by the  speaker  at that time. He said: </para>

            <para>I feel sure there is almost no person in Australia who has not become aware in recent years of the relationship between Aboriginals and their land. </para>
            <para>This relationship, or kinship, is a very special kind of thing. To Aboriginals, land is indivisible with life itself. Aboriginals are one with nature, with all the animals the land supports. The features of the land are believed by the Aboriginals to have been made by spirits of the Dreamtime. </para>

          <para class="block">Those were the remarks of the Minister of Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> at the opening of the Aboriginal exhibit at &#39;Environment 76&#39; on 8 October. They show that the Minister himself feels that anything to do with Aboriginal land is a very sensitive subject. My concern in particular with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976 is that under clause 73 certain powers are to be given to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. Those powers relate to the protection of sacred sites, the entry of persons to Aboriginal land, the conservation of wildlife and the access to territorial seas. I am concerned with the clause because, as honourable senators will know, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward in his report recommended that these powers should be held by the Federal Government. I think his words were that they should be matters for Commonwealth legislation. I have to agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward. I believe that it is not only necessary but also essential that the Federal Government have that control. </para>
          <para>To illustrate that point I want to talk briefly about what has happened in my State of Western Australia within the last 2 weeks with regard to Aboriginal land. I want honourable senators to remember these actions when amendments are moved later. I hope they will recall what has already happened in Western Australia and what could happen in the Northern Territory if the land rights Bill goes through in its present form. I have spoken on a number of occasions in this place about the settlement of Oombulgurri in the north of Western Australia. I have expressed both my delight and my despair at some of the things that either were or were not happening at Oombulgurri. I want to quote an article from the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> of 25 November, just 2 weeks ago. It is not a very long article but it is a most important one. It is important in relation to this Bill. I am conscious of course that the eastern States&#39; newspapers do not cover to any great extent anything that happens in the west unless it is considered sensational, and then they might decide it is worthy of a couple of paragraphs in the back section of the paper with the comics or the sporting news. I have been concerned that many times in this chamber we have heard Government supporters and Ministers elected by the people of Western Australia say that they do not read the Western Australian newspapers. So for the benefit of those from Western Australia and from the other States I intend to read the entire article. The headline reads: </para>

            <para>- I am glad that you do. I was a bit disturbed at some of the things you had to say yesterday. The Aboriginal people have a distinctive soul feeling for their lands- the land where they lived, the land where they were conceived, and the land where they were born. All the Aboriginals know who owns that particular piece of land. A great number of the problems of the cities and the towns are being created purely and simply because traditional Aboriginal land has been taken away from traditional Aboriginal people. </para>
          </talk.start></continue><para>I have spoken before about the problems in places like Kununurra, Broome and Derby in Western Australia; particularly about Kununurra where many problems have been created by transient type Aboriginals coming into the outskirts of the townships because they have nowhere else to go and because their traditional Aboriginal land has now been buried under metres of water at the Ord River dam. One has to wonder whether those problems that are being experienced, not only by the black community but also by the white community in those townships, were in actual fact caused by the fact that the Aboriginals no longer have this soul feeling with the land. The situation there is not unique. It pertains in the Northern Territory as much as it does in Western Australia, Queensland or wherever there are numbers of Aboriginals. </para><para>The Western Australian State Government has now opened up one of the few areas where the Aboriginals were coping quite well with the community in which they were living. They were able to grow their own vegetables. They participated in the various agricultural shows being held in their areas. They were arranging housing and had asked the Government for more money so that they could have housing. They were endeavouring to provide services and goods for the 400-odd people who live on the reserve at Oombulgurri. Yet now we find that at a time when they are negotiating for mining rights on that very land the State Government has seen fit to open the land for all and sundry to compete. Anyone with a miner&#39;s right can simply make application to the Government to mine on that property. The traditional Aboriginal property that belongs to them should be maintained for them by them. If the Western Australian State Government got applications from 2 people for mining rights at Oombulgurri, one of which was from the Aboriginals who are resident on that land and the other from a large mining company, who do honourable senators think would get the guernsey? It would not be the Aborigines, not with the State Government that we have in office at the present time in Western Australia but which will change in the early months of next year. </para><para>Yesterday <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> said that this Bill allows for the protection of sacred sites. A question is raised in my mind because of my participation on a particular Senate select committee some 2 years ago. That Committee was the Senate Select Committee on Foreign Ownership and Control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sir Magnus</inline> Cormack were also members of that Committee. As part of the commission that we had received from this chamber we made a tour of all of the mining areas including the Bowen Basin, the Mt Isa mines, the bauxite mines at Gove and eventually we got out into the Northern Territory to Jabiru and Jabiluka and some other place that I cannot recall. While there we were taken to the extreme end of the lease holding. A fence was constructed to within 2 feet of what was considered to be sacred tribal land. I was concerned that we were allowing all but access to those sacred lands by people who would be working on that lease holding. I had to stop to consider then just how long it would probably be before someone violated the sacred feelings that those Aboriginals in that area have about that particular site. There were magnificent carvings that had been done many generations ago by the forebears of the Aboriginals there and perhaps some of those who are sitting in the gallery today. I was concerned when I read this BUI that there is insufficient protection for sacred sites because we have not yet clearly defined by Aboriginal standards what they consider to be sacred sites. There are many that are unknown to us. There are many that are known only to Aboriginals who live out in the middle of the Northern Territory who have very little contact if any at all with white man. So we have to be concerned on that issue as well. </para><para>Another area of concern I believe is a report that was presented to me and which was incorporated yesterday in the Senate by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keeffe)</inline> but which I understand was not read. Portions of it disturb me greatly. It is the report on the progress of the building program being undertaken at Beagle Bay in Western Australia from its inauguration in 1974 until the present time. Allegations are being made of Aboriginals resident on the mission at Beagle Bay being &#39;ripped off&#39;- I think was the expression used at one stage by the missionaries or the administrative committee that was managing the mission- and the administrative committee that was managing the mission- and the frustration of the architects who were endeavouring to set up housing facilities and sewerage facilities for the Aborigines who live there. </para><para>An integral part of all of these Bills is the housing, welfare and education of the Aboriginal people. I have spoken about this many times. I have spoken about the lack of concern being shown by the media about incidents that happen to Aboriginal people that might not necessarily have occurred if in actual fact the person had been white, not black. We have to be concerned that irrespective of what we do today the effect is not going to be felt only by those 27 000 Aboriginals who are resident in the Northern Territory but also by the 160 000 Aboriginals who live in Australia. They are all equally entitled to land rights and they are entitled to the protection of this Government- not by a government that is sitting somewhere up in Darwin when it feels so inclined and has no regular pattern of meetings and really does not have a good deal of feeling for anything other than the vested interests in its particular area. </para><para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline>said earlier that he intended nominating for the committee that is being established under the terms of reference that were set down late yesterday evening by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner).</inline> I am also one who intends nominating on behalf of my Party to participate on that committee. If this Bill has any substance, if it has the guts that is necessary to give the people their complete land rights- their true land rights-there would not be any necessity to set up such a committee. </para><interjection>

              <para>-Is it better to give them land rights or is it better to deny them land rights for perhaps another 3 months so that they have the benefit of that redrafted legislation when it comes into being or are we to have these amending Bills consistently coming up for review because the legislation is not adequate? The amendments being proposed by the Government are not adequate and no matter what we on the Opposition side do with amendments we are never going to be able to re-arrange a Bill and give it the substance that is necessary for the Aborigines to have complete control of the land to which they are entitled. Quite frankly, I am not prepared to see the Aboriginals ripped off by this Government. I am not prepared to see them ripped off by the Legislative Assembly of the Northern Territory, any more than I am prepared to see them ripped off as the report on the Beagle Bay construction suggests that they were ripped off. There is provision in this Bill and in the amendments proposed by the Government for just that kind of action to happen. </para>
            </talk.start>
          </continue><para>I am concerned not only for the Northern Territory Aboriginals but also for each and every Aboriginal throughout the length and breadth of this continent. Honourable senators opposite would do well to consider that what they determine in this place at this time will have a tremendous effect on all of those Aboriginals. Of course, I will be placing my support behind the amendments that will be moved from this side of the chamber at a later stage. I trust that at least some honourable senators opposite will take into consideration what has already occurred in this debate and that they will take great care when they cast their vote, because the Aboriginals and the people of Australia will be watching them. </para>

            <para>- in reply- We are debating 3 Bills, 2 of which are important and one of which is of historical significance. As I have arranged with the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keeffe),</inline> I shall refer briefly to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bdi (No. 2) first of all, then to the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill, and then I shall deal with the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. It would not be possible to summarise all of the points that have been made throughout the debate by honourable senators on both sides of the Senate. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> has noted the many speeches that have been made and has noted the many points which are rel event to his considerations. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I turn to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill (No. 2). The matter of whether incorporation is mandatory under the Bill was raised, first of all, by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keefee</inline> and later by other honourable senators. I wish to refer to some of the points that the Minister made when he was discussing this matter with his State colleagues and to other statements which he has made in regard to this matter. At the meeting which the Minister held with State Ministers he explained that the Bill is simply a vehicle for allowing Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities to incorporate as Aboriginal councils and groups of Aboriginals and Torres Strait Islanders to incorporate as associations. The </para>
          <para class="block">Minister&#39;s second reading speech clearly indicates that the legislation has been tailored to meet the specific needs of Aboriginals and their particular social system rather than forcing them necessarily to change their affairs, for example, into a company or into other corporate structures such as a club-type association or co-operative body. </para>
          <para>The Bill in no way interferes with matters that are the responsibility of the States. It is an exercise of the Commonwealth&#39;s constitutional powers and its responsibility to make special laws for the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people where a need is seen for that to be done. Matters have been raised with the Federal Minister by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly and by State Ministers. Those matters are receiving the consideration of the Minister. I understand that a great deal of discussion has been held on many of the matters that have been raised. In those areas in which local government already exists, the position of local government is to be preserved under subclause 1 of clause 30 of the Bill. That clause expressly provides that Aboriginal council by-laws cannot supersede the laws of the State enforcing the area of a council. Of course, that situation applies to local government by-laws made under statutory authority which are, as much as any other, laws of the State. </para>
          <para>There are other reasons for drafting the Bill in this way. I assure those honourable senators who have raised the matter of incorporation that under the Bill incorporation is not mandatory and that organisations can continue to incorporate under what legislation they choose. The Government decided that there should be no conflict between local government and the operations of councils under the provisions of this Bill. Until such time as councils are well established and operating under the provisions of the Bill, it is appropriate that the by-laws of the councils be tabled in the Parliament, which we assume the amendments to be moved will require. The proposed amendment is not acceptable because the Bill as it is presently drafted reflects a direct Government decision. When that amendment is proposed we can deal with those matters that fall within its terms. </para>
          <para>I draw attention also to the matters of expenditure and management that were raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> These comments can be related to the Bill I am presently discussing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> implied that Aboriginal people were being blamed by the Government for mismanagement and inefficiency on the part of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs, of consulting firms assisting </para>
          <para class="block">Aboriginals, and of the non-Aboriginal employees of Aboriginal organisations. I make it perfectly clear that the Government has never suggested that Aboriginal organisations were blameworthy. I think I have already indicated, and I know that the Minister has indicated, that that is the Government&#39;s attitude. The Government does not take the attitude that the Aboriginal organisations are blameworthy. As we stated earlier, a decision on making public the report of the Hay inquiry had not been made because several matters were under consideration by the Government or were urgently being examined at that time by interdepartmental committees. As we all know now, the report was tabled on 5 October. As soon as these examinations had been completed and the decisions were made by the Government, it was clear what the intentions of the Government were in regard to these matters. </para>
          <para>Each of the specific allegations of misappropriation and mismanagement which were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> on 14 September have been examined, and not one of them has been substantiated. It is apparent that the information given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> was not accurate. I believe that these matters have now been satisfactorily resolved. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and other honourable senators had the opportunity subsequently of seeking explanations on proposed expenditure from Senate Estimates Committee D. The evidence given and the statements made at that time by the officers of the Department were frank and, I believe, satisfactory. They gave no support to the kinds of allegations that were made in September by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> I am not implying that areas of administration cannot be improved to ensure a better delivery of services to Aboriginals and to ensure that those most in need are assisted. It is obvious from the report of the Hay inquiry that administration can be improved, and that is surely the objective of the Government. The Government has acted on the recommendations of the Hay report. </para>
          <para>The Department of Aboriginal Affairs is now reviewing a number of departmental programs and activities. These relate to particular functions and to matters affecting administration generally. The major purpose of these reviews is to establish firm guidelines for the funding and management of all programs administered by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. We hope that these reviews will be completed by the end of this year. We also hope that, as a result of these reviews, the delivery of services to Aborigines will be further improved. The examination and review of programs for Aboriginal advancement will continue in order to improve the effectiveness of the Department and other organisations which are responsible for the delivery of services to Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>The Minister has said that he would like to emphasise that the rumours which appear to be the basis of some of the matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> are not founded on fact. They will not be considered in the exercise and they will not provide a basis for Government policy or programs. The Government has every reason to believe that the vast majority of Aboriginal organisations and non-Aboriginal people working with or for those organisations, including government employees and private consultants, are trustworthy and dedicated. The examinations which have been undertaken so far have given no cause to believe otherwise. While I am dealing with the Bill related to councils and associations, I think it is important to express the confidence of the Government in the management of the councils and associations and to express our belief that they will do much to assist in the delivery of services and in the advancement of the Aboriginal people generally. </para>
          <para>The second Bill to which I wish to refer in summary is the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill. That Bill, as presented, reflects the Labor Government&#39;s legislation of the same name. It requires the presentation of full information on the expenditure of funds. It was not considered necessary to add additional words of the type which the Opposition will probably seek to add by means of an amendment later today, because it was felt that information of the type sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is more appropriately located in the Department&#39;s annual reports and should be sought by a specific request for additional information when we are dealing with matters of finance or from the Minister in general terms. The Minister did respond to the amendment similar to the one which is proposed to be moved today. He said that this Bill will authorise the payment to the States of moneys already appropriated by this Parliament for that purpose. The purposes for which money is spent will be fully laid out and open to debate by the House in Budget debates and at other times. It is felt that the amendment is unnecessary. It is for these reasons that we will later signify that the Government does not feel itself able to accept the amendment of the Opposition. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill. I believe we all regard this as the significant Bill in the debate which we have been conducting over the past 2 days. It is significant because we are now reaching the final stages of the parliamentary process to give effect to what has been a long promise to Aboriginal people in this country that they will have legislation that will give them land rights. I believe the debate that has been conducted has shown the interest of all members in both Houses to see the fruition of that promise. Naturally, I am delighted that it is my Government which will be finalising this Bill. I think we should pay tribute to the many people, who for a long time, have been working towards the legislation which can give effect to the promises that have been made. </para>
          <para>Many honourable senators have mentioned the work of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner.</inline> I should also like to mention the Minister whom I represent, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner.</inline> Without his dedication to this purpose and without his overcoming the many differences that did exist, I believe we would not be in the position we are in today of seeing the final stages of this Bill being reached. I think we should also pay a tribute to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Dexter,</inline> the head of the Department, and to his officers for their cooperation, ingenuity and dedication in seeing that we were able to find a common ground on which interests could be met. This has led us to the stage where we are now almost ready to pass a Bill which will give traditional Aboriginals inalienable freehold title to land on reserves in the Northern Territory and which will provide machinery for them to obtain tide to traditional land outside their reserves. </para>
          <para>The coalition parties&#39; policy on Aboriginal affairs clearly acknowledges that affinity with the land is fundamental to Aboriginal sense of identity. It recognises the right of Aboriginals to obtain title to traditional lands located within the reserves in the Northern Territory. Perhaps those words in our policy do not adequately express the emotions that Aboriginals feel or that we <inline font-style="italic">feel</inline> as we now enact this legislation. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> has just said, it is a most sensitive issue and one on which I can understand the emotions which have been expressed. We are indebted to people such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> who have shared with us their own experiences of living and working in the Territory. They understand more closely than many of us what this Bill will mean and the effect it will have on Aboriginals who have such a strong feeling about their traditional rights to the land around them. </para>
          <para>The Government believes that this Bill will allow and encourage Aboriginals in the Northern Territory to give full expression to the affinity with the land that characterises their traditional society and which has given a unique quality to their life. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> mentioned that there was still some doubt in people&#39;s minds about land trusts and land councils. Perhaps it would be wise in summarising this debate, to stress just briefly the provision of the Bill with regard to land trusts and councils. The lands described in the first schedule, such as the Her mans burg and Santa Teresa missions in Central Australia and the Delissaville area near Darwin, being existing reserves, will be vested in Aboriginal land trusts composed of Aboriginals living in the area concerned, or traditional owners living outside the area, who will hold tide on behalf of the traditional owners and those other Aboriginals entitled by Aboriginal tradition to use and to occupy those lands. The Government will continue to explore the possibility of the title being held directly by the traditional owners themselves. It is the Government&#39;s aim to achieve this goal eventually. Provision has been made in the Bill for the trust areas to be divided among any number of smaller trusts. But the concept still presents considerable legal and practical difficulties. It must be approached with care and sensitivity to Aboriginal wishes. </para>
          <para>Land councils in the Northern Territory will have the central responsibility in relation to the administration of Aboriginal land. But we are committed to ensuring that they act on the advice and with the consent of the traditional owners and express the wishes and opinions of Aboriginals in their own areas. The land councils will continue to represent Aboriginal traditional owners in negotiations over land use and mineral developments. They will be further strengthened in line with the recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward by giving them the function of assisting Aboriginals to bring forward land claims. Land councils are all Aboriginal bodies. Membership will be chosen by Aboriginals. They will provide the administrative contact point with governments, miners and with all who may wish to have dealings with Aboriginals concerning their land. The Bill further provides for a land commissioner and the other things which have been mentioned. It makes provision with regard to mining and other things. </para>
          <para>Perhaps when summarising the debate it would be important to mention the changes that have occurred in this Bill when compared with the Bill which was presented in October 1 975 by the previous Government. We have decided that this legislation should deal exclusively with traditional land rights. We have defined the nature of Aboriginal land rights we are recognising by vesting title in trusts for the benefit of all those Aboriginals with traditional land rights to use and occupy the land in question. This is a fundamental provision which was missing from the previous Government&#39;s Bill. We believe that we have stated more clearly the functions and powers of the land councils so that the councils will express the wishes of the Aboriginal people. The predominant position of the traditional owners has been asserted. </para>
          <para>This Bill also gives scope for the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to participate in this most important legislative process and, in particular, in relation to the protection of sacred sites and wildlife on Aboriginal lands and the control of entry into those lands and adjacent waters. It provides guidelines for the kind of laws which should be made by the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly to guarantee recognition of traditional rights in those laws. It states that sites of traditional significance should not be desecrated. The Bill leaves it to the Northern Territory legislation to spell out detailed provisions for their protection in accordance with Aboriginal wishes. I wish to stress again what has been said by other speakers: The Government has an expressed understanding from the majority leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly that any ordinances will be prepared in consultation with and with the agreement of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. We believe that that will cover the situation and will enable a co-operative form of legislation to work in the interests of the Aboriginal landholders. In the light of experience, we feel that the undertaking that has been given by the Assembly in the Northern Territory will be honoured and will work in the best interests of us all. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>made some other points when he led for the Opposition on this matter. I shall refer to some of them now and perhaps others may come forward during the debate at the Committee stage. He referred to the matter of mining. I want to assure him that amendments to the Bill since it was originally introduced in June protect existing interests as was recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward. The basic rights of Aboriginals to choose whether mining or exploration should take place on their land and on what terms they are effected, are parts of the Bill which should have his attention. I believe they would reassure him on the points that he has raised. </para>
          <para>With regard to the Legislative Assembly, as I have stated, we are working with the Assembly to achieve co-operative legislation. The central provisions in regard to land rights are all contained in the Bill with which we are now dealing in this Parliament. It is a fact that important but peripheral matters are left to Territory law. As I have said, the Minister will work in close consultation with the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. There are safeguards in the form of guidelines in the Bill. I believe that they will ensure that the Assembly works in the way in which we envisage this Bill should work. The Territory law will provide for Aboriginals to control entry to their land. It will provide for wildlife protection, for entry to seas near their land and access to their sacred sites. Aboriginals with interests in the Tanami Desert Sanctuary and all Aboriginal pastoral lease-holding groups will be able to claim land if they wish. Claims can be readily dealt with and all Aboriginals outside reserves will be on equal footing in seeking title to land in which they believe they have an interest. </para>
          <para>No recent amendments affect the situation of Mount Isa Mines in relation to the silver, lead or zinc deposits in the Macarthur River area or the Aboriginal land claims in the area. Claims already lodged to vacant Crown land by Aboriginals will be heard by Land Commissioners acting with the authority of the legislation rather than by the Interim Commissioner who has no statutory authority. The fact that Mount Isa Mines has held leases in the area for years does not affect Aboriginal land claims. Another matter that was raised related to details of exploration licences. The Bill protects from consent procedures mining companies which applied before 4 June 1976 for mineral or petroleum leases on the basis of exploration licences. The companies affected in this instance are Queensland Mines at Nabarlek, the Ranger joint venturers, Magellan and Partners at the Greenie and Palm Valley Oil and Gas fields. I think some reference was made to Yirrkala. I believe that one of the documents tabled may have been a summary record of the meeting held on 18 June at Yirrkala and sent to the Minister. The points which were made are said to be consistent with the amendments proposed by the Labor Party and the Government&#39;s Bill is also fully in accord with the points made by the Yirrkala community. I have a document which may be the one which was referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline></para>
          <para>Another matter raised was the exploration of the freeze on granting leases on vacant Crown land. This does not apply to town areas as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> suggested. Claims to land have been lodged and will be fully protected. Where there was some concern on this matter, the statements made by the Minister with regard to the freezing of granting of leases should satisfactorily resolve the situation. The Minister spoke on this matter on 2 November in the other place. In answer to a question from the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr E. G. Whitlam),</inline> he said: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Ail that the 2 land councils need to do is give notice of intention to make claims in respect of areas of vacant Crown land. Because of the time that has elapsed it is believed from experience that that will enable all possible claims to be made. However, I have told Aboriginal groups that should it be established that additional time is required, notwithstanding the agreement I have made with my colleague, they will receive all due consideration. I am quite satisfied that with the combination of those 2 things Aboriginals will be fully protected in any claims they wish to make to vacant Crown land. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">As I understand it, the Minister has given notice of a motion that he will establish a joint parliamentary committee. I am pleased to hear that senators from both sides of the Senate have volunteered to be members of that Committee. The terms of reference of that Committee will be to examine and report on the operation of provisions of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Act 1976 relating to the identification of traditional owners of Aboriginal land and the means of establishing the views of such owners to the satisfaction of the relevant land council; the adequacy of provisions of the laws in the Northern Territory relating to entry to Aboriginal land, the protection of sites of significance, wildlife conservation, and entry to seas adjoining Aboriginal land; and any other matters referred to it by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs. I believe that the Joint Parliamentary committee will be a responsible body which may work continually towards the second steps we hope to take with regard to land rights for Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>I noted that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> supports the basic principles of this Bill, in particular the essential provision that land will be held by trust for the benefit of all Aboriginals entitled to use and occupy the land in accordance with the traditional law and custom. He also stressed the importance of the Bill to the future of the Aboriginals of the Northern Territory. I also noted the statements he made about the difficulties in dealing with, under our style of legal custom, land claims by Aboriginals who live under an entirely different system. We have all recognised those difficulties. We feel that the way in which this Bill overcomes them is a step forward, and perhaps the first step, as has been expressed by some other people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> expressed concern about the extent to which the Bill and the land councils reflect the views of Aboriginal elders. Some Aboriginal elders in central Australian have expressed concern but apparently on the basis of inadequate explanations of the Bill. This is natural. With a complex Bill there is not necessarily suspicion but there can be misunderstanding and apprehension. I believe that progressively we should work with Aboriginal elders and leaders so that we are able to interpret for them what the Bill establishes and enable them to tell their people the provisions of the Bill. </para>
          <para>The Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> has replied to the telegram quoted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> and those who signed it attended a meeting of the Land Council within the last 2 weeks. After a full day&#39;s discussion with these people and a detailed explanation of the amended Bill they indicated that they were satisfied that the Bill did not conflict with Aboriginal custom. It is important that we recognise their custom and their understanding of their relationships with one another and with the land and that this Bill does not conflict with that. I want to respond to some of the other matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> by saying that land councils are directed by traditional owners. If the land councils do not carry out the orders of traditional owners, the traditional owners may seek a court order directing that the land councils carry out their wishes. It is also important to note that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> certain documents and referred to other matters. The Albrecht argument to which he referred was supported by a small group in the centre of Australia but, as I understand it, no one else in the Northern Territory. The Bill provides for traditional owners to be on trusts and councils. Those comments should deal satisfactorily with some of the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff.</inline></para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline>referred to the Aboriginal land councils and associations and hoped that I would make it clear that there is no compulsion to register Aboriginal corporations. I referred to that when speaking to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill. With regard to the land rights legislation, an exploration licence alone does not protect from consent. There must be an application for a mineral lease. Consent is required to mining under the Atomic Energy Act. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward envisaged that Territory law would deal with the protection of sacred sites in clause 44 (3) of his draft Bill. He also envisaged that Territory law on wildlife would apply. Some matters raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> lead me to say that Aboriginals will have control over the building of any new roads on their land. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward excluded town areas from claims that would be dealt with under any legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> referred to action to authorise mining in the Forrest River Reserve in Western Australia. This Bill fully protects Aborigines in the Northern Territory. No mining can take place on Aboriginal land without consent except as provided for in the Bill. The Legislative Assembly is not given any power in relation to mining under this Bill. </para>
          <para>Those are the principal matters which 1 feel should be referred to as I conclude this second reading debate on the Bills. I have amendments which I will be moving and I know that  th:-  Opposition has amendments which it will be moving in the Committee stages. I thank the Senate for its interest in this most important legislation. I believe that people throughout the length and breadth of Australia have an interest in the proceedings of the Senate today and that they will welcome this first stage in land rights legislation for Aborigines. </para>

            <para>- I want to draw attention to a couple of clauses in the Bill to which the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> can reply when she is concluding the debate in Committee stages. I draw the Senate&#39;s attention to clause 16(3) and clause 17(4). The Opposition is intrigued by them. I realise that the Minister when replying to the second reading debate gave some explanation of them but I remain unconvinced that the clauses should be phrased in this way. Those of us who are Queenslanders are even more unconvinced because of certain actions taken by the State Government over the last year or two to take in Aboriginal areas under the Local Government Act. In the Bill which was originally introduced into the House of Representatives, sub-clause 16 (3) read: </para>

          <para class="block">The Shire of Torres, which takes in all the islands in the Torres Strait as well as Thursday Island, is a very extensive shire. The original impression apparently created was that action was taken by the State Government in order to prevent the then Federal Labor Government from making any moves on land rights. No assistance has been given to these islands. One would imagine that when establishing a shire one of the first things to be done would be to set up a rating apparatus and establish the type of service to be given under the local government Act. However, none of these things has happened in the Shire of Torres. Palm Island which is another inhabited reserve some 30 or 40 miles from Townsville was incorporated at the same time into the shire which is increasingly overseen by the City Council of Townsville. Originally there was a great debate as to whether it would be incorporated in Hinchinbrook or come into the Townsville city area. I know that there are current negotiations going on to see whether the city council can assist but in all the months preceding the change of council in March this year, city council officers and representatives paid one or two visits to Palm Island, but they have not done anything to assist the residents of that part of the city. I have one other point to which the Minister might reply in more detail than she did in the second reading debate. I seek leave to continue my remarks. </para>

In speaking briefly to this amendment, I could not do better than to use the words of my colleague in another place, the honourable member for Hughes <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Les Johnson),</inline> when he was speaking to the same sub-clauses. He said that the provisions in these sub-clauses showed a paternalistic attitude to Aborigines. He pointed out that the councils in the City of Sydney, the City of Melbourne and the great shires and municipalities do not have to come to this Parliament to table regulations or to go through these overseeing procedures, either for by-laws or for a check over of their by-laws by the Minister. He went on to say: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Is there any justification for this provision? The Opposition puts in all fairness that it is excessive heavy-handedness, paternalism, unnecessary, not likely to render a service, probably not even likely to be treated effectively by the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances which looks after those matters. </para>

          <para>- Perhaps I could make a few brief points before the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> replies. I endorse what the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has said about the need for special consideration to be given to Aboriginals in relation to the submission of regulations to the Parliament. However, there is another which I think indicates the attitude of this Government towards the Aboriginals, both in this Bill and in the Land Rights Bill. Clause 30 (1) of this Bill states: </para>
        </talk.start>
        <quote>
          <para>Subject to this Act, an Aboriginal Council may . . . make by-laws not inconsistent with any other law in force in the area of the Council. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is, for purposes connected with its functions. </para>
        <para>Therefore it makes its own by-laws. Subclause (2) states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A by-law . . . may fix a charge for a service provided . . . </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">It is possible that decisions made by the new councils could be tyrannical, oppressive or unreasonable. The Opposition recognises that and does not wish to amend sub-clause (4), which states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>A by-law has no effect unless it has been approved by the Minister. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That is a safeguard to ensure that such by-laws will not be oppressive or unreasonable. Subclause (5) states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Where the Minister approves any by-laws, he shall cause the by-laws to be laid before each House of the Parliament within15 sitting days of that House after the giving of his approval. </para>

        <para class="block">Sub-clause (6) states: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>If any by-laws are not laid before each House of the Parliament in accordance with sub-section (5) the by-laws shall be void and of no effect. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">There is a right to disallow within 15 days. According to these provisions the action of an Aboriginal group has to be subject to this undue perusal of the white man-first, by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs who has to see that the by-law ism order, and then by some 190 politicians, any one of whom may move a motion to disallow a by-law, that is, to interfere with the by-law that has been made by the Aboriginal group. The amendment also seeks to delete subclause (7), which reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Where any by-laws have been laid before a House of the Parliament in accordance with sub-section 5 of this section, sub-sections (4), (5) and (5a) of section 48 of the <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act</inline> 1901-1973 apply in relation to those bylaws as if they were regulations. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">This is important. Any member of Parliament may move a motion of disallowance of the regulation or by-law of an Aboriginal group. In accordance with the Acts Interpretation Act, the by-law has to be considered within 15 days and, like a regulation, it may be thrown out. If it is not considered within 15 days, the by-law is disallowed. Therefore the by-laws are treated as if they were regulations. If a decision by Aboriginals results in a by-law that by-law is disallowed if it is not considered within 15 days after being laid before either House. Under the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill the Governor-General may proclaim that in the national interest certain minerals on Aboriginal land should be mined. That proclamation is to be laid before the House where any member may move to disallow the proclamation. But there is no provision of the Acts Interpretation Act which applies in this case. If the proclamation is not disallowed within 15 days the proclamation stands. On the one hand where an Aboriginal community makes a decision there is provision for disallowance very easily of the result- a bylaw of Aborigines having a say in their own affairs, but on the other hand in the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) BDI, where there is a mining interest, although there is a right for a member of Parliament to move for disallowance of the proclamation, there is no provision that it is to be dealt with within 15 days. In that case if it is not brought forward in Parliament within 15 days the proclamation stands and the mining may go ahead against the wish of the Aboriginal people. The differences that we are dealing with in these 2 Bills concern the rights of Aboriginal people and mining interests. </para>
        <para>I notice that yesterday &#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports that I said last evening that an official from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs had drawn this aspect to the attention of a committee. If I did say that, I was not being factual. It is a fact that this was drawn to the attention of an official of the Department at that committee meeting. It was brought up by the committee and drawn to the attention of the Department. This legislation embodies double standards. It adopts one standard for supervision of Aboriginal decisions and provides a freer go for mining companies. </para>

          <para>- The Government does not accept the amendment from the Opposition seeking the deletion of sub-clauses (5), (6), (7) of clause 30. These sub-clauses deal with the tabling of by-laws before both Houses of Parliament. It is believed by the Government that it is essential for close scrutiny of the by-laws to ensure that there is no situation of conflict which could arise between the operation of this Bill and local governments, either now or in the future. I have taken note of the matters that have been raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> but it is believed that the provision for disallowance by either House of the Parliament and the structure of this Bill are appropriate to the functions which we believe the associations and councils need to undertake. For those reasons, briefly, we are not able to accept the proposed amendment. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Certain matters were referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> with regard to clause 16(3) and clause 17 (4). These clauses deal with the extension of local government, to remote areas in particular. In the light of the Government&#39;s policy of cooperative federalism it is necessary to ensure that this legislation operates concurrently with relevant State legislation. It is essential that there is no conflict between a proposal from local government and a council under this legislation. The clauses referred to merely require the Registrar and the Minister to take account of a proposal for extension of local government. This does not mean that a council under the Bill cannot be established, but any question of conflict will be discussed and resolved before the council is incorporated under the Bill. </para>

          <para>- I believe that this Aboriginal councils and associations legislation has been brought about by a situation that existed in the Northern Territory some years ago when some Aboriginal co-operatives were having some problem in trading with people other than within the organisations. At that time moves took place to amend the councils and associations legislation in the </para>

        <quote>
          <para>In addition to these measures the Government proposes in relation to the Northern Territory to investigate ways of providing a simple, flexible form of incorporation for Aboriginal communities. </para>
        </quote>
        <para>I wish to express here the viewpoint of the Majority Leader of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly who, in part of a message, stated: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>My understanding is that this refers to amendments which were then being considered to the Local Associations Incorporation Ordinance to overcome several difficulties communities were then experiencing regarding trading with persons outside their membership and taxation matters. There was not any suggestion so far as I can recall that this legislation would be introduced by the Commonwealth Government or that it could cover the establishment and operation of local government type activities. You have probably not been advised that work was proceeding throughout 1972 on the preparation of legislation which would have provided effective machinery for the development of local government type activities in isolated including Aboriginal communities. But for the change of Government this legislation would have been introduced in the February 1973 meeting of the Legislative Council. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">That viewpoint asks where such legislation should be introduced. Naturally I support the claim that there has to be legislation to overcome these problems. However legislation such as this could be considered by the Federal Parliament to be a part of a State-like legislation. In fact it is my understanding that there have been suggestions that the passage of the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill (No. 2) could have been delayed a little so that States could have more discussion. I have gained this impression from discussions which have taken place within the precincts of the Parliament within the last 2 days. However, as I said before, I support the principle of this legislation. But I suggest that in the very many areas in which such legislation is required, such as in the local government area, the Federal Government could consider that this type of legislation should be a State-like matter. I wish to refer briefly to clause 30, which relates to bylaws. It provides that Aboriginal councils may make by-laws under certain conditions. It has been pointed out to me by people from Aboriginal settlements in the northern part of the Northern Territory that they are interested in seeing this legislation passed for 2 reasons. One is that it will overcome a problem within the area of their trading as co-operatives. But sub-clause (9) of clause 30 says that a by-law does not apply in relation to a person who is not an Aboriginal. My feeling in this respect is that one could have looked at this matter in such a way as to provide that if there are to be by-laws in a particular area they should apply to all. I repeat that I support the legislation but I query the necessity for such legislation to be introduced in the federal sphere. </para>

          <para>- I am surprised that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> has adopted such an attitude. He had the opportunity during Party meetings to do something about moving amendments if he wanted to do so. In addition, the previous Labor Government laid this Bill on the table many months ago. So there has been plenty of time to examine it. The only point I raised with the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> yesterday was that some people felt that this matter might be used against them by a heavy handed government. Judging from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> has said, this is what the Government might be proposing to do. The honourable senator said that the States should have had the opportunity to have more discussion. I point out to him that they had plenty of time to have a discussion on this matter. I know that he is anxious to get State-like powers in the Northern Territory and to have it declared a State without its having to accept financial responsibility for itself. The honourable senator then said that this sort of legislation ought to be left to the States. Prior to 2 December 1972 and since 13 December 1975 the Northern Territory has been like Queensland. It has done everything it can to eliminate anything that operates along the lines of co-operatives. So far as Aborigines are concerned, there is today only one cooperative left in the Northern Territory and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> and his Party have been trying to close it down for the past 10 years. I felt that I had to make those few remarks. The Opposition is still determined to have deleted the various sub-clauses to which I have referred. </para>

          <para>- I wish briefly to say, as I said in summarising the debate on the motion for the second reading of the Bill, that the Bill in no way interferes with State rights or responsibilities. It is an exercising of the Commonwealth&#39;s constitutional powers and responsibility to make special laws for the Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders where a need is seen for that. As far as consultation with the States is concerned, I also stated that the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> has had consultation with the State Ministers and others and that, as this Bill has been open for debate since its introduction on 4 June, much consultation has been undertaken. The Minister has advised the State Ministers and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts</inline> of the Northern Territory that he wishes to proceed with the Bill but that he is prepared to discuss the administration of the legislation with them at the next meeting of the State Ministers next year. As this is expected to be early in the new year, I believe that the Minister has taken into account the views of the States with regard to their own responsibilities and that in no way is there conflict in this Bill with those responsibilities. </para>

        <para class="block">The Opposition has a specific reason for moving this amendment to clause 7. The Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> in closing the second reading debate claimed that some of the allegations I have made in this chamber from time to time have not been substantiated.  Her  claim that the Aboriginal people were not blamed for waste is not true because the Government had taken the precaution of releasing specific parts of the Hay report long before it saw the light of day in its unofficial form or official form. That had the effect of putting the Aboriginals associated with housing development in Redfern in a very poor light. A journalist named Peter Samuels was able to get access to some of the notes associated with the Hay report long before we ever saw it and long before any Aboriginal people saw it Let me mention one example. There are thousands of examples of Aborigines who were supposed to be ripping off. In fact it did not turn out that way. I am amazed that the Minister could find no evidence of any indiscretions in the area to which I referred in the previous debate. Maybe the Government is easier to satisfy than I am. Perhaps it will take plausible stories and put them away where they will not ever again appear in the light of day. </para>
        <para>We know that in Queensland money for the Aboriginal people is misused by the Queensland Government Again, as I did yesterday, I refer to the situation at Bamaga, where more was spent on houses for the local white staff than for the Aboriginal people. I referred also to the place known as the Gorge where money was misused by the Queensland Department of Aboriginal and Islanders Advancement. When the Australian Government was trying to secure a piece of land on which to establish a housing settlement, the Queensland Department would not let Aborigines build on the original site. It misspent Aboriginal money on buying land and forbade the Aboriginal people to have their homes there, so people still live in misery because of this hassle that goes on with the Queensland Department. </para>
        <para>It is a fact that this has been happening over a long period of years. Take the old Palm Island reserve. The main street is Mango Avenue. There are no trams there. It is a street on which the blacks were forbidden to walk. Aboriginal funds were used to keep it at a very high standard for the snow white occupants of the street, while the Aboriginal people lived in little places in other areas. The same sort of thing has happened in the Northern Territory on more than one occasion. There ought to be some accounting for this. State departments and governments should have to account to this Government for the money and how it has been spent. Without proper consultation with appropriate authorities and experts in the field a series of graded-type houses was built in the Northern Territory right up until the time the Labor Government took over. The Labor Government abandoned this system of housing. I am not saying that the Labor Government did everything absolutely 100 per cent correctly, but it did a darned sight better job than its predecessor and it did a much better job than this Government is doing. In the Northern Territory we are now reverting to the type of houses known as Gie se &#39;s bus stops. They are little one-room houses with an overhang in which no human being should have to live. This amendment is not a subversive one. It is one I hope the Government will agree to. It will tighten up the accounting system of State governments in particular. I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

He referred to Palm Island and a street called Mango Avenue. He said that the Aboriginal people who lived there, as I did, were not permitted to walk down Mango Avenue and that a lot of money was spent on the upkeep of it. At that time I happened to be the overseer of works on Palm Island. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that that situation was changed with the change of government in Queensland. That was a law under a Labor government, and when the Liberal and Country Parties took government it was changed. </para>

            <para>-Of course it does. In essence this clause is almost the same as was provided in a Bill introduced under the Labor Government. I use this opportunity to point out a problem that is being experienced by the Aboriginal Community Centre in Adelaide. Clause 6 states that financial assistance to the States is subject to the following conditions: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>That each amount paid to the State under this Act will be applied by the State, in a manner and within a time approved by the Minister, for the purposes of expenditure for the benefit of Aboriginals living in the State; </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">I want to highlight this matter. It concerns the Aboriginal Community Centre in Wakefield Street in Adelaide, which had been provided with and had set aside $25,000 for building alterations. Unfortunately it was put in a very financially embarrassing position because after a fire in the Salvation Army congress hall in Adelaide the State Government altered its legislation with respect to fire protection and required the Centre to expend between a further $100,000 and $1 10,000 to provide for more appropriate staircases and other features associated with fire protection which were not evident in the building. </para>
        <para>In addition to that the Centre was required to re-build the top floor at a cost of $60,000. 1 had a talk with the  chairman  of the Community Centre, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Leonard</inline> Kent, the architect adviser and the head of the Department in Adelaide. I was made aware of the financial difficulties the Centre was experiencing. As a result I requested the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> to give consideration to providing adequate funds to this Committee to enable the necessary alterations to be effected. The reply I received from the Minister indicated that he was sympathetic but that the building itself was not being utilised by the number of people that should be using the facility and for that reason there were problems associated with granting that amount of money at that time. However, he informed me that, under the chairmanship of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kent,</inline> communications between the Committee and the Department had improved and there were signs that more Aboriginal people were going to use the Centre. The building also contains offices occupied by the Legal Aid Office and Australian Housing Corporation. The building is important to the Aboriginal people in Adelaide. I understand that the Minister is having talks with the appropriate State Minister and the other State departments including the Fire Brigade Board with a view to providing some assistance to this Community Centre over a period. I highlight this matter for the information of the Minister and hope that due regard will be paid to the urgency of providing funds for this purpose for the benefit of these people. </para>

          <para>- I rise in this debate to make 2 points about Aborigines in Victoria. One concerns the Aboriginal Legal Service Co-operative in Victoria. I make this point: This Co-operative fills what everybody in this chamber would concede was a long felt want. One cannot talk about democracy or people&#39;s rights or their right to go to law if they are not provided with the means to go to law. The Aboriginal Legal Service in Victoria had asked for $442,000. In actual fact it has received $3 1 5,000, which is a cut of 25 per cent. Apart from that, fees for barristers and solicitors in Victoria have risen by 25 per cent in the meantime. So in actual fact the effective cut that has been made to the money sought by that Service is 50 per cent. I think, as we all believe in democracy and people&#39;s right to go to law, this Government ought to look at that point very seriously to see what can be done about it. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The other point I raise concerns Aboriginal housing. In Victoria there are 8 Aboriginal housing co-operatives only one of which has been funded to the point of providing housing. The other seven had been funded to the point of administrative costs. An amount of $700,000 was made available to the Victorian State Government for housing. The co-operatives had budgeted for $614,000, so one would not think they were being excessive in their demands. The fact is that they feel from what they have heard on the grapevine without any direct communication that they will be lucky if they get $22,000 of that amount of money and the $22,000 of course covers the administrative costs. In the meantime there has been an Aboriginal housing section set up in the Housing Commission in Victoria. One does not really have to be a genius to know that the bulk of the money will go to the Commission to provide housing for Aborigines. </para>
        <para>I suppose that the housing position in Victoria is not as bad as it is in some other States, and that does not say a lot for the other States. One could not, I suppose, say that housing for Aboriginal people in my State of Victoria is so bad, but nonetheless it is bad according to the way white people in Victoria like to live. The Housing Commission in Victoria tends to build in certain areas bulk lots of housing. It in fact creates ghettos rather than distributing people through the community and Aboriginal people are part of the community and they want to live in the community as do other people. There is no way that the Housing Commission in Victoria will take special note of the special needs of people. To further my argument I cannot do better than to quote from the report of the Senate Select Committee on Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders on the conditions of Aborigines. I wish more people had read this report and read it thoroughly. One of the points made in that report is this: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>Aborigines lack adequate housing because they are poor. Their poverty is a self-perpetuating cycle, originally partly a consequence of their having been dispossessed of their land. To a great extent, the solutions to Aboriginal poverty are the same as those measures designed to eliminate poverty in Australian society generally, but in addition we must take account of Aborigines&#39; desire to maintain a distinct cultural identity </para>
        </quote>
        <para>Aborigines are poor and so they have bad housing. They have bad housing and so they remain poor and ill-educated. So far the Victorian Government is doing little to break that cycle. As I said, there is not as great a need in Victoria as in some other States but in Victoria under State grants 50 houses were provided for Aborigines in 1975-76 although the outstanding applications as at 30 June 1976 numbered 160- three times as many as the number of houses provided. So far we have no evidence that the outstanding 160 will be caught up with. Yet if cases were made for 160 other sorts of people requiring decent housing in Victoria it would be done overnight, but evidently in this particular area the houses will not be made available. Aboriginal housing societies were set up not just to provide housing for Aborigines. They were set up with other sorts of aims. I quote again from the same Senate Select Committee report which was presented in this place. It says shortly and to the point why Aboriginal housing societies were set up. It reads: </para>
        <quote>
          <para>It is important to remember that the Aboriginal housing societies were originally established with several aims in mind, of which the provision of housing was only one. The societies were primarily to be vehicles for encouraging self determination and community development at a local level. To this end, as well as the provision of housing, they were also charged with the task of developing management expertise among local communities, and also with providing apprenticeship and training programs to alleviate unemployment. They were also used as testing grounds for the application of new ideas in architecture and environmental design in relation to Aborigines. There was, therefore, a variety of tasks assigned to the Aboriginal housing societies, and it should be borne in mind also that the order of priorities was not constant, but changed according to economic circumstances and government policy. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">One of the points about which the Committee felt strongly was that Aborigines as much as any other section of the community had to be given the chance to make mistakes and to learn by their mistakes. They had to be given the chance to manage, to take responsibility, to be whole people. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> referred to this aspect. </para>
        <para class="block">For the benefit of Aborigines and for the benefit of Aborigines living in Victoria in particular I urge this Government to make more money available so that these tasks may be accomplished. The Government should ensure that money is spent where it is really needed. </para>

          <para>- I want to raise a couple of matters in the Committee stages of the States Grants (Aboriginal Assistance) Bill because of my concern about a number of areas in which money is appropriated by this Federal Parliament to a State government which has absolutely no intention of using it. I made mention of this some weeks ago in a speech in this place on the Budget. In speaking about Aboriginal affairs I expressed my concern at the return of $4.5m which had been appropriated by the Federal Parliament to the Western Australian State Government through the State Housing Commission- money specifically designed to cater for the needs of some of the Aboriginals who are on the waiting list for housing in that State. I am concerned once again that in Western Australia there are more than 900 Aboriginal applicants on the waiting list of the Housing Commission. These people are the ones who have known housing problems. There are many, many more- hundreds more whose housing needs are not known by State or Federal governments but are known only by the Aboriginals themselves. I get very concerned to see that in my State particularly there are so many Aboriginals living in abject misery. They are living in the most appalling conditions that one would have to see to believe. They are living under sheets of iron. They are living in what could be described as cardboard boxes and in packing cases. Yet, as I mentioned, under the 1975-76 appropriation, the Western Australian Government last year determined that it did not need $4,556,000 which it subsequently returned to Treasury. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There is another area that disturbs me greatly and which I do not think has yet been touched upon. It concerns one of the myriad of problems associated with Aboriginals. Although we have racial discrimination legislation, I do not think that it is being fully utilised. I believe that particularly in States such as Western Australia its provisions are not being applied effectively. I know of hotels in which it is still not possible for blacks to drink in the same bar in which whites in the upper socio-economic class drink. Of course, they can drink in those bars in which the whites in the lower socio-economic groups drink. In Collie, which is a mining township in Western Australia, black people are not allowed to drink in a particular bar or in the lounge. I am not saying that that situation exists only in Collie; it probably exists in other places. A newspaper report told us not so long ago of a black man and his wife being refused accommodation at a hotel even though the wife was obviously pregnant and very distressed as a result of a long drive through extreme heat conditions. They had to return to a reserve in order to get accommodation that night because the hotel management determined that, as they were black, they were not allowed to live in the white man&#39;s hotel overnight. I know of another instance- again this is in the south-west of Western Australia- of a band not being able to get bookings purely and simply because the members of that band are Aboriginals. I am disturbed by the fact that we are granting money to States and we suggest to the States that we would appreciate their perhaps giving support to our legislation; but no one seems to be doing anything about it. </para>
        <para>I am concerned about the unemployment problems that Aboriginal people throughout Australia face. If my memory serves me correctly, a working party was set up by this Government earlier this year to report on the problems of Aboriginal unemployment. I have not seen the report of that working party. I do not think it has been presented to Parliament. I would like to know what is the position with regard to that working party. Is it still in operation? Is it still seriously looking at the problems of unemployment among Aborigines, or is it saying: &#39;Let us wait until something drastic happens before we go ahead with it&#39;? There is tremendous unemployment among Aborigines in Western Australia. I speak of Western Australia so often because the people of Western Australia elected me to represent them in this place. Be they black or white, they cast their vote, and the majority of them cast their vote in my favour, and that is why I am here. So I am concerned when any member of my constituency finds himself or herself in the situation where no employment is available for them. This applies a great deal in the north-west of Western Australia and in the gold fields areas where, in spite of our racial discrimination legislation, Aboriginals still seem to be third and fourth class citizens. </para>
        <para>I would like the Minister to explain at some stage what will happen in relation to the housing situation and the discrimination that occurs in the hotels. I think that the latter situation is adequately covered by the racial discrimination legislation which is not being put into effect. Will the Minister advise the Senate what is happening or what has happened to the working party report on the unemployment situation? </para>

          <para>- I intervene briefly to take up a point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer.</inline> I am glad that she referred to the report of the Senate Committee which dealt with housing for Aborigines. I was interested in the mathematical projection which we were able to make from a paper provided by the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. The paper is entitled <inline font-style="italic">Desirable and Anticipated Actual Housing Program for Aboriginals for the 3-year period 1 July 1976 to 30 June 1979.</inline> The paper indicates a need for 1 8 000 homes to meet the housing needs of the Aboriginal people. I make the point that, when we were travelling through New South Wales taking evidence on Aboriginal housing needs, we were a little alarmed to learn from the officers who talked to us in various localities that no special arrangements existed to cater for those Aborigines who would be requiring homes under the Housing Commission program. I notice the honourable senator acknowledging that we obtained that evidence. The indication was that they were to be treated like everyone else. Our feeling was that that was not a proper approach from the Housing Commission. There were special needs and special kinds of responses were required. We were not getting those in New South Wales. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Really, what I want to do, perhaps to balance up against what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> said about housing commissions in one or other State, is to draw attention to the experience we had in South Australia. In that State we saw operating through the Housing Trust of South Australia a cooperative venture which was highly successful. A body called the Aboriginal Housing Board of South Australia worked with the State Government in determining a number of matters in relation to Aboriginal housing. Without labouring the point and going into detail, I believe it established a kind of model as to how housing might be provided using State instrumentalities and yet still recognising that the Aboriginal people want their own say and want to make their own decisions. My own view of the situations we saw operating throughout Australia is that the most satisfactory was the South Australian model. It is one that I would like to see extended and applied more generally. </para>

          <para>- Let me take a little further the points on housing raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer.</inline> I agree that it is highly desirable when housing Aborigines in urban areas to avoid the collective situation. I think it is a fair comment and a constructive thought that the Victorian Government Housing Commission ought to recognise. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> has correctly pointed out, South Australia should be praised for the work it has done in this area. I speak from personal experience. When I was a member of the Port Augusta City Council, we tried to achieve the objectives expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer.</inline> But it is extremely difficult to do so in all areas, and that highlights the problem with which we are faced when we try to overcome the difficulties among Aboriginal people and to cater for their needs. Their needs are quite different in various areas. I can recall when I visited Ernabella a number of years ago seeing several homes that had been constructed by the Commonwealth Government at that time. The Liberal-National Country parties were in government at that stage. The houses were unoccupied. The reason they were unoccupied was that an elder of the tribe had died in one of the houses; the evil spirits were still there. Until an appropriate elder of the tribe said that the evil spirits had gone, those houses would remain unoccupied. They remained unoccupied for some 1 8 months. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ryan</inline> mentioned the poor conditions under which Aborigines live. We must recall that many Aboriginal people in Australia prefer not to live in houses, anyway. I can recall another case of a full-blooded Aboriginal patient who was in the hospital at Ernabella. She had rolled into a fire and burnt herself quite seriously. She was put into the hospital. She remained there for 2 nights. On the morning following the second night the matron was doing her rounds and discovered that that lady was not in her hospital bed. She was found back in her natural environment, preferring to live in her whir lie or however one would describe it. So, that illustrates the difficulties with which we are faced. At Ernabella half a dozen homes, costing probably several hundred thousand dollars, were idle. That is the reason why I believe the present Government was determined to reassess the needs of Aborigines. Perhaps there are areas in which money is being wasted in some respects. We want to divert that money that appears to be wasted and reassess the priorities so that the areas of need can be catered for. I thought I should mention that point. I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> for raising it. </para>
        <para>I suggest that the other States of Australia could look at South Australia as an example. They have managed to provide old Aboriginal people at Davenport in particular, with an ideal type of home with the fire right in the centre of the room. This enables the Aboriginal people to lie around it if they wish, as is their tribal custom. I think many States of Australia could follow the example that has been laid down not only by the present Government- and I pay a tribute to it- but by former governments of my colour of politics. I support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> said. </para>

          <para>- It is evident from the many comments that have been made by honourable senators that housing is a matter of extreme importance to the advancement of Aborigines. I shall draw to the attention of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs the several matters that have been raised. With regard to the Victorian aboriginal housing associations mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer,</inline> I understand that the details of funding will now be known to the associations, but I do not have those details with me. With regard to the Victorian Legal Aid Service, it is to receive slightly more than it spent last year. The fact that it asked for- in <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer&#39;s</inline> terms- $442,000 and received some $300,000 does not reflect a cutback on what was received last year but rather that we were not able to give them fully the funds which they had requested. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I feel sure that the matters of housing in various States will be of interest to the Minister. I understand that the matter raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is the subject of a question on notice from him in respect of which the Minister is obtaining information. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Coleman</inline> raised the matter of racial discrimination legislation. As she would know, the Commissioner for Community Relations deals with complaints of the kind that she has mentioned. I hope that the matters which are brought to his direct attention do result in the removal of the discrimination which in many ways has been practised and perhaps accepted in this country. </para>
        <para>I think that those other matters that have been raised will need to be the subject of consideration by the Minister for a response from him. I wish to indicate that the Government does not accept the amendment of the Opposition. The Bill that is presented reflects the Bill of the same name that was presented by the former Government. In that Bill there was not specification of the words which are sought in the amendment. As I said during the second reading stage, it is more appropriate for details of that type to be provided in other ways- the sorts of ways mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop-</inline> such as during Budget debates or in Senate Estimates Committees or by specific request to the Minister concerned. For these reasons we are not able to accept the amendment of the Opposition. </para>

          <para>- I have a couple of brief observations to make. I note that the Minister has said that details of funds for the housing associations will be available soon. With respect, I ask that the Minister persuade the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Viner,</inline> to produce a list of those housing associations that will get benefits and circulate it, at least to members of this chamber, but preferably to all members of the Parliament and of course to Aboriginal organisations. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The other point that rather intrigued me was that I take it from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> said, if in fact he was voicing official Liberal Party policy in relation to housing, that this continued cutback will be part of an on-going program because Aboriginals do not like living in houses; they would rather live on the ground. Perhaps the Minister will reply as to whether there has been any overall change in policy in relation to housing from that of the previous Government. Those are my final comments. </para>

          <para>- It is typical of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> frequently to misrepresent the statements that are made on this side of the chamber. I can understand his attitude. He gets a little bit overwrought when we are discussing a subject which has been of continuing interest to him. But what I was trying to point out to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe-</inline> and if he knows anything about Aboriginal people he ought to know this- is that housing problems in different areas take on quite different implications for the people concerned. I was illustrating that those 6 homes that were lying idle would probably represent a cost of about $ 1 m to the taxpayers of Australia. </para>

            <para>- Well, it might have been more. I do not think that Sim is an unrealistic figure. But the point is that that money, if it is not being used for the benefit of those people, could well be diverted for use in the area that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Melzer</inline> was talking about. I was just drawing attention to the proper consideration of the priorities of this Government and its examination of where money was needed. It has a little bit more businesslike approach to the matter than the previous Government had. It is not a question of withdrawing or withholding money from people in need. It is a matter of reallocation a pause and the allocation of more money where indicated to people in the greatest need. </para>

We seem to be moving into the area of suitable housing for Aboriginals and what government has done the most for Aboriginals. I was a Minister in a government that had a policy on housing for all Aboriginals. </para>

            <para>- Well, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> said that I was not a good Minister. He said that I was known as a disaster. However, if I were a bad Minister, the opportunity has now come for me to make up some of the deficiencies I had as a Minister. We had a policy which provided for the housing of all Aboriginals within 10 years. Through the curtailment of finance this year that policy has been put back. I take it that our policy is not the policy of the present Government. But the solution to the whole problems of the type of housing for Aboriginals has not yet been found. The Department of Aboriginal Affairs has an architectural panel for the purpose of trying to find the best type of housing for Aboriginals in different areas. The peculiar type of housing at Laverton was the result of a design by an architectural panel. I would go so far as to say it was suitable. There was the destruction of houses in some areas because Aboriginals were of the opinion that they did not want that type of housing. Of course even though they were told that their own housing association had decided on the type of housing, they found that that association was under the influence of a white architect. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>I do not think that this Bill relates to those problems; it is a plan for money for the States. The Government of which I was a Minister developed a scheme under which the most efficient housing authority was considered to be the State Housing Commission. This would probably be generally recognised. The State housing commissions, in the main, get the biggest proportion of housing moneys for the purpose of housing Aboriginals. Of course the Aboriginal tenants must <inline font-style="italic">meet the tenancy</inline> requirements of those housing commissions. They provide accommodation only for a particular class of Aboriginal- the one we are discussing in the Bill today. There are other classes of Aboriginals from the tribal areas who have never been accustomed to Europe an type homes. They have never seen a bathroom or a toilet in their lives. To install these facilities in a home would mean a revolution in their whole style of living. Provision has to be made for this sort of thing. </para>
        <para>There is also the type of Aboriginal who receives welfare housing because of his family income or the lack of opportunities making it impossible for him to pay rent. The Government had to make provision for this type of Aboriginal if it was going to house all Aboriginal families. That has to be done on a welfare basis whereby the rent is subsidised by the Commonwealth. Some other attitude has to be taken in respect of that class of Aboriginal family. These are all problems which have to be met from time to time in housing Aboriginal communities. The essential point is that before we can do anything about the bad health of Aboriginals we must get them into homes. That is important in order to improve the health of Aboriginal families. </para>
        <para>Previously, we had legislation whereby the Commonwealth Government appropriated moneys for the States, setting out what it was provided for. The States had to use the moneys for those purposes. The Labor Party proposed that money be appropriated to the States by means of this Bill, giving the Minister the right to make grants to the States which would be reviewed within appropriations. We would not have had to have a Bill every year. An appropriation would have been made every year under the Act. Of course, it is open to question what the States do with the money appropriated to them. This Bill makes provision for the Minister to give an annual report of what happens to that money. Clause 7 states: </para>
        <list type="decimal">
          <item label="(1)">
            <para>The Minister shall, as soon as practicable after 30 June in each year, cause to be laid before each House of the Parliament a report on the operation of this Act during the year ending on that date. </para>
          </item>
          <item label="(2)">
            <para>A report referred to in sub-section ( 1 ) shall include a statement setting out the amount paid under this Act to each State during the year to which the report relates. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para class="block">That becomes a public document which I think would have a greater circulation than the report of an Estimates committee examining the appropriation. There is no check through this report on whether the Federal Government in its appropriation to the States, or the States in receiving the money, are giving priority to the essential housing needs of Aboriginals or whether they are neglecting the housing needs because they believe that they have housed all members of the Aboriginal community who meet the tenancy requirements of the Housing Commission. There is no way of checking whether the States have spent the money on some other purpose with the Minister&#39;s approval. </para>
        <para>The proposed amendment seeks to ensure that the Minister&#39;s annual report shows the amounts paid to the States and the purposes for which the amounts were paid. We could then find out how much was paid to each State for Aboriginal housing each year and how much was paid to them for health and education. That is what the Opposition wants to see in the report. I cannot see for the life of me why there is an objection to that addition to clause 7. It does not alter the Bill. It puts no greater liability on the Government. It only seeks to ensure open government giving freer information in the annual report which is a public document. I support the amendment. It is not one of the issues on which we would go to the barricades but I think that there are big problems in relation to Aboriginal housing. Even with the best of government intentions the housing needs of the Aboriginal community are not always fulfilled in the way we would desire. This is not always the fault of a government. </para>

            <para>- The amendments are circulated in my name. The first amendment refers to clause 3 and relates to the definition of exploration licence&#39;. The amendment is of a technical nature and will make it clear that any authorisation allowing mineral exploration in the form of either the former authority to prospect and the current exploration licence will be treated in a similar manner. It was the Government&#39;s intention that all exploration rights be covered in the legislation. The original authorisation to explore and the authority to prospect were replaced by an amendment to the Northern Territory Mining Ordinance by the current exploration licence, the term used in the Bill. There was legal doubt as to whether &#39;exploration licence&#39;, as it is referred to in the Bill, was a general enough term to cover authorities to prospect. The definition is important especially in relation to the protection of existing interests mainly in mineral lease applications as referred to in clause 43. </para>
          </talk.start>
          </continue>
		  <para>The second amendment is to clause 40 and seeks to insert an additional sub-clause (7) which relates to mining interests and mining operations. It has been brought to the Government&#39;s attention that the Bill unless amended would not adequately meet the Government&#39;s commitment to protect existing rights in relation to a 1969  agreement  for mining at Groote Eylandt. Accordingly, this amendment and a consequential amendment to clause 43 (2) and a proposed new schedule will guarantee that the Commonwealth is able to meet its legal obligations to grant further mineral leases in the eastern areas of Groote Eylandt under the agreement. The amendment removes the necessity to obtain Aboriginal consent for the granting of these mining interests but the company will still be obliged to negotiate fair terms and conditions. The agreement provides that if the company constructs a smelter before 30 June 1 977 or an agglomeration plant by 30 June 1980 additional special mineral leases will be granted by the Commonwealth. Already the company has met its obligation to construct smelting facilities and an agglomeration plant is close to completion. The company is therefore in a position to call on the Government to meet its obligation to provide additional leases and it is considered appropriate that the Government should be able to meet these obligations. </para>
          <para>An additional schedule 3 is necessary in relation to new sub-clause 40 (7) to provide a precise  description of the areas referred to as the eastern areas of Groote Eylandt. </para>
          <para>My other amendment relates to clause 43 (2). It is a consequential amendment to ensure that where additional leases are granted at Groote Eylandt it will be subject to negotiation of fair terms and conditions with the Aborigines. An additional amendment to the sub-clause makes it clear that while additional payments may be negotiated it is not mandatory that agreements between land councils and applicants for mining interests include provision for the payment of sums of money. As originally provided, payments- even nominal payments- would have been essential to comply with the provision. In some instances payments additional to statutory royalties and rentals must be sought by land councils. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward noted in relation to oil and gas at paragraph 704 of his report that the financial interests of Aborigines would be well served by the appropriation of a 10 per cent royalty payment to their benefit. </para>

            <para>-The Opposition opposes the amendments although we have agreed to them being moved together. We feel that this is a further extension of the interference of the Australian Mining Industry Council in the drafting of amendments for the Government. Obviously the amendments are designed to cover up loopholes. Although the Aborigines may have made some gains, it is the intention of the Government to ensure that the interests of the mining companies are not damaged in any way. The introduction of the new schedule indicates this because the Bill itself contains protections for the Ranger area generally. The Opposition is most unhappy about the amendments. Admittedly we are not worried about the consequential amendments because they merely follow the major amendment. I do not think there is any need for me to elaborate. We covered this in detail yesterday when we pointed out that we would have objections to certain aspects of the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill even after these amendments were moved. We have the same objections to the amendments which have been moved by the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle).</inline></para>

            <para>- I feel that I must say a few words about these amendments. Possibly many of the amendments which the Opposition will move are covered by these amendments so we may be justified in taking some time speaking about them now rather than when the Opposition amendments are moved. Many of the Opposition&#39;s amendments are opposed to the advantage which is given to mining companies. The main amendment and the 4 consequential amendments do nothing else but extend the power of the mining company in Groote Eylandt. This is the point I was making last night. It is all right to get up and say what ill treatment we have given Aborigines. It is all right to make the utterances we have made in support of Aborigines. But this is the testing time for those Aborigines who have a traditional claim to their lands or, as we heard last night, the sacred land of those people which comes out of their dream time. They are identified with the land. It is land that means so much to them. Can it be dug up in the interests of a mining company without the Aborigines having a say? That is the whole issue here. It applies only to land that may be found to be traditional Aboriginal land with all its myths, traditions and everything else. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Because there is a mining company and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward said that we have to preserve present contracts, we now have these amendments. Under the provisions of the licence, if the company does certain things before 1980 the Government will give it a further grant of land to mine. It is not just a question of honouring contracts, it is a question of preserving the interests of the mining companies. With all our fine speeches about our knowledge of the Aboriginals&#39; love of the land because it is their land, it is their identity, it is where they were born, the whole thing goes into the melting pot because a mining company has found rich minerals there. The most important point the proposed alteration to clause 40. The amendment states: </para>

              <para>- I have been to the areas which have been mentioned, and to Groote Eylandt in particular, and I have noticed many Aboriginal people driving bulldozers and equipment such as that in the area. They are attracting quite substantial salaries and are profiting from the operations of the mining company. I do not think we should underestimate the value of that to the Aboriginal people. There is also the question of the royalties paid into the Aboriginal trust funds. These are of tremendous economic advantage and benefit to the Aboriginal people. I think that point should be made when we are dealing with this question. </para>

            <para>- I did not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> would come up with an argument like that. It is just not the point we are talking about. The principle goes deeper. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh,</inline> I thought had settled the argument when he pointed out some of the reasons why this sort of authority ought not to be given to the Government in these circumstances. The Aboriginal people will be dispossessed of their own lands. The Government cannot crawl to the mining companies all the time in the name of so-called progress. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> that mining companies in this country have a diabolical record in relation to the employment of Aboriginal people. They have an equally diabolical record for putting their bulldozers into sacred sites, into areas of significance which belong to the Aboriginal people. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> defended the mining companies against the Aboriginals. What does he think they are going to do? Does he think they will come roaring into Comalco with spears and woomeras and get stuck into the white people? Is that what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> fears? The opposition he put was so childish that I cannot believe it came from somebody on that side of the chamber as ultra-conservative as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop.</inline> Again, I join with my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> in our total opposition to these 5 amendments. </para>

            <para>- I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that relationships between the company on Groote Eylandt and the Aboriginal people are at a pretty high level. One of the first questions I asked the mining people on Groote Eylandt concerned sacred sites and the extent of the company&#39;s encroachment or near encroachment on those sacred sites. I asked how the company avoided that and I was told that it was done in consultation with the elders of the council. The company takes an elder over the area it proposes to develop to ensure with absolute certainty that it is not encroaching on sacred ground. That was the experience I had when I went there on more than one occasion, and I believe the point ought to be brought out. </para>

            <para>- I am prompted by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> &#39;s remarks to re-enter this debate. I appreciate what he has said, and I think he truly portrays the attitude of the Government to the question of Aboriginals and mining interests. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> forgets that no suggestion has been made that there should not be mining there. He pointed out all the benefits which flow from mining and the distribution of funds to the Aboriginal Trust Fund and to the local Aboriginals. Of course those benefits do flow, but again <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> put the benefits on a commercial basis. For how much do you sell your sacred right? That is the question. What price do you put on your sacred right? There has been no difficulty in mining on the Aboriginal lands in the Northern Territory. At Oenpelli, where there was some confusion and the Aboriginals withheld their agreement, I believe they are now anxious to enter into an agreement. But where there are minerals in an area, each Aboriginal has to make a decision about the value of the land to him in his traditional way. He has to consider the benefits that flow if he permits the mining company to come in. He makes the decision. Clause 40 provides: </para>

          <para class="block">It is a question of getting the consent of the Aboriginals, but there are Aboriginals who do not want their traditional land dug up at any price. We talk about arbitration, but it may be that although the Aboriginals resent the land being dug up in the search for minerals they would permit it at a certain price. But provision is made for an arbitrator, who can tell the Aboriginals that they do not have the option to barter their land and that he will fix what he considers to be a fair price. These amendments take away the right of the Aboriginal to decide and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Jessop</inline> has just shown, it is impossible for the white man to decide on the value to the Aboriginal of the undisturbed land. We say that benefits will flow on, but we do not understand the Aboriginal mind. Where there are minerals and we think it is desirable to develop them, we say that there should be approval by the Aboriginal Land Council and the Minister. Because there may not be approval or because the price of approval is too high, in relation to Groote Eylandt the Government can tell the mining company that it can go ahead, not with present contracts but with future contracts, if it does certain things, not in relation to paying Aboriginals, which they must do, but in relation to honouring a contract to build some conglomeration before 1980. As I said before, that situation illustrates the difference between the policies of the Liberal and Labor Parties on Aboriginal land rights. </para>

            <para>- At this stage I want to clarify what seems to be some misinterpretation of the amendments moved by the Government. The use of the Third Schedule is specifically to exclude a small and specific area of Groote Eylandt. This will meet legal obligations under a specific agreement. I am talking of an area of just less than 44 square kilometres. As I said when introducing the amendments, they are to meet the Government&#39;s commitment to protect existing rights in relation to an agreement of 1969 on mining at Groote Eylandt. That is the reason for and purpose of the Government&#39;s amendments. Some of the motives which have been imputed in the speeches which have been made from the Opposition are not based on these facts as I have just stated them. </para>

            <para>- I appreciate what the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> has said, but both speakers on this side of the chamber are basing our protest on facts. I am wondering how far this campaign is going. We are receiving telephone calls from Central Australia saying that all radio broadcasts have been cut off in the area. If there is a service fault, I accept that as an excuse. But if it has been decided to change to some other program at Government direction, I think this is keeping information away from people. Radio broadcasts are the only source of information that Aboriginal people in the remote areas of Australia have. I suggest, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> with great respect that an urgent inquiry ought to be made to find out why there is a radio blackout in Central Australia. </para>

          <para>This Bill concerns the people in that area presently more than anybody else in Australia. Should some of our amendments be agreed to and incorporated in the Bill they will tidy it up considerably. I should like to see them all agreed to, of course, but judging by the present mood of the Government that is unlikely to happen. Of course if that were to happen it would make this Bill similar to the original Bill that was introduced in the other place late in 1975. 1 suggest with great respect to the Minister that we have a genuine opposition to the introduction of these amendments. We cannot change our mind on them because that would be totally inconsistent with what we intend to do with our own amendments. </para>

Now that the amendments moved by the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> have been accepted, I believe that the tone for the whole debate on this Bill has been set. In other words this now means that the Aboriginal people will be denied the basic aspects associated with their land rights except for a few crumbs the Government will sweep off the table for them. While I am on this subject, I might as well arrange for a correction to be made. I think it might be nice if we start off with the record completely straight. At page 2744, column 2, of yesterday&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> is reported as seeking leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a letter.

            <para>Criticism has centred on the persons involved in recording and translating these submissions and conversation which has had the effect of distracting attention away from what these Aboriginal men have to say. The additional information is given because various individuals and organisations have made written evaluations and appraisals of the transcripts primarily for the enlightenment of the Government but at the same time giving them wider general circulation. To the best of our knowledge these evaluations have been made without any attempt to communicate with the Aboriginals who made the statements. The insinuation that the transcripts are submissions of the Finke River Mission are quite false. Of the Aboriginals involved in making submissions, quite a number have seen the criticisms and they have found it almost impossible to believe anyone could generate such ideas with any pretence of honesty. </para>

He claims that the tapes and transcripts are not correct. So obviously some political manipulation has been going on in relation to the drafting of lands rights legislation. We on this side of the chamber have said consistently right throughout that there has been a teaming up by a number of people, mostly dominated by the National Country Party of Australia, to prevent the Aboriginal people of the Northern Territory from getting that land to which they are entitled. As I said yesterday, the situation will revert to the position where the Gurindjis now will have to make a fresh application. The people of Willowra, who should have been able to get their land in the foreseeable future, will not get it. It is all very glib, smooth and slick for Government spokesmen to say: &#39;All they have to do is apply to the Lands Commission&#39;. It is not as simple as that.

Clause 2 now states that, whereas the Act is to come into operation on a date to be fixed by proclamation, proposed section 70 is to operate at a later date. The Opposition wants to know why the Government is having six of one and half a dozen of the other in relation to this clause. Incidentally, proposed section 70 is related to that section of the Bill which deals with the right of entry onto Aboriginal land. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, in paragraph 109 of his second report, said: </para>

            <para>- The Government does not accept the Opposition&#39;s amendment. As is known by those who have read the Bill, the commencement date will be fixed by proclamation, but the operation of proposed section 70 may be deferred. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has stated, it relates to entry onto Aboriginal land. The reason for the deferment of proposed section 70 is that this deferment will allow for a law of the Territory to exempt certain classes of persons from entry permit requirements and provide machinery for other persons to obtain permits to enter Aboriginal land before proposed section 70 becomes operative. The delay in the proclamation of proposed section 70 will allow a law of the Northern Territory- that is, the Social Welfare Ordinance controlling the permit requirements -to continue operation until such time as the ordinance is appropriately amended. As the Social Welfare Ordinance contains a total package for the administration of the entry onto Aboriginal land, it would be preferable to allow its amendment before allowing it to operate concurrently with the Commonwealth Act. </para>

            <para>- I want to ask a brief question. With the coming into operation of the Act, at least that land in the First Schedule will immediately become Aboriginal land. Clause 70, which prohibits entry without a permit onto Aboriginal land, will not apply until such time as a proclamation is made bringing clause 70 into operation. Until then will there be no prohibition on the entry onto Aboriginal land in the Northern Territory? </para>

            <para>- The delay in the proclamation of clause 70 will allow a law of the Northern Territory to continue in operation until such time as the law is appropriately amended. As the Social Welfare Ordinance contains a total package for the administration of the entry onto Aboriginal land, it would be preferable to allow its amendment before allowing it to operate concurrently with the Commonwealth Act. That will cover the situation mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline></para>

They want it for themselves. They want to exploit it in their own interests. That is the way they are going to prostitute this Bill the moment it leaves this chamber. </para>

              <para>- Because in relation to the 3 Aboriginal Bills we have been debating today there have been many representations, many things done and many amendments. I am very satisfied with the great bulk of the amendments which have been made to the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill, which I think have improved it very considerably. If I as an individual or someone else in this chamber thinks there might be another here or another one there, then it is a matter on which we must weigh up all the concerns and all the entitlements of people involved in the area and do what is best with prime consideration for the interests of the Aborigines, who I think are concerned with this. </para>

                <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Coleman</inline>is saying that I do not have the courage of my convictions. I think I have demonstrated the courage of my convictions on some occasions. I have never seen any members of the Australian Labor Party with any courage. They have pretty well no conviction at all. They are not the people to talk about the courage of your convictions. Clause 23, dealing with the powers of the land councils, deals with traditional Aboriginal land. This is one of the major matters encompassed in the Bill. Of course there are other concerns that must not be forgotten. They must be dealt with. I hope they will be constantly under review and that the Committee of the Parliament which is being formed to consider the implementation of this Bill will have these things in mind. I hope it will also have in mind the claims, which are another matter of dispute, of need of the land not based on traditional rights but on need. I hope that will be considered as still a fundamentally important matter, but it will be dealt with in a different way from what has been done in this Bill. It appears worth while recalling what is stated in the Woodward report. I have a great deal of respect for both the author of the report and the report itself. In paragraph 274 of the second report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward states: </para>

They have become attached to these areas of land and generally speaking desire to continue to live there. In no case could it be established that the land in question also constituted the traditional land of the particular persons now occupying it, although it may have formed part of the general tribal area of these people. In practically each case the land upon which they are now living is Crown land. The circumstances in which they are living is totally unsatisfactory to both themselves, to the white population of these towns and to Australian society as a whole &#39;. </para>

            <para>- I am surprised to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> quote the very same extracts from the Woodward report as I had intended to quote at this point of the Committee stage because it seems to me that any reasonable interpretation of the extracts which were just quoted would lead one to the conclusion that Justice Woodward did intend that needs claims rather than traditional claims be included in this Bill. The purpose of the amendment moved by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition is to give effect to those recommendations of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, which were that the Aboriginal Land Commissioner have jurisdiction to make recommendations relating to grants of land for Aboriginals within towns. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has said we must weigh up all the possibilities, we must look at all the people affected and so on. I do not think that is what we should do at all. What we should be doing is facilitating the ability of Aboriginal people, whether they be town dwellers or reserve dwellers, to make land rights claims. Unless the Government accepts these amendments the fringe dwellers in places like Alice Springs will not be able to make land claims under this Bill and nothing that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has said will change that fact. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>Several of us spoke in the second reading debate about the needs of people living in fringe areas of Alice Springs and I do not think there is any need to repeat them, but if Government supporters who spoke at such length about their concern to rectify the wrongs done to Aboriginal people and to make up to the Aboriginal people for the destruction of their culture and their traditional way of life meant what they said for one minute then I fail to see how they can refuse to support this amendment because it is those people, as Justice Woodward said, who have been moved away from their traditional land in camps around Alice Springs and similar places who are the worst victims of the racism of this country. The people living in their traditional way on their traditional land are not as badly disadvantaged as the people in the fringe areas of Alice Springs. I fail to comprehend any logic from any Government supporter who says on the one hand &#39;We are concerned in this Bill to rectify the mistakes of the past; we are concerned to give Aboriginals a way of establishing their land claims&#39; and in the same breath says &#39;but of course this Bill does not do that; it will be done in some other way&#39;. The proper way for all Aboriginal people to make land claims should be through the Land Commissioner as Justice Woodward recommends. </para>
          <para>I want to make just one other point, which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Missen</inline> has half made for me, by quoting again from the Woodward report, and that is that the number of people involved in these camps around the towns is very small- 2374 Aborigines in greater Darwin and 1269 in Alice Springs. It is a small number of very disadvantaged people about whom we are talking. Why is it that this small number of people cannot be given the protection and the facility offered in the legislation before us? It is not as if there are going to be thousands and thousands of people in towns making claims which will be very difficult to resolve. Some of this small number of people are already living on vacant Crown land around Alice Springs- land that presumably nobody else wants or that nobody else has been using. It seems to me to be quite inhumane to say that these few Aboriginal people living around Alice Springs cannot under this Bill lay claims to the land on which they have been living in some cases- I am sure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> is aware of this -for 20 or 30 years. Certainly it is not land to which they have traditional rights but it is the land on which they have been living, some of them for their whole lifetime- particularly the younger members of the tribes that are living in this way. Why cannot those few Aboriginals make claims under this Bill for which Government senators have made such claims and which I believe would if the provisions were extended to these people offer a lot more protection than would be available to them in making land claims through the Department of the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para>I do not intend to speak at length on other amendments which will be moved by the Opposition, but I would like to say very clearly for the record that it is on this point that the sincerity of Government senators&#39; intentions in regard to the Aboriginal people will be tested. If Government senators cannot see that acceptance of this amendment will immeasurably improve the Bill then I think there is no sincerity in anything they have said up to this point. I repeat, a small number of Aboriginal people are involved. It is the most disadvantaged section of the Aboriginal community which is involved. To support these amendments would be to support the spirit of the Woodward report and would enable the fringe dwelling Aboriginal people to have the same legislative rights as people living in traditional areas. I exhort Government senators at this stage to look seriously at the amendment and to support it. </para>

This Bill deals with traditional Aboriginal people making traditional claims to traditional lands. Sure there are fringe dwellers. There are fringe dwellers in every city and town throughout the length and breadth of Australia and governments up until now have taken no account of them, but fortunately under the present Government an Aboriginal Lands Trust is able to look after the fringe dweller in the situation Opposition supporters are talking about. Fringe dwelling Aborigines can apply to the Trust to have the land purchased and handed to them. This has nothing whatever to do with this Bill which is dealing with tribal Aboriginal people- people who have traditional claims to traditional land. I cannot understand why the Opposition is trying to make out that we are not concerned for the fringe dwellers. I am concerned with them because I am of a fringe dwelling situation and want to see it taken care of not only in the Northern Territory in Alice Springs and in Darwin but also throughout the length and breadth of Australia. I am glad that in the Northern Territory at least the fringe dwelling situations there can be looked after under the Trust which has $lm, as I understand it at the moment. The Trust can purchase land around Alice Springs and hand it to the fringe dwelling people. It is not necessary to incorporate this amendment in this Bill. </para>

            <para>- This amendment seeks to delete from the definition &#39;alienated Crown land&#39; the words but does not include land in a town&#39;. A further amendment to be moved later will seek to omit from the definition &#39;unalienated Crown land&#39; the same words. The Committee has heard the contributions from the other side of the chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> will acknowledge that I am one of the Opposition supporters whom he accuses of not understanding what the Bill is about. I accept from the statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> that he knows full well what the Bill is about. As he says, this Bill seeks to give tribal land to tribal owners. I would alter that statement by suggesting the words &#39;some tribal land to some tribal owners&#39;. This is the complaint of the Opposition. The Woodward report referred to land for Aboriginals but this definition is restrictive. We both agree that the Bill is not sufficient. The proposal to leave out the words &#39;but does not include land in a town&#39; is consequential because it fits in with the other proposed amendments which seek to make the Bill one for Aboriginals. </para>

          <para class="block">It is pointed out in one of the paragraphs that the proposition that Aboriginals should be pushed out because the site on which they have been living is required for housing development should not be accepted. That is the approach at which he suggests that the Commission should be looking.

Therefore such areas cannot be considered for purchase by the Trust as places where Aboriginals should settle. We are defeating Woodward &#39;s proposals by doing that.

              <para>-I would have thought that it was most appropriate, especially when we have a Commission whose duty it is to look after the claims of Aboriginals and whose duty it is then to recommend what we can do to satisfy such claims. In the case of a claim made for the site on which Darwin is located, I think it is proper for the Commission- the Commission has looked into the Kulaluk claims- to recommend to the Minister that a particular area should be granted to those Aborigines who had a legitimate claim to the Darwin site. Firstly, they should be given land by way of compensation, not the site on which Darwin is located. Secondly, as is envisaged by Woodward, we should have a commission which ensures that the fringe dwellers are not pushed further and further into the outback just because the white man wants to use the land for a housing development. That is the justification for and that is the whole purpose of the amendment. It would not have the effect of excluding a township. Its only effect would be to permit the Commission to look into the matter and make a recommendation on it. But the Government prohibits it from looking into those matters. It prohibits the Commission looking into matters concerned with land other than traditional land. The Commission cannot do what Woodward envisaged. </para>

          <para>I notice that mention is made in the report of the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs, in conjunction with the Minister for the Northern Territory, granting a lease to Aboriginals in Alice Springs. But it is a lease which can be terminated. It is not proposed to give the Aboriginals land. It acknowledges that they are going to be there. They are going to live there. But they are excluded from owning the land. The whole purport of the Woodward report was to give land to Aboriginals. The whole purpose of the Opposition&#39;s amendments is to do that very thing. </para>

            <para>- The Government has decided that the provision of land in towns claimed on a needs basis should be handled under the normal process of Northern Territory law. It is for that reason that the Government is unable to accept the amendment moved by the Opposition. The Government has already decided that most of the land claimed in Alice Springs, for example, will be granted under the Northern Territory leasehold system as recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward. Aboriginal groups have indicated that they will cooperate with the Government in the preparation of development plans for that land. The combined action of the Government and of the Aboriginals hopefully will result in the resolution of some of the problems facing fringe dwellers in these areas. I do not doubt that we all have very grave concern about the fringe dwellers of the towns and cities in this country and about the need to provide adequate housing and land acquisition opportunities that will provide for them the standards which we believe they are entitled to have for their living arrangements. The Government believes that it is inappropriate, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> has said, to complicate legislation which deals with traditional land rights. As there are already appropriate administrative machinery arrangements for dealing with claims based on need, we believe that the amendment that has been moved by the Opposition to this clause cannot be accepted. </para>

            <para>- Once again <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> has made loose charges and carried on with what I would describe as vilification. The Country-Liberal Party is the majority Party in the Northern Territory and is supported by the majority of the people. Regardless of how <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> feels towards that Party it has been made the majority Party by the people to represent the people in the Northern Territory. It has the support of a large number of Aboriginals. It has that support because of the interest it takes in the Aboriginal people. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline>referred to the Albrecht theory. What a ridiculous statement he made. It is ridiculous because obviously he does not understand the situation. I could say also that other people obviously do not understand the situation. There is no Albrecht theory. There is no theory which applies just to central Australia. I refer interested people and all of those people who possibly have been poorly advised and who believe that there is an Albrecht system to the joint parliamentary committee which is proposed to be formed for the purpose of reviewing the provisions of this Bill. I support to the best of my ability the setting up of that committee. In fact, I am one of those who insisted that that committee be formed so that it can oversee the legislation to ensure that it works. Once the legislation is enacted that committee can look at any problems which occur and hopefully make recommendations to the Government which will then act upon those recommendations and seek to cure the ills involved. </para>
          <para>This is the first Federal Bill of its kind in Australia. There will be problems. As I have indicated before, I believe, as a person who lives in the Northern Territory, that there will be problems with the traditional land owners. This legislation is related to the traditional owners of the traditional land. The concept of Aboriginal land owning clans is not properly recognised. But to illustrate that there is no such thing as an Albrecht theory, I suggest that people interested read <inline font-style="italic">Kin and Totem</inline> by Johannes Falkenberg; <inline font-style="italic">Aboriginal Man in Australia,</inline> which was written in honour of Professor Elkin and edited by Professor Bend and Katherine Bend; <inline font-style="italic">The World of the First Australians</inline> by Professor Bend and Katherine Bend; <inline font-style="italic">Man, Land and Myth in North Australia,</inline> once again by Professor Bend and Katherine Bend; <inline font-style="italic">Aranda Traditions</inline> by Professor Strehlow; and <inline font-style="italic">Tribes and Boundaries in Australia,</inline> which is edited by Nicholas Peterson. They indicate that in the Northern Territory, there are land owning clans which, despite their laws, naturally do differ. But what I have been trying to impress upon the Senate is that there are such people as land owning clans throughout the Northern Territory. This is where a lot of the misunderstanding has taken place. </para>
          <para>In answer to some of the criticisms regarding fringe dwellers in Alice Springs, the situation is this: In the first place there are the Yunta people. They own the land. They have lived there from time immemorial. No other tribe or clan come into that area unless they were given permission. Those people lived in the river beds. They have not lived in those river beds for 20 or 30 years. That is their land and they have lived there for a long time. Over the last few years there have been intrusions through various assimilation policies of other tribes and clans coming into the area. The result was that there was quite a mixture of people. There was trouble within those people. The Aboriginal people themselves got together and agreed that they would require certain pieces of land on which they could separate into their own clans, families and so on and live in peace in the Alice Springs area. They had consultations with local government and with government with the result that certain leases have been granted, applications for leases are practically completed and one or two leases have yet to be processed. </para>
          <para>So the situation is this: There are leases that have been granted, there are leases that have been almost completed and there are others that are yet to be processed. Honourable senators should take note that these leases are not on the fringe of the town. They are ordinary leases under the Northern Territory land laws. They are in the town and they will be there for a long time. In fact the Aboriginal people will always own them. It will not be a case of Aboriginal people being pushed out and always being on the fringe. It is realised that if these people are to live in the community- and this is being encouraged- they should have the land or buildings or whatever facilities they require. Once again there has been misunderstanding here and not only misunderstanding but misrepresentation. I suggest to honourable senators on the other side of the chamber that if they want to make the noises they have made, they should be a little bit more accurate in future and at least give some recognition to the good that is being done by government for the Aboriginal people. They should not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is always doing, tear apart government policy and make false assertions and so on. He is the shadow Minister for the Northern Territory. In view of the way in which he is carrying on and always attacking the Northern Territory I have no doubt that he will remain, and be nothing more than, the shadow Minister. </para>
          <para>There have been many comments that I have had to answer, but I wish to refer briefly to another one. I wish to put this matter before the Government as I believe that in the future it will have to have a review of the interpretation of the definition of &#39;Aboriginal&#39;. I recommend to the Government that it take seriously the thoughts that have been expressed by the honourable member for Mackellar <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Wentworth)</inline> in the other place a few days ago. He suggested that the definition of &#39;Aboriginal should read: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>Aboriginal&#39; means a person who is a member of the Aboriginal race of Australia and is registered or entitled to be registered under the provisions of paragraph 24 (a) or who has been nominated by a person so registered as a member of his land-owning clan or group. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">He continued: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>If honourable members look at sub-clause 24 (a) of the Bill they will see that it enables Aborigines to make a register of people whom they consider to be Aborigines. </para>
            <para>This Bill allocates traditional land. Its title speaks of traditional Aboriginal land . . . </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">Another view of the matter is contained in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly of 1 April 1976. The Majority Leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts,</inline> said:   . . in the present bill is the definition of &#39;Aboriginals&#39; which is not consistent with Northern Territory reality. It is necessary to distinguish between the more traditional Aboriginals whose self identity has been culturally shaped and formed and those Aboriginals whose self identity has been largely formed on the basis of colour. Aboriginals as recognised in the Northern Territory have no difficulty in making this distinction. For them an Aboriginal is one who knows and has been put through the law. Under this definition, there would not be difficulties in determining Aboriginal ownership of traditional land in the Northern Territory. </para>
          <para class="block">As I have said, I believe that the Government should review its definition of &#39;Aboriginal&#39; in relation to the law that are being passed now. </para>

But he disappoints me when he says that. I should like to remind him that members of the Labor Party have always been prepared to stand up for their convictions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is one person who has been vilified by members of the Liberal Party over the years I have been in the Senate for standing up for his convictions in support of the Aboriginal people. On many occasions he has been called some nasty names but that has not deterred him from putting the case for the Aboriginal cause. I am sure it will not deter him in the future. </para>

Surely honourable senators on this side of the House, when they are accused of those things, should be allowed to stand up and protect themselves despite what the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> says. The proceedings of the Senate are being broadcast today and I am not going to sit here and allow those accusations to be made against honourable senators on this side of the House, in particular against me, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe, Senator Cavanagh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson,</inline> without having the opportunity to give the lie to those accusations. </para>

            <para>- I wish to refer to clause 3 of the Bill in reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff.</inline> I have waited for 2 days for someone to give me some word of praise. For the first time I have received it from one on my own side. My heart is now filled with compassion. Never again will I say a hasty word against anyone. I congratulate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> on his honesty, as I did last night. He showed direct character in advocating what he believes in. He quoted <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline> and supported his action in defining Aboriginals as only those who are entitled to be on the register kept by the lands councils. This is a register of tribal Aborigines with tribal claims who are the owners of the land although they may not live in the area. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Wentworth</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> want to divide the Aboriginals. They want to have a class of tribal Aboriginals and kick out all the others. I think this is in accordance with the attitude <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> expressed last night. He said that in the Northern Territory there are decent, old Aboriginals and young, drunken Aboriginals. I suppose we would have 3 classes: Tribal Aboriginals, young, drunken Aboriginals and other Aboriginals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> is attempting to divide them. It is evident that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> has been living in the Northern Territory for 46 years.  His  thoughts are for the land-owning, cattle station properties in the Northern Territory. It is good that he is honest about that. I take it that his speeches will be reported in the Northern Territory. I think it is a sign of honesty that he has declared fully his attitude to the position of Aboriginals. </para>

            <para>- I want to make a brief contribution to this debate simply to express regret at the extremely divisive approach which is being adopted by Opposition senators. It is quite clear that in a calculated way attempts are being made to set black against white and black against black. This is quite pathetic. It is a great disservice to the community. I make that statement with great seriousness because I think that the judgment of the Government that traditional land should be dealt with under this Bill and that other claims should be dealt with under the general law is a reasonable approach. It does not involve debate of the sort we have just heard from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh.</inline> I have expressed great admiration for </para>

            <para>- I cannot let the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> go by without commenting on them. I always thought that he was a small &#39;1&#39; liberal but his remarks were probably some of the most racist ever enunciated in this chamber. I regret that they came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and that he tried to create a division. That indicates that he is struggling for a Party which realises that it has taken away from the Aboriginal people that which is theirs in order to look after their own mining companies and what have you. It is obvious, as we said at the beginning of this debate, that the Government has put up a phony Bill and that it is not out to look after the Aboriginal people. I regret this incident and I hope it does not happen again. </para>

          <para>The Opposition promised to co-operate in getting this Bill through in a hurry or at least to assist as far as we could in the speedy passage of the Bill. It is not working out that way, mainly because people on the other side of the chamber have wanted to enter into a protracted debate and the accusations coming from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> are doing nothing to help the harmony of the organisation. I want to refer <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> to a speech made by the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner)</inline> which is reported in Hansard of 17 November. Perhaps he will believe what the Minister said when the words are read out to him. <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> cannot be classified as a subversive document or something subject to the Censorship Board.

              <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline>Woodward was thoroughly conscious of the need to provide within Australia domestic law for the traditional interests of Aborigines. He was conscious of the need to provide a system of law within which the position of traditional owners is respected and entrenched. I know the views of Pastor Albrecht. I have sat with him and his 2 assistants at Hermannsburg for 2 days and discussed his propositions at length. I respect the views which he holds. However, they are not the views which are held by respected anthropologists or by others who have studied this area of Aboriginal interest for many years. With due respect to the views of Pastor Albrecht, I do not accept them. I think that what  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward has provided in his report and what is reflected in this legislation will do all that is required to provide for the traditional ownership rights of Aborigines in the Northern Territory. </para>

              <para>-The honourable senator should wait until I have finished. I did not interrupt him when he was speaking. I met Pastor Albrecht a number of times. I respect him for what he tries to do in other areas. I think that he has been misled. He has had the wool pulled over his eyes. He has been led by the nose by characters such as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts,</inline> the majority leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. It is obvious that these 2 gentlemen have been working against the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill for a very long time because in reply to a question asked by my colleague <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Robertson</inline> on 6 December, recorded at page 2672 of <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> an astronomical figure was disclosed as having been spent on travelling by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr G.</inline> A. Letts and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr B.</inline> F. Kilgariff, now <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff. Dr Letts</inline> spent $ 10,2 12 for the financial year. I guess a lot of this was on travelling expenses while campaigning against the type of Bill we have here today. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Kilgariff</inline> in 5 months and 13 days spent $3,441 on travelling expenses. That is a lot of money; they must have been really travelling around. I hope that we have now heard the last word on it. </para>

He keeps on shovelling more dirt into the debate every time he stands. I do not know what the honourable senator was referring to when he mentioned the majority leader spending $10,000 and me spending $5,000 in travelling expenses. If he was referring to the Legislative Assembly, and presumably that is what he was referring to, I remind the honourable senator that the majority leader has responsibility for over half a million square miles and has to do a tremendous amount of travel- almost as much as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe. Senator Keeffe</inline> spoke of people having pulled the wool over the eyes of Pastor Albrecht. If anybody has pulled the wool over Pastor Albrecht &#39;s eyes it is the Aboriginal people because he speaks on behalf of the Aboriginal people. It is not the Albrecht theory, and because they have no one else to represent their viewpoint they use Pastor Albrecht, who is a conscientious and honest man. </para>

            <para>- I do not think I should need to make an explanation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> should be able to work it out for himself. The Opposition said earlier that the Government has prostituted the terms of the original Labor Bill by comparison with the terms of this Bill in such a way that one becomes suspicious of a full stop at the end of every paragraph in case some hidden meaning is included to deprive Aboriginal people of their just rights. </para>

          <para class="block">It ill behoves <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> to cast aspersions on me or on anybody else on this side of the chamber when he set the tone for this debate when he followed me yesterday and decided that he would go off the verbal deep end. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> wants to invite debate and prolong the agony, he is entitled to do that. However, I make the point that the Northern Territory under the present system has been very slow and indifferent about processing land claims in towns. We had a lengthy discussion yesterday, and brief reference was made to it again this morning, about the reluctance of the Government to re-institute the freeze when it expires on 3 1 December this year in order to give Aboriginal people a decent go. </para>
          <para>There are 3 amendments to which I will refer later for the benefit of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume.</inline> There is the amendment the Opposition has just lost, the one we are currently debating and another one which I will be moving directly after this vote is taken. There is a lot of confusion about the Northern Territory, and as the Government is handing over most of the powers in the Bill to ordinances which will be drafted under Northern Territory laws it will have to take into consideration the fact that the Opposition is reluctant to see it cast away land in towns which may be properly claimed by Aboriginal people. If the matter is left at that point and the proposed section includes the reference to land in a town, it will exclude Aboriginal people. Perhaps that might have sunk through to the normally fairly sharp witted brain of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume,</inline> which seems to have become rather confused on land rights. </para>

            <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Chairman,</inline> there is an explanation, and I should have thought that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> would have realised it. I have always maintained that to talk of consistency is to speak of a weak mind. I do not know the details, but there is no similarity between this Bill and the Bill to be introduced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> It may have been a proper definition for the purposes of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> &#39;s Bill. On the other hand, it could well have been that the Bill having come from the draftsman with that wording, if it had come here for debate, might have been amended. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Keeffe might have seen the justification for withdrawing it. That is not strange. After all, this Government introduced 42 amendments to its Bill. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and the committee looking at the Government Bill were of the opinion that the definition was undesirable in that form. While the Opposition has been defeated on its amendment relating to the commission looking at Aboriginal land in a town, the Government seeks to extend the area of a town to include any area which is proclaimed under the regulations in force. I do not know the extent of that, but it could exclude from time to time areas of land at which the commission is looking. The reason for the change in attitude by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> is that there is a great suspicion at Borroloola that there could be a declaration of a town there on Aboriginal land. To compare the words in one document with words in another document with a different intention is entirely misleading and unfair. </para>

            <para>- The Government is unable to accept the amendment. In common with the one which preceded it and with the next one, this amendment overlooks the fact that the Bill deals exclusively with traditional land rights. As I said before, the Government decided that any request from groups for land in the towns should be dealt with outside this Bill and through the ordinary administration of land use in the Northern Territory. It should be recalled that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward, when speaking of town claims, clearly indicated that the tenure of any land in towns by Aboriginals should be the same kind of tenure as that for all other persons and that any request for such land should go through the normal town planning procedures of the Northern Territory. The Minister for Aboriginal Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr Viner),</inline> when speaking in the debate in the other House, said that that would be done. As the Government has indicated throughout the discussion on the matter of towns as they relate to this legislation, it is not appropriate to accept the amendments which the Opposition is moving. </para>

          <para class="block">The amendment is designed to ensure that mining interests with options or other rights must seek consent when land becomes Aboriginal land. The 1975 legislation provided that mining interests seeking extensions should be subject to consent. For instance, Nab al co had a 42-year lease with an option for another 2 1 years. Yet it has the right under this Bill to get automatic renewal. This applies also to a number of other mining interests. I do not think I need go any further in advancing my argument on that; I think it is self-explanatory. It is the sort of thing that the members of the Opposition have been saying since this debate started yesterday. </para>
          <para>I think that some people on the other side of the Parliament are a bit touchy. They are people who belong to the left wing of the Liberal Party of Australia as opposed to the right wing. They have to live with their consciences. We are not trying to say to anybody: &#39;Leave your Party and cross the floor and vote with us&#39;, All we are saying, in a very reasonable way, is: &#39;These sorts of amendments are not going to bankrupt your Government. Why do you not accept them as they are?&#39; They are genuinely moved amendments and they ought to be accepted as they are. There is no reason for anybody to break away from the Liberal Party or for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff,</inline> as the sole representative of his Party in this chamber, to break away all by himself. There is no need for that sort of thing. We are not trying to intimidate honourable senators opposite to do that. But we are making an appeal to the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> and the honourable senators opposite to see a bit of sweet reason and to accept the amendments. I admit that the amendments are too left wing for the right wing of the Liberal Party. But there are people in the left wing of the Liberal Party who have a more progressive attitude and who sometimes believe in the rights of people, even minority groups like Aborigines. Honourable senators opposite ought to be prepared to accept the amendments. But if they are not prepared to accept them there is nothing that we can do. </para>
          <para>A member of the Liberal Party said to me a few days ago: &#39;Why should we tear our guts out in the Party room over this sort of Bill when, the way Mai is going, we are sliding into oblivion and you blokes will be there in 1978 and you will amend the Bill in the way we want to amend it anyway?&#39; That is a very negative approach but there are people of that mind in your Party who are taking the easy way out.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">This comes right back to what I have been saying in this debate, namely, that the Australian Mining Industry Council drafted the Bill for the Government and that the Government inserted one or two amendments here and there and is now trying to sell it to us as its property. In paragraph 625 <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward said: </para>

            <para>When the understandable expectations of these companies that they would be able to continue exploration under the rules which governed them to begin with, are weighed against the equally reasonable expectation of Aborigines that their wishes about reserve lands will now be respected, I have no doubt in my mind which expectation must be disappointed. </para>

          <para class="block">Woodward, of course- in the same way as the Australian Labor Party would do in Governmentwould ensure that the miners would be disappointed.

            <para>- The amendment is not acceptable to the Government. This clause protects existing mining interests, as recommended by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward and accepted by the Government. If the renewal of mining interests which carry an option or right of renewal were not protected from consent procedures it would mean that existing legal interests were not fully protected. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s draft legislation provided protection for all interests, including interests- I quote him- &#39;agreed to be granted by the Crown&#39;. The definition of alienated interest&#39; in his draft Bill refers to these matters.

          <para>With regard to sub-clause 3(5), a limited number of public roads, the use of which has not been subject to control by the permit system, are excluded from the grant, but Aboriginals will control entry on to their land. Other matters were referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe.</inline> He talked of the rights of people and made somewhat inflammatory statements. I do not think they clarify the matters with which we are dealing. The rights of people include the dignity of people, and I think that includes our colleagues in this chamber.

            <para>- The Government does not accept the proposed amendment. I refer to two or three matters in order to clarify the position. The amendment which the Government has made to the Bill which was introduced in June will preserve the special purpose lease granted to Nab al co at Gove under the Special Purpose Lease Ordinance and the Mining (Gove Peninsula Nab al co Agreement) Ordinance by ensuring that these are treated as land leases to be held in escrow and not mining interests. In other words, in the same way as the Bill preserves existing interests in land, in these respects the Bill preserves the special mining interests of the companies at Nabalco. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I point out also that the Government has protected the Aboriginals in situations such as that at Gove and Groote Eylandt in that where extensions are required to the interests in land of the companies concerned pursuant to contractual obligations of the Commonwealth entered into with the companies, those companies must negotiate proper terms and conditions for any new lease. Where, however, the companies require new mineral leases, the granting of those new mineral leases will be subject to the same requirements of consent and negotiation of fair terms as all other mineral interests. </para>

            <para>- The reference is as it is expressed. It shall not be read as including a reference to any land on which there is a road over which the public has a right of way. This clause allows trusts to be established and recommendations made for the transfer of title to them in respect of traditional land which is vacant Crown land, other than reserves and other lands listed in the Schedule, on the recommendation of the Land Commissioner. This clause, as we have amended it, will in addition allow a land trust to be formed for alienated land where title is held by Aboriginals; that is, pastoral properties which are leased to Aboriginals and which might become Aboriginal land if the Commissioner so recommends. Sub-clause (3), as has been stated, shall be read as not including a reference to any land on which there is a road over which the public has a right of way. </para>

            <para>-That explanation has rather confused the issue. Perhaps I might cite as an instance the Simpson Desert where there is a road which goes from the Northern Territory through to the Queensland border and which, I understand, passes through some traditional areas. Does this sub-clause mean that Aboriginal people who may wish to make a claim to those areas in fact have no claim at all because the road and not the Aborigines will have the highest priority? </para>

            <para>- I think the matter has been explained very clearly. If a national road runs through some land which the Aboriginal people claim, they cannot actually claim the road that passes through that land. I think that is fair and just. If national roads and recognised roads, on which the general public has travelled over the years, run through land on which the Aboriginal people make a claim, I think it is fair enough that they are not able to claim that actual strip of land on which the road is built. I see no complications in that situation. </para>

I think <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> missed the whole point. The question is: What is or what is not Aboriginal land? I agree that in the case of a road over which the public has a right of way there should be some provision in the Bill which retains that public right of way. </para>

              <para>-No, I take a greater authority than the House of Lords and the Bishop of Oxford on this matter. I take as my authority those honourable senators from the Government side of the chamber who have spoken on the matter. It is well known that it is difficult to peg Aboriginal land. But each group knows its land. Surely if they know their land and they know which land is Aboriginal land, it must be their land, whether or not it has a road passing through it. They cannot be excluded from what is their land and what they know to be their land simply because somebody has built a road through it. I accept the proposition that perhaps there should be some control over the road by which there could be open access to it. But what is proposed in this provision is that the Commissioner cannot include that land as Aboriginal land. Clause 50 ( 1 ) reads: </para>

It may be that on that land there is a road to which the public has access. Possibly we should provide that they have continuing access.

          <para>The clause will then read: an arbitrator appointed by the Minister is satisfied, after hearing both the views of the applicant and the views of the Land Council on the matter and after giving paramount consideration to the interests of the traditional Aboriginal owners that the hardship that would be occasioned to the applicant by a refusal of his application would be greater than the hardship that would be occasioned to the Aboriginal communities or groups interested in the land by an approval of the application. </para>
          <para class="block">To use old Australian slang, the Government has had &#39;2 bob each way&#39;. There are a number of reasons why the Opposition&#39;s amendment should be accepted. I might add that if honourable senators on the other side of the chamber think that there was no interest in this matter during the suspension of the sitting for dinner, I can tell them that I received several more messages including a message from a large number of people in the Sydney area saying that they want the amendments inserted. Basically the purpose of the amendment to the clause is to ensure that where land is held in escrow and by a Land Council, a person seeking to renew his interest in that land for a further period or to convert his interest, an arbitrator appointed by the Minister to report on hardship that would be occasioned must give paramount consideration to the interests of the traditional Aboriginal owners. This reverts back to the discussion we had previously on clause 1 1 . </para>
          <para>Given the tendering of anthropological evidence, it is difficult to see that anything could outweigh the hardship caused to Aboriginals by deprivation of their traditional land. The wording that we have suggested follows that which has been judicially interpreted by Australian courts. It is hoped that this interpretation will be adopted by any person appointed as an arbitrator. We feel that if we insert those words as a further guide to the arbitrator it will make the case more waterproof as far as the Aboriginals are concerned. </para>
          <para>Without the amendment it seems clear that the criteria considered may be against the interests of the Aboriginals, as honourable senators on the other side of the chamber would be aware. Contemporary criteria, particularly in the Northern </para>
          <para class="block">Territory, is often related to economic wellbeing. For Aboriginals, however, no claim as to the possibility of capital loss can be made. All they may offer to the arbitrator is their religious and traditional links with their land. I come back to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner&#39;s</inline> remarks again. If there is a sacred site over which a road runs, the fact that that sacred site has been desecrated by a road does not, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> says, take away the sacredness of it. It is still a sacred site. I commend the amendment moved by the Opposition and hope that at long last the Government will accept one amendment. </para>

            <para>- The Government does not accept the Opposition&#39;s amendment. This clause prevents the Crown from granting interest in Aboriginal land the subject of a title deed held in escrow, except where the Crown is obliged under law to grant such interest or the relevant Land Council consent or in the circumstances outlined in sub-clause 2(b). With respect to subclause 2 (b) (ii) I point out to the Senate that the provisions cast a burden upon the applicant to make out his case before the arbitrator and thereby to override the interests of the Aboriginals. In that sense, the applicant having such a burden, the interests of the Aboriginals, by the force of the legislation, are superior. That has the same effect as that which the Opposition is seeking in its amendment- to recognise the paramountcy of the Aboriginal interest. Therefore, the amendment proposed by the Opposition is considered unnecessary by the Government because, as I have indicated, the legislation already recognises the superiority of Aboriginal interests. I mention that this does not refer to mining interests, but to estates or interests in land. The clause which is in the Bill is in line with the provisions of the 1975 Bill. The addition of the words which were suggested by the honourable senator would serve no useful purpose as the views of the Land Council must reflect the views of the traditional owners and the arbitrator must take account of the Land Council &#39;s view. </para>

I read the rest of the clause:  . . is satisfied, after hearing both the views of the applicant and the views of the Land Council on the matter, that the hardship that would be occasioned to the application by a refusal of his application would be greater than the hardship that would be occasioned to the Aboriginal communities or groups interested in the land by an approval of the application; </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr Chairman,</inline>permit me a word to respond to that dripping prejudice arising from a misunderstanding of the clause. Clause 13 relates to land held in escrow. A claim may be made by a person who has an estate or interest for a renewal of that estate or interest or a conversion of his present estate into another. Where there is a conflict of interest the Bill as drafted provides that an arbitrator appointed by the Minister shall arbitrate upon the comparative hardship caused by the refusal to the applicant of his application to renew as against the claim of the Aboriginal community. It is provided that where the arbitrator, after hearing the views of both the applicant and the Land Council, is satisfied that the hardship that would be occasioned to the applicant by the refusal would be greater than the hardship to the Aboriginal community the applicant shall be allowed a renewal of his estate. That expression means that the applicant carries the onus of showing the greater hardship. If the senseless words advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> were inserted there would be no need for arbitration. We would be writing into the statute a stipulation that the person appointed shall give paramount consideration to the interests of the Aborigines, whereas all that is being arbitrated upon is a claim to an interest by a person who has an existing estate as against the Aboriginal community which claims that it has Aboriginal rights over the land. The arbitrator will arbitrate upon the comparative hardship of refusing those applications and give a verdict in favour of the European applicant only if he is satisfied that the greater hardship falls on him. It would be quite otiose and not at all in keeping with sense to provide in a statute that an arbitrator be appointed and then say that (A) shall have paramountcy, that is that the arbitrator shall decide for (A). </para>

Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney, Senator Baume</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bonner</inline> will follow him out and tell him where he is wrong. I am confident that he is wrong. On the legal basis the actual hardship must be considered. When the hardship is greater for the applicant the legal decision will be in his favour. But this appears in a Bill to provide land rights for Aboriginals- their legal entitlements. We have heard so much about the great desire to help Aboriginals in their land claims. All we are asking the arbitrator to do when he is defining the question of hardship is to take into account the paramount considerations of the interests of the traditional Aboriginal owner. We are not asking him to permit that consideration to decide the issue. All we are asking is that when he is deciding hardship he take the interests of Aboriginals into consideration. In the legal mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wright</inline> such consideration gives a preference to the Aboriginals. But is not that what this Bill is all about? Is it not the intention to give preference to Aboriginals. </para>

The addition of the words suggested would serve no useful purpose as the views of the land council must reflect the views of the traditional owners and under this clause the arbitrator must take into account the land council&#39;s views. I would have expected <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> to have a better understanding of that clause. It is precisely the same as the clause which was included in its entirety in the 1975 Bill.

The fact is that the clause as it stands gives preference to Aboriginal communities or groups interested in the land because it requires that the applicant should have greater hardship than they if he is to succeed.

              <para>- The effect of clause 19 is that leases over Aboriginal land may not be granted except at the direction of a land council. Where the lease is to a non-Aboriginal, other than the Crown, a Crown authority or a mission, the consent of the Minister is also required. Paragraph 144 (x) of the Woodward report refers to these matters. The changes which were made to sub-clauses (2), (3), (4), (5) and (6) confirm the passive role of trusts by removing the phrase with the consent&#39;, which might suggest that the trust might have power to act on its own initiative, and substituting the phrase &#39;at the direction&#39;. Sub-clause (4) (b) permits the transfer of part of land from one trust to another to allow for the possibility of vesting land in individual clan groups. Aboriginal land may also be surrendered to the Crown. Sub-clause (5) prevents a land council from giving consent to a lease if the traditional Aboriginal owners of the land do not consent to the grant. </para>

            <para>-I will approach this by moving for the deletion of clause 20. If that motion is not successful, I will move for the insertion of a new clause 20a. The Opposition is opposed to clause 20 and seeks its deletion from the Bill. The effect of the deletion will be that holders of existing leases under the Special Purposes Leases Ordinance of the Nor them Territory will have to renegotiate their existing leases with the Aboriginal owners or their delegates. That will mean that contracts and agreements entered into by former governments are no longer operative, but the Government has taken a lot of precautions to make sure that they are operative. With the exception of Oenpelli, the Aborigines affected by such agreements and contracts were not consulted as to terms and conditions for the use and exploitation of their land. That was the practice of previous governments, with the exception of the last Labor Government. One of the principal reasons why the Opposition seeks to have the clause deleted is that it makes no provision for refusal by the Aboriginal owners for an applicant to continue operations. Although the clause provides for renegotiation in sub-clause (2), that too is hamstrung by the reference to sub-clause ( 1 ), which provides that such leases should be ones where the rights and obligations of the parties are as near as practicable the same as those under existing Crown leases. </para>

I assume that all honourable senators on the other side of the House have read the new clause.

This Government and its predecessors believe that the quickest way to make a fast buck is to dig a hole in the ground. If it is in a developed area, use the bulldozer and the axe and chop everything down. In this case we are deciding that the Aboriginal people are entitled at least to a fair crack of the whip. Under the Government&#39;s existing clause 20, they are not going to get it. </para>

            <para>- I regret it if there were any misunderstandings originally in regard to dealing with clause 20, but the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition has indicated that he is prepared to proceed in this way. It should be remembered that clause 20 gives power to the Minister to issue a lease of land to meet the Government&#39;s obligations under agreements for mining at Gove and Groote Eylandt on behalf of a land trust where negotiations have failed, but only after an arbitrator has been appointed and has determined fair terms and conditions for a lease. The Government is unable to accept the additional clause put forward by the Opposition. This Bill deals with traditional land rights. The granting of vacant Crown land to Aboriginal councils would be handled administratively outside this legislation where the request for land was on a needs basis. If there is a traditional claim, other provisions of the Bill adequately provide for vesting land in trusts. It is unnecessary to confuse the situation with parallel procedures for grants to councils. It should be recalled that  His  Honour <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward at paragraph 89 of his report recommended the use of a trust, that is a land trust, in all cases for convenience of legislation and ease of understanding. It was proposed that such a provision would be implemented in case it might be needed, but the Government does not consider that the amendment moved by the Opposition is required in terms of this Bill. We therefore do not accept the amendment. </para>

            <para>- I have a query of the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> with respect to clause 21. I realise that clause 2 1 defines the area over which Aboriginal land councils have a responsibility. My query concerns the position of tribal areas that overlap State borders. Does the jurisdiction of this Bill stop at a State border if in fact the tribal land overlaps the border of say, Queensland, Western Australia or South Australia? Is there any requirement for State legislation to deal with that position? I should like the Minister to make that clear in my mind. </para>

            <para>- I am advised that this Bill does not intrude on State legislation. The answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is that, under clause 21, this Bill establishes what constitutes a land council. There are two that have been established. They were set up following the first report of the Aboriginal Land Rights Commission. But the Bill does not restrict the number of councils. It is possible that Aboriginals may decide that responsibility for the administration of their land should be on a more local basis, in which case additional land councils may be established. But this legislation does not intrude in any way on State legislation. Therefore, the answer to the honourable senator&#39;s question is that the Federal legislation would not involve borders between States. </para>

          <para class="block">The Opposition has moved this amendment to reinstate the 1975 provisions listing the functions of land councils. This has been a focal point of Aboriginal agitation and representation since the introduction of this Bill in June of this year. Despite the amendment moved by the Government to return to the land councils those functions relating to the co-ordination and application of the land councils- the function that both the Northern and Central Land Councils have, until restrained by the Government earlier this year of course, performed most successfully there still remains a number of areas in which the Woodward recommendations on the functions of the councils have not been followed. In fact this Bill that the Government has produced on land rights is significant for its very great and grave departures from the Woodward recommendations. The most important of these are contained in paragraph 359 of the Woodward report. Paragraph 359 recommends that land councils have power to make representations to the land commission about priorities in the expenditure of moneys for land purchase and land development. Control over the issuing of entry permits to non-Aborigines visiting Aboriginal lands is much emphasised. </para>
          <para>The Opposition is still receiving letters of support for its stand on this legislation. The Executive Member for Information of the National Aboriginal Consultative Committee has forwarded a letter which gives added emphasis to points that I am trying to make. I do not have time to quote the whole letter but I shall read a couple of relevant clauses. It states: </para>
          <quote>
            <para>In general the Acc supports more the original 1 97S Bill, as we understand the previous Australian Government on 16 October 1975, was clearly intent and undisturbed in seeking to grant some real land title to traditional Aborigines in the Northern Territory. </para>
            <para>The NACC, in my view, could not clearly support the present 1976 Commonwealth Government&#39;s amendments to the original Lands Bill as it has been subjected to change, which appears to favour the sectional interests of the European community in the Northern Territory. </para>
            <para>However, the Acc accepts Prime Minister Whitlam &#39;s most historic decision in December 1973, that his government would grant land rights, and as such, the Acc understands and supports the amendments that you as Shadow Minister for Aboriginal Affairs have or will move. </para>

            <para>-The Government does not accept the amended clause 23 as proposed by the Opposition. As has been said, clause 23 defines the functions of the land councils. Those that are included in this clause of the Bill are the functions that the Government sees as being required by the land councils. Bearing in mind ali the other provisions of the legislation, we are not able to accept the amendment. We recognise that it seeks to return to the Bill the 1975 provisions with regard to the functions of land councils, but there are many and detailed reasons why the proposed amendment would not be acceptable to the Government. Some of these are the functions of the land councils as required under this legislation. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of the amendment is to strengthen the role of the Parliament in overseeing the declaration of proclamations made under clauses 40(l)(b) and 41(1) (b). Such proclamations will be made where it is considered that the national interest requires that Aboriginal consent for mining on Aboriginal lands should be overridden. I know that the Government in the first set of amendments it brought in- the first 42 amendments- made some concessions, but the Opposition is of the opinion that this provision ought to be tightened up totally. The effect of such a proclamation is wide ranging and it is to be hoped it will be infrequently used. However, the Parliament must exercise its responsibility granted to it through the 1967 refer rend a to oversee Aboriginal affairs. The form of the amendment follows that provided in the Acts Interpretation Act in section 48(5) relating to regulations. The effect of the amendment is to provide that where notice to disapprove a proclamation is given under sub-clause (2) such notice must be debated by either House or otherwise withdrawn. Without such debate or the withdrawal of such a notice any proclamation made under the provisions of this legislation will be treated as null and void from the day after the fifteenth sitting day from when it was laid before the Parliament. </para>
          <para>I sound a note of warning that if this amendment is not accepted it will be possible that where a motion to disapprove a proclamation is moved such a motion may remain on the notice paper for the required fifteen sitting days and not come before either House for debate, but the amendment ensures that when such proclamations are made they will remain subject to full parliamentary scrutiny and debate thus fulfilling the constitutional requirements given to this Parliament in 1967. The Minister will probably say that we did not have that in the 1975 Labor Bill. Although it was not included in the 1975 Labor Bill the Opposition, having considered the Government&#39;s earlier legislation which did not provide for any parliamentary scrutiny at all, has decided that the clause in the 1975 legislation now adopted by the Government should be strengthened by the inclusion of this amendment. I hope that the Minister on behalf of the Government will agree to accepting this amendment. Whilst it may not provide the ultimate in the protection of the rights of Aborigines at least it does strengthen their case to a very large degree. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </para>

            <para>- I rise to speak on this amendment so that I will not miss out. I was surprised that the Minister did not seek to speak to this matter since it is such an important question. In the original legislation there was a provision that upon the declaration of national interest the Minister could appoint a person to inquire into the question of national interest and decide the issue. Honourable senators will remember that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward said in his report that the only time that a mining interest would have a right to go into Aboriginal lands would be if it were in the national interest. So that there would not be some frivolous claim that it was in the national interest <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward put in his report the safeguard that the Governor-General had to make a proclamation- I take it on the advice of the Minister- that it would be in the national interest and that proclamation had to be laid before the Parliament in accordance with the regulations which provide that in each House of the Parliament a motion may be moved to disagree with the declaration in the proclamation. The agitation between the time of the presentation of the first Bill and the second Bill was such that the legislation was amended to insert provisions in accordance with the Woodward report. The amended legislation provided that the proclamation had to be laid before the </para>

          <para>It was thought that this was covered by regulation, but as I stated this morning in relation to the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill, if there is no safeguard in the legislation one has only to consider the practice of the Senate in the giving of a notice of motion to disallow an ordinance. The day after giving notice the motion is called on and the  President  asks whether it is formal or not formal. Upon the Senate declaring that it is not formal- this can be declared by any one person in the Senate- the motion then goes on to the waiting list of Government business. If the Government decides in this case to bring it on within 1 5 days it will be discussed and the Senate will make a decision as to whether the declaration that it was in the national interest was justified or whether the minerals in the particular area should not be classified as being in the national interest. </para>

It has always been ruled that to alter the order of government business there had to be an absolute majority vote. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Murphy</inline> disputed this when he was here and he won the point that every such question had to be decided by an absolute majority. The other day when I sought leave to move a motion to suspend the Standing Orders I was advised by one of the officers that- I may not be correct on this- a senator does not have to seek leave to move the suspension of the Standing Orders but if the motion is moved without leave there must be a majority of the whole of the Senate for the motion to be successful. </para>

              <para>- An absolute majority. Of course this is contrary to the whole argument of the Murphy concept which we accepted. Of course if leave is granted the motion can be agreed to on the majority vote of those who are present. I do not know which advice is correct. </para>

          <para>Then we come to the question of why a regulation is needed. Does the Government need to force itself to bring on such a matter. There was provision in the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill (No. 2), with which we dealt this morning, for disallowance if the matter is not dealt with in 15 days. Therefore if the Government does not bring on the matter and if the person moving the notice of disallowance cannot get an absolute majority of the House- I do not know what provision is made in the Standing Orders in the other place- the matter is not discussed and there is no expression of opinion of the Parliament, despite the fact that the majority of the Parliament may be of the opinion that it should be disallowed. If after 15 days the proclamation has not been disallowed by the Parliament, it then becomes valid. </para>
          <para>That sort of provision is made in relation to regulations, ordinances and the Aboriginal Councils and Associations Bill (No. 2). It seems that where mining interests are involved it is not insisted upon. The amendment seeks to alter that position. It does not seek any advantage. It does not seek to give anything to Aboriginals. It seeks to refer a proclamation back to this chamber. So, the Government is forced of necessity to deal with it within 15 sitting days or suffer the consequences. That is the matter to which I referred. When an officer of the Department of Aboriginal Affairs was present in the chamber he could not give any explanation to the Minister for the exclusion of such a provision. I do not know what the Minister may say now in reply, but she was not anxious to get up before and give an explanation. I think at least honourable senators opposite should have enough decency to see that the Committee is forced into the position of considering a question such as this. </para>

            <para>- I am concerned about the views that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> has expressed, because I thought that he was a person who in decency would consider the proposition. He did not say that anything I said was wrong or that it would not benefit Aboriginals.  His  justification for depriving Aboriginals of this benefit is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> did something in the past. If we have to answer for every sin of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe,</inline> God knows where we will finish up. Aboriginals will possibly end up with nothing. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> does not know whether I would have objected to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> &#39;s Bill if it had come before the Parliament. As a fair and honest man who tried to appeal to us during the second reading debate, let him say whether I am right or wrong. If I am not wrong in my interpretation, is it right that, because the Government can prevent the bringing on of a matter which will result in the expression of an opinion of the Parliament, mining interests should be permitted to mine on Aboriginal land. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>I would have thought that this matter was above the issue that we have been debating, namely, mining interests and so on. It is a question of common justice. We are making provision in the Bill for giving the Parliament the right to decide on the disallowance of a proclamation which takes away the rights of Aboriginals. I suppose that the Parliament would decide according to the view to which Party was in power at the time. Therefore we are putting forward as an amendment the proposal that the Parliament has the right to make such a decision. There is an escape clause whereby the Parliament can never be given the opportunity to decide and the mining interests can go on to Aboriginal land despite the fact that some members of this Parliament are against it. Is that not quite contrary to what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Chaney</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> said during the second reading debate? We have sought to improve the provision. We have sought to make it compulsory to bring before the Parliament a proclamation. </para>
          <para>In defending the existing clause simply because of something that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> did in the past, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> has indicated that, while he now knows that his Government has done nothing for Aboriginals in comparison with the treatment of mining interests, he goes along with the proposal to support the mining interests in their right to mine Aboriginal land. I think it is atrocious. I cannot understand the objection. The provision is so plain; it is so just. It is providing in relation to every other regulation. I do not know why the Minister and why the Department will not accept it. I am not saying that Aboriginal interests should take precedence over mining interests. Let us at least give the Parliament an opportunity to discuss these matters. I cannot think of any reason why this provision would be objected to. I am concerned for those honourable senators who have expressed concern for Aboriginals. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume,</inline> who has been in the forefront of this debate, went to the extent of expressing concern for Aboriginals but that expression of concern is now overridden by something that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> did in the past. That is his only objection, but I am sure that other honourable senators opposite will not apply the same criteria. </para>

              <para>-Senator Hall is now interrupting. He has never been known to do anything in the field of Aboriginal affairs. Perhaps when the Liberal Party is finished with him, he can go back to the Liberal Movement, if it will have him back. I suggest that he keeps his interjections to himself. It was never suggested that the 1976 private member&#39;s Bill was the perfect Bill; nor was it ever suggested that the 1975 Bill was the perfect Bill. But honourable senators now on the Government side of the chamber, had they remained in Opposition, would have been perfectly entitled to move amendments to the 1975 Bill if they wanted to. Had we remained in government, it is quite possible that we would have moved amendments also because there were some aspects of it about which we were not happy. The 1976 private member&#39;s Bill was introduced in this place by me when it was fairly obvious that the new Government had no intention of introducing any son of legislation at all to grant land rights to Aboriginal people. It had an alternative. It did not have to wait around and hold up land rights legislation, such as you could call it, for a year. It could have brought on my private member&#39;s Bill at the time it was right had it wanted to. There was nothing to stop that private member&#39;s Bill from being brought on. The Bill could have been amended. It is not only childish but it smacks of political duplicity for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Baume</inline> who now has to live with his conscience to come out and make atrocious statements like that. The Opposition is still convinced that the amendment I have moved is the one with which we ought to stick. </para>

              <para>- The honourable senator implied it. He said that he had brought it in, and did not believe that any Bill would be debated in the Parliament. As far as the amendment is concerned, the matter of dealing with disallowance was of considerable interest to the Government Parties. We believe that it should be possible for a parliament to have a scrutiny and disallowance provision with regard to matters that were proclaimed under the Bill. The one presently drafted in the Bill, as has been said by several honourable senators, is based on the same provisions as were included in the 1975 Bill. While the amendment, as suggested, may be technically sound, I think the political reality is such that if there is a proclamation made under the legislation and there is a movement from Government Parties or private members or the Opposition Party for the Parliament to debate it, it would be brought on for debate in the Parliament. The suggestion that this House would necessarily follow the wishes of the government of the day is something that shows short memories. I well recall in recent years the disallowance of Government regulations and other matters in the Senate contrary to what may have been the wishes of the government of the day. So within this clause there is the provision for a proclamation to be laid before each House of Parliament and for the disallowance of it to be undertaken. I believe that on a matter as important as the one that is covered by this clause, there is a political necessity for it to be brought forward and to be debated in the Parliament and, if thought fit by a majority of the House of Parliament concerned, to be disallowed. It is for those reasons that we are unable to accept the amendment of the Opposition. </para>

I did not say that when I introduced my private member&#39;s Bill it was done with the thought that it would never be brought on. What I did say was that the new Government, after its election on 13 December last, showed no indication of bringing on land rights legislation of any sort at any time despite the famous Ellicott promises. So that private member&#39;s Bill was introduced. The Government prevented that Bill from being brought on for debate and implementation. Had it been brought on for debate and implementation without any amendment, it would have been SO times better than the legislation we have before us tonight. </para>

            <para>- I am most concerned at the Minister&#39;s reply. I think perhaps that my remarks about a motion to disallow any proclamation being decided in accordance with the opinion of the government of the day were unfortunate. I accept the fact that this has not been the case at all times. Usually, on the Senate Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances, for example, there are normally 4 members of the Government forces who feel in duty bound, in accordance with their allegiance to the Government, to vote against a proposal from the Opposition. They generally succeed in defeating the proposal. It might well be that a decision might go against the government of the day on a particular occasion. But the Minister comes into the chamber and says: &#39;Well, we agree. It would be brought on&#39;. Why are we given such a promise on this occasion when everything else is put in the statute? We might not have a Minister as obliging in future as we have at present. But this would be the law. It would have to be applied. But it would be applied only on those occasions when the Aboriginals do not agree to mining on their land- the land that we acknowledge in this statute as being Aboriginal land which is handed over to the traditional owners. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para>If the Aborigines do not agree to mining on their land and if the Governor-General is of the opinion that it is in the national interest, he issues a proclamation. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward recommended that a declaration of national interest should not be in accordance with the opinion of the government of the day. He thought it must have a greater test. He thought that the greatest test would be to submit it to Parliament which would have the right to disallow. Whether the matter was or was not in the national interest, the decision of Parliament was supreme. This particular clause provides that anyone can bring a notice of disallowance of the proclamation before the Parliament. If either House of the Parliament decides by a majority to disallow the proclamation, then Parliament has decided that it is not in the national interest. </para>
          <para>If Parliament votes on a motion to disallow but the motion is not carried, then Parliament has not revoked the Governor-General&#39;s proclamation that it is in the national interest and mining will go ahead. We have been told by those Government speakers who spoke on the Bill that it contains provision to protect this positions. But we find that if someone gives a notice of motion to disallow the proclamation and it is not brought on for discussion after 1 S days, there can be no disallowance of the proclamation. No decision can be taken by the Parliament. Therefore, this overrides the right of the Parliament to decide such questions of national interest. </para>
          <para>The Minister has moved 5 amendments. This means that the Bill has to go back to the other place. So it is not a question of holding up the Bill here. The only suggestion that it is not logical that the interests of Aboriginal communities should be brought before the Parliament came from a backbencher. That <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> did something a couple of years ago is the only justification the Government has for its objection to the amendment. The Minister says: &#39;I cannot justify it, but I think I agree that it would come on for discussion&#39;. Have honourable senators ever seen Aboriginal people or any people, for that matter, treated in such a way? I raised the point this morning on the Aboriginal Councils and Associations (No. 2) Bill that the power of the House to override a proclamation on Aboriginal rights lapses if the matter is not brought on for discussion after 15 days. But where mining companies&#39; interests are concerned it can simply be avoided and the Parliament is not permitted to discuss this matter. When agitation necessitated that the Bill be amended between the time when it was first introduced during the last session and now, honourable senators opposite said they had cleaned it up. By the refusal of the Government to accept this amendment it deliberately hoodwinked its supporters into believing that they had cleaned it up with the knowledge that the interests of the mining companies are safe. It has to be recognised by the Aboriginal community that the Government- we heard this on the memorable occasion of last night- is selling every interest of the Aboriginal people down the drain by not letting them or the Parliament have a say in their affairs. I am still waiting for the Minister to give us some explanation why this cannot be done and why there is any injustice in permitting Parliament to decide in future on this matter. </para>

          <para class="block">The Government has included in this legislation a number of specific areas which an arbitrator, if appointed, should examine. The new sub-clause ( 1 ) ensures that the Minister will invoke this section only after it has been made clear that a dispute exists between the applicant for a mining lease and the Land Council. Sub-clause (lA) outlines the procedure for the appointment of an arbitrator and is the same provision as that contained in the Bill already. Sub-section ( In) gives effect to paragraph 708, sub-paragraphs (x), (xi) and (xii), of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward&#39;s recommendations which provide that matters of concern should be given emphasis when mining rights are being negotiated.

            <para>- Under clause 45, where consent to mining is withheld only because negotiations on the terms of agreement with the applicant mining company, or with the Commonwealth where the Atomic Energy Act is involved, break down the Minister may appoint an arbitrator. The clause provides that terms and conditions determined by the arbitrator shall be acceded to by the land council if accepted by the applicant for the grant. The Opposition &#39;s amendment which provides for the addition of subclauses 45 ( 1A) and ( In) seems unnecessarily to complicate the <inline font-style="italic">provision.</inline> There is no need evident to the Government to spell out in the legislation the procedures for determining the terms and conditions of agreement. Where it was necessary all those matters would be dealt with by an independent arbitrator in that way. We do not feel that there is any necessity to add the detail that is provided in the Opposition&#39;s amendment. </para>

          <para class="block">The proposed new clause will have the same title- &#39;Functions of Commissioner&#39;. This is a very sensitive area, and the Opposition is of the opinion that in its original form there were many weaknesses in the Government&#39;s Bill. It is true that there were some minor improvements in the first series of 42 amendments which were made to the Bill. Nevertheless, the Opposition is far from satisfied with it, and on this occasion our amendment is designed to reinstate the 1975 provision relating to the functions of the Land Commission. The clause to be omitted effectively cast rates- that is probably the most appropriate word- the role of the Commissioner which was envisaged by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Woodward and given legislative substance by the Labor Government. One is tempted to reflect on whether that is due to the success of the interim commission of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Justice</inline> Ward and his adjudication of land claims heard so far this year. Of course, we all know what happened to the land claims, starting with the claim in the Borroloola case that was heard on 26 August. Those claims are just not being heard. </para>
          <para>This amendment widens the scope of the functions of the Commissioner to include the processing and recommendations of claims for land by non-traditional owners based on need. The present legislation excludes from consideration by the Land Commissioner claims by one of the most disadvantaged groups in the Northern Territorythe fringe dwellers and those Aboriginals of mixed ancestry, whose aspirations and morale could be substantially boosted through the possibility of obtaining some form of recompense for their life-long suffering. Under this legislation without amendment, claims based on need will be determined <inline font-style="italic">not by an</inline> impartial land commissioner but rather by the Department of the Northern Territory and the Northern Territory Land Board. The Labor Party in Opposition, right throughout the period since the introduction of this legislation, has asked time and time again for the freeze to be extended for at least 12 months, but if the Government cannot see its way clear to going that far ahead then at least it ought to be done for 6 months. </para>
          <para>The amendment widens the scope for claims which may be made by traditional owners for alienated Crown land to include hearings and recommendations on the desirability of securing such land for the use of traditional owners. The new provision also allows for the Commissioner to inti ate claims for traditional land based on need and provides that his reports include recommendations relating to the use of land for Aboriginal community purposes in towns. That last function is very important, and it is an area which has been sadly neglected in the development of the Northern Territory in the past. Without this function being undertaken by a statutory independent body which reports specifically to the Minister and the Parliament, it will continue to be neglected. In addition, the replacement of the present clause will remove the bias favouring pastoralists and miners, who have had the run of the Northern Territory virtually rent free for the last 50 years. I hope that this amendment will be accepted by the Government. </para>
          <para>The people in the area of need are those who are most neglected by this new Bill, and the Opposition is trying to rectify some of the omissions. I have said before and I say again, even though I know that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Kilgariff</inline> is a little sensitive about it, that every time it rains in See Springs 1000 people get wet and cold and illness is brought on. There are no water taps; there is no provision for any of the things that normal human beings expect. If this amendment is accepted by the Government, it will strengthen the Government&#39;s hand in ensuring that those people get some sort of justice. </para>

            <para>- The Government does not accept the amendment moved by the Opposition relating to the functions of the Land Commissioner. Clause 50 defines the purposes for which a Commissioner is to be appointed, and that is essentially to investigate and report upon Aboriginal traditional land claims. Throughout this debate the Government has said repeatedly that the Bill deals with traditional land rights and that needs are to be dealt with under Northern Territory law. There are other functions within the Bill which are distorted by the amendment from the Opposition, and for reasons which have been apparent throughout this debate the Government requires the functions as they are denned in clause 50. </para>

            <para>- I do not think it is fair to suggest that the Minister for Social Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Guilfoyle)</inline> is not telling us the true position. If my memory serves me correctly, money that is paid in royalties, unless otherwise stipulated in the agreement which is entered into, goes in part to the Land Trust and some of it is paid to the Trust Account. Some may be paid to the land council which must be financed. This is set out in the agreement- if it is not in the agreement I think it is provided somewhere in the legislation- and the proportions are shown together with where the money will be paid. But the occasion arises at some date subsequent to the agreement when the royalties demanded by the Government increase. While that amount of the royalty which was decided at the time of the agreement is provided for, the money from the increase in rates can be distributed at the discretion of the Minister. I would be much surprised if the Minister has a discretion to pay a certain proportion of the amount into the Consolidated Revenue Fund. I would have thought that the discretion was whether the money was to be paid to the Trust Fund or the Land Council. I seriously suggest that if, because of an increase in the rate of royalty, the Minister has a right to decided to pay the money into the Trust Account, that provision should be seriously opposed. </para>

It is not appropriate for the comments that have been made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cavanagh</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> to go unchallenged. What I have stated with regard to the ministerial determination of the amount to be paid into Consolidated Revenue Fund and the Trust Account is provided for in this sub-clause. It is precise. The requirement is for the Minister to determine in these circumstances. All of the provisions of clause 63 relate to the payments into the Trust Account and the consequential appropriation. If these matters have not been previously examined by the Opposition. I commend that the Opposition now examine them. It will see that there is provision for a ministerial determination to be made. </para>

          <para class="block">This proposed new clause is one of the very important clauses that has been omitted from this Bill but which was in the 1975 Bill. The first part of the proposed new clause deals with Aborigines and their entitlement to enter on pastoral leases, etc. The Government has done 2 things: It has left this clause out of the Bill and it has left these matters out of the terms of reference of the Standing Committee that is being established. We feel that these matters are of such importance that this clause ought to be inserted in the Bill. The original 1975 Bill clearly spelt it out. It provided that Aborigines be entitled to remain on any pastoral lease except within one kilometre of a homestead, to use natural waters and to kill wildlife for food. Sub-clause (2) of the proposed new clause 67A provides that the right to kill wildlife for food may be limited in the case of a species in danger of extinction. </para>
          <para>Bore waters may be used where there are no convenient natural waters, but an Aboriginal is not entitled to disregard any reasonable requirements of lessees regarding the use of bore waters. A penalty can be imposed for preventing or obstructing an Aboriginal from exercising his rights under the clause. Northern Territory pastoral leases are granted subject to a reservation in favour of the Aboriginal inhabitants of the Northern Territory, which is defined by section 24e of the Crown Lands Ordinance. It is in terms that a reservation in favour of the Aboriginal inhabitants of the Northern Territory shall be read as a reservation permitting Aborigines to enter on and be on lease land, to use the natural waters and springs on the lease land and to kill upon the lease land and use for food the birds and animals that are natural to the area. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Letts,</inline>the Majority Leader in the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly, has said that this right, for which the Assembly will be responsible unless this amendment is accepted, must be limited to traditional Aborigines. He has specifically included groups which use 4-wheel drive vehicles and hunt with rifles. I think that that ordinance may have been still-born, but there is the ever-present threat that it will be reintroduced. To give this right, to give this great power, to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly is a denigration of the rights of Aborigines. I sincerely hope that the Minister will not allow this right to go to the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. I can assure her that if it goes there it will be abused totally by the people who are now dominating the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The rights of the pastoralists will be totally preserved and protected- not the rights of the Aboriginal people. </para>
          <para>I know that it is sometimes claimed that the Aboriginal people are responsible for killing off certain species of wildlife. That does not happen. The Aboriginal people kill only that game which they need for food. I have accompanied them on many occasions when they have been hunting for food. They do not shoot or kill just for the sake of sport. The people who are creating scarcities in certain species of wildlife in the Northern Territory and other places are the southern sportsmen. In most instances they are people who are prepared to go out and shoot anything that moves. They are the ones who are causing the numbers of some species of wildlife to be seriously reduced. I have travelled throughout most of this area on many occasions. I recall being recently in a very nice little spot in an area where there was a regular water supply and seeing somebody moving up in an old truck and emptying two or three tins of arsenic into the creek. It may be said that the tins were not full of arsenic. It probably was not present in large quantities, but they were old tins that had to be disposed of. It is like the people who want to dig for uranium and who bury the waste 2 foot underground and pray to God that nothing will happen about it. The same sort of pollution is found in these areas. This kills off wildlife, too. I suggest that those honourable senators opposite who really want to protect the rights of Aborigines should vote for this amendment and the next three or four amendments because they are at the very crux of the matter. If honourable senators opposite hand over this right to the Northern Territory they should hang their heads in shame and never raise them again. </para>

            <para>- This amendment concerning the insertion of a proposed new clause is not acceptable to the Government. Clause 67 prevents acquisition under an ordinance of the Northern Territory but it does not prevent acquisition of Aboriginal land under the Lands Acquisition Act, since that Act has application in the Northern Territory independent of the Northern Territory Administration Act. The new clause that has been proposed by the Opposition is one on which I would comment that, in line with the decision that some powers be given to the Northern Territory, the Government has considered it appropriate that rights of entry onto pastoral properties should remain a matter for Northern Territory law- the Crown Lands Ordinance. The proposed clause also deals with matters covered in clause 73 of the Bill. Although it has been suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> that there would be abuse in these matters under Northern Territory legislation, I remind him of the many ways in which the Minister for Aboriginal Affairs in the Commonwealth Government will have consultations with the Northern Territory on proposed legislation or existing legislation that may affect these matters. The Government does not accept the Opposition&#39;s proposed new clause. </para>

          <para class="block">The proposed new clause deals with the protection and conservation of wildlife on Aboriginal land. The Opposition is tremendously sensitive about this aspect, as are the Aboriginal people themselves. Speaking to the last amendment I pointed out that the greatest destruction of wildlife was not by Aboriginal people but by so-called white sportsmen who shot at everything that moved. I believe that the protection and conservation of wildlife ought not be left in the hands of the Northern Territory. I regret that I have to say this about the Northern Territory Legislative Assembly. The Assembly has a long, notorious record for preserving nothing and for destroying anything that it thinks it can get a return out of. I think those few pertinent remarks might be sufficient to introduce the amendment. </para>

In line with the decision that some powers be given to the Northern Territory, it was considered appropriate that rights of entry on to pastoral properties should remain a matter for the Northern Territory. Similarly, with regard to the new clause we have decided that this is a matter that should be handled by the Legislative Assembly, but within strict guidelines set down in the Commonwealth legislation. The guidelines and other safeguards available to the Government will ensure that appropriate legislation is passed. The requirements are specified in clause 73. The clauses that are being dealt with now relate to one another and to our attitude with regard to Northern Territory legislation.

Consequently some thought was given to inserting a minor let-out. Unless there is debate on this matter I will not proceed with a discussion on the background of this amendment. This might enable us to move one more amendment before the Senate rises. </para>

            <para>- The amendment moved by the Opposition is not acceptable to the Government. This is a matter that the Government decided is appropriate for Northern Territory legislation. The provisions of clause 73, as I referred to earlier, will require Northern Territory ordinances to accord with the interests of Aborigines. The assurances of the Majority Leader in the Legislative Assembly and the fact that the Commonwealth Government has the power to withhold consent to Northern Territory ordinances will ensure that Northern Territory legislation will have the same effect as if the legislation were introduced into the Commonwealth Parliament. For these reasons the amendment is not acceptable to the Government. </para>

            <para>- Order! During the Committee discussion on the Aboriginal Land Rights (Northern Territory) Bill 1976, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> referred to problems of which he had been made aware relating to radio reception in central Australia of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. He requested an urgent inquiry into the matter. I have had inquiries made, and the following is a letter from the Australian Capital Territory Manager of the Australian Broadcasting Commission: </para>
          </talk.start>
          <quote>
            <para>The ABC&#39;s Manager for South Australia- who is rep on sib le for ABC affairs in Central Australia and the Northern Territory- has investigated the statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> and has been unable to establish the basis of the Honourable Senator&#39;s complaint ABC staff in Alice Springs are unaware of a radio blackout and have confirmed that both ABC and commercial stations are operating normally. </para>
            <para>We are aware that there are reception problems in some parts of central and northern Australia, and have been discussing them with Telecom Australia, the authority which operates the transmitters which carry ABC programs. We see a need for two domestic short-wave transmitters to be built and our recent discussions with Telecom have mainly been concerned with their possible location. </para>
            <para>It seems unlikely that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keeffe</inline> could have been referring to stations carrying parliamentary broadcasts. As you know, the stations which must broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament have been designated by the Joint Committee on the broadcasting of Parliamentary Proceedings. There is one medium-wave station in each capital city, also VLR a medium-powered short-wave transmitter located at Lyndhurst, Victoria. It is improbable that <inline font-style="italic">any</inline> of these stations could be heard in central or northern Australia. In any case, no change has been made in the broadcasting of Parliament, nor could one be made without the Joint Committee &#39;s prior approval. </para>
            <para>If the matter to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keene</inline> has referred concerns ABC stations, we would welcome additional information so that further inquiries can be made. </para>

The reason that I could not do so is that it concerns an article appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> this morning which deals with the Australian War Memorial which, of course, is subject to the jurisdiction of the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> who does not read the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times,</inline> or other newspapers. I am forced to detain the Senate at this time so that I can read to him the statement and the article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times.</inline> It is headed &#39;Memorial Service on Timor Invasion&#39; and reads: </para>

        <quote>
          <para>About 40 people gathered at the Stone of Remembrance at the Australian War Memorial yesterday for a wreath laying ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the invasion of East Timor by Indonesia. </para>
          <para>The  Deputy  leader of the Federal Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren,</inline> laid the wreath, and the member for Fraser, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Fry,</inline> and the  President  of the A.C.T. branch of the Australian-East Timor Association, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Brendan</inline> 0 &#39;Dwyer, also attended. </para>
          <para>
            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren</inline>said the Australian people owed an &#39;enormous debt&#39; to the Timorese people who had helped Australians during World War II. </para>
        </quote>
        <para class="block">The article was accompanied by a photograph above the caption &#39;the  Deputy  Leader of the Federal Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren,</inline> lays a wreath at the Australian War Memorial yesterday, in memory of those who fell in the Indonesian invasion of East Timor a year ago&#39;. The photograph shows <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren</inline> laying the wreath. It shows also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur</inline> Gietzelt and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Justin</inline> O&#39;Byrne. I am not able to identify the other people in the photograph. </para>
        <para>I raise this matter because it is a very serious matter. The Australian War Memorial Act provides for a board of trustees whose responsibilities are delineated under the Act. The Act establishes the functions of the board of trustees. The functions of the board are, on behalf of the Commonwealth, to manage the Memorial; to control and preserve the war relics of the Commonwealth; and to arrange, so far as the Board considers desirable, for their public display; to carry out and to assist other persons in carrying out research in connection with any war or warlike operation in which Australians have been engaged on active service. That is the reasoning behind the Australian War Memorial Act. This Act provides for the continuation of the Australian War Memorial which was first established under the Australian War Memorial Act of 1 925. The purpose behind that Act was to provide a memorial to those who fell in any war or warlike operation in which Australians have been on active service. </para>
        <para>That brings me to the point of the wreath laying ceremony which took place yesterday and was attended by members of the Australian Parliament. The question is raised whether members of the Australian Parliament are using for their own purposes and for their own ends the sacred War Memorial commemorating those who died on service in any war or warlike operation in which Australians have been on active service. I do not wish to reflect in any way on people who wish to commemorate events that occurred a year ago or to remember people who fell a year ago or in any other era. But I do remind the Senate that heretofore the Board of Trustees has been quite meticulous in their interpretation of the provisions of the Australian War Memorial Act and have prevented well meaning people who wanted to commemorate the dead in certain uprisings and wars from doing so. </para>
        <para>I refer to a request that was made in October when the Hungarian communities of Canberra and Queanbeyan wanted to lay a wreath at the War Memorial in order to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the Hungarian uprising. They contacted the Director of the War Memorial and he refused permission, saying that the War Memorial was for the purpose of commemorating Australians who died in actions in which Australia was involved. The Hungarian community was disappointed at this ruling but they abided by it. They did hold a small commemoration ceremony on 23 October outside the precincts of the War Memorial and, as I understand it, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Knight,</inline> a <inline font-weight="bold">Senator for</inline> the Australian Capital Territory was present. The War Memorial was closed and they did not wish, nor did they attempt, to lay a wreath on the stone of remembrance- that sacred stone which is preserved as the memorial to our dead. </para>
        <para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> today we see that a wreath was laid by members of this Australian Parliament against the provisions of an Act to which they were party. As far as I can make out from the photograph which is taken from behind a glass- presumably a cameraman from the Press materialised without having been told about this incident- the wreath laying took place inside the Memorial and on the stone of remembrance. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0</inline> &#39;Byrne and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gietzelt</inline> appear to be taking part in that ceremony. </para>

              <inline font-weight="bold">- Senator Cavanagh</inline>says that they did. I would like to know from the Minister whether in fact they obtained permission to lay a wreath in commemoration of those who were killed in Timor one year ago yesterday, as reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> today. Did the organisers tell the Director that the event was to mark the first anniversary of the events that occurred in Timor last year? If the Director did give authority, in contradistinction to other people within the community who wished to commemorate those who died fighting for freedom and self-determination but who were denied the opportunity to do so, has the War Memorial changed its policy on commemorator ceremonies involving events in which no Australians were in a warlike operation? Did the organisers relate some story to the Director of the War Memorial who then gave permission to those persons mentioned in the Press report to lay a wreath? If so, what was the request and what were the circumstances surrounding the request? </para>

        <para>I believe this is a very important matter for the Senate to consider and in respect of which the Government, through the Minister for Administrative Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> should give some explanation to the Australian Parliament. In fact, we see by the reporting in the Press in the A.C.T. that the ceremony was held to commemorate the first anniversary of the events of Fret i lin versus UDT. The real intention of the people who attended the ceremony, in my view, was to get Press publicity for their own particular prof re til in cause. I have said before in this Parliament and I say it again: If those expo using the prof re til in cause continue on this course they will damage irretrievably the genuine cause of persons in East Timor who desire self determination. If they insult those whose relatives have died in the wars defending this country, they will do damage to their particular cause. I ask: Is it their real intention to make a political com memo rat on of a recent event in which, hopefully, no Australians were engaged in a war or warlike ope at ion as defined in the Act? I believe that these matters call for some explanation from the Minister for Administrative Services, who is sitting at the table. </para>

He has disrupted the political and industrial life in Tasmania since he has been there. He had the temerity to talk about the right of members of this Parliament to place a wreath in a sacred memorial of this nation to commemorate the loss of 5 journalists who were assassinated by the invaders of East Timor. They were Australian journalists. These people wished to commemorate also the valiant assistance that the East Timorese gave to the Australians who fought against the Japanese, against the fascists who threatened to over-run this country. If ever I heard a fascist speak I heard the quintessence of one tonight. </para>

That was forbidden by the provisions of legislation governing the operations of the War Memorial. It was within the rights of members of the Parliament and people in the Canberra community to attend the laying of a wreath on the Stone of Remembrance for the simple reason that it commemorated the participation of Australians in the war against the Japanese in East Timor. That was mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren,</inline> the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the other place, during the course of his few remarks. </para>

A charge has been made against the trustees of the Australian War Memorial and against people who went there to a wreath laying ceremony in good faith. For them to be attacked like this is beneath contempt. However, I suppose that when we are dealing with contemptible people we have to expect contemptible conduct. It is in that way that I answer his contemptible charge. </para>

          <para>- I rise on this subject this evening because two or three weeks ago I received an invitation to attend a wreath laying ceremony to honour Australian war dead. I was honoured to attend the very moving ceremony yesterday at which a wreath was laid by a man who had been captured by the Japanese in East Timor. I attended primarily to commemorate the deaths of Australian servicemen. At the ceremony mention was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren</inline> of the gallant East Timorese who had assisted servicemen in their country during the war against the Japanese. Mention was made also of the 5 journalists who gave their lives last year and of the East Timorese who are suffering hardship in their own country following the invasion by the Indonesians. I did not feel ashamed to take part in that ceremony. I felt proud to be there and felt that more people should have been there. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> would like a complete list of people who attended I would be only too happy to provide him with it. I am a little sorry that the newspapers did not see fit to include us all in their report. I was there and I felt that I was reasonably prominent. I was willing to have my photograph taken. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> would like it, I could arrange a repeat of that ceremony for this time next year and he can then get up on the adjournment debate with his vilifications and accusations against the Board of Trustees of the War Memorial, and against people who went there yesterday with a genuine desire to express their appreciation in a number of ways. They were showing their appreciation to the families of the men who died in the Second World War, to the families of the journalists who died 14 months ago and to the families of the East Timorese who are suffering now after the invasion by Indonesia. </para>
        <para>As I said, I did not feel any sense of shame. I feel no sense of shame now in standing here and admitting that I was in attendance at that ceremony. My colleagues who were also there feel no sense of shame. The only one who has any cause at all to feel ashamed of his actions is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> for getting up and speaking as he did in the adjournment debate tonight. I am ashamed to say that he is a member of this Senate of which I am also a member. </para>

          <para>- I think it is a matter of great regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> should raise this matter in the manner in which he did when he could have obtained the facts in respect of the wreath laying ceremony yesterday. Of course, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> is known as Mr- the chief muck raker. We have come to expect this sort of behaviour from him. I do not think the record will show that there was any endeavour to mislead the trustees of the Australian War Memorial, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> has endeavoured to mislead the Senate into thinking this evening. I am thankful for the approach to this matter that was taken by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers),</inline> which could be summed up in the expression that groups of Australians who want to honour war dead should have the opportunity to do so. Of course there is no more fitting person in this Parliament to honour Australian war dead than the Honourable Thomas Uren, the  Deputy  Leader of the Australian Labor Party who, as has been pointed out, was captured in Timor and as a prisoner of the Japanese subsequently was on the Burma Road and was then taken to Japan. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>The brief hundred or so words that he uttered paid tribute to the Australian war dead who were killed in East Timor during World War II. The official record shows that 50 000 East Timorese people died during World War II. The people of East Timor received the gratitude of the Australian Government for nurturing and looking after Australian troops who were left behind in East Timor and were thought to be lost during the many years of the war. Therefore it is proper that some public recognition should be made of the sacrifices that the Timorese people made to assist Australian troops who managed to escape and with their help remained free from the clutches of the Japanese during World War II. According to reputable information Roger East, an Australian journalist who was representing an Australian news agency in Dili, was killed on the day that the Indonesians invaded Dili. This is the day on which we sought to commemorate his loss, the loss of the Australian journalists in East Timor and the loss of those Australians who died in East Timor in the war against Japan. </para>
        <para>I take the view that the Australian War Memorial is owned by the Australian people. It is true that the legislation under which the Memorial is administered provides that the trustees shall operate the Memorial on behalf of the Australian people. I specifically asked the question when I agreed to go to the ceremony whether official approval for it had been given. I was informed that it has been. I do not know what were the precise terms of the application, but I am told that the ceremony was designed to pay tribute to those who had fallen in World War II and to those who had fallen subsequently in Timor. </para>

            <para>- The elections on Saturday will show the value of the decision that was taken by the Labor Party in the matter. I am proud to have participated in the wreath-laying ceremony and to have been with eleven of my colleagues to do just that. I do not want to enter judgment on the decision of the Trustees so far as the Hungarian question is concerned, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> showed the contradictory position in which he placed himself because he drew attention to the fact that the trustees are obliged to have regard to fallen Australian dead. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> was not present at the ceremony, and if journalists like to present half a dozen words from what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren</inline> said and leave out the other ninety or so words that he uttered, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> is entitled to interpret what was said. I can assure this Senate that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Uren</inline> paid tribute to Australian troops who fell during World War II and to the loss on the day of the invasion of East Timor, as well as on 16 October, when Australian journalists died doing one thing, that is, carrying out an obligation to report to the world what was happening in East Timor. </para>
          </talk.start>

        <para>I think it is proper that members of this Parliament as well as members of the Australian community should commemorate such a sad occasion when men lost their lives trying to bring to the world the story of what was happening at that time in East Timor. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> showed a lamentable lack of knowledge of the events of World War II. In point of fact, most of Indonesia, or the Dutch East Indies, as it was known in those days, collaborated, with the Japanese, as did sections of Timor. The incredible facts are that the section of Timor which is now known as being part of Indonesia was that section which collaborated with the Japanese against the interests of the defence of Australia. It was the area known as Portuguese East Timor, which was the subject of the invasion, which rendered great assistance to the Australian troops. The consequence was a conflict of opinion between the role of those people in East Timor and those who formed part of Indonesia. </para>
        <para>
          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline>sought to compare the events in East Timor with an event that took place in 1956, to which he is entitled to make some reference- the invasion of Hungary. The Trustees could not possibly give approval for a wreath laying ceremony for that event because it would not be commemorating Australian dead. In consequence, the Trustees acted correctly then as they did on this occasion when negotiations took place between the Trustees and those who organised the event to commemorate the Australian dead. </para>
        <para>In all the circumstances, one must doubt the motive of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine</inline> in attempting to raise this matter in the adjournment debate. It was designed not only to besmirch those who were involved in this incident but also to intimidate the Trustees so that on a future occasion the Memorial will not be available to Australians who want to exercise a democratic right to commemorate some aspect of a war in which Australian troops have died. I think that is a matter to be regretted. </para>
        <para>I have taken a consistent position on the matter of Timor. As honourable senators know, I condemned my Party for its lack of activity when we should have carried out our responsibilities to the people of Timor. I enjoyed some of the responses by members of the Government Parties on the matter of East Timor. We shared a common concern about the events there. I think it ill becomes any member of the Senate to suggest that what is done in respect of East Timor has some sinister connotation, represents a subversive approach or in any way ought to be condemned. In fact, the attitude of any members of this Parliament which supports the independence movement in Timor ought to have the endorsement of every member of this chamber. I make no apology on behalf of all members of the Labor Party who attended that wreath laying ceremony. I hope the Government will not be misled into taking any steps which would remove from the Trustees the right to make a decision in respect of any application by a <inline font-style="italic">bona fide</inline> group of Australians who want to pay a tribute to war dead. </para>

          <para>Speech by Tom Uren, M.P., Deputy Leader of the Opposition, at a wreath laying ceremony to mark the first anniversary of the Indonesian invasion of the Democratic Republic of East Timor- Tuesday 7 December, 1976. </para>
          <para>Today we are expressing our sorrow for the suffering of the Timorese people. </para>
          <para>This is the anniversary of the unprovoked attack on their nation- the Democratic Republic of East Timor. </para>
          <para>The past year has been one of bitter struggle for the people of East Timor. </para>
          <para>They have had to contend with an unprovoked attack upon their country by a bullying neighbour. The invaders in their attempts at destroying the freedom of this small nation have committed horrifying atrocities against the Timorese people. Over 60 000 people have died in the struggle against the foreign invader. This wreath is an expression of respect for those people. </para>
          <para>For the people of Australia this situation presents a fundamental challenge to our view of the world. </para>
          <para>The Australian Government wants us to forget the Timor situation. They want the Australian people passively to accept that Indonesia&#39;s generals have the right to decide on whether their neighbours can be free or not. They want us to believe that for Australia to have &#39;good relations&#39; with the Indonesian Government we should not criticise their unprovoked and brutal assault on the people of East Timor. </para>
          <para>That is why Telecom Darwin will be prevented from passing on news from East Timor. </para>
          <para>That is why Ministers of the Fret i lin Government have been refused permission to visit Australia. </para>
          <para>That is why Australia abstained from the UN resolution condemning the Indonesian invasion. </para>
          <para>That is why the Australian Government has abandoned its publicly stated policy and sends our humanitarian aid through the Indonesian Red Cross. </para>
          <para>That is why military aid to Indonesia continues. </para>
          <para>That is why Timorese refugees from Indonesian aggression have been refused special consideration for migration to Australia. </para>

          <para>-  I had not intended to speak on this matter because, after all, I do not think that this is some form of confessional chamber. What I did in attending that ceremony I did with dignity and pride. I can assure honourable senators I enjoyed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Walters&#39;</inline> speech very much indeed. It was a wonderful contribution to the Parliament. </para>

          <para>- I have listened intently to a debate which at times has been confusing, sometimes interesting, and always revolving around the very serious background of the reasons for raising the issue. I do appreciate, as I am sure those who have been involved in the argument appreciate, the statement by the Leader of the Government in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Withers)</inline> that he will bring forward tomorrow the matters of fact. Perhaps that information will permit this matter to be considered in a calmer manner. I am confounded beyond measure to find that a speech has been read tonight on behalf of another person whom it is claimed has never made it. I must say that I rind that a most peculiar thing. I believe that it ought to be settled by further inquiry. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>I am not in a position to judge, but I must say that, from the claims that have been made tonight- I believe that they were very earnestly and quite properly made- I believe that the speech that was read was not made. But I would like to see some further proof produced to settle the argument on this issue. If that belief is correct, I find it preposterous that I should sit here and hear an honourable senator read a speech which was prepared in another man&#39;s name and which was never made. I find that quite preposterous. I believe that those who make the claim that the speech was not made should bring up the matter and that it should be taken from there. It seems to me to be quite a misuse of the Senate&#39;s time for a speech like that to be read if in fact it was not his speech. </para>

              <para>1 ) Yes, I have seen the article. The report, however, is misleading because it suggests that the Public Service Board, as a matter of course, waives the educational requirements prescribed by the Public Service Act for entry for Aborigines to the Third Division. This is not so. There is provision under Section 38 of the Act for the Board to appoint persons not possessing the prescribed qualifications for entry to the Third Division in special circumstances. Where the Department is able to satisfy the Public Service Board that a position should be filled by an Aboriginal possessing special skills and attributes, the Board may waive the qualifications prescribed by the Act. </para>

            <item label="(2)">
              <para>and (3) No in-service training courses are conducted to ensure that Aborigines or other staff without matriculation are promoted to Public Service Third Division positions. In service training courses are conducted to contribute to the personnel development of staff generally and to enable staff to acquire skills, equipping them to contribute more effectively to the Service. However, the Public Service Board approved in February this year attendance at the South Australian Institute of Technology Certificate Course in Community Development under a departmental&#39; training scheme of four Aboriginal staff in the Fourth Division from the Department of Aboriginal Affairs. These staff had not matriculated and lacked the normal entrance qualifications for tertiary study. The course runs for two years and departmental officers receive full pay and a living allowance where appropriate during this period. The Department sponsored twelve Aboriginal staff under the same program in 1975. </para>

            <para>On the basis of information published in the annual report of the Australian Atomic Energy Commission for 1975-76, western world resources in the reasonably assured category recoverable at up to$US30 per lbU3Og are estimated at 1.84 million tonnes of uranium. Cumulative uranium requirements in the Western world were estimated in that report at 1.8 million tonnes of uranium up to the year 1995 on the basis of a low growth scenario. With no new resources established, nor higher cost resources exploited, this would give a life of about 20 years for world resources. </para>
            <para>However, the extent of uranium resources is constantly being revised as new discoveries are made. </para>

            <para>It is therefor most unlikely that they will be fished out to the point of extinction. However, their probable slow growth and relatively low fecundity may make them susceptible to excessive exploitation. Severe local depletion by operations such as those of the Taiwanese may well be possible. Insufficient is known in detail of their life history for the development of sound management plans on a scientific basis but, in the absence of detailed information, management should be conservative. This is the responsibility of the Commonwealth Department of Primary Industry in association with the Queensland authorities. I understand that extensive efforts are made to control the taking of clams by foreign vessels. </para>
            <para>Furthermore, I understand that, since 1969 some 22 vessels engaged in this practice have been arrested, including 6 this year. No reliable information is available as to the number of clams actually taken by the Taiwanese. However, I understand that the average number of clams on the boats arrested has been 20000 as compared with the 300 000 per boat suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr Endean.</inline></para>

                <para>The CSIRO has no plans at present for research on these clams. Unless an Australian fishery seems likely to develop, it seems desirable to give priority to species where management is required and, as far as clams are concerned, to concentrate on keeping the foreign &#39;take&#39; under control. If an Australian fishery seems likely to develop, the possibility of undertaking research to provide a scientific basis for its management will be examined by the CSIRO. </para>

            <para>The Government purchasing policy announced by the Prime Minister on 1 October 1976 concerns the application of a discretionary preference in certain purchasing situations to goods of Australian manufacture in competition with goods of overseas manufacture or with goods having lower levels of Australian content. </para>

            <para>The practice of the Department of Construction is to specify its requirements in terms of quality and performance, thereby permitting tenderers to price competitively on the most economic combination of plant, equipment and materials that are available. The exception to this practice occurs in instances where, for technical reasons and/or aesthetic comp at ability, it is necessary to specify particular types of equipment or materials. </para>
            <para>It could be reasonably expected that where suitable local products are available in close proximity to the site of the work to be performed, local manufacturers may have some advantage in terms of price because of transport cost advantages. </para>
            <para>The Department of Construction complied with approved procedures in the purchase of equipment and materials for the Government Centre at Glenorchy. In fact, Tasmania was the supply source for the majority of equipment and materials for the project. </para>
