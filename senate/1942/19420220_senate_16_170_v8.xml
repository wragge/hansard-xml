            <para> Was the Minister for the Interior correctly reported in the press last week-end in the statement attributed to him to the effect that, owing to the greater importance of minerals such as copper, sheelite, &amp;c, it may be necessary to transfer mining technicians and mining equipment from the gold-mining areas of Australia in order that they may assist in the recovery of other minerals which he considers to be more important than gold in the war-time economy of this country? If he did make a statement to that effect, is that the considered policy of the Government?
