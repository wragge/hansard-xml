                    <para>I am afraid that, through partly answering the question of the honorable senator, I have caused slight confusion in his mind.I am aware that he was withoutcharcoal at the week-end, but I do not know that private garages in Canberra are unable to supply charcoal. I asked the honorable senator to place his question on the notice-paper in order that 1 might be able to furnish him with full particulars. In submitting his question, the honorable senator made the statement that charcoal was not obtainable in Canberra ; but there is plenty of it here, and it is being used in Government motor cars as rapidly as they can be fitted with gas producers. </para>

Is the Minister taking action to see that this work is done, and, if there is a shortage of labour for the work, will he give instructions for the organization of working bees, such as have been formed in other parts of Australia, in order to provide air-raid shelters at the hospitals and schools in Canberra ? </para>

                        <para>- The whole matter of the proper protection of the people of the Australian Capital Territory is being effectively looked into by the officers of my department. The suggestion made by the Superintendent of the Canberra Community Hospital that trenches should be built, so that patients could shelter in them, is too silly for words. We do not propose to do anything of the sort. We have ample labour, and we are getting on with the job as rapidly as we oan; buttrenches are not the only things necessary for the protection of the people. All necessary precautions are in train, and will be given full effect as soon as possible. </para>

                        <para>.. - In supporting the motion, I wish to express my appreciation of the courtesy of the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> in supplying me with an advance copy of the statement which he has just read. All honorable senators have listened to the statement with great interest and although it maybe said that most of what we have heard to-day hasalready been published in the press, it is only right that the information should be incorporated in the official records of the Parliament. It is to the credit of the Australian press generally that newspaper reports on international affairs have been similar  to  the official statement which has been presented  to  the Senate this afternoon. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Opposition also appreciates the opportunity to discuss in open session important matters associated with the war, to pay our tribute  to  the United States of America for its support  of  the Allied cause, and to say how we value the splendid service rendered by members of the Australian Imperial Force and the Militia in various theatres of war, as wellas the gallant performances of our neighbours in the Netherlands East Indies, whom we wish success in resisting a powerful enemy.. </para>
                    <para>In the absence of a national' government, the Opposition considers that it is necessary that the Parliament should meet as frequently as possible. I hope that the splendid example set by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> in inviting' full criticism' in open session will be f ollowed by the Commonwealth Government. We on this side of the chamber realize the tremendous task which the Government is called upon to perform and when it was suggested to us yesterday that the Parliament should adjourn this evening until Thursday week in order that Ministers may attend to urgent and important matters associated with the war, the suggestion was readily acceded to by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fad den)</inline> by myself and also by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride).</inline> We insisted, however, that the Parliament should meet as regularly as possible, and I trust that when the sittings are resumed next week we shallhave the opportunity to deal with the international situation as it affects Australia, and to express freely views which may assist the Government in its difficult task. I trust that the Government will not resent our candour. </para>
                    <para>During this war wide powers have been given to the Executive. I imagine that those supporters of the present Government who, when in opposition, opposed the granting of such powers, are now grateful for their existence. A grave responsibility rests on both Houses of the Parliament to keep a close check on all regulations that are promulgated, in order to ensure that powers exercised  ostensibly in the nation's war effort do not merely camouflage some pet idea of advanced socialism held by some Ministers. </para>
                    <para>I greatly regret that the present. Government did not accept the offer of the Opposition to form a national government. Had it done so, there would have been presented to the country an example of unity in high places which could not have had other than a good effect. As one who had experience in a previous Administration of the difficulties of government in a time of war, I believe that in refusing to agree to a national government the present Government has done a great disservice to Australia. Had the offer of the Opposition been accepted, our preparations for the struggle in which we are engaged would have been more advanced than they are. I am confident that when the history of these days is written, historians will be forced to say that the attitude adopted' by the present Government has left an indelible stigma which time will never erase. </para>
                    <para>I am not satisfied with the action taken by the Government to deal with the manpower problem. It is not necessary to remind the Senate of the shortage of manpower in essential rural industries, as well as in the manufacture of munitions. As far back as last October, when the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> introduced his budget speech, he promised that every effort would be made to divert man-power from non-essential industries, or less essential industries, to those industries which were necessary to the nation's war effort; but, although the present Government has been in office for nearly five months, that promise has not yet been fulfilled. It is true that recently the Minister for War Organization of Industry. <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> announced that the manufacture of certain goods would be prevented in South Australia and Victoria. The reason given was that such action was considered necessary in order to save raw materials required by war industries and to divert to .such industries much-needed man-power; but I am constrained to ask why articles considered to be non-essential in South Australia and Victoria should not be similarly regarded throughout the rest of Australia. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Government has not had the courage to impose industrial conscription, or compulsory service, in war industries. I regard such compulsion as a matter of the utmost urgency and importance. </para>

                            <para>- We already have conscription of wealth. An examination of the taxation measures enacted by this Government will show that substantial, and even vicious, taxation is now levied on wealth in this country. I should fee happier if the same degree of compulsion were exercised in respect of all persons between the ages of 18  ond  65 in order that every one available can be called upon to do a specific war job. I urge the Government to take the power necessary to do this. Only in that way will it be enabled to tackle our immediate problems. In South Australia, for instance, at least 20,000 additional men and women will be required for war industries by June next. Ministers are just as much aware as I am that in many industries to-day hundreds of single men are engaged on process work and could be quickly released for service in the defence forces. Many more men who are now listed in reserved occupations should be serving in the armed forces. I had hoped that by now, following the repeated statements made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and various Ministers, we would have 100 per cent, mobilization. </para>

The man-power regulations were introduced on the 31st January. They are to be administered by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward).</inline> It seems to me that that Minister is more concerned about getting men out of the Army than into it. In that respect we know, of course, that he is running true to form. I regret that a recent meeting of representatives of the trade union movement in Victoria was discourteous enough to criticize the Prime Minister because the Minister for Labour and National Service had not been consulted in respect of certain economic regulations. Those representatives declared that they would accept those regulations only because the Minister for Labour and National Service, who, as we all know, is an extremist and opposed to compulsion, is to administer them. However, after this Government has been in office for five months we are now told that a questionnaire is being circulated in order to find out what men are available. </para>

Even if some of these men be required to live in tents they will still be much better off than our soldiers who are fighting overseas. I repeat that the Government lacks the courage to deal with this problem. Whilst it does not hesitate to call up married men 35 years of age with children to serve in the Militia Forces, it is not prepared to transfer single men from the dog-racing industry, or some other equally unessential industry, to the manufacture of munitions simply because some unions are opposed to such action. I urge the Government to realize the seriousness of the present situation. The people of Australia are staggered at its attitude, for instance, in respect of the recurrent stoppages in the coal-mining industry.I know that the position is difficult; but is the Government or the unions going to run this country? I want to be fair to the Prime Minister and his colleagues in respect of the attempts they have made to deal with this problem; but the difficulty mainly arises because of lack of courage on the part of the Government. This is clear from the following extracts which I have taken from press reports during the last month :  - </para><quote>

                        <para>January 9th. - "Work or fight!" Because there was no general resumption of work at the New South Wales coalfields this morning, the Federal Government at noon to-day promulgated a new National Security Order making it an offence against the National Security Act for any person, normally employed at a coalmine, to refuse to work when the mine is open and when he has been directed, or otherwise advised, to work by the committee of management of his union. Persons who contravene the regulation are liable for a fine of £100 or imprisonment for six months or both if proceeded against summarily, or for an unlimited fine and unlimited imprisonment if prosecuted on indictment. </para>

I assure it that every member of the Opposition will stand behind it in any action which it takes to steer this country through the present crisis.

I presume that that is the request which the Government will make to us, although the Minister stated that we are to be asked to assist in setting up the machinery to implement these regulations. I now tell the Minister that we propose to co-operate with the Government by pointing out how some of these drastic proposals will cause economic chaos, and instead of helping the war effort will do a great disservice to a large number of people in the community. I do not propose to deal with these regulations in detail at this stage. I merely take this opportunity to say that if some of these proposals are not modified, I, personally, shall do all I can to have them disallowed. We are prepared to discuss them with the Government. </para><interjection><talk.start>

                            <para>- Yes, action of the wrong kind; action designed to enable some members of the Labour party to inflict upon this country a form of socialism and a changed economic structure which will be detrimental to the lives of a large section of the people. I am not prepared to support that change. In so far as the regulations are designed to stop profiteering, speculation and inflation, I shall support them, but I wish to enter an emphatic protest against the introduction of such drastic provisions without giving Parliament an opportunity to debate them. Some of these regulations will create chaos in industry and throughout our entire commercial and social structure. I remind honorable senators that when the Prime Minister spoke on this subject, he said that the regulations had been approved in principle, but that the details had not been worked out. A close examination of the regulations reveals that the details were obviously not worked out. because their effect will be to inflict great hardship on the middle class and poor people of this country, without assisting the war effort in any way. I refer particularly to Regulation No. 5, which deals with the limitation of profits. The result of this drastic provision will be absolute chaos. Nobody knows exactly what the Government wants, and this provision constitutes a threat. </para>

Many small income earners, including widows whosesons are fighting at the front, have had their income reduced by 50 per cent. In fact, their incomes have been reduced to such a degree that, unless they obtain some relief, they will be unable to meet their taxation commitments, and the greatest injustice will be done to them. By one stroke of the pen, this regulation has taken away the livelihood of thousands of people. How can these people fulfil their financial obligations? I trust that after these drastic provisions have been considered carefully and fairly, something will be done to remove what has been justly described as the economic paralysis which now prevails. </para>

We realize that, for the present, at least, we must fight a rearguard action,but, as has been indicated in the Minister's statement, the time will come when we shall take  the  offensive. What will be the position of the Government and the people of this country when we find that our Militia Forces cannot be sent to such places as Timor and the Netherlands East Indies? If we are to win the war, our troops should be able to go to such places. They must stand shoulder to shoulder with the conscripts from the United States of America and Great Britain, fighting in the common cause. Australia will not bc able to hold up its head if it persists in its present selfish attitude and insists that Australian troops shall fight only on their own soil. The National Security Act should be amended to enable the Government to send our Militia Forces overseas should that action be considered desirable. Those who oppose permanent legislation for conscription for overseas service will not be prejudiced because the National Security Act operates only for the duration of the war and six months thereafter. I earnestly hope that the Government will give immediate consideration to this most urgent matter. We must take a long view of this war. After all, the Australian Imperial Force and the Royal Australian Air Force are already serving in theatres of Avar overseas. </para><para>I should like to take  this  opportunity to refer to a matter which has been misunderstood and misrepresented by a number of people.

The Government is branded with an indelible stigma because of its persistent refusal to join with the Opposition in the formation of a national government. It has a vacillating policy on man-power problems, and it has avoided the only solution to those problems - the introduction of compulsory service in essential war industries. It has failed completely to rule or discipline its own supporters - the coal-miners. Its treatment of these men provides a classic example of governmental inaction. The latest economic organization regulations provide indisputable evidence of muddled thinking, which is causing complete disorganization with little actual benefit to the war effort. We criticize also the Government's persistent refusal to amend the National Security Act in order to provide for the movement of Australian troops to theatres of war beyond Australian territories. Finally, honorable senators on this side of the chamber dissociate themselves from the Government's unfair criticism of Great Britain's war effort. </para></speech>

                        <para>.- When Darwin was bombed the comment was : " This should wake Australia up ". It has done so to a great degree. Unfortunately, the people's hitherto complacent attitude is giving way to a de featist attitude. Many citizens, including politicians, have " the wind up ", to us 3 a Great  War  expression. There is no need for alarm. Japanese activity in the near north is a clarion call for a greater war effort, with a background of calm confidence that we not only " can take it " but also " can give it ". We all deplore past governments' indifference towards adequate, well-equipped, welltrained sea, land and air forces. The nation is now paying heavily for thai folly. But commendable progress has been made, since war was declared, to make good our shortcomings. The Axis powers have, in actual combat, acquired the greatest respect for the offensive fighting qualities of our sailors, soldiers and airmen. The time is fast approaching when our home forces too will have an opportunity, in conjunction with our latest ally, to show their mettle. When the time comes for them to strike, the enemy must be hit hard wherever he may be. The old Australian Imperial Force won all its battles by taking the offensive. A purely defensive attitude is the next step to a withdrawal, and finally defeat. The static, or position warfare during the greater part of the 1914-18 struggle, engendered a " dug-out" complex, so that ii became necessary to carry out night and even day raids against the enemy. Only when a grand offensive was launched, was the road to victory cleared. </para>

                    <para>I stress the importance of offensive action because I fear that the Curtin Government has a defensive complex; many Government supporters, I believe, favour a " last ditch " defence. There is not mi ex-service man in either the Advisory War Council or the War Cabinet. A leavening of men with war service would be an advantage. When the time is opportune to strike there must be no legislative obstruction to hinder co-operation with our Allies. At present Australia can use her home forces to clear the Japanese out of our mandated territory, but cannot despatch one Militia man to remove the menace in Japaneseoccupied Dutch or Portuguese territory closer to Darwin and the north-west of Australia. If we allow United States troops to do this job for us, we will be discredited for all-time on the other side of the Pacific. Section 13 <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of the </para>

                            <para>draw the attention of the Government, to r.he danger menacing Australia as the result of the unrestricted liberty of enemy aliens. The wholesale and retail fruit and vegetable trade in this country is almost exclusively controlled by enemy or naturalized aliens. They are benefiting by the enlistment and call-up of Australia's manhood. They are extending their productive holdings. Short supplies and consequent higher prices are playing into the hands of these sheltered aliens. More first-class land is coming under their control. They constitute an internal enemy force of some thousands, which would cause a great deal of trouble if Australia were invaded. Prompt action is needed to deal with the man-power problem in rural districts. It is so acute that it is impossible for Australian producers to obtain starts and maintain production. Alien producers have no man-power trouble.* with which to contend. I understand that these aliens have formed the workers of each holding into a sort of company, which escapes the provisions of wages boards, and the employers' payroll tax for child endowment. They are so organised that they can transfer their countrymen to any given point at any time in order to work alien holdings. Behind all of this organization are master minds who have in view the capture of the whole of our fruit and vegetable trade. A sinister ring is thus in operation. While Australians are fighting and dying for love of country, and while Australian producers are being forced off their holdings, these aliens are making large profits and consolidating their position. What is the solution? The Government should exempt those called up for military training who are engaged in those avocations. It should fill the vacancies so caused in the Army from the hundreds of men who have been granted exemption on the flimsiest pretext that they are doing essential war work - work that could be done by women - and men not liable to be called up. The Government's policy of compulsorily registering aliens and allotting them to work of a national character is a step in the right direction. Many of these conscripted aliens could be employed growing vegetables in the proximity of our biggest camps for the troops. </para>

                    <para>The Government is to be commended on its decision to intern enemy aliens in north Queensland. But why only in that part of the Commonwealth? A general round-up of naturalized aliens with axis sympathies is long overdue. </para>
                    <para>Recently a weekly newspaper contained a scathing article concerning the absence of Public Service clerks from Victoria Barracks, Sydney, during weekends. I made it my business to inquire if the same applied at Victoria Barracks. Melbourne. As expected, I found that the article was true in some respects. In each section of the administration, military clerks work side by side with civilian clerks, both doing almost identical duties. The uniformed men have no specified hours for Sundays or week-days and draw no overtime. The civil clerks' hours are specified in the Commonwealth Public Service Regulations or arbitration awards. Overtime for thom has recently been abolished, mainly because. the practice was abused. The system is all wrong. In these critical times the Public Service statutory hours should be made more elastic. No one expects a man in uniform or plain clothes to work continuously every week without relaxation or recreation. The senior official should have authority to grant time off as he thinks convenient, but under the regulations, the civil clerks must " clock off " when the statutory hours per week have been worked. In war-time, particularly with the threat of invasion hanging over us, there should be a continuous service. The most important events requiring urgent attention usually occur during week-ends, when half of the clerical staff is away. I do not blame the individual who, in the mass, is loyal and anxious to give the maximum service. It is the system which is all wrong. Hidebound regulations are clogging the wheels of our war effort. When will somebody in authority take action to remove these obstacles? </para>

                        <para>.- The statement' on international affairs which was read to the Senate this afternoon  by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> reminded me of the many fine speeches that were made last week at the combined secret meeting of senators and members of the House of Representatives. However, not one  speaker  at the joint meeting dealt with fundamentals. Before we can do anything to introduce a new social order we must find the cause of the present disorder in the world - and " disorder " is a mild term to express our present position. In 1916, the late  President  Wilson, of the United States of America, said that America came into the war " to make the world safe for democracy". I maintain that there has never been a true democratic government in any country.  President  Wilson's illustrious predecessor, Abraham Lincoln, defined democracy as "government of the people, for the people, by the people ". It is a. truism to say that the destiny of the people lies in the hands of its government. I repeat that at no time lias there been true democratic government in the world. In 1914 the whole of Europe, with the exception of Russia, was controlled by so-called democratic governments. Nevertheless, we were forced into war in that year. After that war, we were told that democratic government continued. But what has happened in Europe since then? Take Italy as an example. Within two years there were three so-called democratic governments in that country - the Orlando, the Nitti and the Facta - and yet it continued to go to the dogs. In their fight for the fruit? of office they altogether neglected the goodwill of the people. As a result, the Communists took charge of the big Fiat factory at Turin, and the Socialists took charge of Milan. On this wave of disorganization, Mussolini and his Blackshirts were swept into Rome. We recall how he walked into the Senate, and said : " To hell with democracy, I spurn its corpse ". Mussolini introduced many great reforms, and, if he had not become obsessed with the idea that he was a modern Julius Caesar bent on forming a new Roman Empire, Italy would have been better governed under fascism than under any so-called democratic system. </para>

                    <para>What happened in France? Within two years,, that country had four governments - those led by Blum, Daladier,  Reynaud  and Laval - and over 100 Socialist deputies were cast into prison. This caused the greatest possible resentment throughout France, with the result that the war effort was held up. Blum tackled the Bank of France on the devaluation of the franc, but the. moneypower was too strong for him, and a similar experience befell the other governments of France which succeeded him. When Laval made a compact with <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Samuel</inline> Hoare, to the disgust of the people of England, proof was given once more that democracy has never been in power in Europe. If we are to have; real democracy and a new order, we shall have to find out what is wrong with the present order. .Nothing has been done to bring about a new order. Conditions were almost as bad in England as they were in France. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baldwin</inline> faced the electors on the last occasion, there was a strong peace move. He won the elections, but fell in with the peace movement by reducing the grants to the Navy, the Army and the Air Force, notwithstanding the fact that, week after week, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> had informed the House of Commons how powerfully the Germans were arming. </para>
                    <para>In 1936, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> pointed out, without avail, that Germany had exponded £800,000,000 on armaments; but he was too big for his associates, and was kept out of the Ministry, because he wanted democratic government and thought that the safety of his country should be the first concern of members of Parliament. The tremendous task that he has undertaken to-day was handed down to him by mcn who forgot the real principles of democracy. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Stafford</inline> Cripps, as soon as he returned from Russia, said it would bc a good thing if the Government of Great Britain told the people what they were fighting for. He remarked that it was not sufficient merely to tell the people that they were fighting for the conditions experienced by them prior to the war. The people should be guaranteed new social conditions, because the conditions obtaining in England three or four years ago were dreadful. When <inline font-weight="bold">Sir</inline></para>
                    <para class="block">John Boyd Orr was asked to bring up a report on nutrition, he said that 4,000,000 people in England were each living on 4s. worth of food a week, 6,500,000 on 6s. worth, and 9,000,000 on only 9s. worth. That meant that almost 20,000,000 persons in England were living near, or down to, the bread-line. It is logical to say that the people who govern are those who get what they want, but do they want war under these dreadful social conditions? Of course not. Conditions to-day are as bad as they can be in Australia, but there is no effort by a democratic government to bring about better social conditions, and this is due to one particular fact. The present monetary system has brought about these conditions, and there is no chance of peace and better conditions while the present monetary system remains. Abraham Lincoln once said : " I have two enemies. One is to the south, to which I am advancing, and the other is the enemy behind me, the money-power. Of the two, the enemy behind me is the greater." </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Bank was established despite the strong objections of all of the private banks. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley fought for ten years to bring the Commonwealth Bank into existence, and the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller, as governor of that bank, did a splendid job for Australia during the last war, when he raised money at one-tenth of the cost charged by the private banks for the same service.  His  death, however, gave to the private banks their chance. When the Bruce-Page Government was in power, the constitution of the hank was amended in such a manner that, as a people's bank, it was practically strangled. I told <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> that in my opinion the amendment to the Commonwealth Bank Act in 1924 was the greatest piece of political treachery ever perpetrated on the people. That was followed by the attempted Casey amendment. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> proposed a further amendment of the Commonwealth Bank Act, and also desired to establish a mortgage bank. At that time the Commonwealth Bank had .assets valued at £19,000,000 and had made advances amounting to £184,000,000. There was plenty of money with which to establish a mortgage bank, but that would not suit the private banks. The proposal then submitted was to sell inscribed stock and debentures, and the only people who could buy the inscribed stock were the banks themselves. They were to sell £20,000,000 worth of debentures to raise the money required to found the mortgage bank. That would have given to the private banks another tremendous advantage, because, under company law, if th, debenture holders were not satisfied with the way in which the business was being conducted, they could have taken it over. But there was such an outcry .against the Casey amendment at the time that the Government of the day dropped the proposal. </para>
                    <para>I remind honorable senators that it is their duty to endeavour to meet the new conditions. The old orthodox ideas will have to go by the board, particularly in regard to finance. I was in Martin-place, Sydney, last week, and saw a representation of " Britannia " on a fancy motor car surrounded by flowers. On my right hand was the head office of the great Commonwealth Bank, which could advance £100,000,000 of credit to-morrow in order to carry on the war. There is no need for the present heavy taxes, of which even members of the Opposition complain. It has been proved by a royal commission that the Commonwealth Bank could lend interest-free money to the Government, whilst the private banks can lend only against their cash reserves. </para>

Our soldiers won the last war, but the banks won the peace, and that is why we are in the present war. Members of this Senate  have  taken a solemn oath in this chamber to put the interests of their country first, [n my opinion we shall have to drop all parties. When we are at war there should be only one party, and that -is the nation. Some of those who have jeered and laughed at me in this chamber because of nay views on financial matters now admit that I am right, but it is against the traditions of the Opposition to agree to anything that comes from this side of the chamber. That applies to whichever party happens to be in power. In this great crisis, however, I suggest that the Opposition should take a new view of finance, and take the right view of it, even if it means a departure from it. traditional performance of the past. I hope that in the present crisis some notice will be taken of what I have said with regard to the financial situation. </para>
                    <para>A few weeks ago the people were told that the currency of the United States of America had been incorporated in the currency of Australia. This is the first time in the history of the world that any nation has accepted the currency of another nation. .When our men were fighting in France they were paid in the currency of France, and, with the thousands of Americans in Australia to-day. I ask whether any pressure was brought to bear on. the Commonwealth Government by Wall-street to compel traders in Australia to accept dollar bills as currency. The exchange, as all honorable senators know, is the amount one country charges another for the use of its currency. The United States of America has been charging us 6s. 3d. for its dollar of 4s. 2d. ever since the outbreak of war, and also prior to that. Now an American citizen can present a dollar bill to any trader in Australia and demand for it 6s. 3d. worth of goods or services. Not only is Australia in the hands of the private banks, but the currency of the United States of America, created by banks over which we have no control, is also coming in. The Federal Reserve Bank of America, which has the same standing a* the Bank of England, must have exerted influence over the Commonwealth Government. We are not getting anything from the United States of America for nothing, but I do not think that that country has any right to demand 6s. 3d. worth of goods and services for its paper dollar. </para>

                        <para>. - I have listened with interest to the carefully prepared statement which is the product of the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> and which was read to the Senate by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley).</inline> There are one or two matters upon which I desire to touch, because we may get a little further enlightenment in the event of the queries which I shall submit being capable of being answered without giving information which may be of value to the enemy. I read into the ministerial statement a suggestion that there appeared somewhere on the horizon some prospect of Russia engaging in war with Japan. If I am wrong in that inference I shall be glad to bc corrected, because I think that it is of most vital importance to the conduct of this war, both in the west and in eastern waters, that we should know exactly whether that is to take place. In' my opinion Japan must ultimately be stopped. I do not take the pessimistic view that appears, unfortunately, and, perhaps unintentionally, to have been created by statements by various members of the Government. I .regard the present position with optimism, compared with my state of mind some eighteen months ago. I look with confidence to the great democratic forces which represent three-fourths of the population of the world and which are associated with Great Britain, the United States of America, and our other great Allies. I can see in those forces the overwhelming of the people of the other one-fourth of the globe, which stands for tyranny and everything contrary to those principles which we support and admire. I look therefore; to the subjugation of those enemy countries and to a future in which Japan will have been overthrown. That Japan will be beaten I have no doubt, but I want that result to be accomplished with the least possible sacrifice of life. That can be done only by attacking Japan at home - by striking at Tokyo and other Japanese cities and towns. In order to do that we must have air bases at Vladivostock and in China. Recently I was astounded to hear over the. air that the United States of America was already negotiating with the Chinese authorities for the establishment of air bases in China. Japan is full of vigour and fight and, so far, its armed forces have had the luck of battle at Pearl Harbour and elsewhere. Considerable success has attended Japan's exploits, largely because in such places as Malaya and the other countries where fighting has taken place the nature of the country has suited Japanese fighters. Before long Japan's successes may laud Australia in difficulties, but should that cause us to despair? Even though our tribulation may be great this country will continue to carry on. On one occasion recently I rather admired a gentleman with whose politics I am generally not in agreement. The Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> when sponsoring the present war loan, exhibited some of the spirit that should animate the people of this country. He said that Australian!! would fight on, if necessary to the last ditch. For years we have known what was going on in Japan, but. we have failed to prepare against attack. However, now that the trial has come, we shall not shirk the ordeal. The Japanese out-manoeuvred us at Darwin. On trams and trains, and in clubs, it is freely said that Japanese aeroplanes attacked Darwin from the south - a direction from which they were least expected. Without those modern instruments which can detect the approach of aeroplanes, it is not to be wondered at that the authorities at Darwin were taken by surprise. The pity of it is that some of our aircraft were struck upon the ground. That, however, is one of the fortunes of war. Pearl Harbour had its warning; Darwin did not. Pearl Harbour neglected its warning. The commanding officer there said that it was foolish to talk of a Japanese invasion of Hawaii. Serious though they be, such incidents are bound to occur especially when a nation has made preparation for more than a dozen years to strike outlying posts in the Pacific. In Java Japan is meeting foemen  worthy of its steel, and Japanese soldiers can expect a. lively time indeed. I have always visualized the closest co-operation between the Dutch people of the Netherlands East Indies and ourselves. I remember the Dutch as a nation which held command of the seas for many years and whose people have never  lacked  courage and enterprise. I speak only as a layman, but I should regret exceedingly if tUe higher war strategy should leave J ava without support. Of course, it may be that that would be a wise course to adopt, but I cannot easily forget an appeal on behalf of Java which <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> read in last night's Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald.</inline> Ii was an appeal by a Dutchman for his country similar to that which any one of us might make on behalf of Australia. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>When I heard the Minister's statement regarding unity of command I recalled that lack of a single command greatly prolonged the war of 1914-lS and, indeed has produced some degree of chaos in our ranks in the East during recent months. Let us sink our differences so that our men may go forward to the place where they can serve Australia best. Let us put our forces on sea, on land and in the air in charge of one man whom we can trust, and let him do the job. In this respect, we may learn something from dictator countries; in Italy and in Germany one man gives commands which are obeyed throughout the country. Should the man entrusted with that authority fail, he may be punished, and although that will probably he his fate in the long run, the policy is sound. In Russia, Stalin is supreme. He says to those under him, " Go " and they go, and to others " Come ", and they come. In Russia, that policy has met with considerable success. I am delighted at the success which has attended the effects of General  Timoshenko  - a man who I generally refer to as " Tam-o-S banter " because he is so like the  Tam-o-Shanter  of old. Russian strategy is left to him to devise and carry out. A nation engaged in mortal combat cannot afford to have divided control. Nor can it afford to be bound by red tape. For the edification of those honorable senators who share the responsibility of governing the country, I shall mention a story which I heard recently in Melbourne. An officer belonging to the forces of one of our allies took a lady guest into dinner at a social function, where the all-absorbing topic of conversation was, of course, the war. The lady asked whether her companion thought that the Japanese would invade Australia, and he replied: "I do not". The lady was greatly reassured, hut she wanted to know on what his opinion was based. The reply of her companion was illuminating : " They would be very soon entangled in red tape ". We do not want too much red tape; but we do want to have in command men who know their job. I urge that the man on the spot should be trusted, for, after all, it is he who must accept the responsibility. Generally, we have not failed when we have trusted the man on the spot, for, realizing his responsibility, he has risen to the occasion, although, at times, he has been mistaken and perhaps beaten. In the interests of our own safety and of democracy, we must have unified command. Whatever our present shortcomings may he in this respect, I believe that they will shortly be remedied. We have the men and also the material. We are inclined to forget the enormous burden which the old Motherland has carried throughout this war. We are inclined to forget the enormous length of coastline that Britain has to police in order to reduce Germany to commercial impotence. We are inclined to forget also the success which has attended the campaign against raiders, submarines and torpedo-boats in the North Sea and in the Atlantic Ocean. I commend to honorable senators, particularly those who are inclined to dwell upon the failure of our cousins in the Old Land to do what they think should have been done, a book by G. H. Johnston entitled <inline font-style="italic">Battle of the Seaways,</inline> which has recently been, published. It would bring to the notice of honorable senators the endurance and courage of the men employed on trawlers. Only this week, we all read with pride of the gallantry of the man who placed the destroyer under his control between a torpedo and a troopship, knowing as he did so that it meant the doom of himself and his crew. We should read these things rather than discuss the reasons for the fall of Singapore. What right have we in Australia to blame any one else for what happened there? I shall not indulge in party recriminations, but we all know that a government of a certain political colour in England refused to continue to make Singapore a bastion of Empire. Because of my connexion with certain business interests at Singapore, I have reason to know that many things which ought to have been done at Singapore were not done. But what have Ave in Australia done in the way of providing a " backstop " behind Singapore? I believe that experiences at Singapore will teach a lesson to Australia. So far as I am aware, no nation ever came to full nationhood without the shedding of blood. The Japanese have proved that they have the capacity to wage war and, indeed, to do many things successfully. Seeing that they have allied themselves with the Axis powers, and are aiming at domination over other peoples, we. have to meet them, and beat them. By waiting until the Axis forces were on the wane, they played their part well in Axis strategy. Japan's entry into the war, while giving a temporary advantage to the Axis powers, has brought into the war on our side the great United States of America. What must be the result on the future of civilization of the participation of our American allies in the struggle? But this is no time to be thinking about our new policies, or our new orders. We must first preserve our freedom ; and when the appropriate time arrives I. think that even-handed justice will be dealt out to the world as a whole. The regulation of international  trade,  for instance, will help to stem the petty jealousies which have arisen throughout the -world. Some people would revert to our old system of international trade; but that cannot be done. During a short stay in Europe on one or two occasions, and when I represented this country at meetings of the </para>
                    <para class="block">League of Nations at Geneva, I saw much of the dishonest machinations and methods that were current, and the efforts that were made to overcome restrictions in international trade. Whenever I think of those things I am impelled to ask how the world can go on under such conditions. I think that the import duty on wheat, into France, in the interests of French growers, was Ss. or 9s. a bushel, whilst, I believe, it reached 14s. a bushel in Germany. Are the people of the world, the ordinary human beings, to be deprived of commodities vital to their existence when such commodities can be produced in profusion in the Americas and in this and other countries? One could cite hundreds of instances to show bow the present unrest in the world has arisen. There is that seething mass of international jealousies between the people of the various countries of Europe, jealousies which I am afraid will take centuries to eradicate. When one crosses the border from one country to  another  one must produce a passport. If you go from one country into another country, perhaps not half a mile, you sense the venom :with which the workmen on one side of the border regard those on the other side of the border. They have nothing but hatred in. their souls toward one another. On one occasion I journeyed as a guest from France to a beautiful spot a short distance across the border of Switzerland. It was a Sunday, a market day for the French. Our driver was a Swiss. The party consisted of three or four cars. As we left the market town we encountered a few co;\vs on the road under the care of a herdsman. Our Swiss driver got out of the caj- and urged the boasts off the road in order to allow the cars behind us to proceed. The herdsman spoke to  him  in pretty strong language. He called him a pig of a Swiss and used certain adjectives, and a few rocks were hurled at our retreating ear as an expression of the herdsman's ill will towards us. When one crosses the border from France to Italy one experiences the same thing. There is not a spirit of friendship, peace or goodwill. </para>
                    <para>We must he guided by the higher strategy of our Pacific War Council. I implore the Government to harken to the words of those strategists, and not to endeavour to insist on Britain doing this, and Australia doing that, or Britain not doing this and Australia not doing that. Let us follow the lead of the  President  of the United States of America. He has sent his people forward. He has taken many things in his stride, and has dealt shattering blows to the enemy. J have no doubt that he will deal him more blows. Do not let us have bickering. 1 regret the atmosphere generated recently by certain words of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> Probably they were uttered on the impulse of the moment. At any rate,  they were put over the air. He withdrew them, but not before one or two of his Ministers, who are great proBritishers a.s we all know, were at great pains to explain to the people of this country that the Prime Minister had no reflection to make on Britain. We have no reflection to make on Britain. During the past :I50 years we have been protected by the strong arm of Great Britain. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the regulations which have been discussed in this debate by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> I fear that it is a case of forgiving the Government for it knows not what it does. Evidently, the Prime Minister has now realized his error, and it would ill become me at this juncture to add fuel to the fire that has been created by these regulations. The fire is exceedingly dangerous to the welfare of this country. It is a fire of which the Treasury officials and representatives of the Commonwealth Bank are fully aware; they have taken prompt steps to quell it. When the Prime Minister assumed office he stated that he was not going to tear up the economics of Australia by the roots. Let us see to it that he does not do something worse .than that. I welcome the suggestion made to-day by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> on behalf of the Treasurer, that these regulations be reviewed by a committee representative of the Government and the Opposition. One of the regulations is perfectly meaningless. The Leader of the Opposition has vigorously criticized the other regulations. But this is not a time for criticism. The Government has admitted its error. The particular regulation to which 1 refer reeks with injustice. If we must be taxed to the tune of 20s. in the £1, we must pay the tax;but do not let us do something that will reduce the capital value of the assets in this country. I noticed a statement in last night's Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> that the effect of this regulation would be to reduce the capital assets of the people in this country by £500,000,000. </para>

                            <para>- I have no reason to doubt it. I am able to speak with freedom on this matter because I happen to be one of the fortunate ones. On a certain stock exchange, for instance, 10s. shares paying 5 per cent. are still selling at 3s. That is what tie people think of them. When this regulation was mooted I was approached to sell those shares for 4s. I did not do so. But from this instance alone, honorable senators will realize the effect of this regulation. The particular company involved is not a prosperous concern ; its reserves are bad. Large concerns with big reserves are allowed to earn 4 per cent. on the whole of their capital. Probably, such concerns can go merrily on; but what is the position of the unfortunate preference shareholder? [ am not criticizing the Government on this matter; it was rushed through and there it is. Take8 per cent. shares in concerns like Australian Consolidated Industries Limited, Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, Australian Paper Manufacturers Limited, or a brewery. What do sellers get for 8 per cent. preference shares? A couple of pounds, perhaps. The buyer believes that the concern will probably accumulate more reserves and he will probably get 5 per cent. on his money some day. He is looking ahead. Under this regulation, however, what is the investor going to get? He is going to get 2 per cent instead of 4 per cent. In view of these facts, does not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> realize that there will be a shrinkage. I suggest that the honorable senator look at the stock sales effected immediately after this regulation was promulgated. He will see that there was a shrinkage of investments in giltedged securities to an amazing degree. I do not propose to refer to those other happenings which all of us engaged in the commercial life of this country know about. It was the immediate effect of this regulation that induced the Prime Minister to make his statement. I am sure that we do not want to embarrass the Government, but I implore it not to take risks with things that matter. I. cannot conceive that politics were involved in this instance, because such a procedure will obviously destroy the source from which the Government obtains revenue. I welcome the gesture made by the Minister this afternoon. Fromhis remarks I understand that the objectionable regulations have been placed on the table of the Senate, and that the Leader of the Opposition will be asked to appoint representatives on a committee similar to that which was appointed to review the budget. </para>

                    <para>Let us ensure that even-handed justice shall be meted out to our people; but at the same time let us resolve to do nothing that will re-act unfavorably on the revenue of this country. I sayagain to the Government that there is no need for panic or alarm. Our forebears at Home have taken a much more devastating gruelling than we shall ever be called upon to face in this country. They were practically unarmed after Dunkirk, and incapable of resistance. If the German monster had moved on at that moment we may not have been in the position we are to-day. However, he halted; and during that brief period the people of Britain armed themselves so effectively, and used their , air force with such brilliant strategy, that they defeated subsequent attacks by Germany in the air and in the Atlantic. There can be little doubt that those attacks will be renewed. However, the valiant efforts of our Russian allies preclude their immediate renewal. I welcome the inclusion of China which stands for peace, and, I believe, for liberty, among our allies. I believe that we should use the vast man-power of China and of India to the utmost. In regard to India, I echo the sentiments expressed by the Minister for Information : We must make every endeavour to bring the people of that great nation into linewith us. Whatever the difficulties may be, surely there is genius enough' in the British Empire to find a formula of government which will be satisfactory to the people, of that great dominion. </para>

                        <para>.- I realize that the Government is faced with great difficulties in these troublous times, and consequently it is not my intention to stir up discord. However, I do think that the Government would be well advised to consult more freely with the Advisory "War Council on matters which so seriously affect the whole economic life of this country as do the regulations which have been referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan. I realize also that no matter how serious the position in this country may become, the  Government has set itself determinedly against the formation of  a  national administration. For that reason no good can be done by continually raising that subject, although honorable senators on this side of the chamber are convinced that a national government would be in the best interests of the country. We understand that whatever may be the individual opinions of members of the Labour party as to the merits of a national government, they are powerless to act because of the strong forces which control them. However, when the war situation deteriorated suddenly by the entry of Japan into the conflict, we on this side of the chamber were informed that we would be freely consulted by the Government, through our representatives on the Advisory War Council, not only on questions of war strategy, but also on all important matters affecting the economic and financial life of this country. Naturally it was only to be expected that proposals of such a revolutionary character as those contained in the regulations recently promulgated would be discussed by the Advisory War Council. Unfortunately, that was not done, and now we find that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> realizing the difficulties which they have created by the sweeping nature of the regulations, have decided to set up a joint committee representing all parties in Parliament to devise ways and means of overcoming these difficulties. It will be recalled that when the Treasurer tabled his first budget, members of the Opposition told the Government in no uncertain manner that it would not be possible to raise the required revenue by means of the methods proposed in that budget, and that it would be necessary to vary the financial proposals at a later date. After considerable debate, a committee representing all parties in Parliament was set up to deal with the matter, and certain compromises were agreed upon. I say now that if t%e Government is really sincere in its consistent appeals for unity throughout the Commonwealth in this time of crisis, it should consult the Opposition through its representatives on the Advisory War Council on all important matters, and not merely on questions affecting what might be called the strategical direction of the war. I consider that many of the difficulties which appear on the surface, and much of the criticism which is being levelled at the Government, would disappear if a true spirit of compromise were shown. One of the reasons why the Government finds itself in difficulties to-day is that it will not face up to some of the things which are absolutely necessary if we are to achieve a 100 per cent, war effort. In the first place, when the last Fadden budget was brought down, an endeavour was made to secure equality of sacrifice among all sections of the community by means of a system of compulsory loans. Although I firmly believe that the people of Australia will respond generously to the appeals that are now being made by the Government in regard to loan subscriptions, it would have been far more equitable to have introduced a system of compulsory loans under, which every body would have been asked to contribute to our war effort according to his financial position. No doubt thousands of patriotic citizens will lend their money freely without thought of interest, because they know that it is going into the common defence pool, but I still believe that in an all-in struggle, such as this, no one should be allowed to escape his obligations, financial or otherwise. All we have is at stake, and it would be a far better scheme to say to every one, "You will lend or give, according to your means ". I am not very much concerned with the appeals which, are now '.being made to many of of us by members of the stock-broking profession because they in common with every one else will have to make sacrifices, but I do say that although on the surface it may appear that stock-brokers will be the main sufferers under these regulations, that is not so. The people who will really suffer are those whose legitimate transactions have been held up deliberately. For instance, a man might find it necessary to sell a small farm or to dispose of some stock in order to re-invest the money in some other project, but under these regulations he cannot do so. I hope that difficulties of this nature will be ironed out by the committee which the Government proposes to set up. These are the things which cause damage, and usually they are not examined sufficiently by governments when recommendations are made by officials. I urge the Government in all sincerity and in the interests of national unity to utilize the services of members of tie Advisory "War Council to a far greater degree. Honorable senators on this side of the chamber have not been appointed to the Advisory War Council merely for the purpose of attending meetings and obtaining information ; their function is to give solid support to the Government an all matters of national interest, and if the council is to become in fact what we all want it to be. namely, a truly national body representative of the various elements in this Parliament, the Government must take Opposition members of the council .more into its confidence. </para>

                    <para>I believe also that the Government is not standing up to its responsibilities in regard to the problem of rationing various essential commodities. We have always considered Australia to be a land of unlimited wealth&gt; .but because of certain large -demands that have been made to supply not only Australia's requirements but also the requirements of some of  out  Allies, there is a shortage of certain foodstuffs. It is true that we have an unlimited supply of wheat, but the supply of beef, for instance, has caused us great ' concern. It cannot bc denied that there has been considerable hoarding of foodstuffs in this country, just as there has been in Great Britain. Certain individuals who are more liberally endowed with wealth than others have been taking every opportunity to put away stores of certain goods. I agree that in ordinary conditions that might be a very estimable practice, but not so to-day. </para>

                            <para>-  I realize that in the past when supplies have been plentiful encouragement has been given, particularly to country store-keepers, to lay in stocks of certain foodstuffs, but the position to-day is different. As the Minister assisting the Minister for Commerce knows, there are limits to the supply of certain foodstuffs, and I contend that no one should be given an advantage over others in conserving supplies. To overcome that difficulty I suggest that a system of rationing should be introduced. </para>

                    <para>There is another matter to which 1 should like to refer, and I make this point in all good faith. I suggest that when the Government is contemplating drastic changes it should first consult carefully the interests concerned and also the Advisory War Council. Secondly, ii should not give undue notice of the action which is contemplated. I refer, particularly., to the new man-power regulations, of which four or five days' notice was given. When it was noised abroad, through the press and the broadcasting stations, that employment in certain industries was to be pegged, many men engaged in remote country districts  began te* seek employment in the cities where working and living conditions are more congenial. As the result,- country establishments were deserted by large numbers of highly trained and skilled tradesmen. If the regulation had not been implemented soon after the announcement was made, many industries would have been stranded and unable to secure capable men. I agree with the Government's action, in pegging employment. Skilled tradesmen are not numerous at present, and continual staff changes, ddue to' the movement of workers from one place of employment to another, cause inefficiency in important industries and have a bad effect on individuals. Soldiers, sailors and airmen have to stay at their posts, and men employed in war industries should 'be compelled to do likewise, particularly as the Government has granted them many concessions, such as exemption from military service. After consulting representatives of the industries and trade unions affected, the Government should have put its plan into operation immediately. The rush that occurred in some industries was almost as chaotic as if the Government had given two or three days' notice of a new excise tariff and every business concerned had rushed to "get from under" before the axe fell. </para>
                    <para>This afternoon, I asked the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> whether any instructions had been given to the Australian Broadcasting Commission by the Government regarding the policy to be adopted by the commission in its news broadcasts and commentaries, or whether the commission was entirely responsible for all news and commentaries broadcast in. the " This is Canberra " session and in the national news service. An interjection which was then made by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> impels me to refer to the subject again in order to make my position clear. I consider that publicity of the Government's activities- is an essential contribution to our war- effort and plays an important part in sustaining the morale of the people. The Minister, in answer to my question, said that no instructions had been given by the Government to the Australian Broadcasting Commission in relation to its news services, thus infer ring that the commission formulated its own policy in that connexion. He added that a Postmaster-General in a previous government had instructed the commission to follow certain lines in relation to criticism of the government at that time. I thereupon asked the honorable gentleman to state the circumstances associated with this instruction and to name the Minister concerned. The Minister did not reply to my question, but the Leader of the Senate interjected : " The honorable senator knows all about it". I assure honorable senators that I know nothing whatever about such an instruction, and that I heard about it for the first time this afternoon. Furthermore, I have never held the portfolio of Postmaster-General. If any such instruction were given, it was wrongfully given. I believe that the national news service, above all things, should be entirely free from the taint of party political propaganda. I ask leave to continue my re marks at a later date. </para>

                    <para>. - On the 20th February, the honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> alleged in the House of Representatives that on that day the Australian news session broadcast from Canberra included: a statement that no further cables to members of the Australian Imperial Force should be lodged at post offices. Even before the honorable member made that assertion I had shown to him the press statement which I had issued that afternoon, and from which the broadcast, news item had been prepared. It was indicated clearly in the press statement that the suspension referred only to cables and mail matter for members of the Australian Imperial Force who were known to have been in Malaya and Singapore. The honorable member for Barker insisted that his hearing was good, despite the fact that at least one other honorable member interjected to the effect that Malaya and Singapore had been mentioned in the broadcast. After a thorough examination of the announcer's script, I am obliged to challenge the effectiveness of the hearing of the honorable member for Barker. The actual item broadcast in the Canberra news at <inline font-style="italic">1</inline> o'clock that night was as follows: - </para>

                <para>The fullest investigation in Sydney and Canberra proves that these were the only references to the subject in the Canberra news, and in each case it was clear to all but the honorable member for Barker that the advice referred to telegrams and postal articles addressed to members of the forces who had been in Malaya and Singapore. The pre.ss statement was issued by me, following a suggestion from the Department of the Army, because large numbers of telegrams, cables and letters were still being despatched to our forces who had been in Malaya. It was done in the public interest, and the information was faithfully broadcast. By giving his distorted version of this news item, and denying the use of an important qualification the honorable member for Barker suggested that the implication was that Australia's overseas cable service was interrupted by enemy action - a fantastic and entirely foolish interpretation. It is unfortunate that this news session should have been subjected to such an irresponsible attack the effect of which would be to undermine public confidence in an official news service conducted to provide authentic information for the benefit of the public. </para>
                <para>I assure honorable senators that the whole object of the Canberra session is based upon the understanding reached recently by myself and both national and commercial radio services that the news should be factual and objective. I draw the attention of honorable senators to the significant fact that, on the same evening that the honorable member for Barker made his comments, the honorable member for Grey <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Badman)</inline> also criticized broadcasts made by a government department. It was on the same day also that the Premier of South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford,</inline> publicly condemned certain aspects of the Australian news broadcasts from Canberra - a veritable " broadside " from South Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Playford's</inline> attack was as unreasonable as that of the honorable member for Barker, and was couched in general terms in order to make another political attack upon the broadcasting services of this country, which have done everything requested of them in connexion with the Commonwealth war effort. The honorable member for Grey complained that information of value to the enemy had been broadcast on Sunday evenings in the " All Australia " sessions of the Department of Information. He cited the broadcast statement that Japan could approach Australia by by-passing the Dutch East Indies as a typically dangerous statement. That was a general statement of an obvious fact, and Japan needed no help from us in that respect if it wished to follow such a course. Eather, was it a means of bringing home to the people of Australia a realization of the fact that they must be prepared for all eventualities, and must not regard one course of action as the only logical one. Too many countries have fallen as the result of an overdose of " honeyed " words, and T believe that the people should be cognizant of the danger which confronts us.
