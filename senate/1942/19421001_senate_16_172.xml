When I was proceeding along the footpath leading to the Hotel Canberra, I had to retrace my steps and walk along the road. Would it be possible to provide some lights on that and other footpaths, in order to avoid the danger to which pedestrians are now subjected? </para>

            <para>- The history of the lighting restrictions at Canberra is rather a long story, and I do not propose to detain honorable senators by relating it fully. Last night was very stormy, and on several occasions during the night the street lights failed. Under normal weather conditions, the street lighting of Canberra is as effective as my department intends to make it, because the security regulations must be observed. The present lighting arrangements will not be altered. I was glad to hear what you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> said with regard to the lighting in the precincts of Parliament House. When I returned to these premises last night after dinner, I immediately complained to the chief warden. The whole of the front of the building was a blaze of light, which could have been seen for a distance of 40 miles. I am told that Canberra is a country village comparable with some other village 100 miles away. But people forget that this city is situated only 65 miles by air from the Pacific Ocean. Canberra must be protected from that point of view. Furthermore, it is the only city in Australia in which all the prominent buildings are white. I complained to the chief warden that the spectacle which Parliament House presented last night was a disgrace and an open invitation to the enemy. </para>

            <para>- I have already considered that matter, but I shall do so again. Every street lamp at Canberra is shaded at the top. Each lamp throws a light on the ground so that the glow cannot be seen from above. Outside the front of Parliament House are two special lights which are shielded from above, but throw a light upon the steps of the building. If those lights were not burning last night, the fault does not lie with the department. </para>

            <para>- I draw theattention of the Minister to the fact that the surface of the steps in front of Parliament House is not properly graded, with the result that water flows inwards instead of outwards. If that fault were remedied, there would be no danger of people slipping. Will the Minister draw the attention of the Works Branch of his department to the matter, and have the defect remedied before next winter? </para>

          <para class="block">The Governmenthas had under consideration a number of matters in connexion with superannuation in the Commonwealth Public Service, the most important being the extension of superannuation benefits to a number of persons not classed as permanent public servants. The Government felt that these matters should be dealt with comprehensively, and it asked the committee which was appointed to deal with repatriation matters, to examine also proposed superannuation amendments. This has been done, and the bill is based on the committee&#39;s recommendations, with the exception of one item on which its members were not unanimous. The Government is of the opinion that the claims to superannuation of a number of persons employed by the Commonwealth who are classed as temporary, but whose services are of a permanent nature, should be recognized, and in this bill it is asking Parliament to recognize such claims. </para>
          <para>In 1937, when superannuation rights were extended to employees of the Repatriation Commission, the War Service Homes Commission, and some other similar bodies, the Minister in charge of the bill said that if a case could be made out for similar treatment in respect of any other class of persons who were in substance permanent employees, sympathetic consideration would be given to it. There are approximately 2,600 employees who have been continuously employed by the Commonwealth for five years and over, and whose services are required indefinitely. Many of these employees have had long continuous service; more than one-half of them have had from 10 to 40 years&#39; service, and the remainder have from five to nine years&#39; service to their credit. The Government considers that these persons, although classed as temporary employees, are in reality filling positions of a permanent nature, and it now proposes to extend superannuation rights to them on the following conditions :  - </para>
          <list type="loweralpha">
            <item label="(a)">
              <para>That the employee should be subject to medical examination as required by the act; </para>

              <para>that he has not attained the age of  65  years - the maximum age for retirement laid down inthe Superannuation Act; and </para>
            </item>
            <item label="(e)">
              <para>that the chief officer of the department certifies that the employee&#39;s services are likely to be retained for an indefinite period. </para>
            </item>
          </list>
          <para>In any case in which the chief officer does not certify that the services of the employee are likely to be retained indefinitely, the employee will, if he complies with the first four conditions, have the right of appeal to the Treasurer.The names of those persons who are to be regarded as employees within the meaning of the Superannuation Act will be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> by the Treasurer. In those cases in which employees cannot pass the entrance medical examination, but comply with the other conditions, they will be able to contribute to the provident account, but not for pension benefits. Contributions to the provident account are based on 5 per cent. of salary, to which is added 3 per cent. compound interest, and on retirement the Commonwealth also pays an equivalent amount. </para>
          <para>Similar conditions will apply to an employee who is over  45  years of age and his fortnightly contribution for  &#163;52  per annum pension exceeds  5  per cent. of his salary. He may elect to contribute to the provident account instead of for superannuation benefits. The Government considers five years&#39; service as an essential requirement before a temporary employee is given superannuation rights to be a reasonable period when it is remembered that employees who have qualified for permanent appointment  have to serve a probationary period of from six to twelve months before they can become contributors. <inline font-style="italic">it.</inline> is also proposed to extend superannuation rights to persons employed in a permanent capacity by semi-governmental authorities. The Commonwealth does not directly employ these persons, but they are employees of authorities established by the Commonwealth. As the functions of the various authorities differ, the Government proposes to grant superannuation benefits to employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the Canberra University College Council, and the Canberra Community Hospital Board, who are employed on a permanent basis, and to give other semigovernmental authorities the option of deciding for themselves whether they will or will not bring their employees under the Superannuation Act. Where a pension becomes payable to, or in respect of, an employee of a semi-governmental authority, the Commonwealth will pay it3 proportion of the pension to the superannuation fund in the usual way and the authority will recoup the Commonwealth. As practically all of these employees have had to pass a medical examination at some time during their service, it is proposed that if an authority accepts full liability for any pension that may become payable to, or in respect of, its present employees within a period of three years from the commencement of their contributions, such employees will not be required to submit themselves for the usual entrance medical examination. All future employees will, however, be required to pass the medical examination before becoming contributors. The names of the persons who are to be deemed to be employees within the meaning of the Superannuation Act will be published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> by the Minister. </para>
          <para>There is another small group of persons to whom it is proposed to grant superannuation rights, namely, persons appointed for a term of years to statutory offices and who are required to give their whole time to the duties of their office. When superannuation rights were granted to employees of the  Repatriation  Commission- and other authorities, the members of the authorities themselves were not included. However, some mem- bers are already contributors by reason of their status as permanent Commonwealth public servants. It is now proposed that persons appointed to statutory offices for a term of years who are required to give their whole time to their duties may become contributors under the act. There are only about twenty persons involved, and their names will be gazetted by the Treasurer. There are other persons holding statutory offices who are not appointed for a term of years and who are not required to give their whole time to their duties-. These will not become contributors. </para>
          <para>The bill also contains new schedules of contributions which it is proposed shall apply to contributions, the obligation in respect of which arises after the commencement of the act. The old schedules will still apply to all other contributions. The new schedules were recommended by the actuaries who made the third quinquennial investigation of the superannuation fund. The report, together with the Superannuation Board&#39;s comments and recommendations, has already been laid on the table of the Senate. The report discloses a deficiency in the fund of &#163;309,000. The actuaries point out that the original rates of contribution were calculated on the assumption that the fund would earn interest at the rate of 4 per cent., but they felt compelled to assume a rate of 3f per cent. They also draw attention to the high rate of retirement on invalidity pension and. the comparatively low rates of mortality amongst pensioners. </para>
          <para>The Government has taken the opportunity to introduce a number of further amendments to the act recommended by the  Superannuation  Board and also by the committee mentioned with a view to remove anomalies and for the smoother working of the scheme. These amendments have been discussed by the Superannuation Board with representatives of the Public Service associations, and can, if necessary, be dealt with in committee. </para>

            <para>. - The Minister&#39;s speech is a fair recital of the contents and purposes of the bill. Another honorable senator and I had an opportunity as members of the  Repatriation  Committee to examine the proposed amendments before the bill was drafted. I suggest to the Opposition that there is nothing in the measure that is unacceptable to it. Itwill confer many benefits. It contains no proposal inimical to the best interests of the members of the Public Service, or to the actuarial basis of the superannuation scheme. It does not impinge upon public policy. The only weakness of the measure, which was noted by the committee, is that it includes members of the fighting forces. The committee was of opinion that at some future date a separate superannuation scheme must be evolved to meet the peculiar conditions of members of those services. I think that I can speak on behalf of the Opposition, when I say thatwe shall not oppose the bill. </para>

            <para>. - I direct attention to an anomaly in the payment of superannuation premiums in respect of members of the Commonwealth Public Service, who have enlisted in the armed forces. In the cases of all public servants who enlist in the Australian Imperial Force, Royal Australian Air Force, andRoyal Australian Navy, the Commonwealth Government pays the superannuation premiums regardless of the income received by those persons as members of those services. At the same time, members of the Commonwealth Public Service who enlist in the Australian Military Forces, Garrison Forces, or the Volunteer Defence Corps, are obliged to pay their own superannuation premiums when their income in those forces exceeds that which they received as public servants. A commonrule should be applied in respect of all public servants who join any of the armed forces. </para>

            <para>.. - I draw attention to the claims of superannuated officers of the Public Service, who, during the depression, suffered a considerable reduction of their superannuation allowances. Those claims have been voiced by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand.</inline> My concern at the moment is that, so far as I have been able to ascertain, those persons are not covered by the bill. It seems to me that those persons who actually surrendered assur ance policies in order to take up extra superannuation units are suffering an injustice.

            <para>This amount is little enough to live on in these expensive days. The Government, or the Pensions Board, cannot augment this amount until &#39;the act is amended. If you compare our pension with the old-age pension it will be seen that old couples receive &#163;2 10s., with an additional1s. for cost of living. It can hardly be wondered at that superannuated officers feel harshly dealt by. </para>

          <para>If it be true that the contracts of these people have been altered to their disadvantage, their condition calls aloud for consideration, and should receive the early attention of the Government. Apparently, the measure is satisfactory to the Opposition; but I am not aware of anything being done in this connexion. Honorable senators will remember that when the Commonwealth attempted to apply a similar reduction to officers transferred from the States, those officers took the matter to the High Court, which found that the Commonwealth did not have power to deal with the contracts of officers transferred from State services. </para>

            <para>.- During the budget debate, I put forth a plea on behalf of Commonwealth superannuated officials for an increase of their pensions in order to offset the rising cost of living. I again stress this matter. By an amendment to the act a slight increase could be made from the Commonwealth Superannuation Fund, which now totals &#163;8,500,000. These aged officials, both male and female, have given long and faithful service to the Crown. They are not so well off as the old-age pensioners. By thrift over a period of years they contributed one half of the superannuation pension they now receive. The least the Government can do is to grant to them a measure of relief in the eventide of their days. </para>

McLachlan, concerning the refund to pensioners of the 20 per cent, deductions made from their pensions during the financial depression, I point out that all payments by the Commonwealth were reduced by 20 per cent, during the financial crisis, but superannuation pensions were restored to the full amount at the earliest possible date. The reduction in the Commonwealth share of pensions was made as part of the scheme for the reestablishment of the financial stability of the Commonwealth. It involved a common sacrifice. To refund at this stage the amounts deducted from superannuation pensions some years ago would mean that pensioners would not have made any financial sacrifice. It is not seen how restorations can be made in these cases without similar action in the case of every other reduction imposed under the Financial Emergency Act. If the refund suggested by .the honorable senator were made to this section, it would involve an expenditure of &#163;135,000. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> raised the question of granting allowances to superannuation pensioners on account of increased cost of living, as in the case of old-age pensioners. If increases were granted when the cost of living was high, pensions would have to be reduced when the cost of living decreased, and pensioners, and even contributors would never know the exact amount of pension that they were entitled to receive. Many superannuation pensioners are also receiving old.age pensions. A superannuation pensioner 65 years of age, and his wife, if aged 60, may together receive a total income from superannuation and old-age pensions of &#163;195 per annum, or &#163;3 15s. a week. The New South Wales branch of the Commonwealth Superannuated Officers Association last year unanimously decided against a proposal that their pensions should be made subject to the rise and fall of the basic wage. I have to inform <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> that no increase of pensions can be paid! from the superannuation fund. The last actuarial valuation of the fund, on the 31st December, 1939, disclosed a deficiency of &#163;309,000, and provision for an increase of the contribution rates is included in this bill. The honorable senator&#39;s suggestion would simply mean that the present contributors would be compelled to pay increased contributions in order to enable higher pensions to be granted to pensioners. </para>

            <para>. - The number of maximum age pensioners reemployed is about 250. The underlying principle of the clause is that the Commonwealth should not pay salary and pension at the same time. The pensioner still receives the superannuation fund&#39;s share of his pension. The high council of the combined Public Service associations recently confirmed this provision as fair, logical and equitable, taking the view that all employed pensioners received in full the amount of pension for which they had actually contributed. When a pensioner under the Victorian Superannuation Act is re-employed by the State, the State&#39;s share of pension is taken into consideration in fixing the salary on re-employment, but the Commonwealth cannot do this, as salaries for positions filled by pensioners are fixed by the Public Service Act or by arbitration determination. </para>

            <para>. - I congratulate the Government upon the introductionof this measure, the effect of which will be to bring the Commonwealth Public Service superannuation scheme up to date. In view of the long and faithful service which they render to the community, officers of theCrown are entitled to enjoy the best that can be offered to them by the public. However, there is another section of the community which gives long and faithful service to the Grown, but receives no superannuation benefits or retiring allowances. I refer to members of the Commonwealth Parliament. Consideration has been given to several proposals for the introduction of a superannuation scheme for members of Parliament, and I think that it will be found that in the Treasury Department a proposal of this nature has been lying dormant for many years. When we, as the elected representatives of the people,are passing superannuation measures such as this, it is appropriate that we should also have some regard to the circumstances of many of our own colleagues. It is only right that individuals who render valuable service to the community, by representing their fellow citizens in Parliament, should have some recognition of their work when they retire, whether compulsorily or voluntarily. </para>

          <para>That the hill be now read a second time. This bill is introduced to give clear legal effect to the intention of Parliament that sales tax should be paid in respect of concrete and similar goods of a kind used in the construction of buildings. Before the 22nd November, 1940, concrete and other building materials were exempt from sales tax. On that date, because of the growing need of revenue for war purposes, the government of the day amended the law to withdraw these exemptions, and concrete became subject to tax at the minimum rate of 5 per cent. It was specified for that purpose in the second schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and Classifications) Act 1935-1940. The Commissioner of Taxation proceeded to collect tax on these goods from building contractors and other manufacturers of concrete. In view of the greatly increased need of revenue, the present Government further amended the law on the 30th October, 1941, to cause concrete and other building materials to become taxable at the higher rate applicable to the general field of goods. This was achieved by omitting concrete from the second schedule. From that time, concrete has not been specified  in any schedule of the act, nor are any of the goods in the general field so specified. The collection of tax at the higher rate proceeded without challenge until recently when certain authorities which make concrete for their own use disputed their liability to pay tax on that commodity. They claimed that concrete was excluded from liability for sales tax by the definition of &#34; manufacture &#34; in the Sales Tax Assessment Act (No. 1) 1930-1940. That definition reads-  &#34;  Manufacture  &#34; includes production, and also the combination of parts or ingredients whereby an article or substance is formed which is commercially distinct from those parts or ingredients, except such combination as, in the opinion of the Commissioner, is customary or reasonably practicable for users or consumers of those articles or substances to undertake, and also includes any treatment applied to foodstuffs as a process in the preparation of the foodstuffs for human consumption. </para>
          <para class="block">The excepting words were inserted in the law in 1932 solely with the object of excluding from, the scope of the tax simple acts of assembling which are performed by retailers, e.g., the attachment of handles to lawnmowers and brooms. These words are relied upon by the authorities concerned in support of their contention that concrete is not taxable. Their claim is that the production of concrete is a combination of ingredients which it is customary for users- &#39;of concrete such as building contractors to undertake. The effect of this definition had not been overlooked by the Commissioner when he commenced to collect the tax on concrete. At that time, however, he was in a position to point to the specification of concrete in the second schedule to the Sales Tax (Exemptions and, &#39;Classifications) Act as clear evidence of the intention of Parliament that concrete was to be taxed, and he was advised by the Crown Solicitor that this specification would, as a particular provision, prevail in law over the general provisions of the definition of manufacture. Since the amendment in October, 1941, however, there has been no such specification to be relied upon by the department and, therefore, there Ls no clear authority for the collection of the tax although it has been the obvious intention of Parliament since the 22nd November, 1940, that the tax should be payable. In view of that intention, and the fact that the vast majority of taxpayers have complied with it by paying tax on the concrete made by them, it is considered that the few taxpayers who have disputed their liability should not be permitted to escape tax by a mere technicality. Therefore, this bill is introduced to make it clear that the production of concrete is not outside the scope of the tax. It is proposed that the amendment effected by the bill shall be deemed to have commenced on the 30th October, 1941, i.e., the date upon which there has been no specification of concrete in any of the sales tax schedules. </para>

          <para>. - Whilst I commend the Senate for the action that it has taken to prevent the advertising of contraceptives, I am still of the opinion that its attitude towards <inline font-style="italic">de facto</inline> widows is quite wrong, and is an insult to the womenhood of this country. The falling birth rate of this country is not assisted by companionate marriages. Economic circumstances are often urged as a reason for people adopting birth-prevention practices, but a little reflection will show that this has little basis in fact. &#39;Over the period in which there had been such a disastrous decline in the Australian birth-rate, there has been an increase of the real value of wages, an improvement, of social services, reduced hours of labour, and an increase of community benefits such as improved housing, gas, electric light, water and sewerage services, roads, hospitals and ambulance services, &#38;c. From 1.903 to 1937, the effective wage index number increased from 964 to 1,133, according to the Commonwealth <inline font-style="italic">YearBook,</inline> No. 33. In 1937, however, whilst there were nearly 2,000,000 more people in Australia than in 1914, they produced 1.9,000 fewer babies. The figures are as follows :  - </para>

        <para>The fact that an improvement ofthe material circumstances of family lifeis not sufficient to induce people to increase their parental responsibilities, is clear&#93;} indicated in the tables set out by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Mander</inline> in his publication <inline font-style="italic">Alarming Australia.</inline> In the following figures for the City of Sydney, it will be noted that residents of the better-class suburbs have not contributed their share to the population :  - </para>

        <para>It is not the presence of children which causes poverty, but misgovernment, inequality in the distribution of wealth, unemployment, retardation, thriftlessness, bad management, &#38;c. Bearing this in mind it is well to remember the following advice given by the National Birth-rate Commission in England, in its second report in 1920 :  - </para>

          <para>It is a good policy to adapt the conditions of living to the needs of the family, rather than to diminish the number of children in order to adjust a social organization which is defective and injurious to society. </para>

        <para>A declining birth-rate, far from solving the problem of poverty, must intensify it. It brings about a radical alteration in the composition of society, and the group as a whole has a tendency to grow old. In Australia, in 1871, 42 per cent. of the population was under fifteen years of age ; in 1933, 27 per cent. of the population was under that age; in 1871, 1.74 per cent. of the population was over 65 years of age; and in 1933, 6.48 per cent. of the population was over that age. Therefore, whilst the younger group has decreased by one-third, the older group has more than trebled itself. The net result is that a constantly diminishing group of young people must work harder in order to sustain a constantly growing group of old people who are no longer able to produce wealth, but only to consume it. This disturbance of balance must produce economic and political difficulties of a major character as it has done in Britain where it is estimated that in . 1975 nine young people will be supporting 26 old people. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Helen</inline>Gamgee, of Hull, in her investigations into the health of 500 poor families, found that the average health of mothers and children in the group containing five or more children was better than that of those in a group containing fewer than five, and that the level of maternal health in both groups was higher than the paternal health. Infant mortality has decreased considerably in most civilized countries during recent years because of the progress that has been made in hygiene and popular education, including the provision of baby clinics. For instance, in Britain, the death-rate in respect of enteritis and diarrhoea I diseases fell from 40 in 1899 to 6.82 in 1923. Striking results have also been obtained in the case of other causes such as tetanus of the new-born, tuberculosis, typhoid and diphtheria. The researches of Cattell on the families of American university graduates, eliminating poverty as a factor, established the fact that there is no difference in infant mortality between large families and small ones. From Bell&#39;s publication, Duration <inline font-style="italic">of Life and Conditions Associated with Longevity,</inline> it appears that the proportion of children who survive and even reach advanced age, increases with the size of the family up to a limit varying between the tenth and eleventh child. The investigations carried out by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Brownlee,</inline> director of statistics of the Medical Research Council, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Lancet,</inline> on the 1st November, 1941, prove that the correlation between infant mortality and fertility is so slight that when it is met with it can be due only to the intervention of extraneous factors such as poverty. The obvious thing to do is not to teach poor people contraceptive methods but to improve their economic position. </para>
        <para>It has been pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gaha,</inline> Chief Medical Officer of Tasmania, that although wonderful scientific developments are taking place throughout the world, resulting in the production of better and cheaper motor cars, houses and many other amenities, the falling birth-rate means that fewer people will be alive to enjoy them. </para>
        <para>History has shown that falling birthrates have caused the decline of great empires. Polybius, writing in 150  B.C.,  stated - </para>

          <para>In our time all Greece was visited by a dearth of children . . . and a failure of productiveness followed, though there were no long-continued wars or serious pestilences among us. If then any one had advised our sending to ask the gods in regard to this, what we were to do or say in order to become a more numerous and better fill our cities, would he not have been a futile person when the cause was manifest and the cure was in our power. For this evil grew uponus rapidly and without attracting attention by our men becoming perverted to a passion for show and money and the pleasure of an idle life, and accordingly either not marrying at all or, if they did marry, refusing to rear the children that were horn, or at most one or two out of a great number for the sake of leaving them well off or bringing them up in extravagant luxury. </para>

        <para>That sounds modern. Unfortunately, the Greeks did not heed the words of Polybius, and their empire passed into the hands of the more virile Romans. </para>
        <para>When the Joint Committee on Social Security visited Hobart some time ago, the mayor supplied to it statistics relating to the number of houses in that. city, their condition, and the rents charged for them. It is impossible to improve social conditions under the existing financial system, which is entirely responsible for the dreadful economic conditions that exist to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Gaha.</inline> the Chief Medical Officer of Hobart, visited a village settlement in Britain to which peoplehad been taken from slum areas and placed in comfortable homes. The scheme looked good on paper, but the health statistics showed that the deathrate of the community in the new homes had increased by nearly 40 per cent. An investigation of the economic status of the people showed that they had been obliged to &#34; pinch their bellies &#34; in order to pay the higher rents, for the  better houses. That shows what can happen when money is borrowed in the ordinary way for the purpose of improving social conditions. Until we use national credit for the benefit of the people, very little social improvement can be effected. In the principal cities of Australia to-day, people are dying in their own homes because the hospitals have insufficient accommodation for the sick and injured. <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Dale,</inline> the City Health Officer of Melbourne, has drawn attention to the fact that women in that city are unable to find accommodation in maternity wards. All of these disabilities could be removed if we used national credit to a greater degree. I am greatly surprised to find that honorable senators do not want to hear about such important matters as this. It seems to me that they are not taking a proper interest in the welfare of the nation. </para>
