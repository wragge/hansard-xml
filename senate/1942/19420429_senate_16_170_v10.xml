                    <para>As the honorable senator is aware, the marketing of apples is handled by the Apple and Pear Marketing Board, and if a free distribution were made of surplus fruit from Tasmania or any other State, the board would have to meet the cost of cases, cartage, packing, &amp;c, with the result that the Government would have to make a larger subsidy to the industry. I do not propose to take the matter out of the hands of the board by instructing that a free distribution of apples be made even to members of the fighting services. </para>

                            <para>- No refund was made to the Commonwealth Government by the Myer Emporium Limited, but the total amount estimated by the Prices Commissioner to have been overcharged  by the company to the consuming public was £250,000. The firm has been declared, and officers of the Prices Commissioner have made arrangements which ensure that the prices charged for its commodities shall be adjusted until the amount of £250,000 has been made up by the company. However, there still remains a grave defect in the legislation relating to prices control in that it does not guarantee that the individuals who were originally overcharged shall be compensated. There is no certainty that they will receive any benefit from the refunds. This aspect of the matter is under consideration. </para>

I well remember that, during the election campaign which resulted in his election to the Senate in 192S, i toured South Australia with him, and our association was of the happiest nature.

                    <para>. - I desire to associate the Opposition with the sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> in relation to the late ex-Senator Daly. As I was in Adelaide at the time of his death, I had the opportunity to pay my last respects to his memory, and I was pleased to see that the Government was also represented at his funeral by another ex-senator, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. "</inline> Mick " O'Halloran. I agree with the Leader of the Senate that the death of ex-Senator Daly at the early age of 50 years was a tragic loss. He worked hard, accomplished a great deal, and. showed outstanding courage and energy in times of adversity. He had .a humble beginning, having been associated as an office boy with the late ex-Senator <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Josiah</inline> Symon, another distinguished South Australian. Being in humble circumstances, he had to attend' night school in order to qualify for the profession he was anxious to follow. He was recognized as an outstanding authority in the arbitration courts, and was known throughout Australia by the skill with which he conducted cases on behalf of the employees, the class whom he represented in his professional capacity as well as in his political life. I am sure that a great number of friends of the late ex-senator, who had followed his early career and had had an opportunity to judge the good work he had done, were very grieved to learn of his death. As. the Leader of the Senate has said, he has left a widow and a young family of five, including a son who is serving in the Army. We feel deeply for his widow and relatives in their bereavement. </para>

                    <para>- The members of the Country party in this chamber desire to be associated with this motion. We deplore the death of the late  Hon.  J. J. Daly at the early age of 50 years. I saw him recently in Adelaide, and he appeared to be in the prime of life. I had the privilege of sitting in the Senate during the whole of his service of six years here. They were very strenuous years, during which we had to deal with the difficult problems which confronted the Scullin Government, in the period pf the world-wide economic depression. Immediately <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Daly</inline> took his seat, his outstanding qualities marked him out for the position of Leader <inline font-style="italic">of</inline> the Opposition, and, on the advent to office of the' Scullin Government on the 22nd October, 1929, he became Leader of the Senate. He also held positions as Vice-President of the Executive Council, Minister in charge of Development and Migration, Minister for Defence, and, for varying periods during the regime of the Scullin Government, Acting Attorney-General. In all those capacities, he rendered brilliant and sterling public service. Although he took over the leadership of the Senate a few weeks after first entering this branch of the legislature, I say unreservedly that he filled that position with great ability and efficiency and displayed outstanding courtesy. His party was in a considerable minority in the Senate, but his force of character, personality and able advocacy were vital factors in securing the passage of many of the Scullin Government's measures through this chamber. His bright intellect and kindly nature ensured him the personal friendship, respect and goodwill of his political opponents. Personally, I mourn the loss of a friend, who was a good husband and a fond father. My sympathy and that of the Country party goes out to his widow and family in their irreparable loss. </para>

                <para class="block">McLeay) has pointed out, from a very humble beginning. By force of that individualism which is, unfortunately, rapidly disappearing from our midst, and by force of character and sheer determination, fighting against those odds which made themselves felt - the odds of ill health, in his latter days - he strove with success to become one of the bright lights in the legal profession in South Australia. I pay my tribute to him as a man and as an individual. We were on different political sides in this chamber, but he fought with a deftness of mind which made an appeal to a large number of us. We did not always agree with him politically, but he fought strenuously for his party and he also fought his party strenuously when, in his conscience, and in the interests of the country, he thought his party was wrong. He was a strong individualist and a man of firm character. He had a great mind, and it is lamentable that a man of his parts, with whatever party he may have been affiliated, should have come to his end so early in his career. He had many of those qualities which are essential in the world to-day. He laboured under the disability of an undermined constitution, which exhibited itself from time to time in this chamber. We often sat for many hours at a time, and we realized dien that he was suffering gravely. That disability, in the end, led to his death. He attained a great reputation in certain circles for his knowledge of industrial law, and he obtained the reputation in this chamber to which reference has been made this afternoon. All we can do is to join with the Leader of the Senate in whatever measure of comfort those left behind may gain from a motion of condolence. I heartily support the motion. </para>

                    <para>. - As one who was associated with the late ex-S'enator Daly when he was a Minister in the Scullin Government, and who knew him in the active industrial sphere, I add my tribute to the memory of a great man. I believe that of all the industrial men I met in the arbitration courts, ex-Senator Daly was at least the equal of any. He had risen to high positions solely through his own efforts, and, as </para>

                    has said, he held ministerial office during one of the darkest periods in the history of Australia and of the Labour movement. Despite the fact that he crashed on some Labour legislation, when the Labour movement was in a parlous condition he was always ready to take a brief without any hope of fees, and he handled cases on behalf of the Labour party in a skilful manner. I was an advocate in the memorable " hours " case, when the hours of labour were reduced from 48 to 44 a week, and on that occasion the late ex-Senator Daly represented the South Australian Labour government. Despite the fact that he had merely a listening brief, counsel on our side received very sound advice from him. I also remember the ability displayed by him in this chamber. I endorse all that has been said about his strong personality, which was largely responsible for the passage of certain Labour legislation at a time when the Labour party was in a minority in this chamber.  His  passing is to be regretted, and I offer my deepest sympathy to his widow and family. Australia and the Labour party are the poorer for the passing of John Daly.

                    <para>The proposals embodied in this bill are based on the recommendations recently submitted by the Joint Parliamentary Committee in its Report on Wireless Broadcasting. Those honorable senators who have found an opportunity to peruse the committee's report will, I feel sure, have been impressed by the comprehensive nature of the investigations made and by the constructive suggestions submitted for the betterment of broadcasting in this country. Not only Parliament, but also the community as a whole, will be grateful to the committee for the work it has accomplished. There has been, I think, general recognition for some time past that an examination of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act could profitably be undertaken in the light of experience gained during the past decade, and this culminated in the appointment by Parliament in July last of a Joint Parliamentary Committee to inquire into and report upon wireless broadcasting within and from Australia. </para>
                    <para>As honorable senators are aware, the representation on the committee of members supporting the Government and the Opposition was equal and, seeing that . with one exception their views on the questions considered were unanimous, the Government, after consideration of the report, agrees with the conclusions of the committee, and those recommendations requiring legislative enactment are now submitted for the approval of the Senate. In view of the comprehensive nature of the proposals submitted by the parliamentary committee, which embrace the activities of commercial broadcasting organizations, it is necessary to repeal the existing Australian Broadcasting Commission Act. The purpose of the bill now before the Senate is to legislate for the future of broadcasting generally in this country, and it may, therefore, be of interest if I refer briefly to the development of the service. </para>
                    <para>The committee has stated in its report : " Broadcasting has progressed from the position of a novel source of entertainment to the status of an essential public service ". Never has this been more exemplified than at the present moment, when, because of restrictions in . other directions, the public in their homes look to broadcasting for a greater measure of enjoyment and relaxation ; while from the point of view of disseminating news, propaganda, and statements of national interest, broadcasting has taken on an aspect of importance quite unthought of in pre-war days. </para>
                    <para>The first demonstration of radiotelephony was provided by the Commonwealth Government radio service in 1920, with reception at the Exhibition Building, Melbourne, and during the next few years the activities of commercial concerns and radio amateurs were responsible for maintaining . public interest in radio-telephony, when possibilities of its use in the broadcasting field began to emerge definitely. Following a conference in 1923, a trial was made with a service in which licences were issued to approved companies, and listeners were required to pay a subscription dependent on the number of stations whose programmes they desired to hear. The receiving sets were sealed to exclude other programmes. However, this scheme was not successful, and in 1924 a new plan was devised in which two classes of transmitting licences for broadcasting were issued - termed class A and class B licences. There were now emerging clear-cut definitions of stations . providing the national type of service - class A - and those stations financed from advertising revenue - class B - and dependent upon commercial initiative. Subsequent developments, however, indicated that improvement was still necessary, and in July, 1928, a new scheme was evolved in which the class A stations, hitherto owned by companies, were purchased by the Government, and welded into' the nucleus of a nationallyowned service. The A and B class licences, as such, were abolished, and the stations formerly termed B class stations became the only licensed stations. </para>
                    <para>The Government, having thus undertaken the responsibility of establishing a national broadcasting system, a close study was made with the object of preparing a plan of development aiming at the establishment of sufficient national stations to serve the whole of the Commonwealth. The basis of programme service at that time was regarded as being primarily one of entertainment, and it was felt that the programmes should be provided by an organization skilled in that art. The first method tried was to invite tenders for the provision of programmes for all national stations, and a company incorporated as the Australian Broadcasting Company was the successfultenderer. The contract, which was for three years, ended on the 30th June, 1932. The experience gained by this method of operating the national service indicated that yet further improvement could be effected, and it was decided at the termination of the contract period that the provision of programmes should be placed in the hands of a commission set up by the Government. This was done by means of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act. Thus, by a process of evolution, there has' been provided for the Commonwealth - </para>

                    <para>In. deciding to set up two such broadcasting systems it was doubtless felt that the contrast between the motives actuating the two services would result in a diversity of programmes being offered to the public, and also that there would be mutual reactions tending to stimulate each other. From the experience gained, I think it can be said with confidence that these expectations have been largely realized. That the potentialities of service in the art of broadcasting are very great indeed is shown in the fact that whereas in 1924 there were 1,400 licensed listeners, to-day the figure is 1,324,000, or, in other words, 80 per cent of the homes in the Commonwealth have receiving sets; while in order to cater for the. diverse tastes of the people 30 national and 99 commercial stations have been provided, as against the original four in 1923. All this has necessitated a demand for the manufacture and marketing of transmitting and receiving equipment, with the result that over the short space of nineteen years we find that an industry lias been developed with a capital investment of £20,000,000 and in normal times giving employment to some 15,000 workers. Whilst the committee has submitted many recommendations, none is radical in character ; and from the fact that a continuance of the present system is advocated it is, I think, a reasonable inference to draw from the report that those who originally conceived and developed the general broadcasting plan of Australia showed wise foresight. </para>
                    <para>It may not be inappropriate at this stage' to refer to the fact that amongst the pioneers who took a special interest in broadcasting was the  Chairman  of the Joint Parliamentary Committee - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 'Gibson</inline> - who may well claim to be the father of broadcasting in this country. It is just nineteen years since he, a.* Postmaster-General. took the preliminary stops to provide a service for the nation and there is, I believe, a general feeling of pleasure and gratification that the honorable senator is here to-day to help us in out  deliberations concerning the future of broadcasting. </para>
                    <para>By virtue of its worth as a medium for the entertainment and enjoyment of the people, broadcasting has earned a very definite place in our social system and. we cannot be too greatly concerned regarding its future development. In considering the problem it is necessary in the first place to determine whether the- service has proved its efficacy and usefulness. The final test, qf course, is the standard of service rendered to the public. Let us look at the national system for a moment. This system has resulted in the establishment of stations and the use of a network of connecting trunk lines on a much greater scale than could ever have been developed by private enterprise, because of the resources available for the use of those controlling the national service. For example, that service has enabled the preparation and development of a scientifically planned system which, when completed, will serve nearly the whole of the population of Australia. On the one hand stations have been, and will be, established to serve centres where commercial stations, dependent on revenue from advertising, could not exist. On the other hand, by means of the commercial system private enterprise has been permitted, under proper control, to develop a service which is complementary to the national stations in centres where the density of population enables commercial stations to function effectively and without financial loss. By permitting commercial stations to operate, the public has been given a choice of programmes which they would never have had if only the national service had been in existence. For example, in Sydney the public has a choice of eight programmes - two national and six commercial. In the absence of the latter, Sydney listeners would certainly not have had eight national stations. Judged, therefore, from the investigations of the committee and one's own observations, I have no hesitation in declaring that the present system has been beneficial to the development of broadcasting in Australia viewed from the interests of listeners, and apart altogether from the valuable advantages which have accrued to industry and employment. With the experience of the last nineteen years to guide us and the valuable report of the committee to point the way to certain improvements, we are well equipped to write a charter for the broadcasting services of the Commonwealth which, whilst imposing safeguards against mis-use, will permit sufficient freedom to ensure continued progress for the benefit of the community. Not only will freedom in broadcasting achieve this objective, but it must also be a significant interpretation of the general freedom that defines democracy. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators need no elaboration of the value, in the difficult times of war as well as peace, of freedom of speech, and freedom of the press. The evolution of broadcasting as a medium of. public expression, and the tremendous growth in its power to mould public opinion, has given voice to a further interpretation of democratic freedom - a freedom and impartiality of the air. . We have seen how the single regimented view of Nazi-ism and Fascism was expounded by means of the radio in Europe of the last decade, while the press of these countries was devoted to the same cause, and freedom of speech was eliminated. That is one reason why  I emphasise  the value of freedom of the air. The  provisions  of the bill now  before the Senate indicate  the  care  with  which this freedom  has been  recognized, and safeguarded. As the bill contains provisions applicable to all phases of broadcasting in Australia, it is proposed that the title of the act  be  " The Australian Broadcasting Act ". In the past it was deemed desirable to provide for the commercial services  by  regulation because such a procedure allowed of greater flexibility and permitted changes to be made more easily as they became necessary in the early stages of development. Now that the situation is more stable it is proposed that  in  future any important changes should be sanctioned by Parliament. </para>
                    <para>The bill is divided into five parts - </para>
                    <para>Part I. - Preliminary. </para>
                    <para>Part II. - Incorporating the provisions of the existing Australian Broadcasting Commission Act with appropriate amendments. </para>
                    <para>Part III. - Embodying such regulations under the Wireless Telegraphy Act as are applicable to commercial broadcasting stations. </para>
                    <para>Part IV. - Parliamentary Standing Committee on broadcasting. </para>
                    <para>Part V. - Including provisions of the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act and the Wireless Telegraphy Regulations which are applicable to both services and some important new provisions recommended by the committee. </para>
                    <para>The bill in the main is a re-enactment of the present laws relating to broadcasting. As I have already indicated, the proposed alterations to existing conditions are, with few exceptions, in conformity with the recommendations of the joint committee, and I shall now proceed to give to the Senate a brief statement of the more important changes, commencing with those which affect the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>
                    <para>Clause 7 of the bill provides for the establishment of the head office of the commission in the Australian Capital Territory on or beforea date to be fixed by the Minister. In clause 8, relating to the composition of the commission, provision is made that one of the members shall be a woman. Under clause  9  the appoint ment of commissioners will be made for certain definite periods in order to ensure stability and continuity of policy. The term of appointment of the various commissioners has been so arranged that not more than two commissioners will retire in any one year. Clause 10 provides for an increase of the remuneration of the  chairman  from £500 to £1,250 per annum, and of the vice-chairman from £400 to £500 per annum. The general manager of the commission is required by clause 16 to be present, if practicable, at all meetings but, at the discretion of the commission, he may be directed to retire temporarily from any meeting. Matters relating to the permanent staff of the commission are dealt with in clause 17. A notable change is that recruitment is to be by open competitive examination on lines similar to the practice followed in the Commonwealth Public Service. The commission will be permitted to waive this condition in respect of certain prescribed positions for which special qualifications are necessary. Conditions of employment are to be prescribed by regulations under the act. The Minister already has power to require the commission to transmit through national stations any matter the transmission of which is considered to be in the public interest, but clause 23 now provides that any such directions shall be in writing. Under clause 27.' the commission's portion of the listener's licence-fee is to be increased from 10s. to11s. per annum. The amendment proposed will increase the commission's portion of the revenue from licence-fees by approximately £66,200 per annum. The present apportionment of the fee is 10s. to the commission and 10s. to Consolidated Revenue. The alternative proposal made by the joint committee that the listener's licence-fee be increased to 21s. has been considered, but the Government considers that the present is not an opportune time to do this. </para>
                    <para>Very few changes are contemplated in regard to the conditions under which commercial broadcasting stations shall be permitted to operate. A very desirable provision is that included in clause <inline font-style="italic">69,</inline> under which advertisements on Sundays will be regulated in accordance with such conditions as are  prescribed. Under the same clause, advertisements relating to patent medicines are limited to those -which have been approved by Commonwealth or State health departments, but, in accordance with the views of the joint committee that there should be no capricious rejection of advertisements by certain classes of practitioners, provision is made for an appeal to the Minister in regard to any rejected advertisements. Under clause 75 it is provided that, each station shall submit in prescribed form an annual balance-sheet and profit and loss account. A very important innovation  is  included in Part IV., wherein provision  is  made for the appointment of a parliamentary standing committee, to . which either House of Parliament  by  resolution, or the Minister, may refer for investigation and report any matter affecting broadcasting in the Commonwealth. Provision is also made for' the standing committee to investigate such matters as may be referred to it by the Minister on request either by the Australian Broadcasting Commission or the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations. Such a committee will provide Parliament with a means of keeping a more watchful  eye  on the development of the broadcasting services. In clause 95, the Government has departed slightly from the relevant recommendation of the joint committee. The existing Australian Broadcasting Commission Act provides that the commission may appoint an advisory committee in each State, and the joint committee recommended that the appointment of the committee in each State to advise the commission regarding its  activities  should  be made mandatory on  that  body. The Government considers, however, that it would be in the best  interests of broadcasting if there were a representative advisory committee in each State to note the public reaction to broadcasting programmes and to make  any  suggestions for improvement of the  services,  both national and commercial. In these circumstances it is proposed in clause 95 that a broadcasting advisory committee should be appointed in  each  State by the Minister. Clause 96 provides for the encouragement of local talent by both national and commercial stations, which will be required to broadcast works of Australian composers for at least 2£ per cent, of the total time occupied in the transmission of music. Under clause 97 political talks must not be broadcast later than the Wednesday immediately preceding any Federal or State election. The name of each  speaker  and the political party on behalf of which he speaks must be 'disclosed. Dramatized - political broadcasts are forbidden. The commission is still permitted to determine to what extent and in what manner political speeches may be broadcast from national broadcasting stations, but, in accordance with the recommendation of the joint committee, the present practice of the commission in regard to the grant of facilities at election' times will be referred as soon as practicable to the proposed standing committee. The Senate will, I am sure, support the views expressed by the committee concerning' the broadcasting of objectionable features. It is believed that the existence of power to impose the penalties provided in clauses 9S and 99 for the broadcasting of matter which is contrary to accepted standards of propriety will act as a deterrent to those who are unmindful of the canons of good taste. Clause . 101 provides that talks on medical subjects shall not be broadcast unless they are arranged by reputable medical or other scientific authorities or approved by the Commonwealth Director-General of Health or, with his concurrence, by a State Department of Health. In the past it has been the practice to fix the fee for broadcast listeners' licences by regulation, but, as it is intended that the new Australian Broadcasting Bill should as far as practicable embrace all phases of broadcasting, clause 105 now stipulates the fee. It also makes provision for the grant of free licences, not only to the blind as at present, but also to schools with an enrolment, of fewer than 50 pupils. This clause also provides for the granting of licences at one-half of the prescribed fee to invalid and old-age pensioners living alone. Provision is also made under this clause that an additional fee - at one-half of the ordinary rate - shall be paid in respect of receivers installed in motor cars and in cases where more than' one receiver is installed in any household. </para>
                    <para>Clause 109 provides that licences for facsimile, television and frequency modulation transmissions shall not be granted except on the recommendation of the standing committee. This is a very desirable precaution, and it is in the national interest that new developments in the broadcasting field should be carefully examined before being incorporated in the broadcasting system. </para>
                    <para>Apart from the foregoing, the only important change which is proposedin the bill is that which is contained in clause 57. At present the Minister has power to revoke licences, but clause 57 gives him the right also to suspend licences for the reasons stated. The need for such a provision has long been felt, as the existing power only to revoke licences is too drastic in most instances. In paragraph 370 of its report, the committee stated- </para>

                    <para>Steps are being taken to give effect at the earliest possible date to a number of thejoint committee's proposals which do not require legislative enactment, or are not appropriate to this bill. I refer particularly to the recommendation made by the Joint Committee on Broadcasting concerning the re-opening of the negotiations between theAustralian Broadcasting Commission and the Australian Newspaper Proprietors Associution respecting news broadcasts, and the further important recommendation that there should be uniformity in the matter of the performing right fee payable by the commission and the Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations to the Australasian Performing Right Association. The Government fully supports the views expressed by the committee, but neither matter can be validly included in the bill now before the Senate. Further consideration is being given to both matters. </para>

                    <para>. -Great publicity has been given to the subject of the storage of wheat in Western Australia, and there has been a good deal of loose and erroneous thinking with regard to it. A committee consisting of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Clothier</inline> and the honorable member for Wimmera <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Wilson)</inline> visited Western Australia some months ago with a view to making a report on the storage of wheat, and since then there has been speculation as to what action the Government will take to implement the committee's report. In the meantime, there has also been much free speculation as to the actual damage being done to the wheat owing to the depredations of weevils in the wheat. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Braine,</inline> the secretary of the body dealing with the bulk-handling of wheat in Western Australia, in a recent report, has clearly indicated that the depredations of weevils are not nearly so extensive as most people thought; in fact, he has reported that they are a minor consideration as far as the effective storage of wheat .in Australia is concerned. We all realize that on  account of the shortage of shipping, and the loss of our overseas markets, the wheat-farmers of Australia are faced with a  serious  condition of affairs, and that any matter affecting the storage of wheat is a vital consideration, particularly to Western Australia, which produces a large quantity of wheat and has a very limited local market. It can be well understood that consternation was caused in the industry when a statement on this matter by the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scully)</inline> appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Wheatgrower</inline> on the 9th April last. The statement included the following remarks : - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>Without doubt the weevil problem in Westcm Australia is already serious. At Geraldton and Fremantle there are already vast weevil and lesser grain borer infestations in the bulk-heads, and no means are available foi dealing with the rapidly growing populations. One has only to see the No. 1 bulkhead at Geraldton, where, after less than a year's storage, there is a heavy 18 in. surface infestation, and the even more severe infestations in the Government Store and Commonwealth Oil Refineries Limited bulk-heads at Fremantle after eighteen months of storage, to become convinced of this. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">According to those who have special knowledge of the problem of wheat storage in Western Australia, among whom <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Brain</inline> must be included, the statement by the Minister contains a gross exaggeration, and doubts are being expressed in Western Australia as to the expert advice which the Minister received before making his statement. Growers who have approached me on this serious matter state that the quantity of wheat stored at the Commonwealth Oil Refineries bulk-heads at Fremantle was 106,936 tons, and that at the out turn the quantity of fair average quality wheat was 106,609 tons. In other words 99.7 per cent, of the wheat stored was of fair average quality. That is a direct contradiction of the statement by the Minister. There is no definite information available at the moment as to the position at the Geraldton bulk-head, or as to when that out-turn will take place, but judging from the figures available from Fremantle, the Minister's statement was erroneous. I suggest that the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> should inquire from his colleague as to the source of his advice, have the si a tennent corrected and, in addition, have the whole subject .reviewed. </para>
                <para>Recently the Minister for War Organization of Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> visited Western Australia in connexion with the gold-mining industry. Naturally, the people on the gold-fields are anxious to know what the Government intend.s to do about the .industry. Up to date, it has made no definite or real statement of its policy in the matter. I now urge it to give the subject earnest consideration and to make such an announcement as soon as possible. Following the uncertainty which has arisen as the result of recent semi-official reports of the Government's intentions many men have already left the gold-fields with the result that, in the last five or six weeks, gold production in the State has declined by about 40 per cent. Approximately one-fifth of the prosperity of Western Australia depends upon gold production : and no suitable industry is available to take its place. This decline must seriously affect the finances and internal economy of the State. I urge the Government to come to a decision regarding the industry in order to enable those now engaged in it to make necessary plans for the future. It should inform the industry exactly what demands it will make upon man-power on the gold-fields. I repeat what I said when I moved the adjournment of the Senate on this matter during the previous period of the session that engineers on the Western Australian gold-fields are amongst the finest mining engineers in the world. Their services should be employed in urgent defence undertakings such as the construction of aerodromes and strategic roads inland. I am sure that these men would readily respond to such a request for their services. They could easily organize the workers on the goldfields for the carrying out of essential war works of the kind I have mentioned. Their present duties are much more intricate than those involved in the construction of aerodromes and roads. They could carry out such works more efficiently and expeditiously than many of our military authorities who are now charged with the construction of such works. For instance, men engaged in the gold-mining industry recently constructed ah internment camp for aliens at Kalgoorlie within five days. I believe that the military authorities would have taken at least five weeks to complete that job. The Government should not hesitate to utilize the services of these capable mining engineers in war work. </para>
                <para>Another matter to which I wish to  refer is the impressment of firearms. A few months ago, a general order was issued for the impressment of arms, and many people were obliged to surrender arms which they had possessed since the last war. No payment has yet been made to the owners of these arms. It is an old business axiom that prompt payment makes good friends. I urge the Government to attend to this matter. The cost involved would not be very high. T raise the subject because many people have complained to me that they have not yet received payment. Many farmers are seeking the return of shotguns which they surrendered under impressment orders. Similar requests have also been made to the Department of the Army by various, roads boards and local government bodies in Western Australia, particularly in respect of owners who are British subjects. Farmers generally require these arms in order to keep down pests. Possession of the arms also gives to settlers in outlying places a sense of protection, and I urge the return of these arms as early as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - When the Senate adjourned some weeks ago, I spoke on a question concerning the Department of Commerce. It had reference to the Government's acquisition of the pea crop in Tasmania. As a. number of questions relating to that subject have been placed on the notice paper to-day, I shall content myself merely with referring to one important aspect of it, regarding which an explanation is due from the Government. A month ago I drew the Government's attention to the need for making a payment to the people whose pea crops had been acquired. If the growers had been allowed to sell their crops through ordinary trade channels, they would hav« received, not only a higher price, which would have .been of great moment to them, but also prompt payment. If, for instance, they had delivered their  crops  during a week, payment would have been made in cash as soon as delivery was made. I should like to hear from the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> or from some other representative of the Government, why the Government is not able to conduct this business in the way that it would have been conducted by private enterprise. I remind the Government that it is ever ready to condemn the methods of private enterprise. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">The product taken over has not been placed in a pool, and the price to be paid is not dependent on the. amount of money that will be received from sales. For all practical purposes, the transaction is an outright purchase by the Government of a product to be sent overseas. Why should there be any delay in making payment? We were advised a month ago that payment would be made. The growers have had to pay all. expenses incidental to' the growing, harvesting and marketing of their crops, but so far there is no indication as to when payment will be made. Is there any reason why the Government should not have used the brokers, who would ordinarily handle the produce, to conduct the transaction, and to make payments to the growers? The Government did the growers a great wrong by acquiring their property at a price lower than the ruling market price at the time when the pea crop was acquired. I shall not deal with that aspect this afternoon, but rather with the question of payment, which is of great moment to the growers. There is no point in withholding payment. I find, and other honorable senators find also, as we move about the country; that the Government is taking over - quite properly in a. time of emergency - various properties and businesses. It should, in such transactions, set the example for making payments as promptly as they would be made if the sales were arranged privately. There is no reason whatever, seeing that it is the outright purchaser, why it should not pay these deserving people at  once the full price due to them. It has assessed the price of the A grade crop at 15s. a bushel, and of the B grade crop at 12b. a bushel. Why. not send the growers their cheques in the ordinary business way? There is nothing difficult or complicated in the transaction, and all it calls for on the part of the Government is the same procedure that would be followed by private enterprise. The British Government, which was buying the commodity, said that it desired to do the business through the ordinary channels of trade, and if the Australian Government had decided to form a pool one could understand that final payment would depend on the results of sales. 1 shall not -say any more now except to ask the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce to see that early action is taken. </para>

                        <para>- There is nothing to show that they have. I know that some growers who sold their crops at fi a bushel have received payment through ordinary channels. The Government should apply ordinary business principles and should pay these thousands of people what is due to them. That would have settled the whole transaction, and every body would have been happy. As it is, every body is annoyed and many people have been embarrassed because of the Government's action in not dealing with the matter promptly. I urge the Government to see that this question is cleared up and that payment is made to these people without further delay. </para>

                    <para>.- There is general satisfaction in the fighting services at the public statement made by the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> that ' the Government considers that the existing Empire decorations awarded by  His  Majesty the King for bravery, provide fully for the recognition of valor, distinguished service and devotion to duty by troops in the field. Apparently, the Minister's statement was made in answer to a suggestion that Australia should have its own medal for bravery. The existing awards for bravery and distinguished service in time of war on land, on the sea, or in the air, are tangible British Empire links which the great majority of Australian citizens hope will never be broken. I understand that some recommendations for honours and awards are being dealt with at present- and will be submitted to the King for approval in due course. </para>

                <para>My attention has been drawn to the fact that numbers of men who served in the war of 1914-18 are being called up for compulsory military service. These men are prepared to serve" in the Volunteer Defence Corps or to assist in any recognized defence activity, but after having undertaken voluntarily, four years' active service in the last war, they object strongly to being compelled to serve in our defence forces now just because they are within the latest call-up age limits. They say, rightly, " Why should I be compelled to serve again when hundreds of  eligible men are sheltering in so-called reserved occupations, or have been granted exemptions on the flimsiest excuses?" The proper place for these returned men is in the Volunteer Defence Corps, but they are debarred from enlisting because they are under 45 years of age. Many members of the Volunteer Defence Corps are men under 45 years of age, who although they are exempt from military service or are engaged on essential war industries, desire to possess some military knowledge. I suggest to the Government that returned soldiers who are under the minimum age limit be accepted as members of the Volunteer Defence Corps. </para>
                <para>Hundreds of members of the Australian Military Forces have recorded their names for enrolment in the Australian Imperial Force, and I suggest that their transfer be effected, either by absorption into the existing units of the Australian Imperial Force, or by organization as first reinforcements. This would be an advantage- to the Australian Imperial Force when the time arrived, as it must do very soon, for a large-scale offensive, based on Australia. It is no use waiting until that offensive is launched against non-mandated territories before combing the Militia Forces for young men who desire to serve voluntarily in a force, the operations of which are not restricted by  the Defence Act or section 13a of the National Security Act. </para>
                <para>At question time this afternoon, I asked the Minister representing the Treasurer whether, in legislating for an increase of the invalid and old-age pension, dependants of men who gave their lives in the war of 1914-18 and the present war have been considered. In war-time, when colossal expenditure of public money in the interests of our safety and liberty as a nation is inescapable, is it a sound policy to increase pensions of any kind? There is a difference of opinion on this point, but I venture to say that there is no difference of opinion amongst the majority of Australian people that widows and widowed mothers of deceased service men who have given their all to safeguard our freedom should not be overlooked, if and when the money can be found to meet the higher costs of living. I claim  that  these people who might be in necessitous circumstances are entitled to increases of their pensions as much as invalid and old-age pensioners. Many of them have remarried, and so are no longer in need of assistance, hut 'hundreds are still battling along, rearing and educating their children, and denying themselves little extras which they require for their health and comfort. They have no big association to plead their case or to threaten the Government with action if their representations are ignored. The cost of living has increased, but the pensions of these people have remained static for some years. I ask Ministers in this chamber to use their influence with the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to see if more consideration can be given to those deserving individuals. Perhaps the omission is an oversight, because I understand that the Government intends to increase the service pension to bring it into line with the invalid and old-age pension. That is as it should be, since the service pension is the soldier's invalid -Or old-age Dension, the qualification conditions being identical. I make these suggestions hopin cr that some. pood will come from them. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to bring to the notice of the Government an anomaly which inflicts great hardship upon the wives and families of certain soldiers. The case which I shall cite is that of Private A. J. Challenger, Petrol Company, Australian Army Service Corps, 7 th Division. Private Challenger was a member of a contingent of Australian soldiers which went to England and later returned to the Middle East. I understand that, on the return trip, this soldier committed some minor offence for which he was fined and also imprisoned on the boat. When the boat arrived at Suez, he could not .be found. The payments to his wife were stopped and when the matter was taken up with the Defence Department it was stated that Private Challenger was an absentee and could not be traced.  His  wife was asked to return his paybook to the military authorities. She has one child and is not in a position to work. 1 believe that there are other cases of a similar character. I suggest .that the defence authorities should make some provision whereby payments to this woman' and to others who are left without support in similar -circumstances could continue until such .time as it is definitely ascertained' whether the soldiers concerned are dead, missing, or deserters. There are many ways in which Private Challenger could have become missing at Suez. I know of several cases in which men have been deliberately absent without leave. Immediately a man is listed as being absent without leave, payments to his wife are stopped. Recently, my attention was drawn to a case of that nature in which a woman with six children was involved. The unfortunate fact is that when a soldier is absent without leave, his wife is penalized, whereas the man himself should be penalized. My suggestion is that payments to the wife should continue, and be deducted from the soldier's pay when he returns to duty. That would have the effect of penalizing the man instead of his wife. I also ask the Government to do something to mitigate the hardship caused in cases such as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Challenger,</inline> who has been left with a child to look after and a house to pay for, without receiving any income at all. </para>

                <para>Many soldiers in Tasmania have asked me why they are not supplied with apples, when hundreds of thousands of bushels of the fruit are going to waste in the orchards. Normally, Tasmania exports about 3,000,000 bushels of Sturmer apples to England annually, but only a small percentage of that quantity will be shipped overseas this year. In many orchards, I have seen the ground literally covered with rotting fruit. My wife and the wife of the honorable member for Bass <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Barnard)</inline> have, on frequent occasions, received orders from the Apple and Pear Board permitting them to go to an orchard and collect apples free of charge for sale on behalf of the Australian Comforts Fund. Hospitals are also supplied with apples free of charge, and there is no reason why military camps should not receive similar treatment. The collection of the fruit would not throw any extra cost upon the services, because both the Army and the Air Force regularly send trucks to country centres in order to buy primary produce for camp supplies. These trucks could be used to pick up apples and distribute them to the camps in the ordinary course of their work. The people of Australia will not stand for this apple and pear racket much longer. God has blessed this country with an abundance of fruit, but it is allowed to go to waste. Something ought to be done to make proper use of this gift of nature! It would not be difficult to supply apples, not only to military camps in Tasmania but also to camps on the mainland, instead of allowing them to go to waste. The apples belong to the Government, and there is nothing to prevent it from doing as I suggest. </para>
                <para>I now make a plea on behalf of female employees of the Commonwealth Bank of Australia. Many of these worthy women are now doing counter work which is usually done by men. They are expected to wear uniforms consisting of navy blue skirts and white blouses, whereas the men are not required to wear uniforms and. can wear their old clothes if they want to do so. The necessity for providing uniforms imposes a hardship upon these women. This regulation should be cancelled, or, at least they should be allowed to wear some other colour in place of navy blue. If the bank wants to be patriotic it could let them wear red, white and blue, but at any rate it should relieve them of the obligation to provide their own uniforms. </para>
                <para>On the 25th March, 1942, I asked the Minister representing the Treasurer what' amount had been paid to radiologists in the Southern Command for carrying out X-ray examinations of members of the fighting services since the commencement of hostilities, and to whom that money had been paid? I expected then that an answer would be supplied to me by letter during the parliamentary recess, but so far I have not received one, and I should like the Minister to reply to my question as soon as possible. </para>
