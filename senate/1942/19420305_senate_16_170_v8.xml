            <para>- Has the Leader of the Senate read two statements which appeared in the Adelaide <inline font-style="italic">News</inline> of the 2nd March last, in one of which the Minister for Munitions made an appeal in connexion with the &#163;35,000,000 Liberty Loans? The other statement was made by the Minister for Labour and National Service, who said that the people of Australia should not be asked to pay for the war afterwards by paying interest on any loans that were raised now. If so, will the Leader of the Senate inform the Senate whether the views expressed by the Minister in this matter are shared by other members of the Common wealth Government; whether he will give to the Senate, for the benefit of the people of Australia, an assurance that the undertaking of the Government in connexion with interest on this loan, as announced by the Prime Minister, will be observed ; and whether an assurance will be given that the Government will not bo influenced by the statement by the Minister that interest should not be paid ? </para>

          <para>SenatorCOLLINGS. - I have not seen the particular newspaper paragraphs to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred,but I have read the statements in other newspapers. I presume, also, that the Leader of the Opposition has seen the definite statement by the Prime Minister on the matter. There is therefore no- &#39;occasion for any further comment by me. </para>

              <para>- In view of the answer given by the Leader of the Senate, I now ask him whether he has seen a statement in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> of the 5th March, in which the Minister for Aircraft Production agrees with the Minister for Labour and National Service, and states that the Minister was merely expressing a view which has been voiced countless times by the Labour party? If the Leader of the Senate has read this press report, does the Government intend to issue a statement disclaiming the opinions of both Ministers referred to, and assuring the people of Australia that subscribers to Government loans will be entitled to interest, as has always been the case? </para>

          <para>. - I should like the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> to state the reasons for the frequent extensions of time for the presentation of the report of this committee, as it has had a long time in which to make its investigation. I regret exceedingly that the committee did not visit Western Australia, particularly as the representatives of that State have been insistent that its broadcasting service, particularly in respect of technical matters associated with the telephone line from South Australia to Western Australia, should be improved. Apparently, the committee has not had time to visit Western Australia to investigate this and other matters; but should the period for the presentation of its report be prolonged I suggest that the committee should pay a visit to Western Australia before submitting its report. </para>

          <para>.- Obviously^ <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald has no &#39; conception of the magnitude of the work which the Broadcasting Committee has done, otherwise he would not have made the suggestions which he has voiced this afternoon. It is true that the committee did not visit Western Australia, but it is equally true that the whole committee did not visit any of the other States. Nevertheless the committee heard a lot of evidence on behalf of Western Australia, and when its report is presented the honorable senator will see that that State has not been overlooked. The committee has completed its investigations, and had the Parliament not assembled until the 11th March, as was intended, its report would have been ready to table on that date. The earlier meeting of the &#34; Parliament has meant that the committee has not had sufficient time to present its report, even in typewritten form. The report, which is long and comprehensive, is really a compendium on broadcasting from the time that I convened the first meeting of the committee in Melbourne until the present day. </para>

          <para>I take this opportunity to remind the Senate once again of the enormous powers which have been given by Parliament to the Executive since the outbreak of thewar, and also to emphasize the duty devolving upon all honorable senators in considering the regulation issued under the National Security Act. Since the 1st January approximately 100 statutory rules have been gazetted, and many of those rules contain a number  of  regulations. I have been advised on sound legal authority that, whilst the Senate may disallow a regulation under a statutory rule, it cannot disallow part of a regulation under a statutory rule. In view of the wide powers now possessed by the Executive, and having regard to the number of regulations which arc being gazetted, every opportunity should be afforded the Senate to give full consideration to these regulations. I personally intend to oppose strenuously any regulation which I think will not help  our  war effort  or  will do serious injustice to the people as a whole. Of course, it is the duty of every honorable senator to approach these regulations in that way/ Parliament should meet as regularly as possible in order to give us the opportunity to consider these regulations most carefully. Some regulations have been in operation for a considerable time, yet we have not had an opportunity to pass judgment on them. Evenhonorable senators opposite will admit that many regulations gazetted recently were prepared rather hurriedly. I protest also against the action of certain Ministers, or who ever is responsible, in not laying on the table of the Senate at the earliest possible moment certain important regulations promulgated in the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Gazette.</inline></para>
          <para>In moving that regulation 27B be disallowed, I draw the attention of the Senate in the first place to the objectionable nature of that regulation, which, to me, savours of vicious discrimination between employer and employee. Regulation 27A provides first of all that - </para>

          <para>In a recent amendment, the word &#34; Commission &#34; was substituted far Commissioner &#34;. I have no objection to the placing of that power in the hands of the commission. I do not propose to read the regulation any farther, but honoraible senators will realize thai, should an employer refuse to observe the conditions laid down in the regulation, he is subject to a fine and certain other penalties. However, regulation 27b provides that when a coal-mine is open for the purpose of its operation in the manner in which it is usually operated, and the committee of . management of any organization of employees in the coal-mining industry has directed members of the organization to work at the mine, any person who refuses to attend shall be dealt with by the management committee of the union concerned. Surely, if it is right that the commission should have power over the owners, it is also right t hat it should have control over the employees. I cannot remember any regulation such a? this having been passed through Parliament in recent years. I cannot understand how responsible people canthinkit fit and. proper to place such authorityinthehands of the  president,  secretary and committee of management of a union, these officers having been appointed by the coal-miners themselves. It is too ludicrous for words. It is quite obvious that if such a committee ordered the coal-miners back to work, or ordered them to do anything not acceptable to them, the coal-miners would see that member? of the committee were disciplined when they came up for re-election. Those of us who have had an opportunity of watching the course of events in various coal-mining unions realize how jealously the president,secretary and committee members have to guard their statements and actions, because they depend on the votes of the miners if they wish to be re-elected upon the expiration of their term of office. </para>

              <para>- First of all, it displays vicious discrimination. The regulation provides that the commission shall deal with the employers, but that the unions themselves shall deal with the employees. The union committee of managementhas power to direct men to soback to work, and if they refuse to obey. they may be expelled from the organization in accordance with section 2 of the regulation. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>My second objection to regulation 27b is that it smells of political pandering to union executives who are supporters of the Labour party and of the Labour Government. There can be no doubt about that. I suggest to the Government that the people of Australia are becoming tired of reading day after day, following statements by responsible Ministers about alleged total mobilization, that it is necessary to consult the Australasian Council of Trade Unions or some other outside body of unionists in. order to see whether or not the action proposed by the Government is acceptable to such bodies. The people are quite right in claiming that in times such as these the Government should govern and should not be dictated to by outside interests. I have no hesitation in saying that if one looks at these regulations carefully and fairly, one can come to no other conclusion about them. </para>
          <para>Mythird objection to this regulation is that it means&#39; political interference with the work of the Arbitration Court, lt is an attempt on the part of the Government to appease the extremists in the trade union movement and to undermine the power vested in the Arbitration Court. All political parties favour arbitration, and I suggest that the umpire&#39;s decision should be taken as final. I warn the Government that if it continues this policy of appeasement and political interference, those whom it tries to appease will bite the hand that feeds them. There is ample evidence of that in the reports appearing in the press from day to day. </para>

      <para>The fourth objection to the regulation is that it has failed to prevent strikes. This unsatisfactory regulation was promulgated on the 9th January. 1942. On the 8th January, the Prime Minister threatened that the Government would take drastic action unless the mines were re-opened at once. On the 9th January, he made his now famous statement, &#34; The coal-miners must work or fight&#34;. &#34;We all know that many young men, who were formerly outside the coal-mining industry and who should be fighting for their country, have taken the opportunity to secure employment in the mines in order to shelter themselves, and that they are doing the work which married men and older men have been called upon by the Government to do. On the 17th February, the Prime Minister said, &#34;All resources, human and material, will be mobilized&#34;. On tinsame day, five coal-mines, were idle in spite of the provision of regulation 27n. What action did the union committer take on that occasion? On the 25th February, it was reported that the Prime Minister had telephoned <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scanlon,</inline> the Northern Miners&#39;  president,  thai immediate action must be taken to secure continuity of production. That wa.= merely a repetition of what he had said on the 8th January. Then, despite bhp fact that the Prime Minister&#39;s threats had been ignored and that the regulation promulgated on the 9th January had been laughed at by the miners&#39; executive and ridiculed by the extremists, it was reported that an absenteeism regulation would be introduced so that nobody would have discretionary power to shield strikers from the consequences of their actions. That absenteeism regulation has been promulgated. I am not aware whether it overrides regulation 27b, but, in any case, we have been forced to the conclusion that regulation 27b has failed, and that, therefore, the Prime Minister has failed to carry out his threat. Thi.= unsatisfactory position has existed for over two months in spite of the fact that we are at war. I hope that, when it has considered the points which. I have mentioned, the Senate will decide, that it would be justified in &#39; disallowing regulation 27n. </para>

          <para>.- It is  unnecessary to draw attention to  the  fact that it is quite competent for any honorable senator to move for the disallowance of a regulation. Therefore, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> need not have occupied any time in apologizing for the action which he has taken. It would be advisable for me to read regulation 27b at this stage, because that is the only regulation involved  in  the motion now before  the  Chair- If I may do so with due deference to you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> I suggest that it is distinctly out of order for any body to attempt, as the Leader of the Opposition did  at  various stages of his remarks, to refer to matters other than those concerned by regulation 27b. </para>

            <para>- I am glad to have that assurance, but I considered that his reference to the waterside workers could not, by any suggestion of expediency, have been related to regulation 27b, which deals with coal-miners. Apparently the Leader of the Opposition took legal advice on this subject, but he came here very ill prepared. In order that there may be no misapprehension about the subject of this debate, I shall road regulation 27b, which is as follows : -  27b.  - ( 1.)  When a coal mine is open for the purpose of its operation in the manner in which it is usually operated and the duly constituted committee of management of any organization of employees in the coal-mining industry has directed, instructed, counselled or otherwise advised the members of the organization, who are, or were, prior to the giving of the direction, instruction, counsel or advice, actually or usually employed at the coal mine, to work at the coal mine, any person who is or was so employed shall not, without reasonable excuse (proof whereof shall lie upon him), refuse or fail to attend for work at the coal mine at the customary place and at the customary times or to work at the coal mine during the hours for which he is required or for which it is usual for employees of his classification, to work at the coal mine. (2.) If any person commits a contravention of the provisions of the last preceding subregulation then, in addition to any penalty which may be imposed on him in respect of that contravention, the duly constitutedcommitteeof management of any organization to which he belongs may expel him from membership of the organization. </para>

The parties, to which honorable senators opposite belong have, down the ages, sought to clamp down regulations on the workers, and only to the extent that the Labour party has had  power has it been possible to prevent them from carrying all ot their vicious designs into practice. Let us ask ourselves what regulation 27n seeks to accomplish.. It seeks to accomplish, a most desirable thing - &#62;a greater and more continuous production of coal. To the degree that the  Primo  Minister has used his influence with the miners, he has .been so successful that I am able to declare to the Senate and to the people of this country that the greatest output of coal in the history of coal-mining in Australia has been achieved this year. </para>

Why have we clamped down &#39; heavily on all those industries that are unnecessarily consuming coal? Why have we &#39;asked motorists to fix producer-gas unite to their oars? Why has the Government taken a lead in this matter by providing as many producer-gas units as possible for departmental cars? The answer is that <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> use of  petrol,  where its use can be avoided, operates against the war effort.

        <para>Why has, the Government promulgated the various regulations to which the Leader of the Opposition has referred?

As the days have lately  become more  dark and distressful, it has become more necessary than ever for the Government to promulgate regulations to meet new situations as they arise; but the Senate has never been deprived of its right to review them. On listening to the Leader of the Opposition, one would imagine that the Government had done something of an unprecedented nature which was little short of a crime. It should be realized that events of the utmost significance occur overnight. In this fearful war, which is now being brought right into the homes of the people, and right into the departments of some of the members of the Government in this chamber, it is sometimes necessary to promulgate regulations at a moment&#39;s notice, in order to prevent disaster succeeding disaster. The Leader of the Opposition has assured us that he has taken legal advice as though it i.= possible, under war conditions, for the Senate to proceed calmly with the discussion of a. motion of this kind. Cannot the Opposition realize that everything being done by the Government is designed to make the wheels of industry run smoothly. Ministers desire so to lubricate the industrial machinery that it will operate more continuously and effectively than ever before, yet the greatest contribution that the Opposition is able to make in the direction of assisting the Government is to throw sand into the works. -I regret to have to say this, hut the kind of speech made by the Leader of the Opposition in introducing the motion is the most effective fifth column work of which I can -conceive, at a time when all of us ought to be devoting every ounce of the energy at our disposal to the task of achieving victory. I remember what the Leader of the  Opposition  said last week, and I noted then the same shameful indifference to the facts of war that  we  have witnessed to-day. </para>

            <para>- Oh, no ! There might have been something to be said in favour of the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition, had he said, &#34; We understand the intention behind this regulation, and we know the seriousness of the position. We realize that one of Australia&#39;s greatest needs is a continuous production of coal. We do not ask that the regulation be disallowed, but suggest that another clause be added in order to make it more effective for the purpose for which it is designed. Yet the Opposition contends that all that is necessary to bring about maximum production in the coal industry is to disallow the regulation. The Leader of the Opposition has referred to a number of newspaper reports.I also have a number of clippings from newspapers. One states that when a workman was killed in the Bulli mine his mates stopped work! The Leader of the Opposition does not know much about the coal industry, but I have lived amongst coal-miners, and I understand their conditions. It has always been a traditional procedure in connexion with coal-mining activities for the employees to cease work for the day as a mark of respect to their dead mate, in the event of a fatality occurring in a mine. Members of this chamber stand in their places for a few moments when invited to do so by you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as a mark: of respect to the memory of a deceased senator or ex-senator, but the miners are vilified in the press for a similar action. </para>

        <para>It is of not the slightest use for honorable senators opposite to try to buttress their claims by cuttings from the press, because it is possible to provide other newspaper extracts in rebuttal of all such claims. The Leader of the Opposition knows that I am sincere in this matter. Although we are political opponents we have never had hard words. I am sorry for him in having submitted this motion, which is of vital importance and which he is perfectly entitled to submit. Yet he did notmention one part of the regulation in question or give one sound argument why it should be disallowed. He did not show that greater coal production would result if the regulation were disallowed. He closed his eyes to the fact that greater production had followed as a result of the operation of the regulation. I suggest, with all respect, that if the Leader of the Opposition has any abler debaters than himself, he should call on them to support the motion and attempt to supply reasons why the regulation should be disallowed. </para>

          <para>.  - I stand almost aghast at the ferocity with which the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has attacked the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay).</inline> I should have thought that regulation 27b contained in itself sufficient reason for the Opposition to take certain steps, because it must be obvious to all what the Government desires to accomplish and also the objectionable means by which it seeks to achieve its objective. In the earlier part of this statutory rule, the Government has imposed certain obligations upon owners of coal-mines. I hold no brief for them, but I point out that in their case the consent of an officer of high standing is necessary before they may do certain things. In respect of the employees in the coal-mining industry, however, the Government has placed the control in the hands of an organization to which it refers in guarded terms. There is reference to the &#34; duly constituted committee of management of any organization of employees in the coalmining industry&#34;. </para>

            <para>- The ferocity of the Leader of the Senate is simulated. I once had a Scotch terrier which barked savagely when visitors approached the house, but he was in fact the most kindly disposed of all Scotch terriers - and all Scotch terriers are kind. If the Leader of the Senate be sincere in asking for suggestions, it would be well if members of the Opposition were to accept his offer. I cannot think that any government should deliberately stand for one law for one class and another law for another class of the community. I now ask the Government to agree to confer with the Leader of the Opposition and some of his supporters, in regard to these matters. I realize the difficulties associated with the control of the coal-mining industry in this country. I know that it was without propercontrolling tribunals for a number of years, and that there was a lamentable lack of understanding on the part of many members of my own profession of matters associated with coal-mining. But if control is to be placed in the hands of persons who are familiar with the industry, those persons should not be dependent on the votes of those whom they control. Whatever tribunal is set up should be quasi-judicial. I make that suggestion in response to the appeal of the Leader of the Senate. Unfortunately trouble in the coal-mining industry in Australia is no new thing, but I cannot congratulate the Government on the way in which it has set out to act firmly in&#39; connexion with this industry. The Leader of the Senate spoke of the Government&#39;s action towards arbitration. </para>

            <para>- If the honorable senator cannot distinguish between what is proposed in respect of the owners of coal-mines and the proposals in respect of employees in the coalmining industry, I cannot help him. But I see in this regulation an intrusion upon our political faith which is most undesirable. On other occasions I have seen regulations which have left in the public mind a feeling of uneasiness, because of the belief that by means of regulations the Government of the day was seeking to give effect to its own party platform. I do not accuse the present Government of doing that, although I find fault with some of. its regulations. However, when there is a belief that theunderlying principles . of our legislation and of our understanding of justice are in danger, it is time for. the parties to come together. The&#39; Leader of . the Senate has pointed out the urgency of these regulations. It is not . reasonable to allow a man to be judge in. his own cause, particularly if he be dependent for his livelihood on the votes of the people with whom he has to deal. It is extraordinary that that view did not occur to some of the advisers of the Government. Any power which the Government requires in order to enable the coal-mining industry to function 100 per cent should be given to it; but nothing can justify lopsided control of this kind. I regret to have to say it, but it seems to <inline font-style="italic">me</inline> that this regulation is the price demanded by the miners. If we have reached a stage when legislation can be demanded as the price to satisfy any section of industry, it is time that democratic government in this country was ended. I shall not be a party to such legislation. There must be no bargaining of this kind on the part of the Government with any section of industry. Men who will not return to work should be spoken to in the terms used by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> when he told both the owners and the miners that they must get back to work. The public and, I am sure, Parliament as a whole, were behind the Prime Minister when he uttered those words; but the public would not support this legislation if they fully understood it. </para>

            <para>- Probably it will be tested; and if mob rule should win the day, it will be all the worse for Australia. I sincerely urge the Government to devise fairer means to overcome the difficulties existing in the industry. Short of control of&#39; this kind, I have not the slightest doubt that every member of tie Opposition will : wholeheartedly support any effort by the Government to deal with the problems of the industry. The Government, must realize that the Opposition has no desire to hamper it in any way. We have not objected to many other regulations although they violate every . political principle for which we stand. Recently a regulation, which was drafted hurriedly, was referred by the Government to a joint committee. Cannot a similar course be followed in respect of this regulation, with a view to devising a fairer means of control? This regulation is valueless from a judicial point of view, and it is a. disgrace to any legislature. </para>

Does the honorable senator forget the numerous occasions on which members of the Opposition have swallowed their political principles in order to stand behind the Government in the present emergency?

I could not help but admire the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> when he introduced this strain into the debate; and I appreciate very much his gesture in holding out the olive branch to the Leader of the Opposition which I think the latter, in the light of existing circumstances, should accept, with a view to securing the withdrawal of this regulation in order to permit of a fairer means of control being devised. </para>

          <para>. -  I have listened with interest to the speeches of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan ; but I have yet to learn that this regulation is of sufficient importance to take precedence over other urgent business which should now be occupying the attention of all of us. Almost down the ages, one might say, trouble has occurred in the coal-mining industry. In bringing down this regulation the Government has, in effect, sought to grease the skids for the more effective working of the industry. Regulation 27a provides certain penalties in respect of breaches by the employers. The Leader of the Opposition has objected to regulation 27b on the ground that it treats the employees leniently. I point out that regulation 27b provides for two penalties in respect of employees. One of those is most severe as any honorable senator who knows anything at all about trade unionism will recognize. As members of a trade union, the men elect a committee of management to deal- with the operations of the colliery in which they work. If no such committee existed, with whom would the management confer in the event of a hold-up in any mine? Obviously, in drafting this regulation, the Government has been guided by the scheme actually in operation in the mines, so far as dealings between the miners and the owners are concerned. In addition to incurring the penalties prescribed by the act, any miner who commits a breach of this regulation becomes liable to the greatest degradation that can be placed upon a trade unionist, namely, expulsion from his union. Those who declare that the regulation is unfair have not examined it. As all of us know, the coal industry is a troublesome industry. Recently we have effected some improvements in it, but the history of the industry is, to say the least, malodorous. </para>

            <para>- I do not know; but it has been enacted in order to place some effective check on people who hold up the industry unnecessarily. Honorable senators generally know that I stand 100 per cent, for unionism. At the same time I have invariably preached and practised efficiency in trade unionism. In war-time the trade unionists are prepared to stand beside the nation. The ex-Ministers for Munitions and Aircraft Production will agree with that statement. The coal industry to-day is contributing more than its normal share to the welfare of this country. We realize that fact when we remember that the miners are working longer hours than they have ever worked  before.  That, of course, applies to the workers in many industries, of the majority of whom we hear nothing. We hear very little, for instance, about the efforts of our railway men ; but they are probably doing more than any other section for the success of our war effort. As the Leader of  the  Opposition and his colleagues  are represented  on a body which is assisting  the  Government to prosecute the war,  it  is  wrong for them to intrude this matter in this way. When I and my colleagues were in opposition, we gave full support ro every measure  brought down by the government of the day. I was going to =ay that the Opposition, apparently, does not want any regulations; but I do not really believe that that is so. However, I remind the Leader of the Opposition in reply to his advocacy that every regulation should be fully considered by this Parliament, that when we made the same request to the Government of which he was o member, no notice was taken of ns. At that time, Parliament did not meet regularly, because Ministers had a full-time joh in attending to their respective departmental duties. At the same lime, hundreds of regulations were enacted without Parliament being given mi opportunity to consider them. This regulation was gazetted on the 9 th  January  last. I urge the Leader of the Opposition to allow it to stand. Should the position in the industry worsen, we shall then consider the framing of a more effective regulation. This regulation was il rafted with the sole intention of enabling the industry to work more smoothly. Probably it has not, been so successful as we had hoped ; but in those circumstances I take the human point of view. Any honorable senator who has  studied  the industry realizes that it has many, annoying hold-ups. That is the experience of the industry throughout the world. At the same time, it is difficult to find a more courageous class of men than coal-miners. That fact is demonstrated in every mine disaster. T do not know of better Australians who have a dirtier or a harder job. I say that, not as a coal-miner, but from my general industrial experience. Indeed, if any one wanted me to dig for coal, they would have to pay me five times as much as  coal-miners  now receive. Experience has shown that any legislation which prescribes penalties, whether it be enacted hy a Labour or a non-Labour government, i.s never effective. Penalties are prescribed in this regulation, but the direst penalty is placed not on the owner, but on the miner. Any miner who absents himself from work renders himself liable to expulsion from his union. The Leader of the Opposition declared, and, to my amazement, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A-</inline> J- McLachlan supported his statement, that this regulation runs counter to our arbitration law. I have heard nothing in this debate to show that this is the case. Honorable senators must  be aware that the committees prescribed do not have the final say; that disputes may ultimately be referred to a tribunal. This regulation consequently does not run counter to our arbitration law. I challenge contradiction on that point. In the first place, the coal-miners at no time came under the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. They have a special tribunal dating back to the last war. The Hibble tribunal was formed in 1918 to fix wages and conditions in the coal-mining industry, but it was not on the same lines as the Commonwealth Arbitration Court. It was found inadequate to deal with disputes in war-time. To-day both Federal and State machinery exists for dealing with disputes, and there is no warrant for any hold-up in production. Let us retain the arbitration machinery now in operation in the mining industry. To my mind, regulations such as this do not interfere with any principle of arbitration. The trade union movement has made huge concessions m the past two years to me*&#62;* the pressing needs of the war. On that point I challenge any contradiction. Never for a moment did I think that I should live to see the day when there would be dilution of labour and other such tremendous changes, but these things have come to pass, and rightly so because they are necessary in the interests of the people. </para>
          </talk.start>
        </continue>
        <para>In conclusion, I strongly urge that this regulation be not interfered with. It is one of a series of regulations and there has been no complaint from the coalowners. In fact the production of coal is on the increase, and I believe that difficulties in the mining industry will solve themselves in the face of the deplorable prospect now confronting us. Probably in the near future the Leader of the Opposition and myself will not be talking of industrial disputes, but rather of going the whole hog, and seeing that this country is protected 100 per cent, by means of co-operation between employers and employees in this industry. </para>

          <para>- I assure the Senate that I have a very real sense of responsibility in supporting the motion for the disallowance of this regulation. I realize, as does every other honorable senator, the critical position that faces this country. Consequently I give an. assurance that this motion has not been moved in any flippant mood, but because we believe that the regulation complained of constitutes a real injustice and does not preserve equity between various classes of the community. 1 was interested to hear the reply by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> to the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> and to note the points which the Minister raised in rebuttal of the case placed before the Senate by my leader. At no time did the Minister touch upon the crux of the objection to this regulation.&#39; He tried to justify it by saying that it had been successful, but I suggest that he pays no tribute to the patriotism of the coal-miners if he considers that it was the influence of this regulation which enabled him to state, as he did, that all the coal-mines in Australia were working to-day. Surely the Leader of the Senate will admit that the coal-miners too, have a sense of responsibility. Indeed, I have no hesitation in faying that at least 98 per cent, and probably 99 per cent, of them have a very full sense of responsibility, and had they been permitted to express it by carrying out their wishes, there would have been fewer strikes. The real point about this regulation is this: I agree that under the stress and urgency of war-time conditions when Ministers are striving to the utmost to carry out their administrative work it is quite possible that, without any deliberate intention to injure any particularsection of the community, for a regulation, to bo issued which does create an anomalous situation. Therefore, I do not think we need consider this regulation in any heated spirit. We merely wish to point out to the Government that it is completely wrong for one tribunal to adjudicate for one section of an industry, and an entirely different body to adjudicate for another section. Quite frankly, I admit that I am not nearly so conversant with all the . ramifications of the coal-mining industry as are many honorable senators, but during my brief term as Minister for Supply and Development, the first coal commission to be constituted since the war began was set up. In doing that, we did what we thought was the proper thing; we consulted both owners and miners, and 3 should like to pay a tribute to the helpful attitude which was displayed by the miners&#39; representatives on any occasion on which I met them. I say also that with my lack of general knowledge of coalmining, conditions which I found to exist in that industry appalled me. Consequently, I was not surprised at the frequency of disturbances and disputes. However, the Menzies Government also recognized that fact, and, in consultation with various interests, it set up local reference boards and a central reference board which, in addition to the Arbitration Court, would be on the spot to settle disputes as they arose. I have no quarrel with this Government if it feels that some additional tribunal is necessary. . I assure the Leader of the Senate that with regulation 27a, providing for control over the coal-owners, I have no dispute at all, and if the Government considers that some authority should be set up to consider whether or not disputes in the coal-mining industry are of sufficient substance to cause a strike, I still have no quarrel, but I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> j. McLachlan that to use a committee which is composed of partisans representing one section only is completely&#39; improper. I am sure that the people of this country will agree that with the tribunals already . in existence for the immediate consideration of disputes, at this critical time in our history there is no dispute of sufficient magnitude to cause a strike in the coal-mining industry. If the Leader of the Government is in a conciliatory frame of mind with regard to this&#39; regulation, and the Government feels that, this power should be given &#39;to some authority- </para>

We contend that a tribunal consisting of one representative of the coal-miners, one representative of the owners, and an independent chairman should be a competent body, and if it is reasonable for that body to control the coal-owners surely it is only equitable that the same authority control the coal-miners. </para>

            <para>- The Leader of the Senate, who apparently has had voluble legal advice on this matter, should realize that that power is given by implication. The regulation provides, in effect, that the miners are not running counter to the National Security Act if they go on strike, unless this tribunal has ordered them back to work. So, by implication, if the tribunal does not order the miners back to work they are not contravening the regulations if they go on strike. I appeal to the Government to realize that, whether by intention or otherwise, the effect of this regulation is inequitable. If that discrimination &#39;were not intended, then honorable senators opposite should support the motion for the disallowance of the regulation, and should substitute one which carries out their intentions. So farI have heard nobody on the Government side of the chamber say that that was the intention. </para>

        <para>Finally, the Leader of the Senate told us that coal production was at its highest level in the history of the industry.I am very pleased to hear that, because we have heard reports which indicated the contrary. I know from my own personal knowledge that supplies of coal in South Australia have not been the best in the history of the industry, and, in fact, have been considerably smaller than they shouldhave been in this time of emergency. There is no need for us to become heated on this subject. The Opposition has made its position clear. I appeal to the Government, since it did not intend to conferupon the committees of management the powers that are conferred upon them by this regulation, to agree to the motion for the disallowance of regulation 27b, and to promulgate a regulation which does carry out its intention. </para>

          <para>. -  Apparently, there is some confusion about the meaning of regulation 27b. Honorable senators opposite have endeavoured to read into it some threat of interference with our arbitration system, which is entirely wrong. Why did the Government promulgate this regulation? In the first place, it wantedto bring about the maximum production of coal, which is the desire of all parties represented in this chamber. We have not had a 100 per cent, production in the industry, although I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> that stocks of coal in South Australia to-day are higher than they have ever been. </para>

        <para>SenatorFRASER. - I am coming to that, and I shall give the honorable senator some information of which he is not aware. I cannot see that regulation 27b interferes in any way with regulation 27a. It merely gives to a committee of management certain powers to discipline its own members. The Opposition wishes to see a 100 per cent, production in the coal industry. Therefore, I ask whether it will be prepared to support the regulation if it has achieved that objective. For that is what the regulation has done. Every coal-mine in the Commonwealth is working to-day. In this connexion, I pay a tribute to the Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley),</inline> whose energy and determination played a great part in achieving full production. </para>

            <para>- The Opposition is endeavouring to embarrass this Government. It says that it wishes to disallow this regulation in order to achieve the very purpose . which the regulation has effected. What would have happened if this regulation had not been introduced? If the Government had taken the recalcitrant miners to court, and fined them or put them into prison for failing to work, would&#39; that have brought about, a 100 per cent, production in the industry? Of course, it would not have done so. Yesterday the Miners Federation, using the powers conferred upon it by regulation 27b. fined some of its members &#163;5 each. </para>

            <para>-I withdraw it. and say that if, prior to the introduction of this regulation, there was not a 100 per cent, production of coal in this country, and if the regulation has brought about a 100 per cent, production, the Opposition should withdraw any objection to it. Despite any suggestions that the Government has been intimidated by &#34; the big stick &#34; and forced to temporize over the manner in which the regulation should be applied, the fact that it has brought about a 100 per cent production justifies its existence. We all admit that industrial upheavals occur from time to time in the coal-mining industry. That state of affairs is not foreign&#39; to other countries even in war-time. The regulation simply empowers the Miners Federation to fine its members for failing to work and, in the event of a second offence, to expel them from membership. The Leader of the Opposition has said that  he wants peace in the industry and a 100 per cent, production. In the light of the facts as I have stated them, I ask him to withdraw his motion. </para>

            <para>.-I make no apology for indulging in an attack upon regulation 27b. The Senate, in days such as these, has a very important and responsible job to perform in supervising regulations which the Government enacts. The Government has been given the widest possible powers in order to enable it effectively and rapidly to enact laws for the prosecution of the war effort. Any regulation which it introduces and which, in my opinion, is designed for that purpose, will always have my support. But when I find that the Government&#39;s power is being exercised unjustly or in circumstances which suggest that it is being used for political purposes, I shall oppose such regulations. The Leader of the Senate must excuse me if I am a little suspicious of this particular regulation. I am suspicious as to the reason which actuated the form which it takes. The suspicion arises from the fact that this statutory rule deals with two offences of an exactly similar character. Regulation 27a says to the owners, &#34; You shall not, without the consent of the commission, fail to keep the mine open &#34;. </para>

              <para>- I do not object to that. This regulation does not provide that an employer shall keep a mine open if the Employers Federation or the directors of a mining company say that he shall do so. The obligation is upon him to keep the mine open, and the only way in which he can escape that obligation is by obtaining the consent of the commission. I do not disagree with that. All i suggest is that what is to be found in regulation 27a applied to the owners should also be found in 27B applied to the employees. </para>

              <para>- That is quite a separate matter. Regulation 27B creates a new offence under the National Security Act, and the penalty for that offence is by way of fine or imprisonment. If a coal-mine owner does not keep his mine open, he is liable to a penalty. In that set of circumstances, it is only just that precisely the same offence should be created in the case of the employee. </para>

              <para>- No. I am suspicious of it because its terms suggest that the Government was not game to introduce the same offence for the employees as for the employers. I deplore the fact that, under war conditions, I find that for some political reason not yet fully explained the Government has created a different kind of offence in the case of. employers from that provided in the case of employees. It has been suggested by the Minister for External Territories that, as the result of these regulations,&#39; employee organizations are imposing fines on their members. There is nothing in these regulations which gives power to the committee of management&#39; of any trade union to impose fines on its members. </para>

              <para>- All I am concerned with is that a regulation which deals with employees in a manner different from that in which it deals with employers should not be allowed to pass without discussion. In view of its injustice, I believe that it should be disallowed. Although I do not suggest that the whole regulation should be disallowed, the Opposition has no remedy but to move for its disallowance. There is a way out of the difficulty if the Ministry is prepared to meet the Opposition, but as long as the Government promulgate? regulations which are open to the criticism that they give effect to its political policy rather than to the advancement of the war effort, those regulations will meet with my opposition. I suspect that the form of regulation 27b is dictated by political considerations, and that the only reason why the Government will not make the commission a body which is to direct members of unions to go back to work is that it sees difficulties with its own. supporters. </para>

              <para>- Exactly, the object was to ensure continuous . production. Cessation of work should in each case be with the consent of the commission.I have the strongest objection to a regulation which, in effect, puts into the hands of the committee of management of a  union, the power to determine whether  a  strike shall be legal or not. Let us assume that a number of men are on strike. The committee of management meets and can do one of two things. It can direct the members of the union to go back to work - if it does so, regulation 27.il will operate; but it may not direct the men to return to work. The regulation provides that there shall be an offence for not working if the committee of management says that the men must work, but there is no offence under the regulation in the case where the men are on strike and the committee of management refuses to direct them to go back to work. </para>

              <para>- There is  a  penalty for not working only where a committee of management directs the men to work. The plain objection to that is that the committee of management is largely controlled by the large body of unionists. For the purpose of this argument, I am assuming that the men are not working, and it is plain that they can continue to refuse to work without being liable to a penalty unless the committee of management says that they must work. </para>

            <para>. - I  propose to introduce a fresh point into the discussion in order to show that the position is not exactly what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> would have us believe. Theoretically, the commission is based upon the principle of equity - there are representatives of the mine-owners and of employees in the coal-mining industry, with  a <inline font-weight="bold">chairman</inline> who is supposed to be impartial. When a decision is arrived at .by that tribunal, it would appear from what has been said by some honorable senators that that is all that can be done. But the Opposition has not told us that the management of the mine has the sole right to say in what way effect shall be given to the decision of the tribunal That is where the tribunal is unbalanced and one-sided, and obviously in favour of the mine-owners, to the detriment of the employees in the industry. It is because of the ways in which awards of the court and decisions of tribunals similar to the coal-mining tribunal have been administered that so many industrial disputes have arisen in this country. We shall never have equity unless the miners working in the industry have rights similar to those enjoyed by the owners, who are now able to say in what way effect shall be given to the decisions of the tribunal. The mine-owner never consults the miners as to who shall be &#34; hired and fired &#34; or as to whether this or that shall he done. There are managements which are provocative and whose one desire is to defeat the decisions of the tribunal. On paper, it would seem that such managements are always right and the employees always wrong. In the belief that the management of the coal-mines is always right lies the cause of 95 per cent, of the disputes in the coal-mining industry. .1 admit that some managements are tolerant and will listen to representations by employees, but there are other managements which are uncompromising and will not listen to the workers. On the contrary, they seize every opportunity to force their views on the employees, and to pursue a provocative policy, and then to make it appear that the miners have disregarded a decision of the tribunal. Ye legal gentlemen opposite eloquently, plausibly and speciously plead that everything in the industry is based upon the principle of justice and equity. I say to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> that if the coal-miners be given the same rights as the management now has in determining how effect shall be given to the decisions of the tribunal, there will be fewer disputes in the coalmining industry. </para>

              <para>- No. That regulation deals with the owners of coalmines, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> correctly  pointed out, they decidehow the deter- mination of the tribunal shall be given effect. 1 begin where the honorable senator left off; I claim that the employees have- as much right to say how effect shall be given to that decision as the management now has.Under existing conditions, that right reposes solely in the management, and the employees have no say in the matter whatever. In t he circumstances, it is unreasonable to claim that the existing method of controlling the industry is fair. The coalowner does not confer with the coal- miners as to the location in which operations shall be conducted, or whether machines shall or shall not be employed in taking down pillars, and so on. </para>

              <para>- The commission does not go into those details. The removal of pillars has long been a contentious matter in the coal-mining industry. As the work proceeds and coal is hewed out of the ground, pillars are left to support the ceiling. Then as the men work back to the point of commencement, the pillars are removed. In the past the decision as to whether the work of removing the pillars shall be done by m a chines or by hand has been decided by the management; and should its deci- sion be challenged by the miners in the only way possible to them, the men are blamed for going on strike, and the management has its way. On paper the management has the right to say whether a miner shall be deprived of his means of livelihood, but the miner has no right to come to a similar decision in respect of the owner of the mines. Obviously, the present system of management in the coal-mining industry is unbalanced and one-sided, but that fact is not recognized by the Arbitration Court. Special pleaders among the Opposition argue entirely on the wording of the regulation, without taking into consideration the conditions under which the men work. They reason that the coal-miners are always wrong and the owners of the mines always right; but although honorable senators may continue to reasonin that way and try to discredit and embarrass the Government, they will not convince the majority of the people of this country, who are watching closely with an intelligent understanding to see bow industry is being manipulated behind the scenes to the detriment of the workers. They will not easily be deceived by references to the war-time situation made with a view to capitalizing the existing state of affairs for party political purposes. All that regulation 27B provides is that, so far as &#39;is humanly possible, the committee of management shall maintain continuity of operations. The implication behind the action of the Opposition to-day is that it does not want continuity of operations, except on its own terms. Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> spoke of even-handed justice, but. they cannot point to one industry in which it exists. The absence of that even-handed justice in industry is the cause of dissatisfaction leading to disputes. Even <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> has admitted&#39; that the present Government is doing all that is humanly possible to maintain and increase production in this the most serious period in the history of this country. It lias allowed its policy to be ruthlessly interfered with in order that there may be no interference with production. On many occasions I have told workers in New South Wales and Victoria that according to the Labour party&#39;s policy they are not receiving what they are entitled to get, but that I would rather take a risk with Australian employers than with the enemy. I am prepared to go to the utmost limit in giving away things that I hold clear in order that production may be increased. That the Government has taken the same view I defy the Opposition to deny. Yet some honorable senators indulge in specious pleading, saying that the committee of management will be dependent on the votes of the men whom it seeks to control, and on that ground they ask for the disallowance of this regulation. At the same time they say to the people of Australia that they stand for an all-in war effort and are willing to co-operate 100 per cent with the Government so that industry may be organized and the maximum effort obtained. I say to such honorable senators that they may win in this chamber when&#39; the vote is taken, but they will not win outside. Their power does not begin and end in this place, . because there are men outside the Parliament who will not allow them to do what they want to do. However, if honorable senators opposite are willing to take the risk, the responsibility is theirs, not the Government&#39;s. </para>

          <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> that 99 per cent, of the miners represented by the members of the committees of management have a proper sense of their responsibility. Yet by implication the honorable senator said that as they are dependent on the votes of others they could not properly discharge their duties. The honorable senator cannot have it both ways. I and my colleagues have had many years of experience of industrial disputes; and, in many instances, we said as members of a management committee that we did not agree that the workers* claims were justified. But in the past we had no power similar to this to deal with disputes. The objective of regulation 27B is to give to the union management committees power to maintain continuity of operations under an obviously one-sided management. That is proof of the degree to which the management committees are prepared to go in order to assist the war effort. The Leader of the Opposition declared that the Government had consulted outside unions upon this regulation. &#34;What is wrong with that? When he and his colleagues were in office their government conferred &#39;with outside organizations over an over again. By implication he says today that it is wrong for this Government to do the same thing. </para>

              <para>- The Prime Minister made several statements; but, if I understand his attitude correctly, it was that rather than have, as we could easily have had, a general stoppage in the industry, he would almost plead on hit knees to the miners, as I would also, that while we are at war, and while the enemy is on our doorstep, they should put up with difficulties and fight them out afterwards. That is the implication of the statements made by the Prime Minister ; and that is what we are asking the Opposition to do to-day. We could make political capital out of many issues that arise from day to day just as the Leader of the Opposition has done to-day in respect of this matter. He is trying to take an unfair advantage of the Government for political purposes. If we were not at war, and the position was not so desperate as it is, I should use much stronger language, but I do not propose to do so. I simply say that should the Senate carry the motion to disallow this regulation, and, as the result, strikes should increase, let honorable senators opposite remember that the responsibility rests on them and not on the Government. We have done all that is humanly possible to maintain production in the coal-mining, aircraft and the munitions industries. In a workshop in North Melbourne which I visited a couple of weeks ago I met men and women who were working twelve hours a day for seven days a week, with no let-up at all. They have been doing so for months, and are employed manufacturing mountings on which will be placed the engines of Beaufort bombers, and also rangefinders. They are working almost to exhaustion rather than challenge the unfairness of having to do so. because they realize that what they are making is indispensable; they are making sacrifices in the workshops. We ask the Opposition to do nothing to impede the war effort, as it evidently intends to do, but to allow the Government to continue the job which it has been doing and hones to do even more successfully in the future. </para>

            <para>. - I have listened with interest to the debate. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> set out a request, with which I agree in part, namely, that Parliament should meet more frequently during the war. I hoped that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator</inline></para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">Collings) would say &#34;yes&#34; to that request. But the Leader of the Opposition suggested that we should meet more frequently for the purpose of reviewing the numerous regulations that are coming forward. I sincerely hope that the remarks of the honorable senator, who has proved a very good Leader of the Opposition, and did good work in the past as Leader of the Senate, do not foreshadow a. state of affairs in which this Government, whose hands are now full with one great battle and which is striving to preserve the existence of this nation, will be forced to fight on a second front a battle over regulations - some of them obscure regulations discovered by  clever  legal luminaries who build up bogies about them. The dangers which exist in the coal industry are not caused by the regulation which is now attacked. On the contrary, the industry has now succeeded in establishing tin all-time production record. Parliament was called together at the request of the opposition parties. I agreed with that request; hut I did not think it was for a performance of the kind we have witnessed in this chamber this afternoon. We have been/ called together to review the war position, and the ever-increasing dangers to the people of Australia. We met on the 20th February, the day after Darwin was first attacked. On that day, a secret meeting was held, and all members of the Parliament were taken fully and frankly into the Government&#39;s confidence. I take this opportunity to thank the Service Ministers and the Prime Minister for the fact that, for the first time since the war began, private members of this chamber were taken into the complete confidence of the Government in respect of the war. Personally, I found little comfort in what was told to us; I cannot say more than that. We met again last week to discuss in public the important and valuable statement made in the House of Representatives by the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> and repeated in this chamber by the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley).</inline> That statement is now open for discussion; and I have no doubt that the people expected that our discussion of it would be continued here this afternoon. However, it has been interrupted by the consideration of this motion. The action of the Government in calling Parliament together, and arranging a secret meeting, and placing the statement of the Minister for External Affairs before us, reflects a commendable desire on its part to work in the closest co-operation and harmony with all the people&#39;s representatives in this Parliament. We have not a national government. That is not the fault of honorable senators on this side. However, this Government has given us the opportunity to have a nationally minded Parliament in order to assist it during this time of stress and crisis. Consequently, the present is most inopportune for the consideration of anything other than the war effort. The Government is faced with a tremendous job and is carrying a heavy burden, and so long as it remains the Government, it deserves the help and assistance of not only the people of Australia, but also every member of this Parliament in its prosecution of the war. Nothing else matters. So much for the consideration of regulations ! At such a time as the present, every effort of Ministers should be devoted to the defence of our native land. When I say defence, I use the term in its widest sense. I want to see the Ministers directing the war effort of this country adopt a more aggressive policy. I want to see the Government hit back at the enemy, in accordance with the traditions of the Australian Imperial Force. Their time, thought and energy and the efforts of this Parliament should he entirely devoted to that end and nothing else. Many people in Australia will be surprised to learn that this debate has occupied the attention of the Australian Senate this afternoon in this time of crisis. Look at the notice-paper - an attack on regulations concerning the coalmining industry, and an attack on regulations concerning waterside employment. Coal and transport are the life-blood of Australian industry, particularly in time of war. I should hesitate to throw a spanner into the economic working of either of those industries. What will be the reaction of the industry if this motion be carried? If the Leader of the Opposition can show me that its passage will result in the production of more coal and greater effort on the part of miners, I shall give it my support; but 1 think, that it is more likely to have the opposite effect. 1 know something about coal-miners, and I should hate to see a day&#39;s strike at this time of crisis as a protest against the interference of the Senate in the affairs of the industry. I also know something of the urgent demand for the highest possible output of coal for our war effort, and the demand to build up reserves of coal. We all know that it would be much better if those reserves were much greater. All of us must realize the intense anxiety of this Government and of its predecessor to keep the coal-miners at work. Those efforts are now meeting with success, belated though it is, because we are assured that to-day all of the coal-miners are at work. Unfortunately, that was not the case last week. </para>

We are told by these learned gentlemen that this regulation is not entirely conventional. Does this Government alone stand accused of adopting unconventional methods in order to keep the coal-mining industry going? Let us go back only a few months and review the innocent flirtations which its predecessor carried on with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Winkler</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nelson.</inline> At least they show that a government supported by honorable senators on this side of the chamber adopted methods which could not be considered conventional, in an endeavour to keep this great industry going at full production. Every one agreed that that Government&#39;s negotiations with Winkler and Nelson were honest, and no attempt was made to disallow regulations at that time. In fact, there was no attempt to disallow the &#163;300 of Government funds which found its way into some one&#39;s pocket. </para>

              <para>- Of course not. I am merely pointing out that the Government now in office is not the only one which has adopted unconventional methods in its desire to keep up the coal Output in war time. A royal commission spent a great -deal of time and, no doubt, a considerable amount of money, in an endeavour to find out who did get the &#163;300. That &#39;money was paid out in an honest endeavour to keep the coal-mining industry in operation, and I believe that this Government is similarly actuated in its efforts to keep coal production at its highest level. At any rate, I cannot believe that the carrying of this motion would put more miners to work, produce more coal, or further our war effort in any way. I received no objection to the regulation. In  fact, <inline font-style="italic">&#60;I</inline> have not even heard of it until I was informed that a motion for its disallowance was <inline font-style="italic">bo</inline> be moved. I point out that since the war broke out at least S14 statutory rules have been laid on the table of the Senate. In 1939. from. September onwards, 111 statutory rules were tabled, each containing numbers of regulations. In 1940, statutoryrules tabled in Parliament totalled 296, and in 1941, 327. Most of those were brought down during the term of office of the Menzies Government. This year SO statutory (rules have been tabled, making a total of S14. In view of the menace with which we are confronted, there Gan he no justification for the action which has been taken in this chamber to-day. In the early days of the war. when the previous government was in office, the then Opposition did not start a campaign for the disallowance of regulations. </para>

          </continue>
          <para>Regulation 27b recognizes <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> authority of committees of management of organizations of employees associated with coal-mining. When I was a very young man, a battle was fought in Western Australia for the recognition of trade unions by the State Government. A certain Commissioner of Railways resigned from his post rather than &#39;give recognition to trade unions, which was done by the Forrest Government prior to federation. That battle was fought and won. I do not think that it will ever he repeated in Australia, but if it is to be repeated, then this is a singularly bad time to choose. Also on the notice-paper is a motion for the disallowance of certain regulations with respect to employment on the waterfront. That motion has an old familiar ring to those of  us who were here ten years or more ago, and I should not like the Leader of the Opposition,, who has done much to restore the prestige and dignity of the Senate during his terms of leadership on both sides of the chamber, to relapse i&#171;to the&#39; habits of those bad old days. When the debate on that second motion rakes place, perhaps something should b&#171; said about the attitude of the Country party and the Nationalist party in disallowing certain waterside workers regulations, in framing new regulations entirely as they wanted them, but not as the waterside workers wanted them, and t hen repealing them all. The &#34; Vicar of Bray &#34;, who had so much to do with i hu framing of the amended regulations, iiic! not resign from the Government when they were repealed. If peace in the coal-mining industry and on the waterfront was ever of vital importance to this nation, it is now. I resent the threats that have appeared in sections of the press, indicating the attitude which I and other members of Parliament were going to take with regard to the Government&#39;s economic plan. &#34;We have been told day after day that it is the intention of the Senate majority to disallow these regulations. I was never consulted about it. I contend that the limitation of profits is a proper corollary 10 the fixing of prices. The fixing of prices can be evaded by unscrupulous traders, but the limitation of profits finally decides the issue. </para>
          <para>I commend the Government for the remits that it has attained by means of conferences between both parties in the coal-mining industry. There appears to he a. lack of co-ordination between the Leader of the Opposition in the House of .Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Fadden)</inline> and the Leader of the Opposition in the Senate, because at the very time when notice of a motion for the disallowance of this regulation was given in this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden</inline> is reported to have said in the House of Representatives that three minutes of the day devoted to our war effort by Ministers was better than three hours devoted&#39; to a debate such as this. We have already had about three hours of debate on the? motion. Perhaps <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fadden</inline> was a prophet when he mentioned that period, but T agree entirely with his view, and I am sorry that Ministers in this chamber have not been able to devote the last three hours to their departmental activities and our war effort.- </para>

To-day this nation is confronted with the greatest emergency in its history, and is fighting for its very existence. The foe is hammering at our doors, not only at Darwin, but also in. the north of Western Australia, where Australian citizens are in great danger. In these circumstances, Ministers should be able to give their full and undivided attention to the defence of Australia, particularly those portions where we are most gravely menaced, namely, the Northern Territory and the north of Western Australia. I am opposed to this motion, but I shall support the Government in any action which will assist the war effort. That is the only thing that matters to-day. </para>

            <para>. - I am in complete accord with the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> in regard to the motion now before the Senate. The honorable senator&#39;s speech has had a remarkable effect on honorable senators opposite. They all look as though a powerful anaesthetic had been administered to them. They were quite silent during the whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston&#39;s</inline> speech, and -no attempt was made to interject. When moving the motion, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> took objection to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> holding conferences with the miners&#39; executive, but I remember many conferences taking place between the miners&#39; executive, the former Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> and the former Minister for Labour and Industry <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt).</inline> No objection was taken then. Like the present Prime Minister, the former Prime Minister was trying to bring about full production in the mining industry. It is not right for the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber or any one else to suggest that, while the con- ferences  between the former Prime Minister and. the miners&#39; executive were held in an atmosphere of purity, conferences between the same executive and the present Prime Minister have some sinister significance. The result of the many conferences between representatives of the previous Government and the miners&#39; executive was the setting up of the Central Reference Board, and local reference boards in an endeavour to bring about peace in the coal-mining industry and to increase production. Those boards were appointed because it was believed to be necessary to deal with industrial disputes at their source. This Government has gone a little farther, and &#91; appreciate the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBri.de</inline> this afternoon in regard to the loyalty of the miners and their desire to bring about full production. However, I should like to point out that, although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan and other legal luminaries in the? chamber have endeavoured to pull this regulation to pieces, the use of the management committees of unions provided for in this regulation is merely an extension of the present practice. I admit that only the miners are represented, hut there may be a reason for that. I point out that there are several .raft unions connected with the coalmining industry. There is the Engineers Union, the Blacksmiths Union, and so on. All the trouble does not emanate from the miners. One of those craft unions may be concerned  in a dispute that will stop the operations at a pit.  When the men arrive at work something may occur to prevent them from getting on with their jobs. For instance, there may be an inspection, and the miners&#39; representative may deem that certain portions of the mine are unsafe - there can be many different opinions regarding safety in a mine - or the boys on, the skips, or the engineers, may have a grievance. The powers granted to a management committee allow it to deal with such grievances on the spot, and they even go further and give it authority to discipline members. Therefore, if a minority of members are unwilling to go to work, the management committee has authority to tell them that they must work. I see nothing wrong with such a power if it has the effect of keeping the wheels of industry turning, and that is the only intention of the regulation. Much time has already been wasted in this debate, and I shall not delay the Senate longer. I only wish to make it clear that the purpose of the regulation is to give the management committee power to discipline the men. </para>

            <para>.- At the outset of this debate I intended to support, the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> but, after listening to the discussion and giving the matter further consideration, I have decided to oppose it. I consider that clause 1 of regulation 27b departs from a very good principle, in that it has handed over a great measure of control to a management committee. However, I should be sorry to see the regulation go out of existence, because it gives power to the executive of the federation to take drastic action against any of its members who are not prepared to carry on with the production of coal in this time of national danger. I am hopeful that, as the result of the frequent conferences that have been held between representatives of successive governments and the leaders of the Miners Federation, there will be more peace in the industry in future than there has been up to the present. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> said that, in his view, approximately 99 per cent, of the men engaged in the coal-mining industry -were loyal and anxious to work, and that the remainder were often anxious to cause trouble. I do not accept those figures, but I believe that a small minority of miners has-been responsible for most of the disputes that have occurred. I believe the same to be true of the disputes that have occurred in other industries. I am prepared to allow this regulation to remain in force for a little longer in order to see whether the management committees will take strong action to deal with those men whose only purpose is to reduce production. I am willing to give the federation a little more opportunity to expel those members. If, as the result of the additional concessions that have undoubtedly been given by the Government to the federation, these trouble makers are not expelled, I shall be prepared to take any action in this chamber that is within my power to bring the organization to heel. The leaders of the federation have given assurances to the Government, and we must accept those assurances-. We should give this regulation a further trial in order to see whether the committees of management will make full use of the powers conferred upon them in order to maintain peace in the industry and continued production. </para>

            <para>.-1 have not very much to say about this matter, but I give to the Government due credit for its good intentions. I believe, that it introduced this regulation with the laudable object of increasing coal production. However, the road to hell is paved with good intentions, and all that the Government has done is to make strikes legal oh the coal-fields. </para>

              <para>- That is one of the strangest things that I have ever heard. The federation may have fined some of its members yesterday, but it did not do so under regulation 27b. That regulation does not give the management committee any power to fine its members. I do not dispute the fact that the men were fined, but the fines were imposed under the federation&#39;s own rules, which have nothing to do with this regulation. The claim that all miners- are back at work now merely as the result of the promulgation of this regulation is the biggest slur on the coal-miners that has ever been uttered. I believe that the coal-miners arc as loyal as anybody else, and I believe that they have been thoroughly aroused to the seriousness of our position. They have gone back to work because they consider it to be their national duty to do so. I do not believe for one moment that they have returned to work, either temporarily or permanently, because certain regulations were enacted that gave management committees power to expel them if they did not work when they were told to do so. </para>

              <para>- I prefer to think that the coal-miners are back at work for much more creditable reasons than those attributed to them by the Government, which says that they have returned to the pits because of fear of punishment. I should like to believe that they went back because they find their country in the throes of a great tragedy and because they realize that the product of their labour is necessary for the safety of Australia. I do not believe that tinregulation to which exception is taken has had the effect that the Government supposes. In my opinion, Ministers have totally misconceived its effect. It provides that, if a duly constituted committee of management of any organization of workers in the coal-mining industry directs that the men must go back to work, they must do so, hut if it is decided that a strike is legal they need  not return to work. That provision is not at all simple, but is complicated by the fact that there are a number of industrial organizations in the coalmining industry. There is no committee of management for the whole of the employees. Each trade union will decide for itself whether its members shall or shall not return to work. </para>

          <para>Are Ministers aware of the existence of Statutory Rule No. 77, under which a Minister, or any other person authorized by a Minister, may direct any person resident in Australia to perform such duties as are specified in the direction, and to perform such duties in relation to his trade, business calling or profession as are so specified? Is that regulation to be applied to all members of the community except the coal-miners? All other persons are required to act on the orders of a Minister or his  deputy,  whether given orally or in writing, but apparently the coal-miners need not go back to work unless they decide for themselves to do so. Are we to set up an aristocracy of labour in the special interests of coal-miners? I suggest that the Ministers who have been dealing with this matter have deliberately favoured the coal-miners at the expense of every other craft union and every other class in the community. </para>

            <para>. - Judging by the speeches of members of the Opposition, very few of them have a clear conception of conditions in the coalmining industry, and they are not prepared to accept the advice of those who have a first-hand knowledge of the industry. I am surprised that some members of the Opposition are apparently not in favour of a maximum production of coal in the interests of the war effort. The regulations under consideration were promulgated for the purpose of bringing about a maximum production, and were introduced by men who understand the coal-miners and the industry. That is shown by the fact that they have provided for the appointment of committees selected from men who have a first-hand knowledge of the industry. The miners on whom some honorable senators opposite have attempted to cast a stigma are as loyal as any member of this Senate. The implication that the miners have been taking advantage of their position as employees in a sheltered industry is unworthy of those responsible for it. Those who level that charge against the miners have not the courage to do it on the coalfields, but have used the cloak of parliamentary privilege. The members of the management committees on the coal-fields are loyal men who have much at stake. They desire to see production accelerated and are most anxious to have peace* in industry. They would not hesitate to inflict the severest penalties on miners who refuse to accept the decisions of the committee. The heaviest penalty that could be imposed on a miner would be that of expulsion from his industrial  organization, for he would then be regarded as a &#34; scab &#34; throughout the Commonwealth. No unionist who thought anything of his country would willingly become an outcast among his fellow workers. Members of a management committee would not hesitate to punish unionists who would sabotage the industry. The regulation was framed in order to preserve peace in industry, and it has achieved a great deal of success. Its disallowance would mean that there would be no penalty in the case of a person who adopted subversive activities. As one who for three or four years worked in a coal-mine, and understands the miners and the conditions under which they work, I appreciate the tribute which some honorable senators opposite have paid to the coal-miners. </para>

              <para>- I did the same work as thousands of coal-miners are doing to-day. On one occasion I was ordered by the management to lie on my stomach in cold water under hanging rock which was likely to fall at any moment, and scrape out the mullock which had accumulated there. I did not do so, and for that reason I twas sent out of the mine: but because my action had the support of the genuine coal-miners, who understood conditions in the industry, 1 was back, at work the next day. Not infrequently miners are called upon to hew coal all day long in confined spaces at contract rates. Those honorable senators who do not know of the conditions under which miners work - and that certainly applies to the Leader of the Opposition, who has not the slightest conception of conditions in the industry - would do well to organize a party to inspect a coal-mine and see for themselves the conditions under which men have to work. Having worked as a miner among miners, I say without fear of successful contradiction that they are just as honest, sincere and loyal as are any honorable senators in this chamber. </para>

          <para>A good deal has been said, about strikes in the coal-mining industry. As a miner, I have experienced a number of lockouts, but on no occasion was the lock-out provoked by the employees. Nevertheless, such disputes were invariably referred to by the newspapers as strikes on the part of the miners. The truth is that the men were deliberately locked out by the owners, in some instances because they wanted to do some special work, in others because the railways department wanted the trucks for carting wheat. Whatever the reason, the fact remains that every time we were out of work it was as the result, of having been locked out by the employers. I say unhesitatingly that when I was engaged in the industry, the greatest loyalty to the nation was shown, not by the employers, but by the employees. </para>
          <para>Honorable senators opposite who have objected to regulation 27b have not shown that it contains any unjust provisions. Nor &#39;has any Opposition senator drawn attention to regulation 27c, which provides that the commissioner shall have power to inflict penalties upon employees. The whole of the forces of the Opposition have been directed against regulation 27b, but their real reason is that they want no control over any disruptive elements which might creep into the coalmining industry. In its present state, the regulation has a deterrent effect on disruptive tendencies, because any person who tried to cause trouble in a mine could be dealt with effectively by a committee of management. The men on that committee would act promptly if they found any one endeavouring to create trouble which might lead to a weakening of the war effort. When the vote on the motion is taken, the people of this country will be able to see clearly how many honorable senators are really in earnest about a maximum war effort. Should the regulation be disallowed, the miners will be denied the right to deal with any disruptive element in the industry which  might retard the production of coal. I ask honorable senators not to vote for the disallowance of the regulation until it has proved ineffective; and I assure them that should it fail, the Government will take other steps to achieve its purpose. The regulation has not yet failed, and therefore there is no ground for its disallowance. If honorable senators favour the enemy they should vote for the disallowance of the regulation, but if they want to see the greatest possible war effort in this country, they should allow the regulation to remain operative, because it has been framed by people who understand not only the framing of regulations but also the class of men to whom it applies. Finally, I remind the Senate that the employees in the coalmining industry have proved their loyalty in no  unmistakeable  way. </para>

            <para>this afternoon reminded me of the words of Shakespeare that &#34;a little knowledge is a dangerous thing&#34;. The honorable senator made it clear that he knows no more about the coal-mining industry than is known by the man in the moon. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett,</inline> I have a practical knowledge of coal-mining, because for some time I worked in the Rhondda colliery. It may interest those honorable senators who obviously know little or nothing about the industry to learn that there may be many reasons for a stoppage of work in a coal mine. Work may cease because of some failure on the part of an endless belt, a tumbler, an endless chain, because some of the skips have become derailed, because trouble has arisen in the drive, or because the wheelers have not taken the skips to the miners. Perhaps the greatest cause of trouble is a shortage of trucks. A company which controls five or six coalmines may decide to concentrate its trucks at certain mines, leaving other mines temporarily idle. Should there be no trucks to receive the coal from the endless belt, the pit must stop working because it would be useless to bring the skips up if they cannot be tipped into the tumbler or shaker, where the fine coal is removed from the coal which goes on the endless belt. There may be numerous reasons why certain pits are not working on a particular day. I regard the newspaper paragraph that certain mines were not working yesterday not only as political propaganda but also as enemy propaganda of the most despicable character. I believe that every mine-owner should keep his mine working, but he can do so only if he is able to supply the necessary trucks and to keep the machinery working. Should any of the breakdowns which I have enumerated occur, the mine could not be kept clear, and a pit mav have to be closed temporarily. These things are not, made public. When I worked in a mine, we travelled for three miles, and when we arrived at the three mile Peg, we had to wait to see if the red flag was flying. The red flag was a signal that the mine would work the next day. </para>

          <para>Honorable senators opposite have protested against regulation 27b but their real desire is that the &#39;whole of the regulation be disallowed because it cannot be amended. Their object is to prevent the issue of a regulation compelling mineowners to keep their mines open. I cannot imagine that the Leader of the Opposition would want the miners not to work. From my experience among the miners, I know that they want to work. In fact, the difficulty in the coal-mining industry is to obtain eleven days work in a fortnight. I know that the miners get in their eleven days a fortnight in the John Brown pits, where the coal is good ; but that is not the case on the Maitland and Newcastle fields. Yet the latter miners undoubtedly want to work eleven days a fortnight. They are just as anxious as anybody else to earn all they can for their wives and children. &#39;Coalminers as a class  are  just as honest as any other section of workers. I urge the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> to investigate the figures relating to the number of wagons available for the removal of coal from the mines. That information is readily obtainable, and I feel sure that it will convince the honorable senator that the number of wagons available is deplorably insufficient. That is the cause of many stoppages. As the honorable senator appears to have no knowledge of that aspect of the industry, I must conclude that the object of his motion is not to disallow regulation 27b, but regulation 27a. Coal- miners as a body, I repeat, are anxious to work. I admit that recently an irresponsible element has crept into the industry. This consists mainly of young fellows who do not want to work. However, the Government has that matter in hand, and I have no doubt that it will treat those individuals as they should be treated. At the same time, we must not judge the coal-miners on the actions of that element. It is worthwhile once again to place on record the fact that, during the last war, the proportion of enlistments of coal-miners exceeded that of those engaged in any other industry. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> that no worker is more loyal to this country than the coal-miner. I congratulate the Prime Minister upon giving effect to this regulation. Such action called for considerable courage on the part of a Labour Prime Minister. However, that courage is typical of John Cur tin, who has proved himself to be a fearless leader. He has shown that he has no desire to do anything that will injure any section of the community. On the one hand, he has told the investor that interest rates must be cut, and on the other, he has told the miner that he must stay at work. The loyalty of the coal miner to his mate and his organization is a by-word in the industrial life of this country. Nothing could cause him greater disgrace than to be expelled from his union. Those men will die for their organization. Recently, the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> and the Minister for Home Security <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lazzarini)</inline> addressed meetings on the coal-fields, and told the miners that they would either have to work or get into a military uniform. Both of those honorable gentlemen secured election to this Parliament mainly on the votes of the coal-miners. </para>

            <para>- -In the course of this discussion, no reflection has been cast upon the loyalty of the miners. The Leader of the Senate went to a great deal of trouble to explain why we should not waste coal. We are not discussing the wastage of coal; we are discussing the production of coal. The Minister for Trade and Customs also was at great pains to assure us that this regulation does not interfere with the powers of the Arbitration Court, but I am inclined to think that it does. It sets up a tribunal amongst the miners themselves. If the miners do not conform to the provisions of this regulation, the management committee can exercise authority over them. To ray mind, such action cuts right across arbitration awards. We on this side of the chamber desire only to bring about peace in the industry, and I feel sure that if this regulation were amended along the lines suggested, putting the miners under the same control as the mine-owners, the whole difficulty would be overcome. </para>

            <para>. - I have listened closely to the debate on this motion, and the remarks made by certain honorable senators opposite display a lamentable ignorance of the subject. Obviously, they do not know anything about the industry. I feel confident that, in moving the motion for the disallowance of regulation 27b, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> is not acting entirely on his own initiative. It is more likely that this matter has been thoroughly discussed by the Opposition parties. The disallowance of this regulation would have a very important effect upon our war effort. The coal-mining industry is a key industry. Many people are inclined to blame the coal-miners for everything, but that is hardly a fair attitude. I believe that the Government&#39;s sole object is to expedite the settlement of disputes. How many honorable senators opposite who are supporting the disallowance of this regulation know what it is to work at the face in a mine? In New South Wales, before a man is regarded as a practical coal-miner he must work for two years at the pit face alongside a practicalminer. To become a mine manager, a man must work in or around a mine for at least five years. However, by means of a little bit of study at a technical college, and the passing of examinations, it is possible for a man who has been a clerical worker at a mine to get a mine manager&#39;s certificate without practical experience at the pit face. The result is that some mine managers know very little about the actual work in the pits, and when they give orders to practical miners who have been years in the job disputes frequently arise.For instance, a man in a mine might be working with a. horse whose shoulders had been rubbed raw. Next morning the mine manager might instruct the man to take the horse into the pit. The man, being a humanitarian and totally different from members of the Opposition, might refuse to do so. A discussion would follow, such as I have witnessed repeatedly, and the mine manager might direct that the whistle be blown and that no work be done. The regulation provides for nothing different from what has been done in coal-mines for years past. If a dispute occurs in a mine, the matter is discussed by the miners&#39; lodge committee. If that body cannot reach a decision, it refers the dispute to the executive officers, who have been appointed by their organization. That procedure has been followed for many years. The Opposition wants to do away with this system and allow the mine managers to refer disputes to the commissioner mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer.</inline></para>

              <para>- Yes. I have a first-class certificate, and I know what I am talking about. If a dispute arose as the result of a manager&#39;s decision to transfer a man from one operation to another, the committee of the miners would discuss the matter, and afterwards would refer it to the district executive or board of management of the district. The law provides for that procedure, and this regulation goes further and provides for the imposition of penalties if men refuse to work. Apparently the Opposition wishes to do away with this provision. It has no desire to penalize men who impede the war effort. Whether it wants the war effort to be  held up or not is another matter. The Government did the right thing when it issued the regulation. I believe that its action has the approval of 90 per cent. of the coal-miners of Australia. The regulation provides a means of dealing with recalcitrant workers. For instance, a young boy working on a mine ventilation system might not be doing his job efficiently. The brattice might not be held up properly and therefore not carrying the air into the mines. The boy might be reprimanded and might thereupon refuse to work, with the result that the operations of the entire mine would be held up. This Government has rightly said that such employees must be penalized for their actions. Apparently the Opposition wants to prevent that. </para>

              <para>- The miners have not objected to it.We do not know exactly where the objection which the Leader of the Opposition is voicing originated. I believe that disputes in the industry arise from the operations of interlocked monopolies which virtually control this country. What will happen if this regulation is disallowed ? Does the Opposition suggest that something should be put in its place? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan suggested this afternoon that the commission should direct the men whether they should work or not. Under that system, disputes would have to be referred to  the commission. Why should this be necessary when there is in existence machinery that has been operating for years? The coal-miners arejust as anxious to produce coal for the war effort as others are to assist in other ways; in fact, they are probably more concerned about the war effort than those persons whose chief interest lies in profits. The men will do their job. They know what they are doing, and they are anxious to help the nation. But if they should refuse to do their job, they should be compelled to work. This regulation provides for the imposition of fines, and, in certain circumstances, expulsion is provided for. It operates in the best interests of the nation, and it should be allowed to continue. </para>

            <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - I have followed with great interest the various speakers in this debate, and I repeat what I said in submitting the motion, that in these times, when the laws of the land are being made in great num bers by the Executive, this Parliament has a great responsibility. I do not hold the view expressed by some honorable senatorsthat, because we are engaged in a war, the Senate must pass unchallenged class legislation that will not help the war effort, but which will increase class hatred as regulation 27b is liable to do. I remind the Government that when the economic organization regulations were promulgated, a great number of its supporters objected to them, with the result that the Prime Minister (Mr.Cur tin) called upon a legal luminary who has been sneered at this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer,</inline> to assist the Government to make them workable. It ill becomes supporters of the Government, in their ignorance of the law, to refer to my colleagues, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer,</inline> in a sneering way as &#34; legal luminaries&#34;. They placed the facts of the case fairly before the Senate to-day and stated the intentions of the legal men who framed these regulations. I object to the criticism of these gentlemen that was expressed by some honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber. I repeat, for the benefit of certain members of the Opposition, that it is wrong to say that we must not take a stand against any of these regulations simply because we are engaged in a war. I consider that we have a duty to this country. If we are to allow regulations of far-reaching importance to pass unchallenged, what is the good of Parliament meeting at all ?I have stated that the Opposition would be satisfied to have the objectionable clause of this regulation removed. </para>

              <para>- It can be repealed, and a new regulation can be issued providing that the commission appointed by the Government, not a committee of management, shall have power to say whether the men shall or shall not go to work. I do not propose to waste further time in an endeavour to educate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur</inline> on the differencebetween a commissioner and a commission. The commission was appointed by the present Government, and it consists of an independent  chairman,  a representative of the owners, and a representative of the miners. If the Government repealed regulation27b and promulgated a new regulation giving authority over the miners to the commission, the one body would control both the owners and the miners in order to keep the industry operating at full capacity. That would do justice to both sections and would create unity. It is ridiculous for honorable senators opposite to say, after hearing the Prime Minister&#39;s famous statement to the miners, &#34;You must work or fight &#34;, that regulation 27b has been the means of creating peace in the coal industry. From the 9th January, when that statement was made, until this week the miners have defied the Prime Minister. I said at the outset of the debate that to give a committee of management authority to say whether the miners should or should not work was simple. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan interjected and said, quite rightly, that it was just as silly as it was simple. That was the reason why I moved for the disallowance of regulation 27b. The owners are controlled by the commission. We want the miners also to be controlled by the commission. If the Government is prepared to meet the Opposition in the matter we are. willing to assist it in the repeal of this regulation and the substitution of another on the lines I have indicated. </para>

              <para>- The honorable senator ought to withdraw that remark, because 130 members of the Australian Imperial Force are members of that organization, and 70 of them are at present, fighting with the Australian Imperial Force. Prior to the promulgation of the present regulation, the Waterside Workers Federation and the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union each had one representative on that committee. Ever since the passage of the Transport Workers Act there has been peace on the waterfront in Victoria. I strongly object to the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> under the guise of war emergency, using the powers given under the National Security Act to set up a new committee on the waterfront in Victoria. Under this regulation he proposes to appoint three members from the Waterside Workers Federation and three representatives of the ship-owners, and the Minister also proposes to appoint the  chairman.  This means that the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union, with a. membership of over 1,100, will have no representation on the new committee. I understand that the membership of the Waterside Workers Federation in Victoria is about 1,800. I now inform, the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> that I am prepared not to go onwith the disallo wance of regulation 5 if the Government is willing to recognize the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union and to give it representation on the committee. </para>

          <para>This matter was discussed when the honorable member for Fawkner <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holt)</inline> was Minister for Labour and National Service. A conference was held between the Waterside Workers Federation, the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union and representatives of the owners, and it was requested that representation should be given to the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union in Victoria. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Ward</inline> became Minister for Labour and National Service he, by means of this regulation, took advantage of war conditions in order to show the most vicious and vindictive discrimination that could be imagined. I remind the Senate of the reason for the formation of the organization known as the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. In 1928, when there was trouble on the waterfront, the Beeby award was given, and, despite the fact that the executive of the Waterside Workers Federation and representatives of the Australasian Council of Trade Unions advised the union leaders in Melbourne to obey the award, they were not prepared to do so. Honorable senators will remember the introduction of the Transport Workers Bill and what followed. The members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union said on that occasion, &#34; We are prepared to observe the umpire&#39;s decision. We agree to abide by the award of the Arbitration Court. But, in order not to be controlled by the extremists, we shall set up our own organization &#34;. That body was established in Sydney, and it also functions in Melbourne. I believe that the membership in Melbourne is larger than in any other Australian port. Now the Minister proposes to set up a new committee and refuses to give representation to the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. I know that honorable senators are anxious to reach a decision regarding this matter. Is the Leader of the Senate willing to consider my suggestion that the Permanent and Casual </para>
          <para class="block">Wharf Labourers Union is entitled to representation, or is the Government prepared to back up the Minister for Labour and National Service, notwithstanding the fact that Japan is bombing various ports in Australia? Last Saturday week, members of the Waterside Workers Federation were not prepared to work on the wharfs in Melbourne in loading goods required for Darwin. Members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union were the only men who turned up to do the job. I urge the Government to treat this matter with the seriousness that it deserves. </para>

              <para>- Obviously the Government is prepared to take advantage of the war situation in order to strangle an organization which is prepared to abide by the decisions of the Arbitration Court. From conversations that I have had with members of the two unions, I know that since 1928 they have been prepared to work together amicably. If the Leader of the Senate makes inquiries, he will find that the old committee, on which there was one representative of the Waterside Workers Federation of Australia and one representative of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union of Australia, worked successfully with very little friction. My reason for moving that regulations 5 and 15 be disallowed is to give to the Government an opportunity to amend those regulations in order that justice may be done to a deserving section of the people. </para>

Should these regulations be not disallowed and the Waterside Workers Federation be given the power to strangle the other organization, there will be disunity instead of unity, and industrial trouble where there should be peace, whilst the members of the Government can lay this flattering unction to their souls that they have done a great injustice to a large number of men who have rendered valuable service to Australia. </para>

            <para>. - I shall have little to say on this subject because I have come to the conclusion that the less encouragement that is given to the Opposition to prolong debates of this unsatisfactory nature, the better it will be for the people of Australia and the greater the credit to the Senate as a component part of the Parliament of this country. When the war broke out, the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> who was then in opposition, issued a declaration to the effect that he conceived it to be the duty of all of us to show that democracy and democratic institutions, as well as the British way of parliamentary government, could prove effective in times of emergency. Since then the Labour partyhas endeavoured to show its bona  fides  in this connexion; it has done its utmost to make democracy workable. Now that the war has assumed more serious proportions, and Australia is being attacked, the Labour Government feels it more than ever to be its duty to show not only that our democratic parliamentary institutions can be made to function in the British way, but also that as few obstacles as possible should be allowed to stand in the way of the smooth working of our industrial organization. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> knows well that we never have had, and never will have, harmony in. industry while a small section of that industry, which has broken away from the parent body controlling it, is recognized. </para>

              <para>- It was a clever ruse, if not altogether a fair one, to suggest, as the Leader of the Opposition did, that this regulation was drafted by a particular individual. The honorable senator must know that however keen a Cabinet Minister may be on a particular reform connected with the work which, for the moment,, he controls, and irrespective of his Cabinet rank, he must make submissions to Cabinet and must get the approval of Cabinet before effect is given to his proposals. </para>

Does the Leader of the Oppo  sition  understand the immensity of the job confronting the Government and tintremendous responsibility which it has to <inline font-style="italic">carry</inline> at the present time? Does he realize that, great as was thu responsibility of the Government of which he was a member a few months ago, that responsibility has increased enormously  since  the present Government came into office because of the turn that this tragic war has taken in the interim? Does he know that His Majesty the King, and his Queen, are constantly visiting industrial areas in Great  Britain,  accepting risks in so doing, because of their desire to establish and maintain industrial harmony in that country? Is he prepared to sanction, on behalf of  His  Majesty&#39;s Opposition in this chamber, tactics which, to say the least, are not wise at this stage? Does he think that it will increase the dignity of this chamber to waste time in discussions of this kind ? </para>

The present Government is not prepared to submit to any proposal which suggests that it must not move until it has consulted every member of the Opposition, or at least its Leader. The present Government will at least give its proposals a &#34; go &#34;.

              <para>- Exactly, and a party to which I am pledged. We are giving to the friends of honorable senators opposite, on whose behalf they have accepted this brief, an opportunity to come within the Waterside Workers Federation; but honorable senators opposite desire the present division in the industry to continue. They want to be able to pose as the particular champions of this particular section of workers. They hope to prevent the Government from going on with its immense work of bringing about harmony and 100 per cent, production in industry. This matter relates to only one of the difficulties which we have experienced in clearing the wharfs in not only Victoria, but also the other States. All that wo ask honorable senators opposite now is that they cease this unnecessary opposition at a time like the present, because it can neither redound to their  credit  nor help the Government to achieve a greater war effort. That is all we ask of honorable senators opposite in this matter, and it is all that should be at stake at the present time. The retention of all that we have depends upon a more intense war effort and we believe that by this means we can produce greater harmony, or at least reduce disharmony. </para>

If the Government&#39;s action does not happen to please honorable senators opposite, or fit in with their ideas, is it not fair for the Government to ask them at least to stop pin-pricking and putting up &#34; Aunt Sallies &#34; simply in order to have the pleasure of knocking them over ? </para>

            <para>.- If any honorable senator had any doubt as to how he should vote on this motion, I think that the speech of the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has dispelled that doubt. He pleaded to us to stand by the Government in these difficult times. This Opposition has shown it is prepared to stand behind the Government in any action it may take in relation to our war effort. However, on the honorable senator&#39;s own admission, the Government is taking this opportunity to apply a party political principle against a certain section of workers engaged on the wharfs. </para>

              <para>- Do honorable senators opposite remember the circumstances which brought that organization into being in Melbourne and in other Australian ports? It was brought into being because it was the only body at that time which was prepared to abide by an award of the Arbitration Court in relation to waterside work. At that time, the Waterside Workers Federation was not prepared to abide by the award, with the result that shipping in this country, which the Leader of the Senate realizes is the life-blood of our transport in normal times, and particularly in &#38; time of war, was held up. An appeal was made for men to come forward and work the ships under the award of the court. These men, who subsequently formed the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union, responded to that appeal. As th&#60;Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> pointed out, the majority of them served with the Australian Imperial Force in the last war, whilst a large number of them are now serving with the defence forces in this war. </para>

              <para>- That is not so. These men have not broken down any award conditions. They have abided by every award ; but under this regulation these men, who have done their duty faithfully in the loading and unloading of vessels, are not to be represented on the committee. I say frankly that certain Ministers, among whom I do not include the Leader of the Senate, have waited for nearly a quarter of a century to &#34; get &#34; these men ; and they think they have got them under this regulation. That is why these men are to be denied representation on the committee. Regulation 15 prescribes that the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union cannot enrol new members.

This proposition is merely advanced under the cloak of the war effort with a view to gaining a party political advantage. I shall object to any proposition advanced in this way with a view to penalizing an organization of this kind which has been fighting for its existence during the last 25 years. In respect of any proposition which directly relates to the furtherance of our war effort, the Government can count upon the whole-hearted support of the Opposition. I say definitely that this regulation has been framed by the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> for the purpose of getting square in an old vendetta which has existed -between the Waterside Workers Federation and the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union for a long time. This is not the time to bring in a regulation of this kind. These men have done a good job. The Leader of the Senate has appealed for unity.

              <para>- No. If the honorable senator really believes in unity, why does he not give to both of these organizations representation on the committee, or at least representation in proportion to their numerical strength? Under this regulation, the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union is made subservient to the other organization. If the Leader of the Senate will give an assurance that representation on the committee shall be given to the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union in proportion to its membership I shall oppose the motion. Under the guise of a war effort, I am not going to permit men who came forward to help their country in time of need to be sacrificed merely in order to further a party political vendetta that has been going for years. </para>

            <para>. - If there is one State of the Commonwealth that is indebted to the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union, it is Queensland. That is not an empty statement. Honorable senators will recall that some three years ago I made an investigation of the work on the waterfront in Queensland, which is just as liable to come within the provisions of this regulation as the Port of Melbourne, of which we have heard so much. &#91; found that, at many Queensland ports from Port Douglas to Brisbane, membership of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union was practically equal to that of the Waterside Workers Federation. Therefore, at these ports, at least, it cannot be said that the former organization is a minority movement of a break-away union. The Queensland sugarcane-growers have a proper appreciation of what that union meant to the prosperity of that State in the dark days of 192S. Had it not been for the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union many primary producers in north Queensland would have been ruined, because, owing to a dispute on the waterfront, the Waterside Workers Federation would not handle sugar and other commodities. I made a thorough examination of conditions at the Queensland ports, and 1 found that in many instances the majority of members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union were returned soldiers of the war of 1914-18. I found also that there was complete harmony in most ports where members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union were working side by side with members of the Waterside Workers Federation. As a matter of fact, judging by the evidence which I heard, it would have been a good thing if these two unions did not have head-quarters in the capital cities. I found that the local branches of the unions were working in perfect harmony and quite capable of managing their affairs. It was often the intrusion of the secretaries of the unions from the main ports which created disorganization. I found quite a number of purely local complaints which were quite easily solved. In fact, I solved many of them with the assistance of the local secretaries of both unions and a representative of the employers. To say that the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union is a scab organization or is just a minority union is inviting trouble on the waterfront. This is not the time to strike a discordant note. If there is one thing that is required on the Australian waterfront to-day, it is complete unity. I contend that a continuance of this regulation will cause trouble because the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union is a virile body of men. As I have said, its members are mostly returned soldiers and they will not be bull-dozed into doing something that they do not want to do. They will take this as a direct insult to their organization. Furthermore, it is base ingratitude for the work that these men performed at some risk to themselves in 1928 when they cleared the wharfs in north Queensland of the cargoes which members of the Waterside Workers Federation refused to handle. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> I shall endeavour to assist the Government as far as possible, but I refuse to support a move which strikes at the present harmony in the northern Queensland ports. I have kept in touch with many of these people and so far as I have heard, there is no disunity in the union ranks under the Transport Workers Act. When making an inspection of these places, I did not interview only members of the various unions. I took evidence from cane-farmers and cutters, from the mill-owners and many others, and they were unanimous that members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union were deserving of the highest gratitude for their stand in 1928, and that they were competent in the job. Therefore, I propose to support the motion for the disallowance of this regulation, which I claim will result in disorder. </para>

            <para>. - I desire to correct one or two misconceptions of honorable senators opposite in regard to these regulations. It is suggested that the men who are affected to-day are those who came to the assistance of the nation on the waterfront in 1928. That statement is absurd. The main feature of the &#34; dog-collar &#34; regulation of the Latham Administration was that it applied not only to men registered to help the Government at that time, but also to men who were surreptitiously brought into the organization by the thousand. I challenge any honorable senator opposite to check the books of the organization which is now under discussion to ascertain the service that its members have had on the waterfront at any port of Australia. The fact is that the men who are on the books to-day are not those who came to the assistance of the nation at all. Those men went off the waterfront years ago. I remind honorable senators opposite that 1928 is fourteen years ago. The Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> and I, in the course of our industrial activities at that time, took part in the dispute and did our best to see that men were not sacrificed. I suggested recently, as I did during the regime of the Scullin Government to the then Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Brennan),</inline> that to settle the trouble on the waterfront permanently, a list should be obtained of the original registrations of men who came to the aid of the Government. These men could then be given whatever special treatment was considered fitting. My suggestion was not accepted. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> has said is not correct. These men have a federal registration and a federal award. Under this regulation none of these rights are to be violated. Regulation 15 pro vides - </para>

              <para>- Definitely, and I shall make many others. In the course of my duties as Minister for Trade and Customs, I have made an endeavour to see that congestion on the waterfront is alleviated. In the course of that job I visited the depot of the Waterside Workers Federation and that of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union in Melbourne. In fact I did more than that; I obtained extracts from their books showing the number of men registered and the average wages in these organizations. I found that the average wage was &#163;58s. a week for members of the Waterside Workers Federation and &#163;5 5s. a week for members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. The numbers in each organization are not in my possession, but they definitely indicate that, although the Waterside Workers Federation hasa huge nominal registration, actually it has not as many members as I thought it had. The other organization was in practically the same position, but, the vast majority were members of the Waterside Worker. </para>

          <para class="block">Federation. These men have their own registered unions. They are registered in the Arbitration Court. Without reflecting on that jurisdiction I am of the opinion that it is calamitous to have two unions registered in one industry. However, returning to the main point in my argument I contend that to say that to try to &#34; ring-in &#34; these men as returned soldiers as a reason why industrial justice should be done to them is quite wrong. I point out to the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald that in 1928 a government of the same political colour as the one which they supported until recently put 980 &#34; diggers &#34; on the sidewalks of Australia because they held the wrong political views. There was no talk in those days of loyalty to men who went overseas. I should like also to raise another point. The Transport, Workers Act was suspended with the acquiescence of every party represented in this chamber in an endeavour to ensure that the increasing tonnage of goods on the waterfront of Australia should be handled expeditiously. I do not believe that this regulation will interfere with that one iota. I say to the Leader of the Opposition, who always assumes an air of superiority, that his action is on a par with that which he took earlier to-day. He is not helping industrial peace by raising these matters. Does he think that the Government called together its Ministers, its officers and representatives of the employers and the union in order to frame these regulations merely for the good of its health? </para>

              <para>- I have not said that. The Transport Workers Act, under which waterside workers had to be licensed in Melbourne, Adelaide and the northern ports of Queensland, was suspended with the acquiescence of the Advisory War Council, in the definite hope of achieving an all-in industrial effort and with the object of ensuring that shipping movements should not be held up. </para>

          <para>The points that I make are that regulation . 15 does not, allow the federation to interfere with the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union&#39;s membership, and that regulation 17 provides for the industrial conditions of that union&#39;s members to be left untouched. Even without regulation 17 these men are already protected by a Federal Arbitration Court award, which grants them the same rights as the members of the Waterside Workers Federation. A third point is that the present members of the union are not those men about whom all this noise is being made. The regulation has been in operation since the 28th January, but I have not heard of any trouble on any waterfront in Australia. Why is objection raised now? Have the employers complained to the Opposition? The members of the Waterside Workers Federation have not complained, and the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union have not complained. Who has complained? Had these men complained, the Government would have taken immediate action. </para>

We shall give the people what they want so far as that is practicable, provided that we are not obliged to waste time in this chamber and are allowed to get down to our real job. The best job on the waterfront will necessarily be done by the members of the federation, who have spent practically a. lifetime in this industry. Honorable senators know what happened in 1928, when certain parts of Port Adelaide and Port Melbourne were deserted because the jobs of the federa tion members were taken away from them and given to men who, I suggest, do not belong to the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union to-day. I ask the Leader of the Opposition to take the first opportunity to check the statements which I have made to-night in order to see whether they are not correct. There would be some grounds for the Opposition&#39;s argument if there were in the union to-day the men who showed this alleged loyalty in 1928. </para>

            <para>. - On two occasions this afternoon the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> chided the Opposition with obstructing Ministers in their administra tive affairs. He has made it clear to us that he resents the Opposition exercising the rights that it has in this chamber. He has told us, and I agree entirely with his statement, that the work of a Minister in these extraordinary times is very onerous. I assure the Senate that the Opposition does not wish to obstruct the Government or interfere with its administrative duties. On the contrary, we on this side of the chamber have a sincere desire to help the Government in these most difficult days. The Government should do in this instance what it did on another occasion, when the Opposition showed its bona fides by helping the Government to make workable a completely unworkable regulation. The Opposition is prepared, at this stage, to withdraw the motion before the Senate, provided that the Government will undertake to submit the regulation to us so that we can assist the Government to make it workable. A great deal has been said regarding the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. One would imagine, from the speech of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> that this union had sprung into existence as the result of the 3trike of 1928. As a matter of fact, the union was established in 1917, and was registered in the State Court of New South Wales in that year. Furthermore, it was given federal registration a year before the strike referred to took place. The members of this union came to the assistance of the Government when the members of the Waterside Workers Federation, in defiance of the recommendations of their committee of management, refused to comply with the award of the Arbitration Court. The members of the union, which had then been in existence in one State for eleven years, came to the assistance of the country and observed the award of the court. The Minister has the temerity to suggest that, because men who were members of the union in 1928 are not members of the union to-day - and I cannot accept that statement- </para>

              <para>- Why was not the Waterside Workers Federation eliminated? I repeat that the Government, has, on the admission nf the Leader of the Senate, used the National Security Act and the exigencies of our war-time situation to implement what he has called one of the cardinal principles of the Labour party. It is well for the people to know that this Government is capable of implementing planks of the Labour party&#39;s policy in the guise of war-time measures. We resent and resist this action of the Government. If it is genuinely desirous of bringing about peace on the waterfront it will do as we ask and give to the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union representation on this committee of employment. We realize that, on a proportionate basis, the federation should be represented by two of the three members of the committee^ Surely that would give to the federation the protection to which it is entitled. Although the Minister for Trade and Customs has glibly said that there is nothing in these regulations to jeopardize the position of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union, I draw attention to the name of this committee - the Waterside Employment Committee. That is the body which will decide upon the employment of those who apply for work on the waterfront. To suggest that, under these conditions, the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union can be assured of equal opportunities for employment on the waterfront with members of the federation is to ask us to stretch our imaginations further than I am prepared to stretch mine. As to  regulation 15, I am not in a position to say whether the present membership of the two organizations is sufficient to carry out the work now required on the waterfront. If that be the fact, I suggest that, owing to the urgent demand for manpower, it may be necessary for the Government to prevent any further increase of the membership of those organizations. If the Government considers that the men now registered as members of the organizations are sufficient to carry out the work required on the waterfront, I have no objection to the prevention of additions to the membership, provided the restriction applies to both the Waterside Workers Federation and to the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union ; but to suggest that this regulation would not handicap the latter organization is an insult to one&#39;s intelligence. Regulation 15 states that the committee shall not refuse to register or cancel or suspend the registration of any waterside worker who is, at the date of commencement of these regulations, a member of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union of Australia by reason of the fact that the waterside worker is a member of that organization. In my opinion, this regulation was designed - and the Leader of the Senate has admitted it in his speech - to annihilate and eliminate the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. </para>

          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">They provide for a departure from the principle of &#34; divide and conquer &#34;,  a  principle on which the legislation known as the Transport Workers Act was based. In 1928, prices began to fall,  and  the supply of labour on the waterfront greatly exceeded the demand. To the degree that the supply of labour  exceeds  the demand, advantage is always taken by employers of the opportunity  to  reduce the price of labour power known as wages.  Action  of that kind invariably leads to industrial disputes. I have worked on the waterfront and  am  still a member of the Fremantle Lumpers Union. Week after week, month after month, and year after year, the principle adopted by the employers  is to discriminate,  divide and conquer. There  is  no continuity of work at all. The award may provide for the payment of 10s. an hour, but, if there is no work,  the  10s. means nothing. That happens in this age of civilization, among people who talk about equality and justice and the desire to do by their fellows what they desire to be done by. On the waterfront there is no right of  access to  the means by which the workers live. They stand  before  the representatives of the ship-owners who select the men they need. Day after day, they  are  submitted to this treatment, and they are reduced finally to living under conditions of semi-starvation. That  is the  background of what led up to the industrial dispute of 1928, and the Beeby award which provided for a deterioration of the conditions. The men who were prepared to accept a. reduction at the expense of their fellow workers received preference, were registered in the arbitration court and still have to be registered. That sort of thing can go on almost indefinitely while labour power is considerably in excess of the demand. We see the contemptible, cowardly and vicious practice of advantage being taken of the workers in the name of arbitration and British justice, by pitting one group against another for the purpose of reducing the price of their labour to the lowest level and increasing profits to the maximum. Then, when the  war  comes and man-power becomes more and more indispensable, the men who  were  denied employment prior to the war  are wail ted to help in the defence of their country. Even while those men are defending us, honorable senators opposite us still say that we should give effect to the vicious and cowardly principle to which I have directed attention. </para>
          <para class="block">I say dispassionately, and I trust convincingly, that this will not be done to the degree which honorable senators anticipate, because, as pointed out by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> the relations between the men on the waterfront have much improved, and they will not allow themselves to be used in the same way as in the past. The relations between the &#39;two organizations have improved because there is more workto be done and their labour power is essential. The members of the organizations do what honorable senators opposite would do if they were in their places. When a worker is indispensable he insists on what he has a right to ask for. He demands the consideration, remuneration and treatment generally to which he is entitled. If the great desire of most of us were given effect overnight, and peace were declared, and if all the waterside workers came back, causing labour power to be greatly in excess of the demand, the employers would attempt to do precisely as they did before the war, that is, reduce as many as possible down to the level of working in return for the dole. That cannot be done now, because the present situation makes it necessary to extend a measure of justice to men to whom it was previously denied ; but, unfortunately, the facts are never brought  as frequently and as prominently to the notice of the public as they should be. The object of the amended regulations is -to establish a better state of affairs on the waterfront than obtained previously. It is an attempt to prevent the ship-owners from using the Permanent and Casual &#34;Wharf Labourers Union against the members of the other union, and to remove the things which lead to industrial disputes and bacl feeling, and possibly to something even more serious after the war. &#34;We want the best relations possible between man and man in this country. I should not be averse from discussing the pros and cons of this subject if the nation were not at war: but the fact is that honorable senators opposite are attempting to take advantage of the Government&#39;s effort to establish better relations on the waterfront. </para>

              <para>- I have already pointed out that where there are more men than jobs the Arbitration Court awards makes no provision for the men without jobs. Its awards provide only for the men who are privileged to be employed. As the number of men either unemployed or without sufficient employment increases, a dispute becomes inevitable. All the arbitration systems that have ever been established will not prevent industrial disputes so long as no provision is made to deal effectively with the cause of such disputes. Denial of freedom of access to the means by -which men live is the cause of disputes. If honorable senators who do not know what it is to feel want were to try t.f&#62; understand the position from the other fellow&#39;s point of view, their approach to these questions would be vastly different. I am convinced that, if, by a turn of the wheel of fortune, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> and other honorable senators opposite were forced to work on the wharfs, they would be no more prepared to put, up with the conditions that were protested against than were the men then employed on th&#34; wharfs. The Minister for Trade and Customs has pointed out that whereever possible honorable senators opposite use returned soldiers to bolster up a weak case; but they have not referred to the returned soldiers, numbering more &#39;than 900, who were reduced to the breadline and below it as a result of the passing&#39; of the Transport Workers Act. Is that fair reasoning? Representatives of the people in this Parliament should try to take all of the circumstances into consideration, and when they condemn men for going on strike they should try to see what lies behind their action. If they did that, I believe that industrial disputes would be less frequent. In submitting his case the Leader of the Opposition did not say that the ship-owners or the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union had objected to these regulations. </para>

              <para>- I thought that if the Leader of the Opposition were submitting a case on behalf of a section of workers or on behalf of employers, as he now claims, he would have said so. In the absence of any such statement, I was justified in assuming that he had no brief for them. So far as I know, the shipowners have never objected to these regulations. It must be remembered that the Government found it necessary to take action against a section of shipowners who refused to guarantee to the seamen anything in the nature of compensation to either themselves or their dependants for injury or death due to enemy action. Honorable senators opposite who complained of waterside workers holding up ships, made no mention of the fact that supplies for troops at Darwin were held up by certain shipowners, that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon and others had to intervene, and that the Government had to take steps to remedy the situation in the interests of the troops. </para>

              <para>- That is the honorable senator&#39;s way of expressing his view. My view is that all industrial disputes have their origin in action taken by the employers, who are accessories both before and after the fact. Had it not been for employers, through the medium of- the Arbitration Court and otherwise, attempting to reduce wages and conditions, there would have been no industrial dispute. When the Leader of the Opposition attributes to a Minister dirty tactics, I say, as one with some knowledge of psychology, that he is attributing to another person the despicable traits which he himself possesses.

              <para>- I do not deny that the honorable senator had a good case, but he spoiled it by indulging in personalities. I do not call the members of the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union &#34; scabs &#34;, nor do I wish to. do anything which would make their position worse. In all the years that I have been privileged to organize on behalf of the trade union movement my appeal has been to the finer instincts of my hearers. I have appealed to their reason, but, of course, such an appeal does not, succeed where people have never culti-. vated the habit of reasoning, and are more or less controlled by prejudice. Ostensibly, the Opposition wants to assist the Government to win the war and officially it makes that claim; but in reality it takes every opportunity to embarrass the Government, not in respect of major principles or things which mean a great deal to the people, hut in relation to minor and petty matters. There is no serious trouble in either the coal-mining industry or on the waterfront at the present time. On the contrary, conditions there are immeasurably better than they were. The Government is certain that it can do a great deal to remove the antagonism that has existed between two competing groups of men for jobs and for the favour of employers - a system under which one group gets more than it needs and the other group gets insufficient for its needs. Where we can prevent effect being given to the policy of &#34; divide and conquer &#34;, we shall do so, knowing that to the degree that we are successful we are assisting the nation&#39;s war effort. To the degree that we can do that, we shall build up unity in the widest and broadest sense for the time being among all sections of the community. The trade unions are sacrificing privileges which they should not be called upon to sacrifice; but they are prepared to do so. Only a couple of weeks ago I attended a meeting of the Trades Hall Council when it proposed to hold the Labour Day procession as usual. I then made the same appeal to the delegates as I make to honorable senators opposite to-night. I appealed to them to forget everything in a united effort to win the war. I told them that their processions could go on after the war. They agreed, and abandoned the procession. The trade unions have also agreed to the reduction of wages all along the line through the medium of the dilution of labour, which means a reduction of the average rate of pay. I appeal to honorable senators not to raise petty issues which only irritate people who are trying to do a better job than they did in the past. Do not try to open up old wounds with the intention of rubbing salt into them. If you do that you will not help to win the war. </para>

              <para>- The Government opened up this issue by the gazettal of these regulations. We were told by the honorable senator in the course of his speech, in various  phrases  which meant the same thing, that the position on the waterfront, and I agree with him, has improved immeasurably. He also told us that relationships on the waterfront were much better than previously. I agree with him on that point also. In that set of circumstances, when the relationship between these two bodies of men was improving, the Government introduced regulations designed to slowly murder one of those organizations. The regulations are in no way associated with the task of winning the war. We had a long speech from the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> on this subject, when he had much to say about democracy but little to say about these regulations. I believe that if we are to preserve our democracy in Australia it is essential that this chamber should see that this kind of thing does not take place. The Ministry is charged with a tremendous responsibility. Parliament has given to it enormous powers for one purpose and one purpose only, namely, to enable it to take any action which it thinks necessary for the defence of this Commonwealth. It is a distinct abuse of those powers to use them for other purposes. So long as I find a government doing that, I shall resist it to the utmost. The strongest condemnation of these regulations was provided in the speech of the Leader of the Senate when he opposed the motion. He did not attempt to show that the regulations are necessary for the defence of Australia. That is what he should have done. He told us frankly that they are for the purpose of giving effect to a cardinal principle of Labour&#39;s policy.

Indeed, the Minister for Aircraft Production has stated that conditions were improving prior to the promulgation of the regulation on the 28th January.

              <para>- We are only asking that the Government shall have some regard to his point of view. He has been- working on the wharfs for years in accordance with the law of the land. He belongs to an organization which is recognized by the Arbitration Court, and is a perfectly lawful organization. Consequently, the Government is not justified in putting that organization upon a different basis from that of the Waterside Workers Federation. We do not raise these issues for the purpose of making political capital. I remind the Leader of the Senate that the Opposition has done much to assist the Government to put its most atrocious regulations into some kind of order. Regulation 76 was most outrageous; and when the honorable senator sees the revised version he will see the value of consulting the Opposition in such matters. We now give to the Government an opportunity to follow a similar course in respect of these regulations. In the interests of our war effort and the community as a whole, and in the interests of justice to these men, the Government should consult with honorable senators on this side of the chamber, and agree upon an amendment of these regulations which will ensure a reasonable, sensible and workable scheme. I urge the Government to amend regulation 5 by giving one representative out of the three to the Permanent and Casual Wharf Labourers Union. </para>

We have been discussing this matter now for six hours in an endeavour to get some modification, but the Government apparently is not prepared to do anything about it. All that is necessary is to amend these two regulations in the way indicated, and I believe that by so doing we shall be contributing to harmony on the waterfront. If these regulations are persisted with, far from assisting our war effort, they will create disharmony and put a serious brake on the war effort on the waterfront at least. </para>

          <para>.  - I should like to have a few words to say in regard to the gold-mining industry in Western Australia., and I take this opportunity to direct a few questions to the Minister representing the Treasurer. My questions are as follows: - </para>
        </talk.start>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="1.">
            <para>In view of the Prime Minister&#39;s statement that the limitation of profits to 4 per cent, will not apply until the 1st July of this year, will the tax apply to the profits made in the gold-mining industry from the 1st July, 1941, to the 30th June, 1942, or will the tax be collected monthly on the profits commencing on the 1st July,. 1942? </para>
          </item>
          <item label="2.">
            <para>In view of the fact that a number of gold-mining companies have already distributed interim dividends for their operations commencing on the 1st July last year, is the distribution of these dividends now prohibited if over the 4 per cent, limit under section 5 of the regulations in question? </para>
          </item>
          <item label="3.">
            <para>In the amending regulations or taxing legislation to be introduced on the 1st July next, will the Minister representing the Treasurer insist on a proper definition of profits? These should be expressly defined as being the taxable profits within the meaning of section 3 of the War-time (Company) Tax Assessment Act, which is the taxable income of the taxpayer as assessed under the Commonwealth Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>Great confusion has been caused in the industry by rumours and press reports, and if the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> could elucidate those points I am sure he would be conferring some benefit on this harassed industry. Already, Western Australian members of Parliament, have&#39; interviewed the Treasurer on the question of the preservation of reasonable conditions in the gold-mining industry. I am confident that if anything were to happen to that industry, especially in view of the fact that wheat production in Western Australia is to be curtailed by 60 per cent. , as against 30 per cent, in Victoria and New South Wales, the results will be disastrous, and a premature &#34; scorched earth &#39;&#34;&#39; policy will be applied to that State. In other words, our hinterland will become empty, leaving a thin coastal belt occupied by few people. I hope that in replying to my question, the Treasurer will give due regard to the gold-mining industry, which <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> in Western Australia look upon with the same reverence as the sugar industry is looked upon in Queensland. It has the same relative economic value to our State, and I urge that its continuance be facilitated to the greatest possible degree. </para>

          <para>. - After listening to the debate which took place in this chamber to-day, one would never have thought Australia was at war. I have a real grievance which I would like to bring to the notice of honorable senators. It relates to taxation payments by our soldiers, many of whom have been overseas for two years.

              <para>Income tax assessments which are now issuing for the financial year 1941 -42 are based upon the income derived by taxpayers during the year ended 30th June, 1941. The principle of assessing a person&#39;s tax liability for one financial year on the basis of what that person earned during the preceding year is firmly established in the Australian tax system and causes little concern where there is relative stability in the income from year to year. Where there is a serious drop in the income as between one year and the next difficulties inevitably arise and such difficulties are aggravated where, as has occurred during the last few years, there are sudden and severe increases in the rates of tax. </para>

              <para>At the present time thousands of men are being called up for military service or arc volunteering. A large number are leaving profitable civilian occupations. In some cases private incomes will continue and in other cases will cease. Most will have income tax liabilities to meet in respect of the last financial year. Assessments of this <inline font-style="italic">-year&#39;s</inline> liability  will issue during the next few months. In the case of salary-earners complications will arise from the fact that tax instalments will have been levied up to the termination of the civilian occupation and will continue or not depending upon the rate of army pay. In practically every case the enlisted person will have to face heavy tax liabilities out of seriously depleted means. Several cases have been reported in the press recently of persons facing acute difficulties because of enlistment with the forces. </para>

        <para>Only yesterday, it was brought to my notice that persons who enlisted at Canberra and who occupy houses owned by the Government are granted a reduction of 20 per cent, or 25 per cent, of their rent. I know a man with a wife and six children who enlisted as a private and, by hard work and interest in his job, reached the rank of sergeant. Recently, the authorities issued a notice that, in consequence of his promotion, the amount of rent reduction granted to him would be discontinued. That seems to me to be a grave injustice. I do not think that the men who go overseas to fight should be called upon to pay one penny in. taxation. Many of them have given up good positions, as I and other honorable senators well know. They are suffering, or may have to suffer, the horrors of war in the front line and they should not be called upon to pay taxes as were the soldiers in the last war. On that occasion, the men who served subsequently had to pay. Widows and orphan children also were called upon to pay taxes. That situation should receive  the immediate attention of members of the Parliament with a view to the prevention of .a similar happening during or after this war. </para>

          <para>.- I&#34; bring to the notice of the Minister representing the Minister for the Army the subject of the reduction or cancellation of dependants&#39; allowances. I have in mind the case of a widowed mother to whom her soldier son originally allotted 3s. 6d. a day. She was then in employment and earning &#163;3 5s. a week. In due course, her wages were increased to &#163;4 a week. She helps to keep her father, an old-age pensioner. The Army Pay Office became aware of her circumstances, and cancelled the son&#39;s allotment. The official view was that the mother could not he regarded as dependent upon the son for her support. No exception can be taken to that ruling. But I ask whether the Army Pay Office makes similar inquiries in all like cases? It would be a big contract, admittedly, since there must be thousands of persons in receipt of dependants&#39; allowances. A start might be made with young wives in munitions and other establishments. They are earning, I venture to say, far more a week, including overtime, than the mother whose case I cited. In addition, they are probably living with their parents while their soldier husbands are overseas. </para>

        <para>Another matter - email, I admit - indicates lack of co-ordination between the Army and the Royal Australian Air Force and might- have serious consequences in bigger questions if the liaison between the two services be not closer. A father wrote to me as follows : - </para>

About 22nd January, 1942, he was called by the Royal Australian Air Force, Russell-street, Melbourne, for medical and intelligence examination, passing these tests and receiving his reserve badge and papers; also advised to attend classes for the purpose of  being  freshened up on the necessary subjects prior to going into the initial training school, but finds he is nimble to get out of his battalion in Mount Martha military camp to follow up these subjects. </para>

        <para>The younger son evidently has no special qualifications to justify his retention in the Army, for he is doing a normal infantryman&#39;s duty on a battle station. I hope that the Minister concerned will give instructions for closer liaison in such matters. There must be no watertight departments in the present crisis. </para>
        <para>When the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> advocated last week in this chamber that a national government should be formed, the Minister for External Territories interjected, &#34; The majority of electors were opposed to such a government&#34;. The only time the question was put to the electors was at the federal elections in 1940. Foremost in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies&#39;s</inline> policy speech was the necessity for a national government. The United Australia party and United Country party candidates on every platform urged that this was a vital question as a national government was the best during war-time. In <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin&#39;s</inline> policy speech no mention was made of a national government. He and the other Labour candidates did not favour the proposal. Labour conferences also opposed it. Shortly after the new Parliament met, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> offered <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> one-half of the portfolios of the Cabinet and even went so far as to suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> should be Prime Minister. Still the Labour caucus would not come into line. It flouted the wishes of the majority of electors who supported the formation of a national government during the present crisis. An analysis of the Senate returns for the federal elections in 1940 shows that 3,632,817 formal votes were recorded. Omitting 443,219 votes obtained by independents, non-official Labour candidates, Communists, and other candidate.?, the straight-out advocates of a national government secured a majority of 472,660 votes over Labour Senate candidates, who opposed such a proposition. The official figures were - United Australia party and United Country- party Senate candidates, 1,831,129 votes; Labour candidates, 1,358,469 votes. That was a clear mandate to Parliament from the people of Australia to drop party politics. and&#39; an instruction  to form a national  government. Since  the  Curtin  Government  came into power five months ago, with the aid of two so-called independents, it has done well in helping the nation&#39;s war effort, chiefly because of the foundation laid by the Menzies Government. The war situation, since the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour on the 7th December last, has been responsible for the Opposition&#39;s acquiescence in many of the Government&#39;s decisions. &#34;We have a keen appreciation of the great responsibility resting on the shoulders of the Prime Minister and his colleagues - hence the absence of serious criticism. The chief charge levelled against the Government; is that some ministers are prone to play party politics and to put the former Government in the wrong whenever possible. The public was prepared to overlook such indiscretions, but when the Curtin Government besmirched its short career by giving effect to a far-reaching socialistic plank of its platform, in the midst of a life and death struggle, their indignation was aroused. Electors generally never dreamed that the Governmentwould use the National Security Act to introduce legislation by means of regulations to strike a blow at our economic system. In doing so it has made a grave mistake. Though these emergency regulations have been modified under pressure from the Opposition, there is still, in the minds of a majority of electors, an air of suspicion and distrust. The proposed regulations have done, or are likely to do, to our war effort exactly what Hit  ler  desires. It is part of the axis technique to divide a nation, and to create dissension amongst sections of the community. There is no time in the middle of a war for socialistic and dangerous f i n a nci a.l ex periments. </para>
        <para>Almost daily, over the air and in &#34; hand-outs &#34; to press representatives, there is a plea by Cabinet Ministers to all sections of the people to refrain from controversies likely to retard the nation&#39;s war effort. Yet the Government had no hesitation in bringing forward a most, controversial economic proposal, the object of which could have been achieved  more equitably by an enlargement of the field for taxation. That is not the way  to obtain co-operation in  this most serious  period of  Australia&#39;s history. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> in opening the Liberty Loan recently, said - </para>

        <para class="block">The Prime Minister should address thenext Labour- Conference on the same linesand urge co-operation with the representatives of the majority of electors. Tocarry on without a national government i--&#34; to flout the wishes of the majority. That isagainst all democratic principles. It is not too late now to rectify this omission. A. national! government would bringabout a more united war effort since it would put into cold storage party ambitions and pet socialistic schemes until the war is won. The discussion in this chamber to-night has demonstrated theneed for a national government. The public desires to know how much longer the brains and energies of Opposition senators and members with extensive administrative experience are to remain unemployed? </para>
        <para>SenatorFRASER  (Western Australia - Minister for External Territories) &#91;11.46&#93;. - I shall give consideration to the points raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand.</inline> Of course, he is aware that, when a married soldier is serving overseas, his wife receives the allotment, made to him whether she works or not. As to the honorable senator&#39;s comments about theneed for a national government I thought that that matter had met with a natural death. We have had a political display in this chamber to-night which does not do credit to the Senate. For some hour; we have been discussing the disallowance of certain regulations, and it might be- said that our time could have been spent to some purpose more directly associated with the war. Despite the efforts of members of the Opposition to have the regulations disallowed, they were unable to convince even some of their own followers that the Government had acted wrongly in the matter. The Government and its supporters recognize the futility of the debate that, has taken place this evening. It was political from the commencements yet the Opposition raised the well-worn cry that its object was to assist the Government. It is true that the last elections were fought on the issue of a national government, but I venture to suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> that, had the Menzies Government been returned with <inline font-style="italic">u</inline> majority of half a dozen members in the House of Representatives, there would not have been any talk of a national government either then or now. The Menzies Government failed to secure the number of followers it had prior to the election, therefore it could hardly be claimed that it received a mandate to form a national government. Labour increased the number of seats held by it in the House of Representatives and obtained a majority of one. The formation of a national government would be contrary to the democratic system of government. I invite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> to point to one thing that the present Government has failed to do in order to assist in the prosecution of the war. Can he mention one thing that was humanly possible that the Government has not done during the last five months? Not one suggestion has been made by him. I remind the honorable senator that he voted against a regulation that was designed to secure a 100 per cent, production of coal in the interests of the war effort. Fortunately, some of his own colleagues, did not see eye to eye with him, and thoi motion for the disallowance of a. regulation dealing with the coal industry was not agreed to. The matters that the honorable senator has raised on the adjournment do not convince me that a. national government would have been sought by his own party had it been returned at the last elections with a larger majority than it obtained. The honorable senator has admitted that the present Government has done a good job. I am hopeful, that the response to the appeal for support of the Liberty Loan will&#39; show that the public believes that this Government has done all that is possible for the defence of Australia and the winning of the war. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline>ARTHUR  (New South Wales)  1  11. 52&#93;. - I draw the attention of the Government to a decree that has been issued in connexion with the District </para>
        <para class="block">Records Office in Sydney where the female employees were notified yesterday that they must join the Army. They have been given eight or ten days in which to do this. If they refrain from joining within the time specified they are threatened with dismissal. At least 20 or 30 of these employees are withdrawing from their employment to-day because they arc advised that if they join the Army they will receive only 4s. a day. I wish to know from whom that decree has emanated, and whether widows and girU who support their parents are to be required to work for 4s. a day. This matter should receive the attention of the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde).</inline> If these employees are to be forced into this position, some means should be devised whereby they could  be  protected. </para>
        <para>I direct the attention of the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> to certain excise duties recently imposed on beer. I am informed by accountant? that in Melbourne beer is being sold in 4-oz. glasses whereby the liquor trade passes on to the  consumers  the excise, plus 22  per cent. I also  understand  that by means of the 7-oz. glasses the excise is passed on, plus 9 per cent, and on the 11-oz. glasses the excise is passed on, plus 2i per cent. The excise on bottled beer is 2s. a dozen, but the trade has actually passed on 3s. a dozen. One man who has recently retired  informed  me that he sold 16,000 dozen bottles of beer  last  year. The matter should engage the attention of the Government. </para>
        <para>I ask the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development whether it is a fact that the Commonwealth Government has decided, in conjunction with the  Government  of Victoria, to make a search for petroleum oil in this country? Is it drilling at Nelson near the border of South Australia and Victoria, and utilizing a plant weighing 300 tons? Is the selected site 50 feet from another site, where a bore was sunk 1,500 feet by a man named Steinbuchel, whom a member of the Opposition when a Minister a couple of years ago, refused permission to remain in this country ? Has boring, been carried to a depth of  2,700 feet on this site, and is water being obtained from Steinbuchel&#39;s bore for use in the boilers? Does the Commonwealth propose to defray one-half of the cost of the drilling and the casing? Does it refuse to allow this gentleman to return to Australia, with his money and plant. when he has guaranteed to provide 1,000 barrels of oil a day? </para>
        <para>Has any consideration been given to the newer retorts that are now obtainable, such as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> W. Dye, of Sydney? These can be made available without cost to the Government, for the production of the petrol that is needed in this country. Is it to be said that nothing can be done? I contend that we should move as quickly as possible. There should be no red tape. No official should be permitted to place obstacles in the way of the production of oil. </para>
        <para>The Minister for the Army should take steps to have withdrawn from administrative positions men of military age who are in class 1, and who have had neither experience nor training, but have been appointed solely because of their social associations. Victoria Barracks, Sydney, contains some of the greatest nitwits that this country has ever produced. They have pips on their shoulders merely because they are associated with members of the Imperial Service Club or the Automobile Club. I hope that the Government will realize that they should be put into the Army to be trained as privates, and should graduate from that stage, instead of being allotted to instructional duties in the Militia, as is proposed. In Major-General Wynter and MajorGeneralFewtrell we have two first-class men, but the men who hold positions under them have no military knowledge whatever. </para>
