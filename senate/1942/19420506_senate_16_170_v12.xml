                        <para>- The honorable senator notified me that he intended to ask this question, and I have obtained a reply. There is no breakdown in telephone communication between the mainland and Tasmania, but it was reported to me this morning that the lines between Canberra and Melbourne have been interrupted intermittently. This is due to certain line trouble at Wagga, but contact with Melbourne has been maintained by routing calls through Sydney. Work to effect the necessary repairs is <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> progress. </para>

                    <para>May, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> asked me a question, <inline font-style="italic">without notice,</inline> as to the stage that had been reached with regard to the use of Tasmanian woods for aircraft production.I undertook to furnish a report as to the progress that has been made, and I now wish to inform the honorable senator that extensive investigations have been made into this matter by my department in. collaboration with the Division of Forest Products of the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. An officer of the Forestry Division was sent to Tasmania to select timber suitable for aircraft purposes from a number of Tasmanian species. Fifteen trees each of Mountain Ash (Swamp Gum), Alpine Ash (Gum Top or Whitetop Stringybark), and thirty trees each of Blackwood, King William Pine, Celery Top Pine and Leatherwood were selected and suitable lengths forwarded to the division in Melbourne for testing. Extensive mechanical tests were carried out and have been completed for all species, with the exception of Celery Top Pine. Altogether, over  50,000  individual tests were made, and to carry out the work as rapidly as possible, the testing machines were operated on a two-shift basis. The results of these tests showed that Mountain Ash and Alpine Ash were suitable for major structural parts of  aircraft.  Through the Standards Association of Australia, emergency standard specifications were drawn up and these have been published. King William Pine was shown to be suitable for lightly stressed and unstressed parts where its light weight  is a  very desirable factor. An emergency specification is in course of preparation and will be issued shortly. Meanwhile, 10,000 super feet of King William Pine have been supplied against aircraft requirements. Blackwood and Celery Top Pine do not appear to he so promising. Leatherwood appeared to be suitable for plywood, so a large number of  logs  were peeled on the lathe of the division and extensive tests on the veneer and plywood were carried out. An emergency specification for leatherwood plywood  has  been published and the material  is at present  undergoing a practical test in  service  aircraft. The results so far are  very promising.  Aircraft specifications  are very  exacting and besides the question  of inherent  suitability of the timber, there  is  the problem of supply in the  quality  desired. Usually it is found  that only a  small percentage of the timber  cut is  suitable for aircraft work. </para>

                        <para>- The Government, having the full facts before it, decided on certain ways and means of remedying the industrial troubles in the coal industry. I do not purpose here to discuss the methods that have been tried, except to say that when the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> makes threats to the workers engaged in any industry, he should be prepared, if challenged, to carry them out. More than three months ago he made a public statement that the coal-miners must work or fight; but up to the present he has not been prepared' to implement that threat. Coal being a source of power for most of our war industries, it is an essential commodity at this time. </para>

                </continue><para>In approaching this subject, I should like to comment quite briefly on the conditions prevailing in the industry. Since the outbreak of war, the wages of those engaged in it have been increasedby 27 per cent., and the hours worked have been reduced from 44 to 40 per week. I shall not discuss the questions of wages and conditions on their merits or demerits, and I mention them only to indicate that those engaged in this industry have received generous consideration by the industrial tribunals of this country. I have information relating to the earnings of the contract workers in one large colliery in the north of New South Wales for the fortnight ended the 18th April last, which is a quite recent date. The figures represent the average, not the individual, earnings of the men. During that period, the average wages earned per day were: miners, 40s. 2d. ; cutters, 52s. 8d. ; borers, 47s. 6d. ; and wheelers, 31s. 4d. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- I do not know whether present conditions in the coal industry represent the Minister's idea of peace and continuity, to my mind they represent the opposite. When the Commonwealth Government asked the employees in the industry to work on Easter Monday, they protested, and the  president  of the Miners Central Executive, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Wells,</inline> in justification of the objection, said that the men were overworked, and that the human machine required rest. Because of this pressure the Government eventually declared Easter Monday a holiday in the coal-mining industry. Honorable senators ought to he informed of the hours worked by miners, so that they can judge for themselves whether the coalmining industry, of all industries connected with the war effort, should have Easter Monday declared a holiday. The facts are that, under their award, coalminers are now required to work eight hours a day for five days a week, so that, if they worked full time, they would have two days per week for a rest period. That, however, is not the whole story, because the eight hours are calculated from the time the first man enters a pit until the last man has been brought to the surface after his day's work. </para>

                        <para>- I have no comment to make on it; 1 am merely trying to state the facts. It is impossible under the conditions I have outlined for any man to work at the coal face for the full eight hours a day; but the probability is that, deducting the time taken to travel from the pit to the working places, less a half-hour meal period, which also is deducted from the eight-hour period, the average production time will be little more than six hours a. day. During an investigation of holiday pay made in December last, it was stated that the average working time in all pits for the year 1941 was four days per week, which is equivalent to 208 days per year. Applying this weekly period, it means that the contract miner works 24 hours out of the total weekly hours of 168, or a little more than 14 per cent. of his time. If he worked the full five instead of four days his working time would be 30 hours per week of 168 hours, or 17.8 of his time. The court has granted him holidays amounting to approximately two weeks per annum. That is based on the number of days he actually works, but I understand that the intention is that if he works his time, he should be allowed a fortnight's holiday per annum'. The miners work at the face for production on the morning shift only, but in some instances on developmental work an afternoon shift is operated. That is done, however, only to a very limited extent. It will be realized that under these very favorable conditions the people of this country are entitled to expect continuity of work in the industry. I. should like to make it quite clear that I do not suggest that the coal-miners are out to sabotage our war effort, or are in any way disloyal. In fact, at the moment, quite deliberately I say exactly the opposite. The number of en listments from coal-mining areas refutes any suggestion of disloyalty; but I do think that some coal-miners are what I shall describe as joyously irresponsible. Apparently they do not yet realize the seriousness of this war, and are endeavouring to continue their activities on a peace-time basis. That is to say, in time of peace they started disputes and strikes over what might be called frivolous complaints, and they are continuing in the same manner. In addition to the other benefits which I have already mentioned, the coal-miners are now enjoying a pension to which men now receiving pensions have not contributed one penny. It is true that in future they will be called upon to contribute approximately 2s. 6d. a week or a maximum of £6 10s. per annum, and that, I think, is an admirable way of meeting the position. I should like to point out that these privileges which the miners enjoy, and which I am not questioning at the moment, are costing a total of 8d. on every ton of coal produced - 5d. a ton for the pension right, and 3d. a ton for the holiday right. Therefore, I am confident that most people agree that the miners are being generously treated by the community. </para>

                </continue><para>I was very interested to read an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> of 21st November, 1941, contributed by the general secretary of the Miners Federation, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grant,</inline> which stated that from information which the writer had received from Chatwood Hall, Moscow, a very fine example had been set by Russian miners to the miners of all allied countries in their fight against Fascism. The article points out that production norms, which in Russia are the same as dargs in Australia, became something not merely to be fulfilled but to he many times over-fulfilled, although many miners of military service age had been called to the front. Even women and miners on pension, their patriotism reaching new heights and their bitter hatred of Fascism aroused to fever pitch, are voluntarily contributing their share to the struggle on the coal front to smash Hitlerism once and for all. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grant</inline> then cites some instancesof the results of this patriotic fervour. He names three miners and says that between the time of descending their pit at the normal hour, and reaching the surface again at the end of their shift, they produced twelve times as much coal as their regular norm called for. In the same pit the driver of an underground coal train f ound that the two loaders of the gondola wagons had beencalled up by the army. Undeterred, the driver decided to do the loading of his own wagons as well as driving the train. He exceeded by 80 per cent. the ordinary volume of work done by two workers. These are not my statements ; they were cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grant</inline> and I accept the authenticity of them. </para><interjection>

                        <para>- We have a nationalized mine in New South Wales, but I have not heard of it achieving results such as those which I have cited. With these amazing examples before them, I believe that the coal-miners of Australia will be prepared to produce their quota in a like manner in order to further the allied cause. </para>

                </continue><para>From time to time we hear allegations that huge profits are being amassed by the employers in the coal-mining industry, but I suggest that the coal-mining industry is the last one against which such a charge should be made. I should like to place before honorable senators in a concise form the financial position of this ' industry to-day. Figures with respect to coal-mining companies in New South Wales, appearing in the <inline font-style="italic">Stock Exchange Gazette,</inline> show a paid-up capital of £5,324,290 which, if it had been invested in 4 per cent. Commonwealth loans would have returned to shareholders the sum of £2,129,716 during the ten-year period from 1931 to 1940 inclusive. However, so unprofitable was the industry during this period that dividends of only £760,801 were received by shareholders, representing less than 1½ per cent. per annum on the capital invested. In other words, if instead of developing  the  coal-mines the shareholders had played safe  and  put their money into Commonwealth loans they would have benefited by an amount of £1,368.915. In addition' to that, we mustrealize that coal-mines are a depreciating asset and that during the ten-year period to which I have referred coal deposits were reduced by approximately 100,000,000 tons. </para><para>I should like to make some brief observations in regard to what I think could he done  to  improve the position on the coal-fields. Every industry in this country has been or is being classified in order of priority. Some industries - those classed as non-essential or luxury industries - are being severely restricted or completely wiped out. Other industries are being restricted in various ways and the essential industries are being boosted in order to produce those things which we need for the conduct  01"  the war. Even in the essential industries plant and man-power are being rationalized and reorganized in order to achieve maximum production. In most cases the industrial unions have co-operated very fully in meeting these altered conditions. For instance, the engineering unions have agreed to the dilution of labour, but so far no such call has been made upon the employees in the coal industry. In fact, owing to the irresponsible attitude of some of the men the production per man in this industry has not increased at all. The Government should seriously consider taking steps, in which it should have the co-operation of both the employers and the employees, to increase the rate ofproduction and at the same time economize in man-power during the war period. Further mechanization of mines is one method of effecting economy. Some degree of mechanization has been introduced in a number of mines,but these developments have alwaysbeen strenuously resisted by the employees' industrial organizations. In war-time, the employees should co-operate to the fullest degree in bringing about  the  mechanization of mines. I am reliably informed that the ratio of output per man as between a fully mechanized mine and a hand-worked mine is 5 to 3; in other words, a 60 per cent. increase of output could be brought about 'by mechanizing those mines which are capable of being mechanized. I realize that certain mines are unsuitable for complete mechanization, but many others could be profitably mechanized in order to assist war production. Further,I suggest that mining could quite well,  for  the duration of the war, be confined  to  certain pits where conditions are good, working easy, and the haul from the pit to the port is the shortest possible distance. If some of the more distant  collieries were temporarily closed down and the workers transferred to other collieries, the aggregate production might well be increased. This would mean, of course, that the miners would have to agree to working at least two shifts per day, but, as the coal-miners of Great Britain are working two, and in some instances three shifts daily in the collieries of that country, I believe that Australian miners would be prepared to render a similar national service. </para><interjection>

                </continue><para>I refer now to the subject of coal trucks, which constitute a very important link in the production and transportation of coal. At present, collieries, or groups of collieries, have their own trucks for the transport of their coal from the pit to the point of shipment. It frequently occurs that some collieries at particular periods are actually short of trucks, which causes a. hold-up of production, whilst other collieries have a surplus of empty trucks. Some arrangement could be made to pool these trucks so that, in instances like this, trucks belonging to any colliery could be sent to a colliery where a shortage existed. This matter would have to be discussed between the owners, 'but I believe that a solution could readily be found. Apparently, the public, and indeed the miners, do not realize what continual stoppages mean to our war production. Owing to the frequent stoppages on the south coast insufficient coal is being produced at one place to keep important war industries in full production. In order to meet this need about 5,000 tons of coal per week is being railed from Newcastle to the south coast - a distance of about 150 miles. This is an intolerable position. At present, one of the real bottle-necks in our industrial and service organizations is transport, and because of the irresponsibility of certain miners, this huge volume of freight space is taken from other essential uses in order to carry coal from Newcastle, as it were, to Newcastle. The public will not be pleased with this state of affairs, particularly in view of the fact that, in order to conserve man-power, coal, and rolling stock, the normal services on the New South Wales railways have been substantially curtailed. Whilst I have no doubt that Australians are prepared to submit to necessary curtailment, cuts brought about or accentuated by actions such as these will not be tolerated by the public at large. The widest possible publicity should be given to matters such as this so that the public can express its views upon them. </para><continue>

                        <para>- It is a matter of cold fact. When my friend says that the miners are difficult, I tell him that his statement is quite true; but they are difficult because of the damnable conditions under which they have had to work throughout the centuries. It was within the recollection of my forbears that, prior to the passage by Lord Shaftesbury of the Reform Bill, women, stripped naked to the waist, and with chains round their waists, were employed in the coal mines in England. So poor and degraded were they that action had to be taken, not because the miners were difficult, but because coal-mining was difficult. </para>

                        <para>- I intend to do that. We are told now that the coal miner works only six hours a day. I do not wish to be unkind to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride,</inline> but he could not stand up to one hour of the work in a coal mine on any day, let alone work for six hours a day. Some time ago, during a long parliamentary recess, I had the opportunity to do some trout fishing on the Murrumbidgee River. I camped for a week, and one of the men I met - he was not in my camp - was one of the biggest coal mine-owners in this country. He had a trout-fishing outfit which cost £200! Of course, the miners are difficult. They have to sweat in the mines. They have advantages such as pensions, but they also have the disadvantages of death through falls of earth, and through contracting miners' phthisis, in carrying out one of the hardest and most dangerous jobs in the world. The honorable senator would be " difficult " under those conditions, and I am amazed at the case presented by him. </para>

                <para>We have heard before the sordid story told by the honorable senator. We must not do anything to improve the conditions of the miners, otherwise the dividends of the mine-owners will cease. The honorable senator was not original this afternoon. So bad a case did he present that he transgressed Standing Order 406 by reading practically every word of his speech, and he made a miserable job of the imperfect brief that had been handed to him. But for the fact that any disturbance would have put him out of his stride, I should have asked you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> to rule that he was out of order in reading his speech. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> and some of his colleagues are working day and night in trying to overcome the difficulty that alone gives any semblance of reason for the speech made to-day by the honorable senator. The difficulty is to find a means of obtaining the necessary production of coal. I know that the protagonists of the honorable senator believe, and have always believed, that the remedy for all industrial upheavals is to "fire low and lay them out"; but that would not get coal. </para>

Despite all that has happened, and all that has been said, the coal production of Australia for the last twelve months is the largest that this country has ever had. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator can have his quarrel with the Prime Minister, but at the moment he must quarrel with me. One would think that this Government was not doing anything. The extreme need to-day for essential war production is due to  the  fact that the Government of which the honorable senator was a member left Australia naked to the world, when the Labour party assumed office. I was greatly amused by the sudden discovery by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> that the coal-owners are banded together because of the fact that they are whole.souled philanthropists. They could have invested their money, in Commonwealth loans and made a profit of £2,000,000, or £1,750,000, more profit than he alleges they made in the coal industry. But investors  in Commonwealth loans cannot water stock, build up secret reserves, or benefit from the issue of bonus shares. Consequently, these people do not invest in Commonwealth loans, but in coal; and that is the story of the industry. The interests which control the industry are interlocked with shipping and other big commercial interests. Indeed, the honorable senator comes into court with a tainted brief, because he and his connexions, political and social, are associated with the interests which interlock our big industries, and make their profits by wringing sweat out of unfortunate people who have nothing to sell but their labour and must work in order to live, whether it be down a mine or in any other sphere. The Senate should not have been asked to waste time on this matter. The Australian Broadcasting Bill is awaiting our further attention, and much remains to be done in connexion with that activity. </para>

                    <para>. - At the outset, I assure honorable senators that I hold no brief from outside in this matter. When we consider the present imminent terrible threat to our country, to our lives and to our liberties, it is as well, perhaps, to devote a few thoughts to the subject as to how we as a people are preparing to meet that danger which is ever drawing nearer. That danger is imminent. Therefore, this is not a time for levity. I ask myself whether we are conducting ourselves as a rational people, or as a people who have every reason to know that a brutal, ruthless, resourceful, implacable, and, up to now, an invincible foe, is preparing to make a furious onslaught on our coast. I ask myself whether we, to-day, are better prepared than was Malaya or Burma. From a military point of view, I think that we are. I devoutly hope so ; but I think that the answer to the first part of my question, although it seems wellnigh incredible to say so, is "No". Our position to-day politically is deplorable. It is little better than the political situation that existed in France before the <inline font-style="italic">debacle</inline> in that country. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin ) has said, " It is the clear-cut determination of the Government to yield no part of the country to the enemy ". I support that statement up to the hilt. It .is a most excellent aspiration. However, the Prime Minister and his Ministers have already yielded the coal-fields of New South Wales to the enemy within our gates. Week by week, the Government permits the coal industry, which is the key cf our nacional defence, to be disted by a campaign of persistent industrial anarchy. We cannot get away from that fact. One Minister, whose special province is to see 'that industrial discipline is maintained, has succeeded, under the guise of an alleged peace mission to the coal-fields, to further accentuate the disorder and idleness, and reckless defiance of authority. The Minister for Labour and National Service (Mr. Ward),</inline> whose biased and inflammatory public statements, and open support of the more militant coal-miners, are unprecedented examples of ministerial irresponsibility, has acted utterly in contempt of the rules of Cabinet administration. He should have been dismissed from office long ago. Without a blush he gives the lie direct to the Prime Minister. After considering the facts, the Prime Minister said some little time ago that, in his opinion, the coal mine-owners were not to blame for the troubles on the coalfields. But the Minister for Labour and National Service said that the owners were to blame ; and the miners themselves continue to give the lie to the Minister by stopping work on frivolous excuses. </para>

                <para>At present a general stoppage of the mines is threatened because the Miners Federation is at loggerheads with the Federated Engine-drivers and Firemen's Union over some union rivalry. I ask myself: Is it possible that these misguided men fail to realize the frightful peril that confronts all unions and unionists in this country? Has not the Minister for Labour and National Service sufficient brains and common sense to realize what will happen to our industrial system under the tender mercies of the Japanese? Apparently, judging by his conduct, he has not. </para>

                        <para>- This Government must realize the awful possibility of our defeat at the hands of the enemy, and it must know that the possibility cannot but be heightened by the partial paralysis of the coal industry. I suggest that the present inaction of the Government is sheer madness, and I ask this question : Will the Government still play at party politics, and will it suffer itself to be blackmailed and bullied by a small but loud-voiced band of traitorous men. I know that it will require courage to scotch this trouble, but the trouble must be scotched if we are to win through and obtain the best from the resources of this country. It is, in my humble opinion, a palpable and ever-growing threat to our national security, endangering every Australian man, woman, and child. More disgraceful still, it adds to the perils so unselfishly confronted by those large numbers of gallant allies who have come to the aid of this country in its dire peril. It is time, and high time, that this crazy and sordid industrial brawl was put to an end, because, if that is not done, we shall be betraying the common cause, our friends, and ourselves. </para>

                    <para>. - I am  firmly  convinced that the action taken in the Senate to-day is merely a continuation of the PackerTheodore - coal-owner - Bulletin - Opposition vendetta against the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> and that nothing of the kind advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> is required to adjust the coal difficulty. I am convinced that the campaign against the Minister for Labour and National Service has been continued for a long period, and that the coal-miner has been used as the stalking-horse to obscure fie facts. That is obvious when we find the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> publishing this statement, "Ward defies his own Government on strike issue. Won't use rule 77 against workers; Cabinet row likely". The paper quoted the Minister as saying that he would never use rule 77 against the workers, and it quoted the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> as saying that the rule would be used against fifteen wheelers who had struck the previous day at Wongawilli mine, on the south coast. The statement added that the men were back at work. Those fifteen men who were on strike at Wongawilli were not proceeded against; but, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Loudon</inline> and the Prime Minister, the stoppage waa caused by provocation by the management. It was not caused by the miners. Nevertheless, the mineowners, the members of the Opposition, the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> and other persons and organizations that dislike the Minister, are prepared to do anything to cause his colleagues to oppose him. </para>

                <para>The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph,</inline> along with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> and other Opposition members, must be very disappointed because the coal-miners are not on strike to-day. The <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> wept yesterday when it published a statement that there was no strike, but that two mines were idle. It was evidently sorry that, in the circumstances, it could not further abuse the Minister for Labour and National Service and disparage his good work. A member of any government who could go among the miners of Australia and arrange that 22,000 of them should work to a degree that must impose a strain on them, deserves commendation. The men had refused^ to work because of the tactics of the mineowners, but to-day, thanks to the Minister, they are hewing coal for the war effort. What a stupid statement it was that fifteen men out of 22,000 were idle ! More men would be found to be idle in any section of industry where 22,000 were employed. I believe that no man has done better work for Australia than the Minister for Labour and National Service has done, and this Senate ought not to be discussing a motion such as this unless with the object of paying a tribute to him. </para>

                    said that the stoppages could not be tolerated, and that they were "frivolous". The
                    <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>
                    has found some one to say that a horse had been the cause of a strike 'because it was too fast. I do not know how the animal was quietened, but I do know that such a horse would be a most dangerous animal in a pit. When hauling skips to the wheeler, or from the wheeler to the miner, the horse might tear up the rails, pull the skips off the rails, and crush the driver or wheeler against the rock face and kill him. Worse than that could happen, because he might tear down the pit props, as a result of which rock and earth might fall upon the men and crush them. That, however, does not matter, according to the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph.</inline>
                    Any man who works in a mine would agree that an objection to the use of such a horse was not a " frivolous " matter, as the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>
                    alleged. The miners of this country are doing good work, and if members of the Opposition were employing themselves in th&lt;» war effort as well as the miners are doing, the result would be better for Australia.
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline>
                    has admitted the justice of some of the complaints about the shuffling of trucks. It has for many years been the practice of the coal-owners to stop a pit at their own will. They are doing it to-day, because they can make more money by taking the coal from one mine than from another. That is why some mines are starved for trucks, and, of course, if there are no trucks the coal cannot be transported. Because of these tactics, the
                    <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline>
                    and members of the Opposition say that these terrible, uncontrollable miners should be disciplined. Yet the 'best story they could find on which to spill their ink was that fifteen men out of 22,000 were on strike. I am whole-heartedly with the Minister for Labour and National Service in his contention that the licences of the owners of the coalmines should be revoked, and that the men should be employed direct by the Government. The tactics employed by the owners and the managements in the past should not be allowed to continue. Under government management there would be, not greater efficiency, but better conditions for the miners than those existing to-day. It would ensure full production if the mine-owners had their licences withdrawn.

Such attacks make one wonder what would happen if an invasion of Australia actually took place. </para>

                    <para>. - The people of Australia appreciate the importance of coal in the war effort, and having watched with interest the repeated stoppages in the coal-mining industry, they feel depressed because of the repeated, but unfulfilled, promises made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> to take action against the coal-miners. Up to date, there has been a notable lack of action against extremists in this industry. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride,</inline> pointed out very clearly that since the outbreak of war, wages in the coal-mining industry have increased by 20 per cent., and that working hours have been reduced from 44 to 40 a week. He also showed that the average wage earned in the coal mines to-day was £2 0s. 2d. a day. All that is ample evidence that the coal-miners of this country enjoy much better conditions than do their colleagues in any other part of the world. The Senate is indebted to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> for placing these facts before it, calmly, fairly and clearly, in the interests of the people of Australia. I was somewhat surprised when the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> became so heated, and dealt with  all  aspects of the matter except those referred to in the speech delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride.</inline> All sections of the community deplore these continuous stoppages. Disputes have persisted despite all that has been said by the Prime Minister. What is the position to-day? </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> displays a surprising lack of knowledge when he says that. For the benefit of the Minister, I draw attention to the fact that in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> to-day, it is stated that the Burwood colliery, which produces a larger quantity of coal than any other coal-mine in the Commonwealth, was idle yesterday when 600 men returned to their homes because the Transport Department officials set them down 400 yards from the entrance to the mine. Side by side with that statement, in the columns of the same newspaper was a report that twelve Royal Air Force and Royal Australian Air Force men had escaped from Java in a 30-ft. boat and had spent 44 gruelling days at sea. How can the sacrifices which are being made to-day by the coal-miners compare with the trying experiences of those men? Such comparisons give food for thought and provoke action. It is proper that in the National Parliament these important matters should be debated., and that the Government should be reminded of the necessity to take immediate action. I am informed that in addition to the Burwood colliery, the Millfield colliery also is idle to-day. </para>

Despite the fact that, as the Leader of the Senate has said, the war position is more serious to-day than ever, these two coal mines are idle.

                    <para>Because there was no general resumption of work at the Kew South Wales coalfields this morning, the Federal Government at noon today promulgated a new national security order making it an offence against the National Security Act for any person, normally employed at a coal-mine, to refuse  work  when the mine is open and when he has been directed, or otherwise advised, to work by the committee of management of his union. </para>

                <para>The public was misled by the statements that were made by the Prime Minister and the Government spokesman over a period of four months. In January it was said that action would be taken against the miners under the then existing regulations. When members of the Opposition in this chamber objected to those regulations and pointed out that they would not work, because they placed upon the Miners Federation the onus of sending strikers back  tO'  work, members and supporters of the Government opposed that point of view strongly, and they debated the matter with such skill that they convinced two honorable senators on this side of the chamber that they were right. Within a few months, however, the Government repealed the regulations and carried out our suggestion by placing the responsibility for sending strikers back to work in the hands of the Coal Commissioner, where it should have rested originally. Then Statutory Rule No. 77, which contains drastic regulations empowering the Government to order people to do this, that or the other thing, was issued, and again the Government spokesman said that the new regulations were necessary in order to deal with the coal-miners.  We on this side of the chamber, and the public generally, are disgusted with the inaction of the Government. I take this opportunity to place the facts before Senate Ministers and to urge them to do something, knowing that strikes will continue unless the Government plucks up sufficient courage to deal with the extremists in the coalmining industry and show them who is to govern the nation. </para>

                        <para>- I say that the telegram was merely propaganda designed to boost the Opposition's arguments on this motion. Prom my own experience of employers in Tasmania I am aware of the pinpricking attitude that has been adopted by the employers in industry towards employees. The Minister for Labour and National Service has stated openly that such pinpricking is going on in New .South Wales and has caused many industrial stoppages. He has  made  a personal investigation of the whole position, and I prefer to accept his statements, particularly in view of my own knowledge of what is taking place in other States, instead of the propaganda telegram which was read by the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> launched a vicious attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service. Like the Leader of the Opposition, he apparently overlooked the fact that " you can lead a horse to water but you can never make it drink if it does not want to drink". We must adopt the best methods avail able in order to maintain full production from our industries. Up to the present, this Government has endeavoured to use  every means possible in order to secure the maximum rate of production that can be obtained under existing conditions. Honorable senators opposite know that to impose compulsion upon the employees because they stopped work as the result of provocative actions by the employers would only cause chaos in tin whole industry. They know that the employers have endeavoured to  caustfriction  amongst the employees in ord".]to make them discontented and resentful of their actions. If the  Government  imposed compulsion upon the men in such circumstances they would all connout on strike. That is what honorable senators opposite would like to  happen  to-day. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> informed us, in the opening stages of his speech, thai he would deal not only with the employees, against whom he launched such  a vicious attack, but also with the  eniployers.  All that he told us about the employers was the profits that they hamade. </para>

Even if they did not make much profit from the coal-mines, they did secure huge profits from the Newcastle steel-works, the shipping companies and their other big monopolies Honorable senators opposite should not imagine that we are not aware of the fact that the mine-owners also own the other big monopolies, and that their accumulated profits amount to a huge sum. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> referred at length to the hours of work in the coal-mines. The honorable senator would not know a coal-mine if he fell into one. He made that abundantly clear during his speech by the lack of knowledge of the industry that he displayed. He stated that if a coal-miner worked full time for five days a week he would be employed for only 30 hours out of 168 hours. Does he expect a miner to work continuously, and have no time off for meals and rest? </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator was incorrect in stating that miners worked only 30 hours during a five-day week. No greater misstatement has ever been made in this chamber. It is hard work for a miner carrying his " crib " to walk for an hour in a crouched position under a roof 4 feet high, in order to reach a stops where the actual mining takes place. I know the conditions under which the men work in the coal-mines, and I have not yet met a miner who would not put in an extra hour's work at the face in preference to spending an extra half-hour in carrying his " crib " in a crouched position to the wall where he has to work. If the honorable senator would go down a coal-mine we would hear different speeches from those made by him in this chamber. He has complained about the pension that the miner receives; but surely a man whose work exposes him to the risk of contracting miners' phthisis, and having his life shortened by perhaps a score of years, as well as the risk of accidents due to falls of earth, is entitled to compensation. The miners spend the best years of their lives in recovering coal for the owners, and, as they may eventually become physical wrecks, they have every rightto a pension. The honorable senator seems to resent the fact that the men are entitled to a pension after spending the best of their lives in producing coal that enables men like the honorable senator to live in comfort. </para>

                <para>The honorable senator referred to the stoppages that -had occurred recently in the coal-mining industry, but he did not draw a comparison with the number of stoppages that took place during his regime as Minister for Supply and Development. He has not suggested how any steps' other than those taken by the Government could be taken to reduce the number of stoppages. He said that by mechanizing the mines 5 tons of coal could be produced as compared with 3 tons being obtained by means of hand work. However, investigations have shown that in- some of the mines where mechanized methods have been adopted less coal has been produced than by hand work. Those investigations were made by experienced men, and were not based on assumptions, as are the arguments advanced by the honorable senator. He has said that some of the miners were most disloyal. </para>

                    <para>. - When an honorable senator in the responsible position of Leader of the Opposition states a case in this chamber, the least we expect from him is a reasonable measure of fairness, and in that regard the honorable senator has failed in his contribution to the debate this afternoon. We have heard a highly coloured story of interference by miners to such a degree that the production of coal has been seriously reduced. All of the blame has been placed on the shoulders of one section of th, industry! The least the honorable senator should have done was to paint, if only in subdued colours, the other side of the picture. Since the Opposition has failed to paint it, I shall endeavour to do so. Owing to vindictive action on the part of the owner of a certain colliery, a watchman named Mitchell was sacked some time ago. He was not regarded highly by the other miners from a trade union point of view.  His  trade union background had been bad, but, because of advancing age, he bad been given a job as watchman. For some reason, his services were dispensed with. The miners threatened to go on strike, but because of representations made to them by their delegates, they agreed to continue at work. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Subsequently, the matter was referred to a board of reference; and that body decided that the mine-owners were in the wrong; that they should not have sacked Mitchell. It was of opinion that the owners had not made out a case to support their action. However, the owners refused to accept the board's decision. They continued to refuse to reinstate Mitchell. Those are the details of just one of many instances that could he cited in order to show that there are two sides to these disputes, and that each side is not absolutely blameless. </para>

                        <para>- The opinion <inline font-style="italic">exists</inline> in this chamber that the honorable senator opposite has reached the age of reason. I ask him not to do anything that would destroy that opinion. The honorable member for Hunter <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. James)</inline> was informed 'by telegram that the owners were approached only last week by the Commonwealth Government on this matter, and had been ordered to carry out the decision of a board of reference. To-day, however, information was received that they have not done so. Consequently, the owners are continuing in conflict with the Government and the miners on the job by absolutely refusing to accept the decision of an independent tribunal about whom we hear so much from honorable senators opposite. Times out of number, honorable senators opposite have declared that the decision of the referee should always be accepted. However, neither the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride,</inline> who .moved this motion, made any mention of that dispute. They were content to present only one side of the picture. In submitting a case of this kind for the consideration of the Senate, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> should endeavour to plow the facts fairly before us, in order that the blame may not be placed entirely on one side. I say that neither side is absolutely  blameless. I am not here to defend either the mine-owners or the miners as such. However, the honorable senator who moved this motion was bound in fairness to both sides to place all of the facts before us. </para>

                    <para>.- Not one honorable senator opposite will deny that the conduct of the coal industry is of particular importance at present, or that it is our key industry, upon which the great majority of other industries are dependent for their life blood. Therefore, they must realize that any hold-up in the coal industry is of vital concern to our industrial life as a whole. Neither will it be disputed that the coal industry is in a better position than other industries to hold up the economic activity of the community, and. therefore, in a better position than any other industry to bargain. This debate is not directly concerned with the coalminers. I presume that the Government is governing the country. Parliament has given to it absolute power over the personal property and behaviour of every individual in the community. The Government is managing the affairs of the* country on behalf of the nation as a whole. However, I have never seen a more pitiable exhibition of weakness than that which it has given to the country in dealing with the coal industry. I do not attack the miners at all. I simply say that it is the Government's responsibility to ensure that coal is won. But what is the Government doing about the matter? Nothing! I can quite imagine the daily prayer of the coal-miner to be : " Give us this day our daily strike ; or two, or even three, strikes " ; and the daily prayer of the Government to be : " Give us this day our daily regulation ". However, when a regulation is passed, the Minister charged with its administration declares that, so long as he lives, it will not be used against the workers. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister did say that.  His  statement has been reported in practically every newspaper, and it has not been denied. I attack, not the coal-miners, but the Government, because of its weakness in controlling the coal industry. How can we expect the Government to manage a body of men like the coal-miners, when every one of its supporters in this chamber, who ha? so far spoken in this debate, has justified the actions of the miners in going on strike and holding up industry? Every honorable senator opposite who has spoken this afternoon has stated that the action of the miners, in holding up our industries in a time of war, has been justified. </para>

One of the Government's vital duties is to ensure a full supply of coal to industry. That supply is not forthcoming. Yet the Minister calmly asks me what I would suggest! I suggest that the Government should have the guts " to implement its own regulations for the control of the coal industry. Up to date, I assumed that it was taking appropriate action in order to ensure a full supply of coal to industry.  However, 1 find that it is impotent in this matter. One of its members is so helpless that he now asks me what I think the Government should do. Put us back on the Government side of the chamber and we will tell you how to get coal. We will certainly have the courage to implement our regulations, and we would not issue regulations that we were afraid to implement. </para>

Look at that regulation which gives power to us to take control of every man, woman and child in the community, and to tell them what work they have to do, and what they have to stop doing ! " The Government issues a regulation to take full power to itself, but on the question of coal it goes back in the breeching and will not pull the cart any further. It then says, " We did not mean this ". These aristocrats of labour in the coal industry can hold up the rest of the community merely because they are the aristocrats of labour, and because they are the big political power in this country. The Government says to them, " We will not touch you ; we will stroke you down and calm you. You can have your daily strikes, and we will justify them in Parliament. Although we proclaim from the housetops the danger the community is in, the urgent necessity for coal, the shortage of man-power, and the importance of coal as the life-blood of the community, we will not do one single thing that will in any way offend you ". </para>

                    was quite justified in attempting to show how impudent, how futile, the Government had been in this matter. The Leader of the Senate, with his usual enthusiastic incoherence, attempted to justify the coal-miners by attacking, as if we were responsible, honorable senators on this side of the chamber, but he did not attempt to justify the Government's inaction. He " said', " We will fix this up ". but that has 'been said daily for many months. There is always going to be, but there never is, something better. The Prime Minister is always going to implement Statutory Rule No. 77, but the Minister for Labour and National Service says it will never be used against the workers.

                    statement to-day has been entirely justified, but the Government has not said how it is going to overcome the difficulty. It has not stated how a full supply of coal can be obtained in the most dangerous period of our history. It has not even acknowledged that coal is a national necessity, but its supporters have, one after another, attempted to justify the miners for withholding coal from industries that are essential to the safety of the nation. When
                    <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline>
                    said that this sort of thing could not be tolerated, the Leader of the Senate became annoyed, although the Government knows that it is tolerating the present situation, and is not achieving results. I hope that before the debate is over a Government spokesman will tell the chamber and the people outside what the Government intends to do to obtain a full supply of coal. No one is worried very much about the cost of the coal, but it is well known that coal is a necessity. If a small section of people is permitted to defy the Government, the Government is not fit to occupy the treasury bench.

                    <para>. - I have never -worked in a coal mine, but I have a family interest in mining. I had three brothers who were miners, and they were men of magnificent physique. The first one was killed at 38 years of age, the second one worked underground for 30 years, and the third one is broken in health. The two who are alive are suffering because of the unhealthy conditions of their work. A party of parliamentarians went to Lithgow about two years ago, and were taken down the State coal-mine. I said to the manager, " How far is it to the face ", and he replied, " I should not advise you to go there ; it is about a 2-mile walk ". Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> objects to the miners being paid for the walk. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> showed how difficult it was to walk those 2 miles, and explained that the miners would rather be working at the face than walking. I am glad that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> drew attention to a statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> about women in mines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> evidently approves of women working in mines.

                        <para>- The honorable senator put the statement forward as a reason why such things should be done. Some years ago a doctor, who was also a psychologist, gave evidence before a commission in England to the effect that men who worked underground year after year, out of the sunlight, suffered in health, and that they took a different view from that taken by men who worked in the sunlight. That furnishes a strong reason why the miners should be allowed to bring their grievances forward. I believe that the Minister for Labour and National Service did all he could to bring about continuous production of coal. It has been said that the application of Statutory Rule No. 77 might have caused a complete stoppage in the coal industry. Miners are loyal to one another, and a sympathy strike could have stopped the coal supply. If it is possible by interviewing the owners and the miners, and by listening to the grievances of the men, to bring about a reconciliation, such action should be taken. The Minister for Labour and National Service induced the men to go back to work. There has never been proof that the faults are all on the one side ; the evidence in New South Wales is to the contrary. I believe that the men have just grievances from time to time. They do not fail to realize that if we do not win the war they will lose all their industrial advantages, and they are not such fools as not to know that if Japan succeeds they will lose all the trade union privileges for which they have fought hard. I give them credit for realizing that, although members of the Opposition do not do so. I think that it would have been better had we adopted the suggestion made by the Leader of the Senate, and allowed all the talk in regard to this matter to come from honorable senators opposite. In the course of this debate <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> has been smiling, but I cannot sees anything to laugh about in the war position to-day. However, smiles, laughs and jeers are all that I have had in this chamber since I came here four years ago. Apparently the honorable senator does not realize the importance of matters such as this. He is the most irresponsible man in the chamber. I believe that the Minister for Labour and National Service went about this task in the best way possible, and that he did contribute largely to the establishment of peace on the coal-fields. It was only right that, by means of conferences with the men and the owners, he should do his best to secure maximum production of coal which is so essential at present. </para>

They have their own opinions and they are entitled to express them. </para>
                <para>In the course of this debate a good deal has been said as to who is responsible for the stoppages on the coal-fields, and, in turn, first one side and then the other has been blamed. But the question before the Senate to-day is not who is to blame for the strikes, but whether or not the Government has done everything possible to avoid these disputes. "We have a Commonwealth Arbitration Court and any infringement of awards, either by employers or employees; or in fact any trouble between coal-miners and the mine-owners is entirely a matter for that court. But I ask honorable senators whether or not the Government has done everything in its power to see that the law of the land as laid down by the Arbitration Court has been observed by both the employer and employee? Apparently early this year the Government believed that the Arbitration Court's rulings were not being observed by all sections of the coal-mining industry, because, on the 9th Januarylast, regulations were promulgated setting out what should be done by the coal-miners and the mine-owners, and stating that action would be taken against any one who did not comply with the Arbitration Court's awards. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> pointed out that the Government, although it realized that stoppages were occurring in the industry and that somebody was to blame, had not exercised the powers which it possessed under these regulations to ensure that the awards were enforced. There can be no doubt that the Government is to blame for the continued disputes in the coalmining industry, irrespective of whether they have been originated by the coalminers or the mine-owners, because under the regulations to which I have referred action could have been taken against either party.We have heard to-day that certain action was taken, but if that be so, it could have been only of a minor nature and hardly worth mentioning. Between the 9th January, when the regulations were issued, and now there has been ample opportunity to use the new powers, but no such action has been taken. Naturally enough we in this chamber are anxious that the coal-mining industry should continue to produce sufficient coal to meet this country's requirements, especially in view of the fact that coal is so vitally important in our war effort. Another good point which . was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> was that it was ridiculous to haul coal 150 miles to areas in which an ample supply of coal existed. </para>
                <para>A great deal has been said in recent months about coal production and about the alleged benefits accruing from the visit of the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> to the coal-fields. It has been suggested that the Minister returned from his trip satisfied that he had found a solution of the problems. Personally I believe that the Minister returned from the coal-fields with nothing more than he had when he went there. I am reminded very much of an argument which I once heard around a camp fire at a place 250 miles beyond Oodnadatta, and allegedly on the direct route to what is known as Lassetter's Reef. Some time previously a party had gone out to search for the reef, and there was considerable speculation as to what had been found by that party. In the course of the camp-fire discussion one man said that he knew that the search party had found gold because he had seen members of the party returning with specimens. However, another  speaker  said that he knew perfectly well that the party had not found anything, because he had seen members of it go out, and they had the specimens with them then. The same can be said of the Minister's visit to the coalfields. He had all the information with him when he went; he did not get it when he arrived there. </para>

                <para>We have heard a great deal about the wonderful production of coal that has been achieved during the last few weeks. However, I have here an extract from a report published in a reliable newspaper of a statement made by the Coal Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mighell.</inline> It reads - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Australian coal production during the past eight weeks has fallen below the rate of consumption, with reserve stocks rapidly being depleted, said the Commonwealth Coal Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. N.</inline> Mighell, to-night. </para>
                    <para>The greatest contributing cause to the production lag was undoubtedly the compulsory retirement of 2,000 men who reached the retiring age under the New South Wales miners' insurance scheme, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mighell</inline> added. Lost production from this cause was estimated at about 30.000 tons a fortnight, about 750,000 tons a year. Many of these men were ready, anxious and fit for work. </para>
                    <para>I think it tragic that a State law should be permitted to force to idleness experienced men from an industry on which perhaps the very safety of this Commonwealth depends. None of these retired miners has gone back to the mines, although the Miners Federation has now agreed to the slack in man-power being made up from their number. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The question before the Senate is not whether this state of affairs is the fault of the miners or the fault of the owners. The blame rests entirely with the Government. If the Government was of the opinion that the coal-mining industry was operating satisfactorily, why did it issue regulations? But, having issued regulations to control the industry, it should have taken action under them when the need to do so arose. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> said that the coalminers were difficult to manage. That is admitted. All workers are difficult to manage when they are working under extremely provocative conditions, and, obviously, if the task of management is to be made easier, the workers' conditions must be made better. Commonwealth public servants are not so difficult to manage as coal-miners. Why? Because the conditions under which they work are very much better, more congenial, and more secure than the conditions under which the miners work. Several honorable senators have very properly asked what the Government should do. In my judgment, the Government should now be prepared to take much more drastic action against the mineowners than it has taken hitherto. The Government, in good faith, left it to the mine-owners to do the right thing by the miners in order that coal should be produced in the increasing quantities which are so badly needed. It is obvious that everything depended upon the mine-owners, and, if they had done the right thing, the position of which complaint has been made to-day would never have arisen. What are the conditions under which the mine-owners operate? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan have said, in effect, that the organization of the mines is unbalanced. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator did say so in effect. For example, he admitted that on occasions there were more trucks than were needed at some mines and not sufficient at others. That is evidence of unbalanced organization, and where there is unbalanced organization there is also unbalanced production and all of the difficulties of which honorable senators complain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan said that he could not understand why coal should be brought a distance of  150  miles when it could be obtained locally. The existence of that apparent anomaly is further evidence of unbalanced management. Whilst that may be reasonably safe in times of peace, it is desperately dangerous in times of war, and, whether we like it or not, we must deal more drastically with the owners of the mines unless of their own volition they take steps to remedy the position. But those controlling the mines are not prepared to take such action, because they are competing with one another for monopoly control, and when there is fierce competition for such control, not only in the mining industry, but also in other industries, the conditions of the workers are made more and more intolerable. It is well known that mine-owners themselves have deliberately provoked strikes in order to make difficulties for their competitors and put them out of business. I asked <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Leckie</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mcleay</inline> to suggest what action  should be taken in order to remedy the position in the industry, but I did not obtain an answer. These honorable gentlemen put themselves in the position of critics, but they offer no constructive suggestions. I venture to say that, if the Government should be forced to take more drastic action against the mine-owners in order to organize balanced production, eliminate wastage of man-power and money, establish the industry on a more efficient and economical basis, and make the working of mines almost as safe as the working of underground railways, the first persons who will object and challenge the Government on the ground that it is interfering with private enterprise will be honorable senators opposite. When a desperate war-time situation arises we must be prepared to bring about national control of industry, where necessary, in order to obtain better results. Where there is divided and competitive control, more managerial staffs than are needed, the expenditure of more money than is necessary, and an irregular supply of trucks, there will always be industrial disputes.- That is happening in the engineering industry to-day. In some workshops there are more machines than are needed, and in other workshops there are not enough. I have outlined the course that must be taken, and I shall urge the Government, particularly in view of the discussion which has taken place here to-day, to take action immediately against provocative, incompetent and wasteful management of coal mines. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> referred to the position in Russia by way of comparison.

                        <para>- It does not seem strange to me, because I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> could not possibly fail to notice the marked contrast between conditions in Australia and conditions in Russia. In Russian coal-mines there are no directors who draw high fees and there is no divided and competing managements. No shareholders draw profits from the mines. The workers in Russia get the full benefit of the product of the mines, and that makes all the difference. In time of war the nation's resources of coal and all other commodities are pooled. The people all fight in the defence of their country, and against the Fascists of Germany. There is no declaration of dividends and no appropriation of enormous profits. In short, the Russians are working foi  themselves and for the defence of their country, and not for the profits of shareholders and directors. Would honorable senators opposite agree that the members of the Miners Federation be allowed to work under similar conditions? </para>

Do you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> think that honorable senators opposite would agree to put all the shareholders and directors of the coal-mines out of commission, and say to them, " From this day onwards your managerial staffs shall be directly responsible to the Government, your incomes shall cease, and all of you shall be put to work in production in the coal-mines, the munitions factories or elsewhere ? " Under those conditions, we should have a national effort true to name. We should have a set of conditions that would appeal to the best in men and women. But are we appealing to the best in them when they work under conditions which are camouflaged  ? It is said that they are unpatriotic simply because they object to building up the bank balances of the employers. Give them conditions under which there will be equality of sacrifice, not in name but in reality, and where the privileged and pampered section will contribute its share in production, and we shall hear no more of difficulties in the coal-mining or any other industry. The exigencies of this war, the most desperate in which we have ever been engaged, will enforce such  conditions upon us whether we like them or not. Do the  mine-owners  and shareholders intend to wait until they are forced into a position in which they will have to " do their bit ", as well as the  men employed in the mines, or do they intend to be patriotic and take a proper view of the whole position, saying 'of their own volition to the employees, "We shall make sacrifices equal to yours ". </para>

                        <para>- In my judgment the Government has been depending on the mine-owners to do the right thing. [ make no apology for that. That is the proper thing for the Government to do. [f the mine-owners say, " We are prepared to do the fair thing", well and good: but the evidence we have to-day, particularly the case of the watchman, Mitchell, which has been mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong,</inline> and numerous other cases, leads one to assume that the mine-owners do not intend to do the right thing. In these circumstances the Government will have no alternative but to act in the direction I have indicated. Lf it does, the most strenuous opposition will no doubt come from honorable senators opposite. </para>

                    <para>. - No amount of vociferation and rhetoric, such as has been indulged in by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> is a satisfactory reply to the indictment of the Government for its administration of the coal-mining industry. Whether the fault lies with the miners or with the mine-owners, the people of Australia are looking for action. Threats and conferences for the purpose of bringing the parties into line are no longer sufficient. Our allies in the north have lost Corregidor in the Philippines. <inline font-style="italic">Ls</inline> this a time when we should be prating about the nationalization of industry? </para>

                        <para>- The vacillation and pusillanimity on the part of the Government is responsible for this debate. The present position is due to political fear in the hearts of Ministers, when there should be room for none, because they know full well that the Opposition would stand behind them were they firm in their action, whether in regard to the employees or the management. We have heard threats and suggestions that the management is at fault, but why has not the Government the courage to prosecute the mine-owners? If the management were at fault I should be 100 per cent, behind the Government in prosecuting the mine-owners. </para>

                        <para>- Bui the Government trembles to do anything. It is fearful of the result of any action it might take. That is the indictment which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> has levelled against it this afternoon. It is idle for us to engage in a metaphysical discussion such as the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> essayed this afternoon when he visualized a revolution of our social system. He simply avoided the issue and slid away from it as he has done so successfully when he has been engaged in combats in another capacity. It is idle to engage in special pleading in this matter. Tribunals galore exist to deal with disputes in the industry. We have had tribunals since the royal commission over which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Justice</inline> Davison presided thoroughly investigated conditions in the industry; The Government is not without means of ascertaining whether strikes, or disturbances, in the industry are frivolous, as the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> suggested in respect of one recent dispute. It has means of finding out whether real grievances exist. It has at its disposal means of ascertaining whether the miners, or the mine-owners, are at fault. Should either be at fault, they should be dealt with. But the Government has not the courage to deal with the miners, because of political fears. Such fears are groundless. We want a 100 per cent, production in the industry. States which depend on coal from New South Wales have been bled white by the tribute demanded from them .by the coal industry in that State. It was for that reason that Victoria was driven to establish its great industry at Yallourn. Unfortunately, South Australia has not yet been able to discover coal deposits of the requisite value to enable it to establish a similar industry. The recurring strikes and disputes in the coal industry in New South Wales are due to the fact that the industry has never been  stabilized. I could also mention certain aspects which have been testified to by more than one leading unionist in New South Wales. The Minister for Aircraft Production concluded by advocating the nationalization of the coal industry. With the enemy at our door, how ridiculous it would be to entertain any thought of changing our social system. What would happen if the coal industry were nationalized? I recall a story told by a distinguished Labour premier of South Australia, who afterwards graced this Senate. He said that on one occasion when he was Premier of South Australia, the " boys " came to him and said, " J ohn you must nationalize something. You know that it is part of the programme ". Being a copper-miner, he immediately nationalized copper-mines at Moonta, which in its day had been a great producer. Incidentally, owing largely to representations made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Charles</inline> Hawker, the mine was re-opened during the economic depression, and provided at least a living for the miners who at that time were in dire straits. However, after " John " nationalized that mine, he found that things were not going to his liking, and, being a practical miner, he visited' the mine himself. Subsequently, he reported to the Labour caucus : " I went tip to Moonta to see a copper mine working. I found a. lying-in home ". Much the same sort of thing would happen, should we nationalize the coal industry as advocated by the Minister for Aircraft Production. It is useless for the Minister in his specious way to try to get away from the issue involved in this matter by preaching nationalization. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> has simply stated that whoever is to blame in these disputes should be dealt with effectively. A few days ago, I read in the press that one dispute arose because a fast pony was used in a mine. The report stated that two ponies were available, and that, if necessary, an extra man would be made available to lead the fast pony. Surely in a time of war, when we are really up against things, somebody must put a stop to that sort of thing. It is the duty of the Government to do so, and I implore it to take the necessary action. There is nothing sinister about this motion. We on this side seek no political kudos in supporting it. Unless the Government wakes up to realities, it will soon learn that the men who are to-day risking their lives and their all for this country will not stand <inline font-style="italic">tamely</inline> by and see the favoured few do as they please. Regardless of the interests of either the coal-owners or the miners, the Government must enforce the law. That is all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> asks. It is what the Government should have done long ago. </para>

                        <para>- And we are helping to safeguard the lives of the bravest of our sons who are fighting to save our skins, because, in return for our pig iron, we received material of great value for safeguarding- our aviators. Surely honorable senators opposite do not think that the previous Government was so idiotic that it failed to realize what was likely to happen. This Government can thank its lucky stars that we exported a certain quantity of scrap iron. But what is that scrap iron compared with the materials we are receiving to-day from our great ally, the United States of America? The coalminers are merely amused with this Government. They take the view that it is afraid of them, and that they are masters of the situation. Therefore, they can do as they please. The Government must ensure that the production of coal is maintained at the greatest possible rate. We cannot contrast the conditions of workers in this country with those imposed on the workers in Great Britain without feeling that our workers are infinitely better off. I again urge the Government to take its courage in its hands and to translate into action the words of its own leader on this subject. We must see' this business through, or, otherwise, the whole transport system  of  Australia will be disorganized. God forbid that I should say one word to make it more difficult to settle this trouble, but it is obvious that action must be taken. Tribunals are established to bring about a settlement, but they cannot do so. We Iia ve to take the more definite action that the Prime Minister promised under Statutory Rule No. 77. I commend <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> for bringing the matter forward, because it is of more than passing moment. It is vital to Australia's interests that the production of coal should be not only continued, but also increased. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan that there should be less talk and more action. More than an hour has been wasted in talk this afternoon, and, apart from the proposal by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride,</inline> no formula has been advanced that could in any way be used to solve the many difficulties that have always confronted the coal-mining industry. I listened with attention to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan. I would direct the attention of the Senate to the fact that a previous government of which he was a supporter and once a member, had a leader who, when thousands of miners were .on strike on the northern coal-fields, pleaded with them to go back and work in the mines. Because the present Minister for Labour and National Service has been successful in inducing many of the miners to go back into production, members of the Opposition are annoyed. It would please them if they could read in the newspapers to-day that half a dozen mines were idle because the men were out on strike. <inline font-style="italic">As</inline> a member of the Government, I would welcome a formula or suggestion of practical value. We are prepared to accept any advice that is practical, but we do not accept as practical the solution offered on many occasions by members of the Opposition. Miners, it is urged, should be placed in labour corp3 and given uniforms. </para>

                        <para>- The mines are all working. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> knows as well as I do that if it were thought by the Government that Statutory Rule No. 77 should be implemented, it would be implemented. It will be implemented, however, when the Government decides, and not when the Opposition decides. We are in charge of the treasury bench to-day. The Opposition has drawn a red herring across the trail, and has failed in its attack. The action taken to-day is merely in support of a previous attack upon the Government, when its patriotism was challenged because it went to the United States of America for help. An attempt is now being made to create trouble in the industrial world. The argument has been featured throughout the press and was prominent in the House of Representatives last week. The mover of the motion has suggested that there should be some regimentation of the coal-mining industry, that the small mines should be put out of operation, and more monopolies created. </para>

That cannot be done for a reason that I shall explain. He does not know the conditions in the coalmining industry, although he may know all about the pastoral industry. .

He has suggested that the miners should bc moved from one field to another. Where would he move them from and to? No indication has been given of that. He merely made the bald statement that he would regulate the industry. I suggest that he should obtain further information from the Colliery Proprietors' Association, from which he no doubt obtained the information he used this afternoon. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator suggested regimenting the industry, but he did not say how it should be done. He made a sensible suggestion in regard to skips. He said that skips that were not being used in a particular mine should be brought into a mine where they could be used, irrespective of who owned them. To suggest, however, that miners could be taken from the north to the south, or vice versa, is entirely impracticable. Reference has been made to the increased cost of coal and the increased wages of miners. May I direct attention to what happened during the war of 1914 to 1918, when the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was Prime Minister. He gave an advance to the miners of 6d. a ton, and at the same time gave 2s. a ton to the proprietors of the mines to keep peace in the industry. The present Government is not buying peace in industry to-day in that way. It has been alleged that the miners were unreasonable in ceasing work. I was at one of the meetings in the west where a coal-mine was out of production because a weighbridge, as admitted by the proprietors, was weighing up to half a cwt. short. In some pits the men have to walk 2 or 3 miles to and from the coal-face, and sometimes the height from the floor to the roof is only 4 feet, so that the men have to crouch in order to get through. I suggest to the honorable senator who was so concerned about the bank-to-bank principle of eight hours which has been fought for over a period of years, and is recognized by the courts, that he should not take exception- </para>

                    McLachlan said that I had been prevented from attending a miners' meeting at Lithgow. That is a misstatement of the position. I was in Lithgow attending a miners' meeting, and at the same time a meeting of the Amalgamated Engineering Union, which was attended by the Minister for Labour and National Service, was being held. It is a rule of that union that only members can attend its meetings, except by a resolution of the meeting.

                    went to the meeting an hour before I did, and was admitted by such a special resolution. When I went to the door I was informed that I would have to wait until my presence was notified and a resolution had been passed, but as it was then 1.30 p.m. I decided to go to lunch instead.

I should like to know how the honorable senator knows just what the public of Australia thinks.

                        <para>- If the Government had those facts we should expect it to make use of them, but the honorable senator did not indicate what the facts were. The honorable gentleman spoke of the conditions of the sweated slaves of the mining industry, and said that their rates of pay had been increased by 27 per cent. I should like the honorable gentleman to tell me of one instance in which the miners have been granted an. increase of the hewing rate. All of this work is done on contract. let us examinethe position of the coal-mining industry in 1915, when the same conditions asapply to-day were operating under avaricious owners. At that time, we thought that we were fortunate if we earned £4 10s. for a full fortnight's work of eleven days. To-day the miners are working fairly constantly and earning a little more than they were a few years ago, because they have not worked somuch since the depression, when many of them were obliged to accept the dole because of the way in which orthodox financiers, particularly bankers, carried on the affairs of this country. But the usual thing is for the owners, through, their bookworm managers, to set out each, fortnight what they consider to be a fair amount for the miners to earn. I speak in earnest when I refer to mine managers as bookworms. I shall explain why I use that term. In order to be a practical miner, a man must work for two years at the coal face with a qualified man. Until he has completed this term, he is not entitled to work by himself. That is provided by the law of New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- In order to become a mine manager a man must work for five years in or about a mine. Under that provision an owner could take a man of the same intellectual capacity as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLeay</inline> and put him to work in the office adding up figures, collecting the wages tax from the miners, or putting tickets on coal trucks, and, with a little study and some attendance at a technical college that man could obtain his manager's certificate without having been underground. Many mine managers have obtained their certificates by that means, and that state of affairs is the root cause of the trouble. It is further aggravated by the actions of the financial councils which are interested not only in coal mines but also in interlocking concerns, such as shipping companies, iron and steel works, banks and the newspapers. Take for example the Adelaide Steamship Company Limited. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> could have told us about that firm's financial interest in coal-mines. The affairs of Howard Smith Limited and other companies are also worthy of investigation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> said that the miners earned 40s. 2d. a day. He did not state that that was the average figure. </para>

                        <para>- I challenge the honorable senator's statement; it was definitely wrong. He may have picked out a particular mine where men averaged that rate for a fortnight because the railway trucks were there to be filled, but he omitted to refer to the increased price of coal paid to the owners at the pit mouth. He said that the miners' rate had increased by 27 per cent. He should have pointed out also that the price of coal has increased by 70 per cent. since the beginning of the war. </para>

G. Casey. The object of this bill is to enable the Government to utilize the services of the Honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon in that office, without his position as a justice of the High Court of Australia being prejudiced in any way.

                        <para>Notwithstanding anything contained in the Judiciary Act 1903-1940, if  His  Majesty shall see fit to appoint the Honorable Owen Dixon to be Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary for the Commonwealth of Australia in the United States of America, he may accept that appointment and hold the same as well as the office of a justice of the High Court of Australia, and his service as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary for the Commonwealth of Australia in the United States of America shall for all purposes count as service in the office of a justice. </para>

                    <para class="block">Under section 48a of the Judiciary Act the pension of a justice of the High Court on retirement depends upon the number of years in which he has served in that office. It is desirable, therefore, to make it clear that any period during which <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon may hold the office of Commonwealth Minister in the United States of America and perform the duties of that office shall be regarded as included in his period of service as a justice of the High Court. </para>
                    <para>Whilst the bill, for simplicity, contains no reference to the present war, the necessity for the utilization of SiT Owen's services has arisen out of the war, and the special significance attaching to the diplomatic relations between the two countries at the present time renders it vital that the Commonwealth's representative should be a man of the highest attainments and reputation. I feel confident that honorable senators will agree that <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> Dixon is eminently suited for the position. He has had a distinguished career. After a successful period at the bar, he was appointed a justice of the High Court of Australia in 1929, a position which he has continued to occupy with great distinction. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Owen</inline> lias, in addition to his duties as a justice of the High Court, performed services Cor this country as  chairman  of the Central Wool Committee since 1940, and  chairman  of the Australian Coastal Shipping Control Board and Marine War Risks Insurance Board since 1941. The Government considers itself fortunate in having been able to obtain the services of an Australian of such outstanding ability to fill its most important diplomatic post abroad. I feel sure that this appointment will not only commend itself to honorable senators, but also receive the approval of the people of Australia. [ trust that the bill will have a speedy passage. </para>

It seems to me that the Government should have congratulated the Right Honorable R. G. Casey, our retiring representative at Washington. This opportunity should have been seized by the Government to commend <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> upon the valuable services rendered by him to the Commonwealth, and upon the fact that he has been elevated to a very high position as a member .of the British Cabinet. It falls to the lot of few Australians to gain such a distinction, and, although <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Casey</inline> is no longer associated with Commonwealth administration, 1 feel sure that he will remain a good Australian and will continue to represent the Commonwealth overseas. It is not possible for him to forget his native country, as I believe he represents about the third or fourth generation of his family in this country. He is to be congratulated upon the great work he did for Australia. </para>

                    <para>I should like to indicate some misgivings which I entertain in respect of the practice that appears to be growing up of appointing members of the judiciary to posts of this kind. I believe that it is a very sound rule that men who are appointed to judicial office should be appointed for life; and that they should hold those offices for life without possibility of promotion, or change, so far as Government appointments may be concerned. In saying this, I do not criticize this Government in particular, because the previous Government followed this practice. I realize that in circumstances such as we are faced with to-day, we are obliged, perhaps, to do rather extraordinary things. Precedents for this practice can be found even in the United Kingdom. However, it is not undesirable to sound a word of caution against a too frequent departure from what I believe to be the very sound basis of our judicial system, namely, that judges should hold their office as judges for life, and there should be no possibility of any one suggesting that they may be able to obtain favours by promotion, or otherwise, from a government. </para>

The remainder are the result of further discussions which I have had with the  chairman  of the joint committee, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson.</inline> Their object is to ensure that certain provisions of the bill effecting alterations of existing conditions will be more in keeping with the relevant recommendations of the joint committee. </para>

                    <para>.- This clause is taken from the current act, but it seems to me that paragraph <inline font-style="italic">e</inline> is stringent, and may at times prove inconvenient. Two points occur to me in regard to it. First, I do not know how frequently the commission will meet, but I should think that it would not be impossible to have a period of two months in which there would be only two or three meetings. We know that virtually the consent of the Governor-General means the consent of the Minister, but formalities have to be gone through. I shall not move an amendment, but I suggest that if the period is to be two consecutive months, it should be sufficient to obtain the consent of the commission. The Minister should consider substituting the word " commission " for the words " Governor-General ". </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause precludes the commission from broadcasting advertisements. Some mischievous person may classify Treasury announcements relating to the war or the raising of a war loan as advertisements. In fact, such announcements are, in essence, advertisements. I know that the associated press of the country look upon them as advertisements, and many other professional advertisers consider that a number of the announcements made by the broadcasting commission are advertisements. </para>

                    <para>.- The amendment that the committee has made in clause 23 precludes the Minister from saying that the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald is covered by that clause. As originally drafted the clause provided that the commission should broadcast, free of charge, any matter the broadcasting of which is directed by the Minister. That has now been made " Subject to this act ". Therefore, clause 23 must he read subject to other provisions of the bill, including clause 24. The Minister cannot, therefore, rely on clause 23 to get him out of the difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- A government announcement may still take the form of an advertisement. It is only within recent years that the spoken word has been regarded as an advertisement. It is logical to say that both announcements, one at night over the air and the other the following morning in the newspapers, are advertisements. I suggest to the Minister that clarification of the clause is required. </para>

                    <para>.- Apparently the . Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> accepts the ruling that if payment is made for a broadcast then it is an advertisement, and if payment is not made, then it is an announcement. That is what it amounts to. The Minister's argument that the wording is approved by legal advisers is weak, because two legal gentlemen in this chamber have expressed entirely opposite views. In any case, we all know how legal opinions vary. Probably the Minister's legal advisers have not looked upon the matter in this light. I suggest that the committee would be satisfied if the Minister undertook to give the matter further attention in view of what has been said in this chamber, and then, if necessary, to recommit the clause. The definition of an advertisement as being something for which payment is made is hardly adequate, and I advise the honorable senator to seek further legal advice, [f he agrees to recommit the clause should an alteration be desirable, it may overcome a lot of difficulties, and no harm can be done. </para>

                    <para>.- It seems to me that honorable senators are at cross-purposes. This provision has operated for the last ten years, and so far as I know it has caused no difficulty whatever. The broadcasts referred to are not advertisements; they are simply announcements by the Government, and have to be approved by the Minister before they can be made. No charge is made for them, and they cannot in any sense be called advertisements. They are announcements in the public interest, and if they have been good enough for the last ten years, they should be good enough for the next ten years. </para>

                    <para>. -  I see no reason for quibbling on this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald claims that this clause might result in attempts to boost the sales of the <inline font-style="italic">A.B.C. Weekly</inline> to the detriment of other radio journals in Western Australia, but if the honorable senator reads the report of the committee thoroughly, he will see that it is recommended that the <inline font-style="italic">A. B.C. Weekly</inline> be not published in Western Australia. Apparently, there is some fear that the <inline font-style="italic">A.B.C. Weekly</inline> will receive undue publicity and the owners of other publications wish to prevent the national stations from being used for that purpose; but, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has pointed out, this clause was in the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act of  1932,  and no objection has been taken to it. I see no reason why there should be any objection now. </para>

                    <para>.- I do not dispute the legal reasons which have induced the Attorney-General's Department to insert in clause 23 the words " Subject to this act ". There may be very good legal reasons for that, but the difficulty occurs in relation to clause 24, and honorable senators on this side of the chamber are only raising this question in order that the matter may be put beyond doubt. I suggest to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> that all doubt would be eliminated by adding in clause 24, sub-clause 2, the following new paragraph: - </para>

All  doubt can be eliminated in the manner which I have indicated. No lawyer would be able then to suggest that a matter directed to be broadcast under clause 23 was a prohibited advertisement. </para>

Weekly</inline> may take steps to prevent the broadcasting of advertisements proclaiming the Australian Broadcasting Commission journal. There are certain legal difficulties and implications in this matter and I suggest that the Postmaster-General should give an undertaking to seek further legal advice on the matter and to recommit the clause if necessary. Obviously, it is impos sible, during a debate, to draft an amendment which will meet all contingencies raised by honorable senators. I am sure that honorable senators would be prepared to let the bill go through provided that an undertaking were given that this clause will be recommitted if necessary. If the Minister were not prepared to recommit the bill in this chamber, he could effect any necessary alterations when the measure reached the House of Representatives.

In ordinary circumstances, I should allow this provision to pass unquestioned, but, as money is urgently required for national purposes, I should like to know whether the Government is fully assured that it can reduce  the contribution to the national exchequer from this source without damage to the war effort. In my opinion, this is not an opportune time to increase the commission's share of revenue from listeners' licence-fees. I would vote against any alteration of the existing allotment during the period of the war if I had the opportunity to do so. At any rate, I should like to Hear the considered view of the Government on this poin t. </para>

                <para>Last week I brought to the notice of the Senate the way in which radio can be used for either good or evil. I have been asked by an influential body in Melbourne to bring to the notice of the Minister the advisability of granting licences to persons who are determined to educate children away from war as children of this generation have been trained in other countries. The clause seems to give a great deal of power to the Minister, and I hope that he will take notice of my remarks. </para>

                    <para>.- During ray second-reading speechI questioned the wisdom of sub-clause 2 of this clause, which provides that, after the initial licensing period of three years, renewals of licences may not be operative for more than one year at a time. I did so having in mind the fact that B class stations should be as competent, well conducted and educative as possible. I doubt whether they could afford to expend large sums of money on the improvement of their services if, after the initial three <inline font-style="italic">years</inline> licensing period, they could not expect security of tenure for more than one year at a time. I have not consulted any representatives of the commercial stations on this subject, but, looking at the matter from a business man's point of view, it seems to me that this provision restricts the incentive to develop commercial broadcasting and is likely to prevent the owners of B class stations from investing large sums of money in equipment and other improvements. No business man would like to know that his business would be secure for only twelve months at a time, and no investor would be likely to regard such an undertaking favorably. So far as I can see, the Minister has no power to cancel the licence of a wireless station except for broadcasting anything offensive or detrimental to the public welfare. At the end of twelve months, the Minister may cancel the licence of a commercial station if he considers that its programmes are poor. The Government seems to have made up its mind that the B class stations are to carry on, and it ought to enable them to continue their work under the best possible conditions. In other clauses, it is provided that the licence may be cancelled if the station broadcasts objectionable matter, and I quite agree that that power should be exercised by the Minister ; but, under this clause, it would be easy for the Government to close the commercial stations one by one. I am wondering if the clause is so phrased as to enable the Government to change its mind with regard to the commercial stations without reference to Parliament. </para>

                    <para>.- The commercial stations have been operating under regulations, but now they are to be recognized in the act. In their evidence before the Joint Committee on Broadcasting, their representatives did not raise the point that has been taken by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> They seem to be quite satisfied with a three years' licence and the annual renewal of the licence thereafter. I do not think that any government would take from them their present rights, unless it intended to nationalize the' broadcasting system. </para>

                        <para>- Admittedly ; but it seems undesirable, after the whole system has been investigated, to appoint another committee that would probably interfere continuously with the administration of the act. The proposed committee will be merely a nuisance committee. Should an important problem arise in the future, Parliament can appoint another joint committee to inquire into it. I am opposed to this clause and the following clause; and as it appears that honorable senators generally accept them, I take this opportunity to enter my protest. I do not think that the proposed committee will work well. It will certainly work to the detriment of the commission, and, very often, against the wishes of the Minister. I repeat that its only value will be a nuisance value. </para>

                    <para>.- I disagree with my colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> on this matter. The proposed committee will deal only with matters which are referred to it by resolution of either House, the Postmaster-General, the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations, or the Australian Broadcasting Commission. No individual commercial station, or any disgruntled body, or individual, will be able to place any matter before it. </para>

                        <para>- Extraordinary developments are certain to take place in the field of broadcasting in the near future. For instance, licences will have to be granted in respect of television, facsimile reproduction, and frequency modulation. No honorable senator will suggest that the responsibility for the granting of such licences should rest solely upon the Postmaster-General. Obviously, a thorough and independent investigation must be made into these very important matters. It will be the duty of the standing committee to make such investigations, and to report thereon to Parliament. Then Parliament, or the Minister, will deal with such matters. I submit that the developments which I have mentioned will represent a far greater undertaking than broadcasting as we know it to-day. </para>

I emphasize that no individual commercial station, but only the Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations, as a body, will be able to place matters before the committee. The federation is an excellent organization. Its members meet annually, and elect a committee and executive officers. It has laid down a code of ethics governing the behaviour of commercial stations. It is a very influential organization. I hope that the committee will adopt the amendment. </para>

Under the existing act the Australian Broadcasting Commission is empowered to appoint State Advisory Committees, and such committees have been appointed in some of the States. Tim clause proposes to alter the law by giving that power to the Postmaster-General instead of to the commission. I should like to know the reason for the alteration. Another feature of the clause is that it now makes it mandatory for the Minister to appoint State Broadcasting Advisory Committees. Such a clause should also provide for the constitution of these committees. That should not he left indefinite. </para>

I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Spicer</inline> would suggest that advisory committees appointed by the commission should adjudicate upon claims, or alleged misdemeanours, on the part of commercial stations. The appointment of these committees will not preclude the commission retaining its present advisory committees such as the " talks " committees.

Has the Postmaster-General any objection to making it mandatory upon the commission to conduct adult education programmes?

I suggest to the Minister that among the four should be a representative of the churches, which are extremely interested in the work, and collectively support it. They have a right to some voice in the broadcasting business. The Council of Churches, or some other representative church body, should be given the opportunity to make nominations. </para>

                    (South Australia). | 9.47] . - The committee ought to be given more information as to the constitution of the proposed advisory committees. The Minister has told us of three sections to be represented, but it seems to me that the size of a committee will be out of proportion to the work it will do. It will consist of seven members, although the Australian Broadcasting Commission will consist of only five members. It will be far too large, and the largest committee I could suggest would be  a  committee of five, seeing that the commission consists of only five members.

                    <para>. - The Joint Committee on Broadcasting represented that such bodies ought to be appointed to judge the actions of those persons who use the microphone to broadcast subtle jokes, some of which are nauseating to the public. The committee recommended that certain penalties should be imposed, and that when the Minister wished to exercise his power to penalize an individual or a station, his decision should be referred to an advisory committee. It was then pointed out that the only advisory committee that functioned was in Western Australia, and that although committees had been appointed in the other States, they were not functioning. The Australian Federation of Commercial Broadcasting Stations contended that it was wrong that a charge against them should be referred to a committee appointed by the Australian Broadcasting Commission. As a result, the committee agreed that the new committees should consist of seven persons. It was thought that there would be one representative from the Postal Department, one from the commercial stations, and one from the Australian Broadcasting Commission, so that unless four representatives of the public were added-, unfair decisions might be made. I am of opinion, and the committee should be also, that a competent body should be appointed in each State because the penalties imposed, although they are. not so heavy as I should like them to be, are nevertheless very drastic. Before they are enforced, they will be submitted to a committee, which will report to the Minister on the action to be taken. .The committees will have other duties, but that will be their most important function. </para>

In addition to Parliament, there  i3  the Minister, the  commission, a parliamentary committee, and advisory committee. The Government says that the bill is a good one, and that we are going to have a broadcasting commission consisting of experts. It indicates, however, that it is not satisfied with the persons it will appoint, so it will impose on them a standing committee and other committees. It reminds me of the quotation - </para>

I do not know whether that will keep them up to the collar, but it will certainly have the same effect as hobbling them. The joint parliamentary committee reported that the commission had done good work, but, unfortunately, the committee spoiled its recommendation by saying: "Although this commission has done excellent work, and although we expect the new commission to do excellent work also, we want it hobbled so that it cannot do what the experts think it should do, but must do what we as non-experts think it should do ". There is a commission which will advise the Minister, who will advise the Government, which will advise Parliament, and so on. It is so ridiculous that every body will be broadcasting or advising on broadcasting. There will be constant complaints and demands to the Minister to " Put me on this nuisance committee in Western Australia, or South Australia, so that I can gain fame by complaining about the Australian Broadcasting Commission ". The bill, taking it all round, is good, but the Government is seeking to spoil it by appointing too many watch-dogs. It is not common sense to hobble the commission in all its operations. </para>

In Western Australia, there is a committee of twenty members, and in South Australia a committee of twenty members.We propose to reduce those committees to seven. I confess that the problem is rather difficult. I would have preferred two committees, but I shall support the Minister's proposal. We have had a long conference on the subject, and the provision in the bill is the best practicable solution. </para>

It was my desire when Postmaster-General that all the States should become interested in this tremendous scientific power of broadcasting.

The State advisory committees, of which we have a large one in South Australia, have never functioned. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the committee to stick to the scheme. The committees are only a little gesture, but they enable the States to feel that they are in the business. Broadcasting is only in its infancy, and there are things that appeal in different ways to the different States. Although the scheme has not operated, it will operate in future. It will gi ve the commercial broadcasters and the general public an opportunity to present their views, and will help the Australian Broadcasting Commission in deciding the class of programmes to be broadcast. The proposed standing committee also will ensure that State points of view are put forward, because the bill provides that the committee shall include one member from each State. The appointment of the committees will be in the hands of the Postmaster-General, who has outlined how he proposes to exercise his powers. I have felt that for a number of years the commercial stations have not been getting a fair deal in regard to their security of tenure. That also is a matter which can be brought before the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Broadcasting or the State committees if necessary, which could investigate the matter and make recommendations which no government could ignore. Broadcasting to-day is only in a transitory stage. No one knows what will be done in the future in regard to such developments as television. I support the Government in this clause. </para>

Song writers and composers generally in this country have great difficulty in getting their work broadcast over the national stations or recorded by the gramophone companies. At present, the gramophone recording companies are controlled by an outside monopoly and all profits go to other countries. My suggestion is that the 2£ per cent, provided for in this subclause be stepped up gradually to 50 per cent., say, over a period of ten years. Surely we have song-writers and musicians in Australia who are capable of giving us Australian music, and so reducing the broadcasting of imported jazz items. In support of my argument T desire to place on record a statement which I think sets out concisely the views of Australian composers in regard to this matter. It is written by an Australian song-writer whose songs were produced and broadcast in England, one written with an Australian collaborator, winning a first prize offered by the British Broadcasting Corporation, and another having a world broadcast through that Corporation since the composer returned to Australia. She was to appear before the British Broadcasting Corporation, London, in September, 1940, but having worked in evacuation centres and volunteered for evacuation by sea, was appointed to help to bring 480 British evacuated children to Australia in August of that year. Since returning to Australia she has found the nation's songwriters in the same position as they were when the conditions of boycott forced her to leave the country in 1938, when less than 1 per cent, of the songs circulated throughout Australia were Australianwritten. She has letters proving that the boycott dates from 1925, when one of the Australian importers of Hollywood songs wrote to her confessing that her songs contained merit but that his firm was bound by overseas' contracts. This same influence, but to-day considerably wealthier, blocked the song of the British evacuated children from being recorded and published on their arrival, after its great publicity in the Australian press and at all the ports of call on the historic voyage from Liverpool to Sydney. The Children's Welfare Department, Melbourne, asked the composer in vain for a record of the song, which is needed for the Australia-Britain talks of the evacuated children to-day, whilst such songs as <inline font-style="italic">Hallelujah, I'm .a Bum</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">FiatFooted</inline><inline font-style="italic">Floojie</inline> are recorded, and are for sale everywhere in Australia. </para>

                    <para>. - The Joint Committee on Broadcasting considered that the percentage of Australian compositions used by our broadcasting systems could be greatly increased, and it inquired as to their capacity to use at least 10 per cent, of Australian compositions in their programmes. At present they use about 5 per cent, of Australian compositions. The contemplated increase was very great, and it was not known whether either the commercial system or the national stations would be able to use 10 per cent, of local works. Columbia  Graphophone  (Australia) Proprietary Limited might have difficulty in recording that quantity of Australian works, but the committee has recommended that the firm should be required to do so. If that were done a great deal of assistance would be given to Australian composers. The committee was just as mindful as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> of this problem and i; investigated the matter thoroughly. I assure the honorable senator that there would be grave difficulty in finding suitable talent, because listeners expect to hear the very best in radio broadcasts. I consider that the Australian Broadcasting Commission has done a great deal to encourage Australian talent, and, if it continues this good work, the date when 2£ per cent, of Australian compositions will be broadcast cannot be far distant. I am sure that both the national stations and the commercial stations are anxious and willing to use Australian compositions if sufficient good talent is available. </para>

                    <para>.- The clauses proposed to be inserted by this amendment deal with a very important subject - the broadcasting of political matter at election times. Both clause 97, as originally drafted, and the proposed new clause 97 are, in my opinion, unsatisfactory. The new clause, as drafted, applies to all kinds of political elections in this country. It applies to Commonwealth elections and State elections, whether they be general elections or by-elections, and it applies to elections for the lower house of a State and for the upper house of a State. The important part of proposed new clause 97 is  to be  found in sub-clause 2, which provides that during the election period -  which  may merely be the period of  a  byelection in some State - the broadcasting of any politicalmatter in any part  of  the Commonwealth, and any matter  relating  to a political subject, shall be prohibited for the three days immediately prior to the election. In other words, if a by-election should be held for some remote constituency in the State of Western Australia for the upper house of that State, no broadcasts could be made in any State on Commonwealth political subjects. The proposed clause contains  no  definition of " political speeches " or  of  " matter relating  to a  political subject ". As a matter  of  fact, looking at the matter from the strict legal point of view, I doubt very much whether, during the three days immediately prior to any kind  of  election in Australia, anybody would  be  entitled  to  broadcast matter relating  to  the politics of Great Britain or any other part  of  the Empire. All such political topics would  be  excluded for the period  of three  days. </para>

                        <para>-That is so. Many people might regard this proposed clause as a godsend and hope that there would be some sort  of  election  at  least  once a  week in order to prevent the broadcasting of political matter. But that  is  not the object that the Government  has  in mind. It has in mind the laudable object of placing a restriction  upon the  use of broadcasting stations for political purposes during an election campaign. But surely such a restriction should apply only to the use  of  stations in connexion with the particular election which is being held. It is nonsense to suggest that, because some  by-election  for the Legislative Council  of  Victoria might  be in  progress, we could not have any discussion over wireless stations anywhere  in  Australia in relation  to  Commonwealth politics for three days during  that  election campaign. It is obvious that the clause in its present form is entirely unacceptable. I confess that I have  no  ready-made alternative, because I do not consider that it  would  be easy to draft  a satisfactory clause. I suggest to the Minister that the matter would be best left in the hands of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. </para>

                        <para>- That does create a difficulty. However, I suggest that the matter is so intricate, when it is considered in relation to all of the various types of elections that might be held, that it might be better to leave it to regulations or in the power of somebody, perhaps the Minister, to determine to what degree the broadcasting of political matter during an election campaign should be restricted. The clause in its present form is a hopeless proposition and should not be accepted by the committee. </para>

That shows how difficult it would be to police the honorable senator's suggestion. Therefore, I ask the committee to accept the proposed clause as I have submitted it. I have investigated this matter with the Joint Committee on Broadcasting, and I consider that we have arrived at a fair compromise in the proposed new clause which I have submitted. </para>

                        <para>- The proposed new clause 97a provides .that the commission, in the case of a national broadcasting station, or the licensee, in the case of a commercial broadcasting station, shall cause to be announced the true name and description of every speaker. What doe» that mean? Many writers in Australia have pen-names under which they are well known, but their true- names would mean little or nothing to listeners. What does the Minister mean by " description " ? Would a description such as the* have to be given of a lady who was giving a broadcast, " Gladys Brown, blue eyes, fair hair, height  5  feet"? I should hesitate to have a description of the Minister or myself given over the air. If a statement is required only as to the name and profession of the  speaker,  that should be made clear in the bill. Why should a famous author or musical authority who has adopted a nomdeplume which has become world-famous be required to divulge his identity? It is quite possible the broadcasting in Western Australia of any speech on a political matter could be prohibited under this clause because of a by-election in Queensland. The Minister should postpone consideration of this clause in order to draft a provision that would overcome the objections that have been raised.  I  am sure that the Minister does not desire to do anything unreasonable. </para>

                <para class="block">The provision contained in this clause has operated in Canada since 1936. What is desired is that the names of the sponsors of political addresses should he made known. At the last elections a certain political party broadcast over commercial stations a dramatized statement said to be of German origin. It was stated that Hitler would be pleased if the Labour party were to win the elections. Every member of the Joint Committee on Broadcasting made a sincere effort to discover the cause of the trouble, and it was found that certain stations had objected to broadcasting the dramatized speech referred to. The committee considered that such items should be banned. Surely a person delivering an address should not be ashamed to have his name made known. If he were ashamed to have his name announced at the beginning and conclusion of his address, he must be ashamed of, not only the matter broadcast, but also the political party con- cerned. </para>

                    <para>.- [ am not concerned with this matter from the point of view of allowing a New South Wales station to broadcast material during an election campaign and of preventing a Victorian station from doing so. If the Minister will consider this clause, I think that the position will he quite clear to him. It says that during the election period - in the case of a byelection in Queensland it would be a period of three days - the commission shall not broadcast any political speech or any matter relating to a political subject. That means that, if there is a byelection in Queensland, no speech by a Commonwealth Minister relating to a national matter, and having nothing whatever to do with the by-election in Queensland, may be broadcast. That is what the clause provides in perfectly plain language. It also provides in equally clear language that during that by-election period no matter relating to a political subject may be broadcast. We could not be told during those three days what was going on in the House of Commons, or what was taking place in this Senate. The committee did not intend that. What it intended was that there should not be broadcast during that period any matter relating to a political subject that was in issue in the particular election concerned. It did not mean that, because of a byelection in Queensland, a Commonwealth Minister could not broadcast a speech about Commonwealth politics. The provision is so wide as to make it ridiculous. I do not pretend to suggest what precise words should be inserted. Consideration of this clause should be postponed, or the matter should he left to regulations. </para>

                    <para>.- This is another clause which might be reconstructed. It seems to me that if station 3DB, Victoria, which is owned by the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> broadcast an item of news which it received from overseas, the <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> would be precluded from publishing the same item in its evening edition without the approval of the Minister. Surely that is not the intention of the Government. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to note that the Postmaster-General's innate  toryism  is coming out. He seems to take the view that anything that has been in operation for a number of years must be absolutely right. I am astonished to hear an argument of that kind from him. 1 should have thought that he would take the opposite view. I am endeavouring to improve this measure. I do not wish the Postmaster-General to make a mistake in respect of it. He is responsible for the measure, but when an honorable senator raises a point of this kind, which could be met by a simple amendment, he becomes angry. He thinks that he is being baited all the time. </para>

                        <para>- Already in respect of three matters in this measure we have prevented the Postmaster-General from making himself look supremely ridiculous. It seems to me that some amendment to this clause is necessary. I can imagine quite a lot of things which might happen under it. For instance, the proprietor of a small country newspaper might hear an important item of news broadcast, and thinking that it was universal, publish it. Under this clause such a person would be liable to a penalty for publishing the item. Many innocent people might suffer in that way. L have no doubt that honorable senators generally can imagine the troubles that might arise. The Postmaster-General could overcome the objections to the clause by giving power to newspapers to publish items which are broadcast by their own stations. </para>

                    <para>.- The object of this clause is simply to safeguard telegraphic revenue of the Postmaster-General's Department. When I was Postmaster-General, tremendous pressure was brought to bear upon me by 600 newspapers to permit them to publish items broadcast over the air. If that had been done, our telegraphic revenue would have vanished. This regulation has been in operation for years, and no one has taken exception to it. At first sight, it would appear that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie's</inline> objections are justified. How ever, it is quite another matter. This provision is designed to protect telegraphic revenue. </para>

During the second-reading debate, I, and other honorable senators, criticized this objectionable practice. Very often the offending advertisement includes a long talk concerning the misfortunes which will befall listeners suffering from certain complaints if they do not purchase the patent medicine being advertised. Does that come within the category of a medical talk, seeing that it is a medical subject? </para>

It appears that the sub-clause, as amended, would cover a garage where a car was being repaired in which there was an unlicensed wireless set. Under the bill, the occupier of the premises would he liable for prosecution. Sub-clause 7 states -  ft shall be a defence to a prosecution  for  any such offence if the defendant proves that he was not aware and could not, with reasonable diligence, have become aware of the existence in the premises of the appliance in question. </para>

                    <para>. - I make an appeal to the Minister on behalf of State schools. I urge that free wireless licences granted to schools that have an enrolment of fewer than 50 pupils should be extended to schools with fewer than 100 pupils. I believe that free wireless licences should be granted to all schools, because of the exceptional value of the educational items broadcast from time to time. Parents and citizens associations, and progress and improvement societies are called upon to pay for the wireless receivers used in schools. These excellent bodies do a vast amount of work in the upkeep of school grounds, and it is unjust that they should have to pay for wireless licences used for purely educational purposes. The Minister should consider the granting of free licences to all schools, or of altering the figure 50 to 100. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>I also appeal for free licences for invalid and old-age pensioners. Blind persons are already granted free licences. The argument generally used with respect to blind persons is that they must have some one in the home to assist them, and therefore are entitled to free licences. It is said in regard to invalid and old-age pensioners that a free licence would be used by other persons in the house. It is a fact, however, that many invalid and old-age pensioners must have assistance in their homes, and when they live alone no other persons participate in the use of their licence. They, as well as the blind people, are entitled to free licences. Blind people are allowed to earn up to the basic wage, but invalid and old-age pensioners are allowed only a meagre earning capacity. I ask the Minister to give favorable consideration to my request. </para>

                    <para>. - I intended to move an amendment to this clause, but I was called away to the telephone and missed the opportunity to do so. I wish to protest, however, against the increase in the licence-fees. The Government has given a large sum to the commission by providing it with11s. in the £1 and charging a fee of 10s. on each additional set. I do not object to that charge for wireless sets on business premises or in hotels, but in the homes of the people an extra licence-fee of 10s. should not be charged if there is a second receiving set or an extension of a set to another part of the premises. I know of many homes in which a new set has been purchased, and the original set has little or no value but remains in the nursery. Also, in many cases boys make crystal sets or small two-valve sets for use in their own rooms. In such instances, I think it is wrong to charge a second licence-fee, and I ask the Minister to see whether or not something can be done in this regard. I quite agree that in hotels or large blocks of flats where additional sets are installed the extra fees might be charged but not in private homes. </para>

                <para>The reference made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> to small sets, such as those made by schoolboys for use in their own rooms at home, is worthy of consideration, but there would be great difficulty in establishing a line of demarcation. A man who can afford to pay £700 or £800 for a motor car fitted with a radio set should be able to afford to pay an extra 10s. a year for a wireless licence. Similarly, Any one who has three or four radio sets in a palatial home should he able to meet the additional cost. I am confident that no industry will be adversely affected as a result of this additional imposition. </para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>The reason why Australia is full of imported songs is because the work of local song-writers of ability are prevented from reaching the Australian public in the strength and effectiveness given to the imported numbers. There is plenty of classical music, plenty of Australian pianoforte pieces, but between these and the vulgar crooning and other dance music there is practically no happy Australian " middle music " of songs for the people. Anything written by Australian song-writers in bright happy dance songs is literally killed by the importers of the American dance songs, who control all the means of publicity. Thus if. as happened in my own case at least eight times between 1924 and 1940  -  and I have all the proofs necessary between those dates, thanks largely to the Australian press - an Australian song is produced in public am i liked sufficiently for the public to enter shops to ask for copies of it, the men responsible for the boycott and monopoly refuse to publish or record the song, urging the retail shops to persuade the Australian inquirer to buy an imported song instead. </para>
                        <para>The composer himself is helpless, for he finds that recording is refused for the song, and the wireless stations use far more records than they use flesh-and-blood singers, finding the records much cheaper. Orchestration is refused by the publishers who publish orchestrations of the imported songs, and thus the composer cannot hear Australian orchestras or dance bands play his song. If he pays one of these men to do the orchestrations, the next orchestra leader wants to be paid to do a fresh lot. and the composer, getting no royalties, simply cannot afford to continue. T he song is thus kept from being recorded and broadcast several times a day (as the imported Hollywood crooning numbers are broadcast) . and kept from being played by orchestras and dancebands. There remains sheet- publication of copies, but (although that. too. is of course refused) the copies would not sell unless the song had previously been heard several times through being recorded and orchestrated throughout Australia. Here are someexamples of the results of the boycott, with, of course, press extracts proving each case: In 1935 a Sydney magazine offered a prize, with promises of full publicity to follow for Australian dance songs.  I  composed the music of the waltz song to which the first prize was given, the words being by Moore Raymond, the Australian journalist who is now entertainments editor of <inline font-style="italic">The Sunday Dispatch.</inline> London. The press in various States announced the result of the competition, and Chappels, of Sydney, published the song, "The Silent Waltz", in sheet music. Recording was refused, so the public was prevented from hearing it on the A and B class chain of publicity; orchestrations were not distributed to the orchestras and dance bands throughout the land, and the published sheet-music, lying unheard on the shop shelves throughout Australia was withdrawn by Chappells and burnt. This song, when I reached London, was produced at Australia House at a big function just before the war, but in Australia it had been sent swiftly to oblivion by the force arrayed against it by the wealthy monopolists. Two Covent Garden artists introduced a song of mine and Sarah Sheldon's in Australian city halls. (Sarah Sheldon is the Australian song-writer who collaborated with me in the song that was awarded national and Empire broadcasts by the British Broadcasting Corporation just before the war.) A representative hearing of what the Covent Garden artists had done to bring forward an Austra lian song they had expressed a high opinion  of,  said  to me : " Had that gesture been made outside your own country, it would have resulted in ^publication of your work. You must leave Australia." A visiting Englishman, hearing that " The Silent Waltz ", after winning the .Sydney competition, was supposed to be incorporated in an Australian film, said: "That simply  will  not be allowed to happen. J. am .in the film business,, and 1 have found, since my .arrival, that Australian films are contracted to American song interests for ten years ahead. You must get out of this country to .get a fair chance in Bongs." The  manager  of the Queensland A class station, 4QG, who had broadcast, through living  artists, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Sheldon's</inline> and my songs, although, as they were not recorded, lie had to broadcast the imported songs much more often than .he could the Australian songs, wrote and said: "Australasian Performing Eight Association has been .formed. Now at last the boycott will be smashed. Get into touch quickly with them." When I did get in touch with 'Australasian Performing Bight Association, as it was called, J found that one of the men leading hi importing American songs was either its  president-  or its  chairman.  When I, rather unwillingly, called on a fighting type of newspaper to ask it if it would expose the position of Australian songs, it refused. I was told by a press-woman, later, that this refusal was due to the large amount of advertising given to the paper by one of the song monopolists. </para>
                        <para>Shortly after  my  arrival in London, .1 called on a comedian about to come out to Australia on contract, and took him a humorous Australian song. "It's exactly what the people would like ", he said, " for I know the Australian public, but one of your Australian men .connected with my tour has just flown over to Loudon and made mc promise to sing only the songs arranged for me ". In the West End of London, after I had won first prize at the British Broadcasting Corporation, a business mau who had lived in Australia remarked: <inline font-style="italic">"A</inline> song composer from Australia ! That's rather strange. I remember the day when your leading song publisher tied up with foreign song interest to kill every Australian song lie could. It paid him ; he is a wealthy man out there now. But how can you be a .song-writer in a land where no song-writer can get his songs a chance?" When the Anzacs reached Britain, after war had been declared for some time, people asked why the Australian troops, unlike the Canadian, had no songs of their o\VU. excepting "Waltzing Matilda", but were singing Holywood syncopated tunes with American and negro phraseology. These songs sell at sixpence each in England, but in Australia the monopolists charge the public two shillings - a difference not accounted for by the difference in wages.. Lastly, although my list of songs includes many others treated likewise, the boycott killed the song of the evacuated British children, which had been recorded, broadcast and even filmed .at the many ports of call; both recording and publishing have been refused, as with nearly all songs that inspire and aid morale. Australia, the best fighting laud in the world, is robbed by the  monopolist of  tile song world of her own inspiring, fight ing songs at the greatest crisis of her  history  Finally, I hold the proof .that this position pre-dates " talkies " and wireless, so the importers who mis-call themselves publishers, blame those in vain, but they are still successfully, and with enormous financial profit to themselves, exploiting Australian children with unclean, imported songs and robbing them o!" songs of Anzac tradition and sentiment. </para>

                    <para>. - 1 protest against the Senate adjourning till next week when members of the Opposition are most anxious to discuss the motion for the printing of the Ministerial statement on the progress of the war. Furthermore, notices of motions were given to-day for the disallowance of two very important statutory rules. The Senate has not been meeting frequently, and in these days when statutory rules are pouring out in large numbers it is only fitting that the Senate should have an opportunity to discuss them promptly. Honorable senators who have come from distant States will be compelled to remain at Canberra to-morrow, but will not have a chance to proceed with the discussion of matters which are occupying their attention. I protest emphatically against this procedure. </para>

But it is obvious that if the senator had any evidence that secret wireless stations were operating at either of the addresses which he mentioned, he would not have discussed the matter publicly in Parliament, but would have informed either the Military Intelligence Department or the Attorney-General's Department. Either of those agencies would assuredly have hastened to investigate so serious an allegation. To mention the matter in Parliament obviously would have been to warn the culprits and enable them to remove evidences of their guilt. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Lamp</inline> must have sufficient intelligence to appreciate this. We can, therefore, regard his question and subsequent statement only as spiteful slander, uttered under the protection of parliamentary privilege, from motives of malice and in the full knowledge that no evidence whatever existed of his untruthful accusations. </para>

                <para class="block">The Minister representing the Minister for Commerce replied that departments other than the Department of Commerce were concerned in the matter and that the information desired was being obtained. That reply was given a week ago. I now ask if the Minister will make an early statement setting out the terms and conditions under which the Government proposes to deal with the proposal to encourage the increased production of potatoes and other vegetables for the financial year 1942-43; and, will the scheme be carried out and controlled bv the Stares on behalf of the Commonwealth, or by officers of the Commonwealth? Those questions relate to Government policy which has been decided. The Government has given certain information on this subject to Ministers in another State. Agreements have been reached but the Government has made no pronouncement which would give information on these subjects to the representatives of .the people in the Commonwealth Parliament. Members of Parliament, when asked questions concerning the matter, are unable to give detailed information to their constituents. They are questions on which the Government must at present have information and I ask the Leader of the Senate why the information given to people outside of Parliament has not been given to us. Much discussion has arisen on the subject and I understand that the Government has appointed a control board in connexion with the production of potatoes, that it is giving a certain price in Tasmania, and, I presume, in other States, but still the questions I have asked remain unanswered. "Why was the information withheld from members of this Parliament. We should be in a position to explain the details of the decision reached by the Government. I understand that the Government has made a contract for the purchase from Tasmania of 6,000 tons of blue peas of A-grade quality at 15s. a bushel. If there be a surplus above 6,000 bushels, does the Government intend to control that quantity or is it to be sold on the open market? If there is a quantity of peas available over and above the needs of the fighting services, under what terms does the Government propose to take over that quantity? The producers are now preparing for next season's crop, and the information desired should be made available so that there will be no misunderstanding over the next crop such as there has been over the last crop. It, may be that, the decision has been conveyed to the Minister for Agriculture in Tasmania, but members of this Parliament should not be placed in the invidous position of not knowing exactly the nature of the decision reached. </para>

I am informed that many sales have been made at £1 per bushel although the Government has undertaken to pay the growers only 15s. per bushel.

                    <para class="block">In that instance the Government has introduced new verbiage. The growers naturally wish to know why the 3s. was withheld if the peas were acquired. If a pool has been formed may the growers expect to  receive more  than the additional 3s. if sales warrant such a payment? The phrase "pending determination of the final price " requires elucidation. Obviously the answers to my questions need elaboration in order to prevent confusion. I therefore ask the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> to inquire from the Minister for Commerce exactly what is intended, and, in particular, whether, in fact, the growers may receive more than 15s. a bushel for their peas. </para>

                        " We stressed the vital nature of the industry to Western Australia, explaining that it provides more than one quarter of our national income and one-fifth of our total State revenue. Vast areas of our State are completely dependent upon it and if it ceased operating these would inevitably be denuded of population. Whole towns would close down and the economy of the State would be completely disrupted. Many mines once closed down could never be re-opened and an industry which could be of tremendous value in providing employment during the post war reconstruction would be prevented from fulfilling this valuable function."

                    <para>I have received a copy of a lettergram sent to the Prime Minister try the Secretary of the Chamber of Mines, Kalgoorlie, on the 1st May, in relation to those remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dedman.</inline> It reads as follows : - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>We understand Dedman is of opinion and has expressed to Willcock State Premier that Chamber of Mines approves of his proposal that all fit men under forty-five be withdrawn from industry and that further number of men over forty-five be withdrawn for allied work* programme. He further stated Chamber wac of opinion that mines could be carried on on fairly reasonable scale of operations despite such withdrawal of labour. This is entirely wrong and we cannot understand how Dedman arrived at such conclusion.. Proposal was placed before representatives gold-mining industry as absolute minimum requirement* of man-power by Dedman who at same time told representatives it was not the Government's intention to close the mines stop no acquiescence was asked for nor was it given to this proposal it was a plain statement as to what was to take place and the mining representatives did not consider they were serving any useful purpose by combating what was put to them as a condition which was inevitable whether the mining industry liked it. or not. If it is. the federal Government's wish that gold mining should continue on a reasonable scale in the interests of Western Australia then it is perfectly obvious that it cannot do so if the man-power as outlined by Dedman is to be withdrawn. This was clearly stated in memorandum handed to Dedman at the conference in Kalgoorlie. This lettergram is sent to yon so that there should be no misunderstanding of the position when it is considered by the Government. In fact the position at present is so acute that the call up of approximately 450 men arranged for 11th May will seriously jeopardize existence of some mines. Anderton, Secretary, Chamber of Mines. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The whole matter is of immense importance to Western Australia, and I should like the Minister for the Interior to ask his Cabinet colleagues who are handling the subject what their intentions are in relation to gold-mining. Originally we feared that the blanketing of the whole industry was contemplated. It appears now from the statements attributed to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dedman,</inline> which I have just quoted, that some other procedure is likely. If <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dedman's</inline> proposal is put  into operation it will undoubtedly destroy the gold mining industry, for it involves the denuding of the gold-fields of their manpower. The suggestion that allied works might be put in hand elsewhere is impracticable. It would be impossible for the miners to work many miles distant from their home, and for their families to remain on the gold-fields. I urge the Minister to endeavour to have some definite pronouncement made on the subject, because so many residents in Western Australia are dependent upon the mining industry for their livelihood, and are most anxious to know to what degree the Government's man-power proposals will affect the future of the industry. Many fear that such proposals will go so far as to paralyse the gold mining industry. </para>

I am now in a position to inform the honorable senator that I have conferred with the Acting Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Beasley)</inline> regarding his suggestion, and I find that every effort is being made to give the widest publicity to all National Security Regulations.

These statements are not always published in the form in which they are issued, and some of them are not published at all, as they relate to matters which are considered by the press to have no news value. The Government has no intention of compelling newspapers to publish any of these statements because that would be an unwarrantable interference with the freedom of the press.
