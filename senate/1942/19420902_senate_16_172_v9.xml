                        <para>That the following resolution be transmitted through His Excellency the Governor-General to  His  Majesty the King: - &#34; We, the members of the Senate in the Parliament of the Commonwealth of Australia, record our sorrow at the death of  His  Royal Highness the Duke of Kent, and express our profound sympathy in the great loss which Your Majesty;  Her  Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent and her children,  Her  Majesty Queen Mary, the other members of the Royal Family and the people of the United Kingdom have sustained.&#34; </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>It is with feelings of deep regret that I submit this resolution. As honorable senators know,  His  Royal Highness was killed in an air accident in the north of Scotland on the 25th August, 1942, while on his way to Iceland on active service duty as Air Commodore attached to the staff of the Inspector-General of the Royal Air Force. On the 19th May, 1939, a little more than three years ago, the announcement was made that the Duke of Kent had been appointed Governor-General of the Commonwealth of Australia.  His  residence would have been with us in this national capital, but war intervened, and it was decided that his appointment should not be implemented until peace returned to the world.  His  death, at the early age of 40 years, is a sad and tragic happening. It can be truly said that he died in the service of his country.  His  life as a member of the Royal Family, as a citizen, and as a husband and father, is eloquent testimony to the fact that the nations look in vain for any form of government or any way of life superior in its results to our British system of limited monarchy with its democratic parliamentary and other institutions. We feel very deeply for  Her  Royal Highness the Duchess of Kent and her children, who have sustained such a great personal loss - a loss which is shared by Their Majesties the King and Queen,  Her  Majesty Queen Mary and the other members of the Royal Family. In formally submitting the motion, I know that its terms express the feelings of every member of this Senate. </para>
                    <para>SenatorMcLEAY (South AustraliaLeader of the Opposition). - I second the motion, and in doing so express, on behalf of  His  Majesty&#39;s Opposition in the Senate, our heartfelt concurrence in its terms. The late Duke of Kent was indeed a gallant prince. With his supreme sacrifice, while on active service, his name will be indelibly linked for all time, with those of the Empire, who have fallen in defence of all that we cherish. He was a man amongst men, and held the love and respect of the people.  To all Australians his most untimely end has a particularly poignant meaning.  His  appointment as Governor-&#60;General of this country caused our people a great deal of happiness, and we &#39;know, too, that both he and his gracious consort, the Princess Marina, had anticipated with pleasure and interest, their sojourn amongst us. Fate ordained otherwise; the blast of war shattered our mutual .plans, and finally carried beyond our sight the man and the Royal Prince whom we had hoped to have amongst us. Our thoughts go out to Their Majesties the King and Queen, to the Princess Marina and to all the members of the Royal Family in their bereavement - a bereavement which is common, to all the subjects of the King. </para>

                    <para>- Honorable senators will have heard with regret of the death, on the 7th of last month, of the Honorable James Hume-Cook, a member of the first Commonwealth Parliament. In the course of his service as a member of the House of Representatives he held office as Minister without portfolio for the greater part of 1908 in the second Deakin Ministry.  His  parliamentary career extended over almost a quarter of a century as, prior to his period of nearly ten years service in the Commonwealth Parliament, he was for fourteen years a member of the Victorian Parliament. He was associated with those who strove for social improvement and took a leading part in the activities of the Australian Natives Association and the Australian Industries Protection League. I am sure that the achievement of social ideals and the remarkable advance that has taken place in Australia&#39;s industries must have afforded him great satisfaction in his declining years. On behalf of the Senate, I extend to his widow and children our deepest sympathy. I move - </para>

He died at the age of 76, after more than 50 years in public life. Not only the parliamentary sphere, but also civic administration received the benefit of his exceptional knowledge. He was Mayor of Brunswick, Victoria, for a term. He also displayed considerable interest in other matters of public importance, such as health and youth movements. </para>

                    life was dedicated to the service of the people, and this spirit of sacrifice is further reflected in the fact that his eldest son, Keith, is at present serving in the Royal Australian Air Force abroad, whilst Kevyn, his second son, has been reported as missing in the Malayan campaign. I came in contact personally with the late gentleman on numerous occasions, and his keen enthusiasm in all matters of public interest was particularly noticeable. The Opposition supports the motion and joins iri expressing sympathy to the widow and children of the deceased gentleman.

Honorable senators will be glad to know that he had no declining years ; his brain was as keen within three weeks of his death as at any period during his lifetime. He worked right on to the end, and for the good work that he did I believe that he received his reward. He was a remarkable man in many ways. Although a parliamentarian, and engaged in public controversy most of his life, I do not think that he had any enemies. That was because he did not allow any controversy to become bitter. In addition to his great&#39; work as a public man he had a flair for literature and art, and, what is somewhat unique in a public man, he even wrote a very fine book of Australian fairy tales. The community has sustained a loss in the death of a man of his calibre, and I feel a keen personal loss because of the passing of a very old friend. </para>

                    <para>. - Honorable senators on this side of the chamber support the remarks which have just been made by the Leader of the Senate. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard,</inline> who represented the  electorate of Nepean, New South Wales, in the House of Representatives, was particularly well known for his interest in members of the Australian Imperial Force during the last war. He also took a very active part in committee work in the campaign to raise the funds necessary for the prosecution of the World War of 1914-18. He retired from Parliament in 1919, but maintained an active interest in charitable organizations in New South Wales. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Orchard</inline> was well known for the excellent work which he did as an original member of the Australian Broadcasting Commission.  His  public service provides a record of which his family may well be proud. On behalf of the Opposition I extend to his widow and children our deepest sympathy. </para>

He took  a great interest in every phase of the work devolving upon him in that  office.  I take this opportunity, on behalf of those engaged in the jewellery trade, to express regret at his passing. </para>

                        <para>- Has the Assistant Minister for Commerce seen, the article which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Telegraph</inline> of the 30th August, in which it is stated that 51 big dairy farms in the Casino district have closed down in the past twelve months, and that a recent government survey showed that 2,000 dairy farms in New South Wales were idle? According to the report, those farms had been closed as the result of &#34; more attractive salary baits &#34; held out in other avenues associated with the war effort. If the Minister has seen this article, can he say whether it is correct? If so, what action does the Government intend to take in order to meet this serious state of affairs in one of Australia&#39;s most important primary industries? </para>

                        <para>- Can the Minister for Trade and Customs explain to the Senate what action has been taken in order to prevent merchants, or retailers, of potatoes and other vegetables from exploiting the public? I ask this question in view of the very big margin between the price paid to the grower and the retail price. What action has been taken to protect consumers? </para>

                        <para>- About three weeks ago the retail price of potatoes was fixed by the Prices Commissioner at 2Jd. per lb. Previously, there had been, as the honorable senator has stated, much exploitation of consumers. Consequently, a large number of prosecutions is being launched, and in the statement to be delivered to the Senate this evening some indication will be given of the action which the Government proposes to take against similar offenders in the future. </para>

                    <para class="block">In doing so, I should like to intimate to honorable senators that the financial statement has been circulated in the House of Representatives, where it is at the moment being read. It was suggested to me that we should postpone our hearing of it until it had been presented to the other House, but, in accord with what has been frequently urged in this chamber, I considered that it was proper that we should let the other House get a little ahead of us and then, as the Minister representing the Treasurer in this chamber, present the figures to the Senate, which I now accordingly do. </para>
                    <para>When delivering his budget speech in the House of Representatives to-day the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> stated that the year just ended had brought to us a new and nearer menace to which we had responded with a new and mightier effort crystallized in the expansion of war expenditure from &#163;170,000,000 in 1940-41 to almost double that amount, and that a further enormous increase this year is inevitable. Last year war expenditure reached the record total of &#163;319,511,000. This was &#163;98,000,000 more than the budget estimate, an increase which was due to the &#34; nearer menace &#34; - the entry of Japan into the war. Of that huge total &#163;272,938,000 was expended in Australia and &#163;46,573,000 overseas. Additional taxation was brought down by the Government on three separate occasions - in October, in December and again in May. Counting these taxation increases the revenue budget provided &#163;108,635,000 for war purposes. Public loans and war savings certificates contributed a further &#163;126,852,000 to the war, &#163;5,596,000 was financed by the temporary use of treasury balances and the balance of &#163;78,428,000 was provided by means of treasury bills discounted with the Commonwealth Bank. </para>
                    <para>The estimated revenue for 1941-42, including the taxation imposed after the budget, was &#163;195,827,000. The actual revenue amounted to &#163;210,041,000, or &#163;14,214,000 above the estimate. The chief items accounting for this increase were customs and excise, &#163;6,881,000; income tax, including war-time company tax, &#163;2,414,000; and business undertakings, &#163;1,456,000. Total receipts from taxation were &#163;179,435,000. Civil expenditure last year was &#163;101,406,000, or &#163;2,049,000 less than the estimate of &#163;103,455,000. During the year &#163;119,S73,O00 was subscribed to three war loans raised in Australia and a conversion operation was undertaken to deal with the 4 per cent, loan of &#163;72,610,000 which matured on the 15th November. War savings certificates taken up amounted to a face value of &#163;13,194,000. and national savings bonds yielded &#163;059,000. The aggregate debt of the Commonwealth arid States as at 30th June, 1942, reached &#163;1,629,000,000, being &#163;718,000,000 for the Commonwealth and &#163;911,000,000 for the States. </para>
                    <para>Revenue for 1942-43 with present rates of taxation is estimated at &#163;235,881,000. an increase of &#163;25,840,000 over the collections of last year. Income tax, including war-time company tax, is estimated at &#163;106,326,000, an increase of &#163;28,762,000. Sales tax is expected to yield &#163;30,000,000, an increase of &#163;3,170,000. On -the other hand, customs and excise is estimated at &#163;6,7S0,000 less than last year. The gold tax is also expected to decline by &#163;5SO,000 because of manpower restrictions. Taxation from all sources is estimated at &#163;205,192,000, compared with &#163;179,435,000 last year. Business undertakings and miscellaneous services are estimated at &#163;30,689,000. I may add that these figures exclude a sum of &#163;27,174.000 which will be collected under the uniform tax plan and paid to the &#39;States as compensation. Arrears of State income taxes to be collected, &#163;6,315.000, will provide the remainder of the compensation. </para>
                    <para>Further mention of the uniform tax plan may appropriately be made here. The plan replaces the former multiple taxing systems of the Commonwealth and the .States and will operate for the duration of the war and one financial year thereafter. It was implemented by four acts, viz., Income Tax (Wartime Arrangements) Act 1942, States Grants (Reimbursement) Act 1942, Income Tax Assessment Act 1942, and the Income Tax Act 1942. In consideration of the States leaving the income tax field the Commonwealth will pay compensation yearly to each of them equivalent to the average of that State&#39;s collections from income tax for the financial years 1939-40 and 1940-41. Tho grants are as follows: - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para class="block">Four of the States challenged the validity of the legislation which was, however, upheld by the full High Court of Australia. All the States have since notified the Government of their willingness to vacate the income tax field during the period of the operation of the plan. I may say that the uniform tax plan will greatly simplify the work of both the public and the Taxation Department, will save man-power, and reserve to the Commonwealth for war purposes the increase in the taxable field that follows the expansion of war expenditure. </para>
                    <para>Total expenditure for the current year for purposes other than war is expected to reach &#163;109,492,000, or &#163;8,086,000 over the actual expenditure last year. Social services, to which I will refer briefly in a moment, account for &#163;5,546,000, post office works, transferred from loan, account for &#163;1,027,000, and &#163;1,513,000 is the net result of variations in other items. Legislation passed m May embodied the Government&#39;s proposals relating to invalid and old-age pensions. The maximum rate of pension was increased to 25s. a week, subject to variations in the retail prices index, but it cannot be reduced below 25s. without parliamentary approval. Other important concessions relate to the increase of permissible income for a blind person, pensioners in hospital, extension of pension benefits to aborigines and the liberalization of the provisions regarding maintenance by relatives. The new benefits provided by the act as amended will cost &#163;925,000 this year, and the total cost of pensions in 1942-43 is estimated at &#163;22,400,000. Last year, the actual cost was &#163;19,257,000. </para>
                    <para>The Widows&#39; Pensions Act, which became law iu June of this year, provides for the payment, subject to a means test, of pensions and allowances to widows over 50 years of age, widows with dependent children, and, for a limited period, to widows under 50 years of age and without dependent children, who find themselves in indigent circumstances upon the death of their husband. About 30,000 widows will receive help under the scheme, and the cost for this year is estimated at &#163;1,630,000. In its first year of operation, the child endowment scheme cost &#163;11.303,000, and the cost for a complete year is estimated at &#163;12,060,000. The Maternity Allowance Act has also been amended in two directions. The estimated cost of maternity allowances for 1942-43 is &#163;375,000. Last year, the actual cost was &#163;359,000. </para>
                    <para>Special grants to certain States will be made in accordance with the ninth report of the Commonwealth Grants Commission. The payments recommended compare with those for the previous year as follows : - </para>

                    <para>For the 1942-4&#39;3 wheat crop, the Government&#39;s plan for the stabilization of the wheat industry provides for licensed wheat-growers to receive #. net a bushel, bag basis, at sidings, on wheat up to the first 3,000 bushel.&#34;. This represents an increase nf about ls. a bushel for quota wheat. Wheat produced above the 3,000-bushel quota will be pooled and receive a just  price  on realization. In the meantime, the Government intends to make an advance against it at the rate of 2s. a bushel&#39; net at growers&#39; sidings. About &#163;27,500,000 will be required to meet the guaranteed price for quota wheat and the 2s. advance on the balance. It is anticipated that approximately &#163;9,500,000 will be received from local sales, leaving a deficiency of about &#163;15,000,000 until export sales are made. </para>
                    <para>The Loan Council has approved a borrowing programme of &#163;7,328,000 for State works, including &#163;150,000 on Commonwealth account for farmers&#39; debt adjustment. In addition, &#163;1,524,750 was approved for local and semi-government bodies. Actual expenditure for all governments in 1941-42 was &#163;15,524,000, including &#163;1,200,000 by the Commonwealth on post office works. </para>
                    <para>I come now to the key item - war expenditure. The estimate for 1942-43 is &#163;440,000,000- &#163;390,000,000 in Australia and &#163;50,000,000 overseas. This is an increase of &#163;120,000,000 over actual expenditure last year. Future events may compel us to increase even this huge amount. The estimates for the Departments of the Navy, Army, Air, Aircraft Production and Munitions together amount to &#163;415,000,000, and the other items aggregate &#163;25,000,000. The Government recently increased the pay of members of the forces and their dependants. The new scale provides for an increase of 6d. a day in the active pay of male members on special force or naval (sea-going) rates of pay, and 4d. a day in the active pay of members of women&#39;s auxiliary services. The allowance for a wife has been raised by ls. a day and for a first child 6d. a day. These increases came into effect last month. A private soldier without dependants will now receive active pay of 45s. 6d. a week compared with 35s. in October, 1941, before the present Government came into office. A married private, after deducting the compulsory allotment of 3s. 6d. a day, will receive 21s. a week compared with 14s. in October, 1941. The weekly payment for a wife with, for example, two children, has increased from 70s. to 91s.; thus the total military money income of a family consisting of a private soldier with a wife and two children has increased from 84s. to 112s. since October, 1941. In addition, 14s. a week deferred pay accrues after six months&#39; service. The latest increases will involve additional expenditure at the rate of &#163;10,500,000 a year. </para>
                    <para>Before dealing with new taxation proposals it is necessary to remember that last year the Government imposed additional taxation on no less than three separate occasions. Some of those taxes operated for part of the year only. The additional amounts estimated to be collected last year as a result of those new taxes were &#163;33,200,000, but the estimated additional collections for a full year were much greater, namely, &#163;58,520,000. The additional &#163;25,000,000 estimated to be received in a full year should therefore be regarded substantially as new taxation for the purpose of this year&#39;s budget. The Government has naturally taken this into consideration <inline font-style="italic">in</inline> connexion with further proposals this year. As already announced, the Government proposes to grant further taxation concessions to members of the forces. All members whose civil and military income in 1941- 42 was less than &#163;250 a year will be exempt from income tax in 1942-43. These concessions will cost &#163;1,000,000 in 1942- 43. The Government has decided not to impose the uniform income tax on income from gold-mining. The existing gold tax based on production will be continued. New taxation proposals relate to entertainments and customs and excise. The Government proposes to re-enter the entertainments tax field for the duration of the war and one year after, the States having agreed to suspend their entertainments taxes for that period. The States will receive compensation based on the taxation formerly collected by them. In a full year the expected gross return is &#163;3,250,000, and compensation to the States, &#163;750,000, leaving a net revenue to the Commonwealth of &#163;2,500,000. This year the gross yield expected is &#163;2,400,000, and net yield &#163;1,800,000, allowing &#163;600,000 for compensation. Increases of customs and excise duties are proposed which will yield additional revenue of &#163;12,000,000in 1942-43 and &#163;14,200,000 in a full year. Details will be announced in another place. These new taxes will bring the total additional taxation imposed by this Government since it came into office to an annual value of approximately &#163;75,000.000. I may say that in the last pre-war year, 1938-39, taxation was about &#163;74,000,000. Since then it has trebled on account of the war. It is now about &#163;219,000,000 and about half the increase is the result of action taken by the present Government. </para>
                    <para>The budget position for this year can now be simply summarized in this way: War expenditure is estimated at &#163;440,000,000,. and civil expenditure &#163;109,000,000, making a total of &#163;549,000,000. Toward that sum, revenue is estimated to bring in &#163;249,000,000. the bulk of which, viz., &#163;219,000,000, will come from taxation. The balance required is &#163;300,000,000 and it is proposed that this shall be financed by loans. For the first two years of war, the war effort was carried on without entrenching on civilian consumption to any great extent, and reserves of manpower and materials were then available. In the third year of war, with no reserves to draw upon, we added to the war effort as much as was accomplished in the two preceding years. This has meant a great change in our economic system. Twelve months ago, 25 per cent, of our man-power was engaged in the war effort; to-day, 50 per cent, of our man-power is engaged in the war effort. Since the Production Executiveof Cabinet was established last December, more than 300,000 men and more than 50,000 women have entered war production or the services&#34;, but we must devote still more men, factories and materials to the war. This explains the increase of war expenditure by &#163;120,000,000 for the current year. The additional resources needed for war must be taken away from the already reduced resources engaged in producing goods for civilian consumption. As a result, spending power will come into the hands of the people at a far greater rate than the nation can afford to provide goods and services for civil needs. The Government cannot allow this excess spending power to compete against the nation&#39;s war needs or to menace price stability, and it will take whatever measures are necessary to prevent this. </para>
                    <para>I know that there are some people who think that the war should be financed entirely by central bank credit, but the Government is convinced that in that way lies grave danger. I have made it clear that we have used all our reserves of labour and equipment and that recent expansion of war effort has been obtained by subtraction from peacetime production. Further expansion of war activity means further reductions of the things that remain for civil use. Expansion of bank credit, therefore, without a corresponding capacity to expand production would increase purchasing power without increasing the supply of goods and services. Increasing the volume of money without increasing the supply of goods for civil consumption not only creates the danger of inflation but it sets up serious competition between demands for civil goods and demands for war requirements. As further physical resources are provided by the nation for war, so must further financial resources be similarly provided from the savings of the people. This can only be done if every individual saves and contributes to the utmost of his capacity. To finance &#163;300,000,000 by loans is indeed a huge task but not an impossible one. The spending of every shilling must be closely watched. To indicate the directions in which savings should be made is the purpose of the Government&#39;s austerity campaign which will be launched to-morrow. </para>
                    <para>I will now mention briefly some other items of the Government&#39;s policy for the current year. The Government has approved the establishment of a mortgage bank, and a bill will be brought down at an early date. In National Security (War-time Banking Control) Regulations issued last November and National Security (Economic Organization) Regulations issued last February the Government&#39;s banking policy was made effective. During the year the field of price control was considerably extended. To provide for better enforcement of price control, provision will be made for the imposition of minimum penalties. The Government proposes also to bring down a bill aimed at the suppression of &#34; black marketing &#34; by the imposition of the most severe penalties. </para>
                    <para>The Government has been giving close consideration to the vitally important question of post-war reconstruction. For some time past, research work in this connexion has been undertaken by the Reconstruction Division of the Department of Labour and National Service. This preparatory work promises to be of considerable assistance in formulating plans to cover the very difficult period of transition from war-time to peace-time conditions. A committee of Ministers consisting of the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley),</inline> the Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt),</inline> the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward),</inline> and the Minister for Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Holloway),</inline> has recently given special consideration to the whole question of post-war reconstruction. The Government has accepted its recommendation that it is necessary to invest the Commonwealth Parliament with legal powers sufficiently wide to save the nation from the chaos which is likely to result unless the Commonwealth Parliament is able to deal with post-war reconstruction on a national basis. In time of peace the constitutional limitations on Commonwealth powers, together with the divergent views of six State Parliaments, are a serious impediment to the nationwide planning and the national undertakings which must be an integral portion of the period of reconstruction. </para>
                    <para>Much of the organization for war would not be possible under peace-time powers. Nevertheless, similar organization and undertakings will be necessary for the work of reconstruction. Broadly our poetwar aim must be the physical development of our country, linked up with expanded production and increased population. By these means employment will be assured to our people and security to the children of Australia. Power to control prices and production is an essential adjunct to any progressive policy of physical development. Such control is possible today only because of war powers. Present powers would disappear with the war. They must be continued by constitutional alterations. </para>
                    <para>Further, we shall have to deal with such matters as the re-establishment of members of the fighting services in civil life, the transfer of munition workers from special war-time occupations to other suitable avocations, the development of primary and secondary industries, the provision of maximum employment, the prevention of profiteering and the control of prices, the maintenance and improvement of the standards of living of those engaged in rural as well as in industrial occupations, the carrying out of national works, the problem of housing the people, the question of national insurance, national health, and, broadly, the general problem of social and national security in the difficult post-war world. All these projects demand national organization in peace-time as effective and comprehensive as that required by the exigencies of war. It follows that the Commonwealth Parliament must be armed with full powers to carry out this programme of reconstruction. </para>
                    <para>Our allied leaders have laid down in the broadest terms the nature of the four freedoms for which the United Nations are striving - freedom of expression, religious freedom, freedom from fear, freedom from want. This Government intends that the objectives shall not be a mere placard, but shall be carried into effect. It will therefore ask the people of Australia to arm the Commonwealth Parliament with full power to ensure that, the four freedoms shall be enjoyed throughout the Commonwealth and its territories. For all these great purposes a special constitutional amendment will be required, and the Government proposes to bring down a bill with that object in view. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, the Government calls upon every one resolutely to face the fact that we are fighting for our very existence. Physical resources will be the deciding factor in the struggle and these must come from the people. They cannot be obtained by easy financial expedients. The Government calls upon all Australians to accept whatever sacrifices are needed. </para>
