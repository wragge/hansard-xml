          <para>- Standing Order No. 423 provides that when any honorable senator objects to words used in debate and desires them to be taken down, the  President  shall direct them to be taken down by  the  Clerk  accordingly. During the course of a debate in the Senate yesterday, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> requested that certain words used by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> be taken down. I accordingly directed the  Clerk  to take down the words and to read them aloud. Upon this having been done, it appeared that the words were not offensive or disorderly, and that Standing Order No. 423 had been misapplied. The purpose of this standing order is to protect honorable senators from objectionable, offensive and disorderly expressions, and it should be applied for that purpose only. The reading of such words must be followed by an explanation, withdrawal or apology by the honorable senator deemed to have offended against the standing order. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to obtain a further loan appropriation of &#163;75,000,000 to finance war expenditure from Loan Fund, and to authorize the raising of an equivalent amount of loan moneys to finance that expenditure. Loan Act (No. 2) 1941, which was approved by Parliament in October last, appropriated an amount of &#163;50,000,000, which amount together with the balance of appropriation which was available at the 30th June, 1941, covers war expenditure from Loan Fund up to about the middle of March, 1942. A further appropriation is therefore necessary to carry on our war plans. In the present circumstances, it is impossible to say with any degree of certainty what our requirements will be, hut it is anticipated that the present bill will cover loan expenditure to the 30th June next. Since <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> beginning of the war, Parliament has granted war loan appropriations totalling &#163;234,000,000. The total war expenditure to the 31st January was &#163;148,000,000. The estimate for thefinancial year 1941-42 exceeds &#163;260,000,000 ;it may reach &#163;290,000,000.

            <para>. - The Opposition will support the bill, but I take this opportunity to comment on statements made recently by Ministers which must have a damaging effect on any future loans which may be raised in this country. I asked the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> some questions on this subject yesterday,but with his usual skillbe gave to me replies which I regard as unsatisfactory. Parliament is the place in which honorable senators should be free to criticize the government of the day; and whatever government is in power it should appreciate the position of the Opposition and not resent criticism by its members.I trust that in the discussion of this bill, there will he no repetition of the heated comments which marred yesterday&#39;s proceedings, but that Ministers will take notice of remarks made by senators sitting in Opposition. I wish to refer particularly to statements made by the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron).</inline> The Leader of the Senate gave no indication yesterday of his attitude towards such statements. I shall be satisfied if he will tell us whether or not, as the Leader of the Government in this chamber, he approves the statements of his colleague. I am not satisfied with his statement that the matter has been referred to the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> I remind the honorable gentleman that the Senate has equal rights with the other branch of the legislature, and that we expect the Leader of the Senate to announce Government policy, and not merely to state what has taken place in the House of Representatives. I mentioned yesterday that the Minister for Munitions <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> when speaking in Adelaide recently, made a stirring appeal to the people to support the Liberty Loan and I am pleased to know that numbers of small investors have contributed to that loan. </para>

For two days I have had on the notice-paper a question asking if the Government proposes to pay to members of the Militia the same rates as are paid to members of the Australian Imperial Force. In the opinion of many people, the remuneration of munitions workers is out of proportion to the pay of the soldiers. Under the guise of war necessity, some Ministers in the present Government are attempting to override decisions of the Arbitration Court by rising the rates to be paid to females employed in certain industries.

              <para>- The fixing of wages and conditions of employment is a matter for the Arbitration Court, not for the Minister for Aircraft Production, who takes his instructions from trade unions with which he has been associated for many years. I deplore that policy. Yesterday 1 drew attention to the enormous amount of expenditure now being incurred, and the influence which the trade union movement is exerting upon this Government. I again protest against the policy of the Government of empowering the Minister for Munitions and the Minister for Aircraft Production to fix rates of pay in industry. That is political interference with the Arbitration Court, and political pandering to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions. I sincerely trust that when Parliament next meets we shall have an opportunity to discuss the regulation to which 1 have just referred. If the Government wants to create unity, and influence all sections to pull together inour war effort, it must not, under the guise of war emergency, implement the policy of advanced socialism which has been advocated in this Parliament by certain members over a number of years. </para>

          <para>As the Minister in charge of the bill, I take the opportunityon behalf of the Government to clear up any misapprehension which may have arisen from any statement published in the press or in any quarter concerning the payment of interest. The Government shall honour the advertised rate of interest on any loan. It shall persist in the same attitude as the Labour party adopted when it was in office in 1929-31. At that time, when this country had 400,000 workers unemployed, the Government paid an annual interest bill of &#163;39,000,000 despite the fact that it could not obtain &#163;18,000,000 to assist the unemployed and the primary producers in this country. I make that clear to the people of Australia, despite what may be said by anybody, irrespective of the position he may occupy. The current Liberty Loan is proving most successful. We want it to be even more successful. Indeed, if the people of Australia realized the seriousness of our position, we should not be getting the amount sought, hut eight or ten times the amount asked for. </para>

          <para>The Loan Council agreed to consider at its next meeting  a  proposal by the Queensland Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forgan Smith)</inline> that the procedure should be varied to enable expenditure by  a  semi governmental body to be authorized to cover a term of years instead of having to be authorized piecemeal from year to year. The first money raised for the defence of this country was &#163;10,000,000 by way of a loan which was approved by the Loan Council. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dwyer-Gray,</inline> then Treasurer and Acting Premier of Tasmania, expressed the opinion that to continue to borrow money in the ordinary way from thebanks was an ignoble concession to an antiquated system of finance. He said that it was just as necessary for us to beat the present banking system as it was to beatthe Germans. The motion moved by the Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Cosgrove),</inline> which 1 have just read, was ruled out of order by the  chairman  of the Loan Council, who is now Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. For the last four years I have been trying to impress  upon honorable senators the suicidal nature of the policy of borrowing money from the private banks when, according to the finding of the Royal Commission on Monetary and Banking Systems, there is no necessity to do that at all. That is made quite clear in paragraph 504 of the royal commission&#39;s report. Paragraph 530 of that report is also important. It states that ultimately Parliament is responsible for the finance and good government of Australia. The Commonwealth Bank has certain powers delegated to it to be used in the interests of the nation. If at any time there he a difference of opinion between the Commonwealth Bank Board and the Government, there should be a free and frank discussion on the matter, and if that discussion fails to clear the position, the Commonwealth Government should tell the Commonwealth Bank Board that it proposes to take full responsibility and instruct the Commonwealth Bank Board how to act. This private bank racket has been going on long enough. To-day there is a nation-wide demand for monetary reform. Already five of the six State Parliaments have passed resolutions demanding that the findings of the royal commission be put into effect, and that the Commonwealth Bank Board be asked to finance all the necessary credits for public borrowing. Over and over again I have exposed the swindle of our private banking system. </para>

              <para>- I repeat that it is a swindle, and honorable senators opposite have acquiesced in it for years. Every bank branch throughout the Commonwealth has a notice over its door, &#34; Buy War Savings Certificates &#34;. Some time ago I asked the Minister representing the Treasurer in this chamber what was the value of war savings certificates sold by the private banks. The answer I received was &#163;15,000,000. On that occasion I pointed out to honorable senatorsjust what the selling of war savings certificates over the counter of a private bank involved. I asked further, how did the banks pay the Treasury for the war savings certificates which they sold, and the answer was that payments were made by cheque. That merely proved what I have always said, namely, that when a loan is floated no actual money reaches the Treasury. The hard-working public has been asked and urged to buy war savings certificates, and latterlythey have been threatened that if they do not give their money voluntarily it will be taken from them. The money obtained by the private banks from the sale of war savings certificates merely goes to swell their cash reserves. Not one penny reaches the Treasury. Any one with a know ledge of finance knows that cash reserves of the banks represent their lending or purchasing power in government bonds. After selling &#163;15,000,000 worth of war savings certificates, the banks are in a position to purchase war bonds from the Commonwealth Government valued at about &#163;130,000,000, Can honorable senators imagine a bigger racket than that ? Am I not right when I call it a swindle? I have drawn attention to this matter time and time again and no one has been able to contradict my claims. If I am wrong then it is time that honor able senators opposite were able to prove it. but beyond a sneer or a jeer there has been no attempt to prove that my statements on finance are not correct. I also brought to the notice of honorable senators the fact that in 40 years a balance-sheet has never been presentedby any government showing how this country stands as a trading concern. That shows how little most people know about the principles of political economy. George Bernard Shaw once defined political economy as the art of spending the national income in such a way as to bring happiness and prosperity to the greatest number of people. Surely no honorable senators can claim that this Government or any other government of Australia has ever worked on that sound principle. It cannot be denied that the incompetence and inefficiency of democratic governments brought dictatorships into being and is directly responsible for the rotten state of the world to-day. People place their destiny in the hands of their governments, and the present world conditions can be charged only to democratic governments. At this stage I thinkI am quite justified in reading to honorable senators the objectives of the Australian Labour party in the matter of banking - </para>

            <para>Everything in war must be paid for - not by reducing wage standards but by the use of the national credit. Because of a Labour government in the Federal Parliament, there is a Commonwealth Bank. It was created as a means for releasing national credit. But because Labour lost office the national bank has been transformed by our opponents into a mere puppet of the private banks. Asa requisite to national defence the Commonwealth Bank must have restored to it its original charter. When we are in power, we shall proceed to redeem the national bank from its slavery. The cost of war can be met without piling up huge debts, andwithout interest payments sucking our national lifeblood.The Commonwealth Bank must, with a Labour government, work out a freer and fuller life for our people. </para>

          <para>The old bugbear of inflation which ha? been used by the banks in the past  to  intimidate the people can no longerbe used, because it has been proved to be only a bogy. To-day there is a nationwide demand for banking reform, and it is time that this Government decided  to  use the national credit to the fullest possible advantage, in accordance with the Labour platform. I must confess that I am amazed at what is going on. If the banks were actually lending money it would he a different thing. We are now told that bank profits are to  be  limited and controlled, but I am not concerned at all about the 4 per cent. ; I am concerned because I know for certain that loan subscriptions  by the  private banks are not in the form of money at all. All that is used is credit which the banks themselves create out of nothing. According to the  chairman  of directors of the largest private bank in New South Wales, all the money for the Commonwealth Government&#39;s &#163;20,000,000, floated some time ago, -was subscribed by the private banks. When the bill providing for the loan came before Parliament, I asked how the money was to be raised and I was told that it would be raised through the agency of the Commonwealth Bank and the private banks. I was very doubtful . at the time as to how much was to come from the Commonwealth Bank, and when the loan was floated I asked how much of it had come through the Commonwealth Bank and how much through the trading banks. The Government refused to reply to my question. Surely members of Parliament should know something about the Government&#39;s financial transactions. We were asked to pass legislation under certain conditons -, those conditions were not fulfilled, but the Government refused to tell us what had been done. The men who come back from this war will be taxed to meet the cost of it, just as the soldiers of the war of 1914-18 were taxed. There has been no alteration of the financial system since then. The men who return from this war, and the widows and orphans of those who are killed, will have to pay in perpetuity simply . because government after government in Australia has adhered to the old orthodox ideas of finance. Conditions have never been so unorthodox as they arc to-day. Under the present system, governments do not govern at all. They are under the thumb of high finance, and must do -what the banks tell them to do. The banks also control the newspapers and the radio stations, which have great power to&#39; mislead the people. I have often heard it said that the people get the sort of government that they deserve. I do not agree with that. Millions of honest- people in Australia would like to have a different system of government. </para>

            <para>- They want a policy different from the policies of all governments since federation. The honorable senator smiles. We are asking men to face all the horrors of war, and even give their lives, for 6s. a day. I cannot, see anything to laugh about in that.I have not smiled in this chamber for a long time. The things that happen in. here hurt me very much, as they would, hurt any man with honesty of purpose. After serving in the Senate for fouryears, I have reached the conclusion that, whatever party may be in power, the people will never receive the consideration to which they are entitled. I am. sorry to have to say this, but the conclusion is inescapable. The people of England are talking to-day about restricting, the profits of the hanks. But nothing has been done in Australia to restrict banking profits, nor has anything been done to prevent the banks from creating credit out of nothing and charging it up to the nation at 3&#189; per cent. I am not concerned about the amount that the banks make in their ordinary profits. If people are prepared to accept 2&#188; per cent. on their deposits and to pay 6 per cent. for their overdrafts, that is their concern. But are we prepared to allow the private banks to create out of nothing the hundreds of millions of pounds&#39; worth of credits that will be wanted for the prosecution of the war, as they have done in the past? No man can truthfully deny that they have done so. We should use our own credit through our own great national bank for the needs of the war. That was the purpose for which the Commonwealth Bank was created. But no government has ever used it for that purpose. Australia has never had a government worthy of our heritage. I am an old man with a lot of experience, and I attended meetings at which federation was advocated by the great orators of the early days. Those men sold the people. They told us that the cost of federation to each taxpayer would be little more than the value of a dog licence. If the early Commonwealth governments had- understood finance, we should not be in the shocking position that we are in to-day, nor would we be at war. </para>

          </continue><para class="block">Europe&#34;, which had been prepared by <inline font-weight="bold">Major C.</inline> H. Douglas, the only man who told the people of Europe that war was inevitable under the existing monetary system. Unfortunately, that statement has proved to be true. I recall attending a ceremony at the Cenotaph in Sydney a couple of years ago, when a wreath was placed on the monument with a large placard bearing these words, &#34; Because you would not think, we had to die &#34;. That was a true statement. Because there has been no constructive thinking by Australian governments, hundreds of people are dying to-day and millions more will have to die. Until we have in this Parliament men of character who will put what they can into it instead of taking all that they can out of it, there will be no change of the present shameful system. A committee of members of this Parliament is at present considering social reforms. What is the use of that? We all must know that our rotten monetary system hasbrought the existing dreadful social conditions into existence. We cannot improve social conditions until the cause of our present bad conditions is removed. Professors tell us that, in the physical world, there is no effect without a cause. Why do we not get down to fundamentals, and find the cause of all the trouble in the world? Since I have been a member of this Senate, I have learned that no members of any government that has been in office during that period has tried sincerely to find what must be done in order to improve social conditions and make the world fit to live in. </para><interjection>

              <para>- I know that it is true. I have been told that it is so by a bank manager. Perhaps the honorable senator has not been bothered in this way so far. One honorable senator said to me several days ago that it is almost impossible to change the monetary system for the reason that members of Parliament with bank overdrafts dare not open their mouths in an attempt to do so. That is a fact. If a member of Parliament is muzzled by thebanks in this way, he has no right to draw a salary as a representative of the people. I asked the Government what it cost to float the last loan. I was told that the costwas &#163;41,800. All of these costs would be done away with if we used the Commonwealth Bank.Stock Exchanges are complaining because their operations have been restricted. When an inquiry took place, it. was found that the banks did not hold a great number of stocks. I investigated the big amounts that were subscribed to the last loan. The Australian Mutual Provident Society subscribed &#163;1,500,000. </para>

              <para>- I am not the Government, and I am not responsible for its policy.I am exposing the rotten financial system of the governments that preceded the present Government. The loan proposed in this bill is to be raised according to the old Menzies-Fadden system. Eighty per cent. of all war loan subscriptions come from the banks in various ways. A bank manager told me that he made one man take up &#163;1,000 worth of bonds. Although he had previously told the man that he must pay off his overdraft, he informed him that, if he took up the bonds, he need not worry a bout the overdraft. The bank bought the bonds and drew the interest. Yet that would he called a voluntary contribution to the loan. That is only one of the swindles that is being perpetrated on the public. Does any honorable senator think that an organization as big as the Australian Mutual Provident Society would have &#163;1,500,000 waiting to be invested in a war loan at 2&#189; per cent. when it could charge the people who have given it business in the form of life assurance policies a rate of 7 per cent. for overdrafts? That sum of &#163;1,500,000 carried a bank commission of &#163;2,750. The manager of the Australian Mutual Provident Society instructed the society&#39;s bank manager to apply for &#163;1,500,000 worth of bonds. With that application, the bank received &#163;2,750, which represented 5s. per cent. on the whole loan. I do not know whether the bank would split that commission with the society or not, but it would hold the bonds as security against the overdraft advanced for the purpose of purchasing the bonds. Not one of the big business concerns which contributed to that loan is operating without an overdraft. </para>

              <para>- Then where do the banks get their profits? As a business man with  50  years&#39; experience, I know that hardly a firm in Australia operates without an overdraft. Nevertheless, businesses with big overdrafts can make applications for bonds up to an amount of &#163;750,000. All that their banks have to do is to send a cheque for the amount of the subscription, just as they do for war savings certificates. The war savings certificate swindle is the biggest racket that has ever been operated. When the banks learned that no person would be allowed to hold more than &#163;250 worth of certificates, they made their employees subscribe. Every &#163;1 taken over their counters for the sale of certificates goes to swell their cash reserves, which represent their lending power. In Great Britain, people have tried unsuccessfully to obtain information about the operations of the banks in that country. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Simon was asked whether he would bring in a bill to alter the charter of the Bank of England so that the people could learn who owned the bank and in whose interests it was working. He refused to do so. Great Britain ran up a bill of &#163;6,000,000,000 for the war of 1914-18 and is now paying &#163;300,000,000 a year interest on that amount. Does the Government think that it can raise the &#163;300,000,000 said to be required for this year&#39;s war expenditure merely by selling war bonds? The nine associated banks of Australia are holding only &#163;14,000,000 worth of notes between them and this, with their holdings of silver and copper coins, represents the whole of their real purchasing power, except by means of cheques. Yet in the first year of the war they bought &#163;67,000,000 worth of bonds and treasury-bills. The only way in whichthey could do this was to write cheques. All that they had to do then was to honour their own cheques. The period that elapses between the time when money leaves a bank to pay wages and dividends and when it returns to the bank is nevermore than ten or twelve days. If we asked a working man how much he had left of his last week&#39;s wages, he would probably say that he had paid his butcher, his baker and his landlord and had had a few beers; but his wages would have gone back to the banks, because he had paid various tradesmen and other accounts. This shows that it does not require a great deal of money to keep the banks in operation. </para>

          <para>Some time ago I offered a suggestion as to how the Government could reduce  its expenditure. I gave to the Menzies Government an idea which I claim is worth millions of pounds, but it was turned down. It was also rejected by the Fadden Government, and I have put it before the present Government. There is such a thing as reciprocity in business, If I sold a watch worth  &#163;10  to a man who was a tailor, I could arrange to take payment in the form of a suit of clothes. As the Government is paying out scores of millions of pounds to contractors, I suggested that every contract should contain a clause requiring the successful tenderer to use the Commonwealth Bank in order to finance his operations. By teaching the people to use their own bank, millions of pounds of revenue could be obtained. The credit of the nation stands behind every advance made by the Commonwealth Bank. If a contractor sent in a bill for  &#163;50,000  worth of goods, he could be paid by means of a Commonwealth Bank cheque, which he could put back into the bank in order to reduce his overdraft. We have been told that the problems of finance can be grasped only by those who have special training in monetary matters. I remember reading an article in which the writer said that the essence of credit is faith - faith on the part of the depositor that his money is safe in the bank, and faith on the part of the manager of the bank that his client will repay the advance at the right time. But that is a fallacy, because the essence of credit is approved security. I remember reading a statement by Professor McConnell, of the Sydney University, who said that banking is a business. He contended that a banker sold credit the same as a butcher sold beef, but I claim that there is no analogy between the two transactions. Before a butcher can sell beef he has to buy a bullock on the hoof, have it slaughtered and cut up, and put on view, and he can sell a bullock only once; but, metaphorically speaking, if a banker has one bullock on the premises he can sell seven or eight bullocks, and be paid for them by way of interest.  </para>
          <para>At the outbreak of the last war, the Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, pledged Australia to the last man and the last shilling. But what happened ? Not knowing anything about finance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fisher</inline> ran up a bill of  &#163;335,000,000,  on which Australia has already paid over  &#163;400,000,000  in interest. When the &#34; diggers &#34; came back from the war, their last shilling was taken in order to pay the bank interest. When I became a member of the Senate I was told that I was a voice crying in the wilderness, but, so long as this chamber remains a financial wilderness, and I am here, my voice will still be heard on monetary matters. It has not been raised entirely in vain, because a resolution has been passed in the House of Assembly of South Australia, where there is a government&#39; of the United Australia party variety, backing up al) that I have said regarding monetary pro blows. </para>

I shall not submit quietly to allowing a bill of this kind to be used for the purpose of trying to persuade the people of Australia that the Government intends to repudiate its obligations. That, I submit, was the intention of the Leader of the Opposition. When the last loan was raised, I received a request from the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> to appear on the public platform to support the loan, and I did so, in deference to his request. </para>

The Minister for Aircraft Production, whose statements gave rise to that impression says that he does not agree with the policy of repudiation, but he still adheres to the  view  that interest should not be paid on borrowed money. </para>

              <para>- Obviously the two honorable senators who have occupied most of the time taken up with this debate - Senators Cameron and Darcey - do not believe in the system of finance which the present Government is following.I repeat that the clear statement of the Minister in charge of this bill is welcomed, not only by the Senate, but also by the people of Australia as a whole, because they will now understand that this Labour Government does not subscribe to the tenets of some of the wildest of its supporters, but intends to adhere to the  terms of the contract which have been entered into and to pay the interest that it has undertaken to pay, both now and in the future. That is the plain meaning of the statement of the Minister in charge of the bill, and I welcome it.Whether or not the impression that was gaining ground was the fault of certain persons or the result of incorrect newspaper reports, the belief was widely held throughout the Commonwealth that certain Ministers were prepared to repudiate contracts for the payment of interest. I compliment <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> on his plain, forthright statement, which I believe will remove much misunderstanding as to the intention of the Government regarding interest payments and other obligations into which it has entered. </para>

I was one of many who offered to do what I could to make the loan a success, and the Treasury has evidence of my efforts in that direction.I was therefore astounded to read in the press that there was good reason to believe that the Government might repudiate its obligation to pay i nterest. </para>

            <para>. - I support the bill. With other honorable senators on this side, I realize that we cannot change the present orthodox system of finance overnight; it is changing automatically. A change for the better is being achieved gradually. I do not agree with the comment made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald on the statements made by the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey.</inline> Those honorable gentlemen were merely expressing their personal opinions. I agree with them that so soon as the time is opportune to improve, or abandon, the old orthodox system of raising loans, which is an inevitable cause of war because of the emphasis it places on the profit motive, we should follow such a course. Neither of those honorable gentlemen uttered one word which implied repudiation. Neither is repudiation implied in the measure now before us. I regret that honorable senators opposite have taken the opportunity during this debate to make a vindictive attack upon the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> and the Minister for Aircraft Production; each of whom is endeavouring to do all he possibly can in the prosecution of our war effort. The </para>

          <para class="block">Leader of the Opposition had much to say with respect to the expenditure of this money. He complained that much of it would be devoted to the payment of huge wages to workers in the  munitions industry whilst, at the same time, our soldiers were receiving only 6s. a day. He added that he would like to see our munition workers placed on the same rate of pay as the soldiers. I also should like to see that change brought about provided that every individual in this country was placed on the same basis, including members of this Parliament, Ministers, our captains of industry and all individuals now in receipt of high salaries. All of us, with the soldiers, should he placed on the basic wage; and every civilian from the Governor-General down should be set to work at which he can best serve the nation in its present crisis. If that were done, much expenditure could be saved and, at the same time, we should bring about a 100 per cent. war effort. That is my reply to the Leader of the Opposition. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald referred to the statements of Ministers who, he said, were irresponsible. I have found no member of the present Cabinet to be irresponsible. On the other hand, the honorable senator himself made several irresponsible statements. I trust that the bill will receive a speedy passage, and that in the near future we shall be able to finance our war expenditure out of taxation and through the people&#39;s bank instead of resorting to the old orthodox method of raising loans. </para>

            <para>.  - My reasons for supporting the bill arethe same as those which actuated the Minister for Aircraft Production <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> and the Minister for Labour and National Service <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> in making the remarks to which honorable senators opposite have taken exception. I do not subscribe to the principle of paying interest on public loans, because I do not believe that any section of the community should make a profit out of the horrors of war. No individual should be permitted to enrich himself in a time of war. I should certainly oppose the payment of interest on public loans if the economy of this country were such that the non-payment of interest would be equitable to all of our citizens. However, our economy being what it is, it would be most unfair to penalize those persons who invest their money in war loans. By placing portion of their wealth at the disposal of the Government they show their preparedness to make sacrifices. It would be wrong to penalize that section of the community. For that reason, I definitely subscribe to the payment to investors of interest at the rate prescribed in respect of past and current loans. That is definitely the policy of the Labour party. We have never entertained any thought of repudiation. At the same time, we regret that the Government has found it necessary in this period of crisis to follow the course dictated by expediency rather than mobilize the whole of our resources in the same way as it has attempted to mobilize our man-power. If it is right for the Government to take our manpower, transferring men from their homes and families to the defence forces, where they will risk their lives, and to our war factories, it is equally right that it should take control of all of the assets of our nation and use them for the defence of this country. </para>

              <para>- To some degree that may be so; but I submit that if we are to have a total war effort, the whole of the resources of the nation should be at the command of the Government. We know very well, however, that when an attempt is made to act a little harshly in respect of profits which have been made out of war contracts and war activity generally, the indignation of honorable senators opposite is immediately aroused. Whilst I realize that it may not be in the best interests of Australia to raise this controversy at this juncture, I deplore the fact that we are not able, as a government, to take control of the whole of the resources of this country for the time being by completely eliminating the profit motive. To-day we must first give consideration to profit-making in order to obtain our requirements of war material. Should the profit incentive be suddenly eliminated we know very well that industry, as it is now constituted, would not supply that material at the rate at which we require it. &#34;With the Minister for Aircraft Production, I regret that we still find it necessary to pay interest on public loans. However, as the Government, rather than disrupt our economy in a time of crisis, must resort to the expediency of raising loans, I am confident that it will honour its obligations to investors. </para>

          <para>.- The announcement by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> that Parliament may meet before the specified date leads me to suggest that, if that happens, some consideration should be given to members and senators who have to travel from Western. Australia. The congestion on our railways and air-lines is such that it is practically impossible to obtain bookings for less than a fortnight or three weeks ahead. Shipping, of course, has been cancelled. There is another matter relating to this question which, I think, should be investigated, and thatis the practice of giving priority on our transport system to various individuals whose status or mission is considered to be important. I have travelled with men who have been enjoying such priority, and usually I have found that their mission has not been important at all, except perhaps to the commercial houses which they represented. The whole question of priority should be given a thorough investigation. I consider that members of the Commonwealth Parliament travelling to and from sittings at Canberra should be ranked fairly high on the priority list. On my last trip to Canberra I was denied priority in the plane service from Melbourne, and yet on that plane were men who were solely on business trips. That state of affairs should not be allowed to continue. </para>

          <para>. - During the last two strenuous years, large numbers of regulations under the National Security Act have been issued, and it has come to tuy notice that in many distant localities people do not understand just what is being done. The difficulty is obvious. I realize that governments have to act suddenly at times, but such action leaves the public in a very uncertain state. I have heard conflicting views expressed, not only by individual citizens in the localities in which I move, but also by public men in responsible positions. Nobody seems to know just what he has to do, and what he has not to do. The air-raid precaution regulations are a good example. The general public is not aware of what is required &#60;&#62;f it, and guidance and advice should be given. I suggest to the Government that if one of the officers of the Attorney-General&#39;s Department were associated with some one who had the journalistic touch and could make a precis of the various regulations for publication in the press throughout the Commonwealth, the position would be greatly improved. If necessary, the Government could compel the publication of such statements, or pay a remuneration for the space occupied, if that be considered necessary. Apart from a relatively small number of people in the capital cities, the people of Australia generally are unfamiliar with the laws under which they live. I have . spoken to one or two Cabinet Ministers in regard to this matter, and I am sure that they appreciate the difficulties. It is important at this stage that people should have a thorough, knowledge of matters which affect them closely, and that could bo done by the publication in the manner I have suggested of a  pr&#233;cis  couched in plain language and entirely free of the legal terms in which regulations must necessarily be framed. </para>

          <para>.- In the course of my recent speech on international affairs, I referred to the Australian Broadcasting Commission&#39;s news sessions and the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> informed me that the news sessions from Canberra were entirely the responsibility of the commission. I think he also stated quite clearly that neither he nor the Government of which he is a member gave any direction to the Australian Broadcasting Commission in regard to these broadcasts. I accept the Minister&#39;s assurance that all the responsibility lies with the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Consequently, any criticism which I may voice in regard to these sessions must necessarily be directed to the commission and not to the Minister either as Postmaster-General or Minister for Information. I have received a number of communications in regard to these sessions. One of them was from Miss B. A. Leeper, of SouthYarra, Melbourne. The letter states - </para>

          <para>I note in to-day&#39;s press that in answer to a question from you, the Postmaster-General is reported to have declared that the broadcasting commission was given an entirely free hand in the presentation of its news services and commentaries. The letter of which I enclose a copyis  aflat  denial of this statement. The matter to which I had taken particular exception in my letter of the 21st January (to which the commission had taken a fortnight to reply ) was the interpolation into the midday session of oversells news of comment from two newspapers (apparently of Sydney, though this was not stated) violently attacking the British Government and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> in particular. I stated in my letter that this was the first timeI had ever heard local comment interpolated in overseas news and that this could notbut give rise to the suspicion that we were being given coloured, rather than objective, news, and that we were being told what the Government wishes us to hear, while English comment was withheld from us as far as possible. I am sure that I speak for a great many who resent the changed presentationof news and suspect the motives behind it, and I sincerely hope that it may be possible for you to bring to the attention of the Minister the flat contradiction between the reply stated to have been given by him in the Senate and the letter from the manager of the broadcasting commission. </para>

          <para>From its terms it is evident that you assume that the commission is entirely responsible for all broadcasts that are made from its stations. That is not so. The act under which the commission works gives an overriding authority to the Government through the Minister. In these circumstances I am sure you will understand that it would be improper for me either to indicate whether, and, if so, to what extent such authority is exercised, or to express an opinion on the merits of the broadcasts to which you take exception. </para>

        <para class="block">In that letter <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bcarup,</inline> the acting general manager of the commission, shifts the responsibility from his own shoulders on to the shoulders of the Government. On the other hand, the Government says that the entire responsibility rests with the Australian Broadcasting Commission. I consider that the commission should be held responsible for its own utterances. 1 realize that governments have a perfect right to give to people, through the medium of all broadcasting stations, any information which is likely to be of value to them, but no government has the right to use the Australian Broadcasting Commission for the purpose of disseminating coloured political propaganda. There is a great difference between the statements made by the Minister for Information on this subject and those made by the acting general manager of the commission in the letter which I have read. This is a very live question, and many people are concerned at the change that has been made in some of the alleged news broadcast in the Canberra news session.

        <para class="block">Such letters show that there is a great deal of concern in the minds of the public at the change that has occurred in our national news broadcasts. At this time, the entire radio system of both A class and B class stations should be used to the very best advantage for the stimulation of public morale. I was glad to notice recently that the Minister for Information stepped in and prevented a continuance of broadcasts such as those in which prominence was given for fifteen minutes in one session to a wrangle between an ex-Minister and a Minister of the present Government. The honorable gentleman is to be commended for stopping that sort of thing. Many of the statements that have been broadcast in the Canberra session have not been of sufficient importance to warrant their publication. I agree that important matters, such as statements in connexion with air raid precautions and announcements of government policy, have news value, but I have frequently heard long, rambling statements made by one Minister or another, which had no real news value, whilst commentaries by competent men have been almost discontinued.Never before in the history of Australia has it been more desirable to create in the public mind confidence in our governmental institutions and to maintain moraleby giving to the people plain statements of fact that have real news value. </para>

          <para>- It is not necessary to close bars altogether, but it would be wise to change the hours of trading. Hotel bars could he closed during some hours each morning and afternoon, as is done in Great Britain. I do not believe that six o&#39;clock is a suitable closing hour, or that it reduces the consumption of alcohol. In fact, the early closing hour is responsible for a certain amount of drunkenness that occurs each evening. Large numbers of soldiers often arrive in a town, after a hard day&#39;s work, just before closing time. A soldier has just as much right to his glass of beer as anybody else; probably he has mors right than others, because he is doing a wonderful job for his country. However, when these men arrive from their camps they have to join in a mad rush to get their drinks, because the bars have to close at 6 p.m. Consequently, instead of having an opportunity to drink in comfort, they have to swallow their beer hurriedly to the sound of the cry, &#34; Time, gentlemen, please &#34;. But that is not the worst feature of early closing. Crooks who run sly grog dives wait outside the hotels to meet the soldiers at closing time and direct them to sly grog shops. I should like to see hotel bars closed for some hours during the day and kept open later than 6 p.m. so that soldiers on leave who want to have a drink can do so under decent conditions. I should like the hotels to be kept open until 8 p.m. if necessary; that would be a much better time than 6 p.m. I am glad that the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> referred some days ago to the increase of drunkenness in the capital cities. All sorts of low class dives have sprung up where undesirable people congregate for the purpose of taking in our own soldiers, and perhaps the fighting men of Allied nations, who may be visiting this country. These men are liable to he taken in, given &#34;crook grog&#34;, and robbed. This evil is partly due to the fact that there are no other places of entertainment for our soldiers to attend. Many of them are strangers to the cities and when they are on leave they want to have a look around town. As the result, they are taken in tow by undesirable people. No matter what a man&#39;s views may be in relation to temperance, he must be deeply concerned, if he is a good citizen, at some of the things that are happening in the cities. I hope that the Government will give early consideration to this problem, because many good young lives are being mined by this evil. I do not believe that the men want to over-indulge in drinking. The circumstances which force them down into these hovels, which in :owe cities the police are apparently unable to control, are responsible for the trouble. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator BROWN</inline>(Queensland) &#91;2.56 J. - J. am greatly troubled by many problems in relation to our war effort, but I rise to speak of them with considerable diffidence because I fear that I cannot speak frankly without risk of acting detrimentally to the national interest, lt would be wise for  Ministers- and honorable senators to meet in secret from time to time so that honorable senators, who have many questions to nsk in relation- to the war. could do so without giving away vital information. The general public has a tendency to condemn the Parliament wrongly because members of Parliament are prevented from speaking openly by the fear that they may damage our military, naval or  air  situation. The people should know the reason for our reticence. Many of us would speak frankly to the representatives of the Government if they were to meet us in secret. I have said before that the war effort would benefit if the people were told the truth, and I still contend that the Government should tell more of the facts- of our situation to the public. Senators and members of thu House of Representatives have met in secret and have heard certain things that have not been told to the public. I believe that the complacency that has been evident in Australia since the beginning of the war has been largely due to the fact that we have not trusted the people to the extent that they should be trusted. Had they been told more of the truth wc should now be in a better position tha it we are to meet the onslaughts of the enemy. </para><interjection>

          <para>- I am not so foolish as to say that. There is a happy medium in all things, and I believe that wrong methods are being used both in Australia and in Great Britain with the result that there is complacency where complacency should not exist. The farther south one travels in Australia, the more one notices indifference in the attitude of the public towards the war. I know that residents of Queensland and other northern parts of Australia, who are virtually in the front-line, take a more serious view of the war than people in the south. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>There are some things that I should like to speak about with regard to Queensland, because there is no doubt that the people of that State are apprehensive. They are as full of fighting spirit as are the people in other parts of the Commonwealth, and they desire to fight. They are right in the front-line, and areanxious to be armed so that they can take their part in keeping the Japanese out of this country, or, if that cannot be avoided, in beating them back when they arrive. I should like to see the Senate spending most of its time in dealing with the immediate perils that confront US instead of discussing matters of comparatively minor importance. We should set to work to find out how we can best utilize the powers and courage of the people in order to defeat the enemy. If the courage and power of our people were efficiently organized, it could be used against the enemy, but are we fully utilizing the powers of the people for the purpose of safeguarding Australia? It does not matter to me what brand of government is in power at the moment. Under our democratic system of parliamentary government we have reached a standard that is not efficient in dealing with a totalitarian enemy. I do not blame individual Ministers. They are bound by the present system, and are affected by their environment; but there is always a tendency on the part of Ministers to excuse the mistakes of the governments of which they are members.. lt is a very serious matter when men in power think more of excusing their departments than of prosecuting the war. </para>
        <para>Before we meet again, God know3 what may happen. I am anxious that something should be done in those parts of Australia that are immediately affected by the present war situation. We should consider how we can best utilize all of the forces that are at our command for the purpose of defeating the enemy. I do not understand military strategy, but I know &#34;hat has happened in other countries, i feel certain that if we went about our tusk in the proper way we could coordinate the fighting power of the people in order to prevent the Japanese from advancing further southwards. We know that a defensive policy is wholly wrong and that the audacity shown by the Japanese has proved, and will continue 10 be, the winning policy. People in both political camps are blameworthy for the fact that the preparations that should have been made in Australia have not  been  made. Now the position is so  serious  that, every moment when the Senate is sitting, it should be discussing means of successfully fighting the Japanese. </para>
        <para>I do not wish to speak disparagingly of any honorable senator, but, viewing i lie matter in a general way, I consider that our methods of finance have had a had effect on the organization of industry find have not secured the best results from defence point of view. I shall refer, by way of illustration, to what has happened to a certain firm at Sandgate, near Brisbane. I realize, of course, that the war effort has been retarded in the other capital cities also, because of the outmoded financial methods adopted by both Tory and Labour Governments. The firm to which I am referring was manufacturing producer-gas units, and was capable of turning out one high-quality unit every quarter of an hour. Last June, it made .an application for a certificate of approval of its unit, and it was not until October that a movement was- set on foot to supply the .necessary certificate. Because this firm had put every penny it had into the laying down of a plant, which is admittedly one of the best of the kind in &#34;Queensland for the mass production of producer-gas unite, and because it was short of money, it. was prevented- from making over 1,000 units available for motor cars and trucks. Despite the fact that the firm had a contract for 1,000 producer-gas units at &#163;35 each, and had the necessary artisans, moulders and fitters to carry out the work, production was held up because the firm could not get the necessary financial accommodation. I have approached the Government and have asked- that something be done to assist the firm. Under the parliamentary system of government, public officers who are men of probity, and are anxious to do their best for the community, are victims of the vicious system under which they operate. Everywhere 1 have moved with the object of assisting this firm, I appear to have been confronted by a stone wall, as though there is some antagonism to the war effort in this particular direction. Men have come to me in my office in Brisbane with similar complaints. One of them said he believed that some fifth column was at work, because weeks went by without his being able to move goods from the control of the customs authorities. &#34; Everywhere I move <inline font-style="italic">&#34;j</inline> he said, &#34; a hand seems to be held up to frustrate me&#34;. Would the Japanese prevent a manufacturer of producer-gas units from carrying out a contract merely because of lack of finance1? The greatest crime of this firm was that it was unfinancial. </para>

            <para>- The contract was given by the Government for 1,000 units at &#163;35 each, and the tenderer was asked whether he required bank accommodation. Naturally, he thought that he would receive accommodation to enable him to carry on, but he did not get it. He mortgaged his home in order to raise sufficient money, and, with &#39;the help of a clever Russian, he erected the necessary plant, at a cost of &#163;4,000. That is why the contractor &#34; went broke &#34;. Is it right that a small firm which is not a member of the Manufacturers Association, but which desires to do its best in the interests of the community, should be prevented from contributing to the war effort because of lack of finance? Undoubtedly, we are &#34; on the spot &#34; in Australia, and anything that would help to safeguard this country should be considered seriously by every member of the Senate. Honorable senators opposite have laughed at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> and the Labour party as a whole because new methods of finance have been advocated, but I ask whether it is right that an industry, no matter how small, should be closed down because it does not happen to have the necessary finance. Such treatment of a firm is damnable. The cry has gone up that we should save petrol, but when a firm desires to provide necessary producer-gas units, it is prevented from doing so because of the rotten financial system in operation in Australia. </para>

I ask whether similar happenings have occurred in other parts of Australia. Steps should be taken to see that the war effort is not being retarded because of lack of finance. Referring to the plant at Sandgate, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> of the Main Roads Commission, declared that it was shameful that such a plant should be standing idle. If a dictator were in power, he would say that wherever there were men and machines, they  should be set to work, and the question of the necessary capital could be discussed afterwards. Possibly I have shown some heat in bringing this matter forward, but I do so in order to show how, under our obsolete system of finance, a man is prevented from doing useful work because of lack of funds. </para>

If newspaper reports are correct, as I believe they are in this instance, there is considerable unrest in Burma. So serious is the situation there that many Burmese are said to be assisting the enemy. Should that be so, we in Australia are affected, because we are vitally interested in the success of Allied troops in that country. Burma is being invaded by the Japanese and, according to reports, many of the native Burmese are allowing themselves to be used by the Japanese against the Allied troops. It may be that we cannot now help what has happened in Burma ; hut there is still India to consider. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Amery</inline> has expressed himself as being favorable towards giving to India a measure of home rule, but we know that the conservative element in Great Britain is bitterly opposed to any such reform. J shall not mention names, but I point out that when the British India Bill was before the House of Commons it was bitterly opposed by certain people in high places. There are strong forces at work against giving to India any measure of self-government. I shall not at this stage discuss the reasons for and against giving to India a measure of self-government, but I want something to be done in this matter. </para>

            <para>- I believe that Britain takes notice of Australian views. I believe also that Australians generally favour some measure of self-government being given to India. If we can do anything to rouse in the Indians sufficient enthusiasm to lead them to stand by our cause, even to the degree of risking their lives, the situation will be saved. Last December I was pleased to read in an editorial in the London <inline font-style="italic">Herald</inline> - an influential newspaper with a circulation of a bout 2,500,000 copies daily - a statement somewhat as follows: - </para>

That is my reason for bringing this matter forward.

            <para>- &#39;One of the things which make for a good and efficient army is discipline; and discipline is based on mutual understanding and respect between all ranks of the services. Major-General Bennett had that respect. He is now back in Australia in circumstances which prompt the question : &#34; Did he leave Singapore before an armistice was agreed to ? &#34; If he did, he deserted his men. If he did not, another question which may -be asked is: &#34;Did he remain in Singapore until after the signing of the terms of surrender and then leave ? &#34; If he did so, it may be assumed that he disobeyed the orders of the commanderinchief on the spot. If, however, he left after the surrender, and after being placed in open arrest, which is the equivalent of close confinement, he is to be congratulated on making his escape. I want to put the case impartially. Major-General Bennett was our general in Malaya, and was responsible for the care of some thousands of our men. He has been brought back to Australia and promised a good post here where he can exercise his talents. I repeat what I said earlier that discipline and efficiency are based, not only on training, but also on mutual confidence and respect between all ranks. It is only fair to this country and to Major-General Bennett that the  proper course should be taken, namely, that a court of inquiry should be convened to ascertain the circumstances in which he left Singapore. That, at least, was thecustom in my early years in the service. Whenever a man&#39;s conduct came into question, a court of inquiry was convened, and the man concerned was either acquitted or otherwise dealt with. Should an officer of the Navy lose his ship, he is brought before a court of inquiry, and either cleared of blame or suffers the consequences of errors. The Government owes it to itself, to the country, and to Major-General Bennett to convene a court of inquiry which, I remind the Senate, would be composed of Major-General Bennett&#39;s peers, and would be impartial. </para>

        </continue>
        <para>I endorse the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Poll</inline> in regard to the control of the liquor trade. Some of us who have been in the services know the effects of the indiscriminate sale of liquor in time of war. My suggestions to meet this problem are simple, namely, that the hotels should remain open until 9 p.m.; that their control should be tightened; that the sale of liquor in bulk should be forbidden; and that the hands of both the civil and the military police should be strengthened. If those remedies were taken, I think that most of the trouble would quickly be removed. </para>
        <para>I come now to a question which I asked in November last and repeated to-day, hut to which I have not yet received a reply. It relates to the Government&#39;s policy in respect of preference in employment to returned soldiers. I know that this question has placed the Government in a dilemma, but I ask the Government to come to a decision in regard to it. In view of the number of men in uniform to-day, and of the number who at the end of the war will have done front-line service, and also of the possible clash between the interests of those men and the interests of other men who have stayed at home, I hope that the Government will give earnest consideration now to the granting of preference to the men who run the risk and take the blows. Four months should suffice for the Government to make up its mind. I ask for an early decision in this matter. </para>
        <para>Having dealt with those important issues I now turn to a more prosaic matter, namely, the transport of Western Australian members of this Parliament to and from Canberra. I suggest to the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> that he should consider the setting aside on the Western Australian railways of certain accommodation for the use of members travelling to and from that State, so that the continual bargaining and worrying about accommodation on trains may he eliminated. My appeal should have some weight with yon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> as you know the difficulties associated with travelling to and from Western Australia. </para>
        <para>SenatorFrASER (Western Australia - Minister for External Territories) &#91;3.28&#93;. - This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> asked the following questions of the Minister representing the Minister for Supply and Development: - </para>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="1.">
            <para>Is it a fact that contracts for floor-boards for military camps in Tasmania have been let in Melbourne? </para>

          <item label="2.">
            <para>If so, were such floor-boards unobtainable in Tasmania? </para>

            <para>If not, why were the floor-boards not obtained in Tasmania? </para>

        </list>
        <para>I am now able to supply the following answer :  - </para>
        <list type="decimal-dotted">
          <item label="1">
            <para>. 2 and 3. No contracts for the supply of tent floors for delivery to Tasmanian camps have been arranged in Melbourne. All Tasmanian requirements of tent floors are being manufactured by Army personnel from Tasmanian hardwood flooring purchased in Tasmania. </para>
          </item>
        </list>
        <para>As to those questions which so far I have been unable to answer on behalf of the Minister for the Army, I point out that it is common knowledge that Major-General Bennett interviewed the Prime Minister and members of the War Cabinet in Melbourne recently. A sufficient answer to any criticism which may be levelled against Major-General Bennett is provided by the statement made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline> For that reason I fail to see the need for an inquiry. I feel sure that appropriate action would have been taken by the War Cabinet and the General Staff had there been any ground for the suspicion which the honorable senator says exists in the public mind that Major-General Bennett left his troops before the armistice was actually signed. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator E.</inline>B. JOHNSTON (Western ber last, I -brought before the Government the case of a <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. F.</inline> L. R. Polak, previously of Western Australia, who received a writ for &#163;3,039 12s. lOd. principal and &#163;1,281 Ss. 3d. interest, making a total of &#163;4,321 ls. 6d., in respect of an ancient debt, from one of the trading banks. I then set out the facts fully, but I invite the Minister to look into the case again. This gentleman had a farm in the Western Australian wheat belt. Ho invested a lot of money in the farm on which his sons worked until 1933 when they were obliged to leave the property. They then asked the bank to take it over but the bank refused. I do not think that the property was worth very much at that date; and since that time it has certainly deteriorated. I suppose that in the ordinary course of events the bank, like any other financial institution, would have had to stand its loss. However, <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Polak</inline> subsequently came into a little money, and bought a farm in Victoria. The sons also have a place there, and both properties are heavily mortgaged. The bank has not only issued the writ to which I have referred, but has followed it up with a bankruptcy notice. I know that in ordinary circumstances banks and other creditors get their pound of flesh ; but it appears to me that when a family like this is threatened with being driven out of their home and with bankruptcy, this Government, which, like its predecessor, is doing much to protect people in similar circumstances, should take a hand in the matter. It is the duty of the Government to protect innocent debtors in war-time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Polak</inline> was in a business. For a time he worked for me, and his sons worked on his farm. The family put their money into the farm. We have had- quite a lot of regulations lately in order to help people in similar circumstances. Under the Government&#39;s economic organization plan, of which a good deal has been heard lately, people have been prevented from selling their land, but an exception is made under that regulation in respect of persons whose land is sold for them under legal process or under the Bankruptcy Act. Such sales can still go merrily on. </para>

            <inline font-weight="bold">- Mr.</inline>Polak  told me  that  his elder son has enlisted in the Air Force, but has not yet been called up. That son&#39;s wife is on one of the properties. Probably when he is called up his mother, who owns the property in Victoria, which the bank is trying to sell up, may secure some relief. I suggest that this is a case for Government action, particularly by a government which is following the example of its predecessor in affording protection to people in similar circumstances under war conditions. Some provision should at least be made to ensure that this man cannot he sold up and his family driven off their property in Victoria without the matter first being considered by some tribunal. A tribunal should be set up to prevent creditors from making unjust use of the bankruptcy acts during the war. The bank&#39;s writ, being No. IS of 1941, was issued out of the Supreme Court of Western Australia. While some people would like to see fewer regulations passed under the national security legislation, the Government might well consider the wisdom of giving more protection to debtors. I urge the Government to look into this case not only as a special case, but as one of a class. All of us are aware that occupants of wheat properties have had a difficult time during the last ten or fifteen years. I should not like to see people who have made a start in another State unfairly pressed for an ancient debt. </para>

        <para>Honorable senators will recall that a select committee of the Senate, which reported on the case of Captain Conway, recommended that an <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment of &#163;100 be made to Conway, and that the previous Government refused to make such a payment. I should like to know whether this Government has given any consideration to that case, and whether it is prepared to make that payment, which 1 consider should be made. </para>
        <para>Dealing with the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> I am of the opinion that the greatest crime which any government can commit against its people is to withhold information concerning the war from them. Such a practice lulls them into a sense of false security, as has been shown by the experience of the peoples of many countries in Europe during the onward rush of the German hordes. I do not wish to see Australians have a similar experience. For that reason 1 support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> in urging the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> to ensure that proper and full information is given to the people concerning the war. The dissemination of such information, of course, must be subject to the requirements of national security. I also suggest that members of Parliament should be given more information than has been made available to them in the past. Such information should be given, not sporadically, but regularly. When the secret meeting of senators and members concluded, the Prime Minister intimated to those who had attended that all the facts had been given, but I am confident that all the facts were not given. I contend that we should have been consulted prior to the Malayan campaign. Secret meetings should be held more frequently in order that members of Parliament may know what is happening. In a statement made on behalf of the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> last week, the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> hinted that there might be an inquiry inro the Malayan campaign. I hope that an actual court of inquiry will be set up so that the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> in regard to Major-General Gordon Bennett may be considered. I do not make this suggestion in any carping manner, but I think that the people of this country should be made aware of the facts. At present, even members of Parliament do not know the full facts. Members of Parliament, who are the representatives of the people, should bc told, at secret meetings if necessary, exactly what is happening, so that they may be of some assistance to the Government. At the last secret meeting, we, as private members, were of absolutely no assistance to the Government. Private members should be taken into the confidence of the Government, and their services used to a greater degree than at present. </para>

          <para>. - I should like to make several observations, two of which relate to the speech made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown.</inline> First, it is true that the minds of most people have been greatly exercised with regard to the situation in India, especially in view of the fact that our aggressors in the Pacific belong to the coloured race. The honorable senator will be gratified to know, as I am, that steps are being taken to give to India a certain degree of autonomy. It was reported on the short-wave radio to-day that a certain gentleman whose enthusiastic support for a measure of reform in India is well-known is likely to enter the British Cabinet. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>Reference was made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> to a certain manufacturer. It seems that somebody is blocking the firm which desires to engage in the production of necessary appliances. There is no shortage of finance. I assure the honorable senator that government assistance has been given for the manufacture of many essential commodities. I know that quite well from my association with the Joint Committee on War Expenditure. Hundred&#39;s of thousands of pounds have been made available to people requiring assistance. I am sure that if the honorable senator puts his case before the appropriate authority, action will be taken. The Director of Finance has authorized the advancing of large sums of money, in varying circumstances, for the manufacture of essential requirements. These advances have been made throughout the Commonwealth, and I believe they have extended even to the north of Queensland, an area which is exercising our minds greatly at present. Even the benighted and- forgotten State from which I hail has had a fair share. There can be no doubt that producer-gas unite are urgently required in this country if motor transport is to remain on the roads, and if the case be placed before the Minister concerned, I am confident that there will not be the slightest difficulty in securing assistance, provided of course that the firm concerned has sufficient equipment to do the job, and is producing an article that the Government requires. </para>
        <para>I am afraid that the Minister for External Territories <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Fraser)</inline> did not get the point made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett.</inline> There is not the slightest doubt in regard to Major-General Bennett&#39;s courage or his worthiness as a man. </para>

            <para>- I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> did not suggest &#39; anything of the sort. I point out to the Minister that laymen such as myself rather rejoiced when we heard what Major-General Bennett had done. We thought that he had achieved a personal victory over our enemies, and would be able to give the military authorities here a great deal of valuable information. However, a closer examination of the <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps,</inline> and the degree of liaison existing between military authorities in other countries of the world, shows that for centuries it has been recognized that no commanding officer should desert his men. In these circumstances, it seems desirable that in order to rehabilitate Major-General Bennett in the eyes of the people - not in the eyes of the Prime Minister or other Ministers who have interviewed him, because they are more than satisfied - an inquiry of a military character should be held. </para>

            <para>- Certainly not. What we have to bear in mind <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> this: It has been intimated that Major-General Bennett will be given a high command in the fighting forces in this country. Therefore, in the interests of all those who serve in our military forces, from the private to those holding the highest rank, it is essential that there should be some pronouncement by a military authority. That is well known by Major-General Bennett himself, and no doubt he is prepared to stand up to the fullest examination by men of his own rank. I have no doubt that he will be able to justify his action. I have great admiration for the courage, skill and intrepidity of Major-General Bennett and  the others who participated in the daring escape. </para>

            <para>- Yes. It showed tremendous courage and great organizing capacity. However, the defence authorities have to go a little farther than that, because, in the first blush of the affair, many people said unpleasant things and are continuing to whisper them, to the detriment of those concerned. If a military inquiry be held, these people will have to remain silent. I only say this because of my desire to assist in the rehabilitation of this soldier, who I believe has done a good job for Australia. I am sure that that is the opinion of the Government. The honorable senator who has brought this matter forward has done so in the best interests of Australia and of Major-General Bennett himself. I ask the Minister to give consideration to the representations made by honorable senators, with a view to doing what is best in the interests of the officer concerned, and of the men whom he is to command. It is essential that the men who are to serve under him should be inspired with confidence in their leader, and an inquiry such as has been suggested will create that confidence. </para>

          <para>. - I had no intention of taking part in this debate, but I should like to add a few words to what my friend SenatorCollett had to say. As one who has been a soldier for more than 40 years in this country and in other countries, I personally shall withhold judgment until I know all the facts, hut all the circumstances of Major-General Bennett&#39;s escape from the Japanese should be investigated by a court of inquiry composed of officers of his own rank. That is owed to Major-General Bennett himself; it is owed to the men who remained in Malaya and who, in fact, are still under his command because he has not yet been relieved of that command. It is owed also to the men here in Australia who to-morrow may be serving under Major-General Bennett, possibly with the Japanese on our shores. I support what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> has said. There can be no doubt that there is an uneasy feeling and an underlying stigma which will remain until the full facts are known. 1 talked this matter over with brother officers at my club recently, and asked them what they thought. </para>

          <para>. - It is extraordinary that this matter should have been brought up and pressed in the manner in which it  has  been pressed this afternoon. I approach the subject simply as a layman,  as  do most other honorable senators. The community generally is in great heart because  at  least one responsible officer has returned from Malaya and can give the benefit of his experience to the Government. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> spoke of courts of inquiry to deal with stolen material. Such inquiries often involve a great deal of waste of time and energy, and they only add to the paper war that is being fought within the Army. If a tin of petrol is missed from Army supplies, a court of inquiry is established, and sometimes it takes a fortnight or longer to decide whether the petrol was wasted or stolen. Surely honorable senators realize that, in these days, we are not counting the days but the hours. It would be ridiculous to pull Major-General Bennett out of whatever job he has been given and force him to wait about while half-a-dozen &#34;brass hats&#34; consider whether he should have stayed in Singapore with his men, or whether, having done all that he could, he should have endeavoured to escape to his country in order to make his knowledge and experience available to us. British newspapers regarded this officer as the one general in the Malayan campaign who fought from the word &#34;go&#34;. Mis last cable message to the Australian Government, as published in the press, was that the Australian Imperial Force line would &#34;hold as usual &#34;. When the flag of surrender unfortunately had to be raised, and the Australian troops had to lay down their arms, he had done all that he could do.  His  next responsibility was to the Commonwealth, and he endeavoured to discharge that responsibility in the right way. I believe that the great majority of Australians approve his action. If the military gentlemen opposite want to stand by what has been happening in the Army for 40 years, they should wait for the war to finish, and then hold a court of inquiry at leisure. In my opinion the sooner we forget about what has been done in the Army for the last 40 years, the better it will be for us. The Japanese will not wait upon the decisions of any courts of inquiry. Anything that impedes speedy action by our military leaders and the Government in preparing, first, for the defence of this country, and, secondly, for the offensive that must be initiated in this country, is criminal. I hold strong views on this subject. f am pleased that Major-General Bennett has escaped and returned to Australia. He fulfilled his duty to his men, and then he successfully endeavoured to do his duty to the Commonwealth. He should be placed immediately in a position in which he can use the knowledge which he gained under extraordinarily trying conditions in Malaya and Singapore. If a court of inquiry is to be held, it should be held in happier circumstances, when there will be plenty of time for the members of a court to make whatever long-winded decisions they want to make. Apparently there are still many men in this country who would rather die, choked by the old school tie, than live without it. </para>

        <para>To-day the Leader of the Opposition asked the Minister representing the Minister for Home Security the following question: - </para>

          <para>Will the Minister inform the Senate, in connexion with the recent betting and racing ban imposed by the Premier of South Australia, whether such ban was imposed after consultation with, and with the approval of. the Commonwealth Government ? &#34;With regard to the order issued on the 6th January, 1942, by the Premier of South Australia restricting racing, the Premier acted under regulation 26 of the National Security (General) Regulations, which does not require a Premier, before making any order thereunder, to consult the Commonwealth or obtain its approval, and accordingly the State Premier did not approach the Commonwealth before making the order. The Commonwealth was, in pursuance of regulation 35a of the National Security (General) Regulations, consulted by the State Premier with regard to the making of an order imposing a ban on betting shops, and the Commonwealth concurred in the making of the order. </para>

          <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline>J. McLachlan&#39;s request that a precis of regulations be prepared and published will be passed on to the appropriate authority. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald referred to the subject of train and aeroplane transport to Western Australia and, presumably, to other places, for members of Parliament. That subject bristles with difficulties, but it is being very carefully examined by my department. In passing, I point out that matters such as this which have been raised in this chamber could have been dealt with much more effectively if the responsible Ministers had merely been interviewed by the honorable senators concerned. The subject of hotel trading hours, mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> is receiving the very serious attention of the Government at the present time. I was interested to hear <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foil&#39;s</inline> remarks about the Australian Broadcasting Commission. Apparently he is entirely dissatisfied with the commission&#39;s methods of disseminating Australian news. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald referred to the same subject. I suggest that when the parties represented by honorable senators opposite were in power, they were treated exceedingly well, and it ill becomes them to complain, before this Government has been in office for six months, that Ministers are, in their view, obtaining a monopoly to which they are not entitled. The questions regarding the war situation and the other points raised very  ably by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> will be considered. Some investigation should be made into the production of producer-gas units by the firm at Sandgate which he mentioned, and, in collaboration with him, I shall see that inquiries are made. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> spoke about MaajorGeneral Bennett. We can let that matter rest where it is, but I undertake to draw the attention of the appropriate Minister to the statements that have been made about it in this chamber. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> also referred to liquor trading hours, and his suggestions will be carefully noted. He further discussed the subject of preference to returned soldiers. I point out that we have been at war for a long time. The previous Government knew all of the facts of this matter and had every opportunity to decide what action should be taken. SenatorCollett evidently realizes that difficulties have to be overcome, and I suggest that he should not be in a hurry to ask this new Government to make a statement on the subject until it has had an opportunity to consider every phase of the matter. </para>

            <para>- I acted on instructions from the House of Representatives. My intention was to ask the Senate to suspend the sitting until the ringing of the bells. That would have served my purpose, but the procedure of the House of Representatives was suddenly altered, and that was the cause of the alteration in this chamber. I am offering no apology and I do not detract from anything said by me yesterday or to-day about honorable senators occupying valuable hours in discussing matters which, in the final analysis, are comparatively unimportant. I do not include those matters which have been mentioned on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate. I have noted every one of them, and I intend to see that they are passed on to the appropriate Ministers for comment, if not action. </para>
