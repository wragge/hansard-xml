Inquiries have been made, and I am now able to inform honorable senators that advice has been received that the launch <inline font-style="italic">Nerita,</inline> under the command of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. E.</inline> Carey, owner, which left Brisbane at 3 p.m. on Saturday on a fishing trip, and which was expected to return about 6 p.m.on Monday, is missing in the open sea off Cape Moreton. Reports indicate that twelve people are on board. The  Deputy  Director of Navigation in Brisbane, Captain I. J. Burch, has arranged for all ships in the vicinity to keep a close watch for the missing launch. He has advised the water police at Brisbane of the route which the aeroplane being used in the search should follow, having regard to the currents off Cape Moreton. Lighthouse keepers have also been instructed to keep watch. </para>

                        <para>.- In the history of this Parliament there has probably never been a measure which has been received with greater disfavour by the Labour movement of Australia than has the bill now under discussion. The bill has the full opposition of every trades hall council &#39; in Australia which is affiliated with the Australasian Council of Trades Unions, The Western Australian body, although not affiliated with the Australasian Council of Trades Unions, has also expressed its opposition to the measure. This legislation has the full and undivided opposition of the executive of the AustralianWorkers Union, which, as honorable senators know, represents approximately 100,000 workers throughout Australia. It also has incurred the hostility of numerous organizations not connected with the Labour movement. Generally, the opposition to it is well summarized in a communication which has been received by senators on this side of the chamber from the governing body of the industrial movement in Australia. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour party has no need to obtain instructions from any outside organization, because the Labour movement throughout Australia is one; when the Labour army marches,  it marches with one objective. The majority of the men on this side of the chamber served their political apprenticeship in the trade union movement. Therefore, we can say to Government supporters that no other measure has received such whole-hearted condemnation as has this compulsory national registration bill. </para>

                    <para>I point out, first, that the Government has received no mandate to introduce this legislation. The present Government is on the treasury bench as the result of the 1937 elections, during which the Labour candidates predicted that if a United Australia party government were returned, conscription would inevitably follow. The Prime Minister of the day <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> replying to that contention, said : &#34; The people can take my pledge that conscription will never be brought into force &#34;. Clearly, the Government has no mandate for this legislation. </para>
                    <para>Secondly, the Government is not truly representative of the people of Australia ; I say that in a political sense, with every respect to Ministers personally. The Government is hanging on by the skin of its teeth, as it were, and is led by a man who, according to disclosures in the press, was elected by 23 votes to 19 of the United Australia party. That party has broken its previous alliance with the Country party, and the Country party has generally indulged in shamfighting by professing to disavow this and that legislation; but the moment the party whips crack or there is evidence of a risk of a dissolution of the House of Representatives, its members fall into line behind the Government. Yesterday, we had the spectacle of the &#34; guillotine &#34; in operation in connexion with a cognate measure, and last week similar action was taken in the other branch of the legislature to prevent the Opposition from moving desirable amendments to the bill now before us. When we go to the people - and the time does not appear to be far off - we shall have a wonderful weapon in our hands. We shall be able to tell them of the muddling leadership of the present Administration. So weak was its case, the Government would not allow proper discussion. Labour supporters will use that fact to the fullest possible degree with, perhaps, a little interest added. We realize that some time during to-day similar action will be taken in connexion with this bill; when we reveal some weaknesses in the armour of the Government, the &#34; guillotine &#34; will again be applied. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour party has not objected to the expenditure of huge sums on defence. It believes that the Government must know that danger really exists, or it would not attempt to commit the country to such colossal expenditure. Since the receipt of the Squires report the previous estimate of &#163;63,000,000 has been increased to &#163;78,000,000. We are not concerned about the additional cost if it be necessary; but we are concerned at the ghastly failure of the recent London loan. Obviously, the present Government, which is supposed to have restored confidence in Australia, has not done so, for it could get only about 20 per cent. of a &#163;6,000,000 loan on the London market. What amazing evidence of Australia&#39;s credit ! </para>

                            <para>- WhenI asked what steps were being taken by. the Government, I was given an answer which did not say much more than &#34; See reply to No. 1 &#34;. I shall have something more to say on that point later. I repeat that the Labour party has supported the Government&#39;s defence programme. It said that when troops were wanted, the voluntary system would provide them. That system was tried, with the result that more men enlisted than were required. But, as my leader has pointed out on several occasions, the Government was not ready to equip them. I hope that by this time that state of affairs has been remedied. In the event of an outbreak of war. supporters of the Labour party  will be the backbone of Australia&#39;s defence, as they were in the dark years, 1914-1918, when the then Labour leader, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Andrew</inline> Fisher, said that Australia was in the war to &#34; the last man and the last shilling&#34;. The result of voluntary effort on that occasion resulted in 365,000 nien enlisting for active service. Members of the Labour party are just as conscious of the needs of Australia as are supporters of the Government, but we are not prepared to submit to dictation by a minority government which has not received from the people a mandate for a compulsory register. The Government could have met the situation by bringing forward the next general census. That action would have provided it with the information desired as to the avocation of citizens, the number of workers unemployed, and so on. </para>

In any case, the census will have to be taken within the next few years. I have established that this measure is opposed by the whole of the industrial movement of Australia, that it is a breach of the pledge given by the late Prime Minister, and that the Government was not given any mandate for a compulsory register. </para>

                    <para>A lot has been made of the fact that the Labour party expressed opposition to a national register of the man-power of Australia unless it was accompanied by a compulsory census of wealth. In the other chamber, an amendment moved by a leading member of the United Australia party, was accepted by the Ministry; and now the bill provides for a register of the property owned by every man and woman in Australia. Those provisions leave this party cold, for the good and simple reason that the Government knows that, whatever wealth census may be taken, it does not intend to take any action in regard to such wealth. It would not dare to do so. The only practical purposes of a wealth census is a compulsory levy on wealth.  Fancy  supporters of the present Government being&#39; associated with even the suggestion that the possessions of their supporters should become known ! I hope that when the  Minister replies he will make clear what use. the Government will make of the wealth register. In my opinion, it can only have one purpose - a levy on wealth in. the event of an attack on Australia. However, I could talk for hours as to what happened during the years 1914-18. It cannot be contradicted, however, that &#39;while other sections of the community responded to the call for men for service overseas, some rich men in the community unloaded onto the Repatriation Department land which was not worth one-twentieth of the price paid for it. Others put their money into war loans from which they are still getting a rake-off. On the other hand, many men who served overseas have not been given fair treatment by the Repatriation Department. I am glad that we now have a Minister in this chamber who is prepared to listen to individual claims. Members of the party which fought the Labour party between 1914 and 1918 were the biggest gainers by the last war. </para>
                    <para>The press of Australia demanded a compulsory wealth register, and this Government eventually decided to support; it. I have already alluded to the fact that I decline to be a &#34; Yes &#34; man to the other branch of the legislature. I shall resist this measure because I regard it as wrong in principle. The proposal was discussed at great length in the House of Representatives, and probably the Government will not permit of such a protracted debate in this chamber. To show the arrant hypocrisy of some of the supporters of the ministerial party, I remind the Senate that during the last few years &#163;45,000,000 has been raised by way of public loans in Australia, the interest on which is paid and disbursed in this country. Out of the total amount, no less than &#163;14,000,000 had to be underwritten  by the Commonwealth Bank, despite repeated ministerial denials that loans had been underwritten. A wealth census would be useless, because, whilst the Government is prepared to regiment the man-power of Australia, it would not touch its rich friends. The Labour party is not deluded by the fact that a smokescreen has been laid by the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> who submitted an amendment in the House of Representatives providing for a register of property. On Sunday evening last, a meeting of 3,000 unionists was held in the State Theatre, Melbourne. The fact that the gathering had been arranged only three days previously shows the hostility aroused by this measure. </para>

                    <para>My main objections to a. compulsory national register are: (1) It is the first step to bring about industrial conscription ; (2) it is a forerunner of compulsory military training; and (3) it makes no provision as regards wealth. </para>
                    <para>When the Cabinet met in Hobart in February last, the Government decided to create a voluntary national register for the purpose of ascertaining the industrial resources of the nation. Two of the reasons given for the voluntary register were that it would cost less and would not take so long to complete as a compulsory register. There is a section of the Cabinet which has always been in favour of conscription, and eventually its agitation prevailed, for, about a month later, the Cabinet reversed its Hobart decision, and decided to introduce a compulsory register. </para>

                    <para>It may be asked why we should have doubt regarding the- sincerity of the Government, but I remind the Senate that in 1931 the party opposite, with the same organization and policy, went to the electors and decried the Labour party of the day for having reduced, the invalid and old-age pension. It declared that, if it were returned to office, a complete restoration would be made. It not only did not restore the pension, .but it also introduced hideous amendments of the law which made the position of the pensioners worse than before. Is the Labour party likely to forget some of the acts of the Bruce-Page Government against the interests of the trade union movement and the workers of this country? My party remembers the actions of the former Acting Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, for his official blunders. There was the attempted deportation of Walsh and Johnson. In connexion with the Conciliation and Arbitration Act, he introduced repeal provisions that almost wrecked the system, and ultimately, knowing that he was going out of office, he supported their elimination: <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan was a member of the Cabinet at that time. Is it likely that the Labour movement will forget either <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan, who were 100 per cent, behind the transport regulations directed against the waterside workers? On seven occasions the Scullin Government tabled motions in the House of Representatives for the repeal of the regulations, but on each occasion, in the following week, the Senate, in which that Government was in a minority, vetoed the proposal of the Labour party, and the regulations remained in force. Ordinarily, when an industrial strike is over, honorable treatment is given to the losing side, but the party opposite said to the workers concerned : &#34; We shall see that you never work on the waterfront again &#34;. The result was that 8,000 men, including 930 &#34; diggers &#34;, lost their jobs&#39;. Still this Government will not consent to the withdrawal of the regulations. Consequently, when we say that we do not trust the Government we have ample grounds for our suspicion. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Anderson continued - </para>

                            <para>- Conscription is the last subject on which the honorable senator ought to talk. However, at the moment I must deal with the question before the Chair. No explanation has yet been given as to why Cabinet discarded its original decision in favour of a voluntary register. Can it be said that when an appeal to the spirit of patriotism of the Australian people has been made in any time of crisis, the response- has not been enthusiastic and successful? Does the Government doubt the patriotism of our people? Is it seriously suggested that the average Australian would not respond to a voluntary register? History has proved the loyalty and patriotism of the Australian people. This was shown in the Great War which is the only crisis Australia has yet been called upon to face. It is said that one volunteer is worth ten conscripts. I suggest that that axiom applies to-day as it applied in the Great War, when the Australian soldier proved himself to be the best worker and best fighter. Despite this glorious record&#39; this Government now wishes to place the stigma of conscription on the Australian people. The Australian worker will work and fight for his country, and all he asks in return is a decent job at decent wages, and a decent standard of living. Plenty of workers are willing and eager to help in the defence of this country. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> admitted that 29,000 unemployed men were registered for work at the munitions factories. Within the last month that number has increased to 34,000. The stupidity of legislation of this kind is accentuated when so many unemployed are screaming for work. What does the Government intend to do for those men? Industrial liberty is sacred to Australia. Although our workers have been treated in a niggardly and shameful manner in the past, their loyalty is far greater than that of those who are always flaunting their so-called patriotism in terms of money. No matter how the Government attempts to camouflage its real purpose this measure is designed definitely as the first step towards the introduction of. conscription. Such action is a disgrace to Australia and an insult to our people. The Government has no&#39; justification whatever for suggesting that the workers  are not prepared to shoulder their full share of responsibility. I admit that it is the Government&#39;s duty to finance adequately its defence programme. We have no fault whatever to find with it on that score. The Labour party agrees that our forces must be properly equipped, and that this should be carried out on the advice of military experts. We do not agree with the establishment of the new Department of Supply and Development, because we believe that it is unnecessary. Furthermore, we know that the majority of our skilled workers are to be found in the big industrial concerns, whereas the unskilled are to be found among the unemployed, for whom this legislation will achieve nothing of value. It is for this reason that the trade unions, which consist mainly of unskilled, workers, are so strongly opposed to this legislation. In that respect those unions are in step with the political wing of the Labour party, and I, personally, make no apologies for the opposition of the trade union movement to this legislation. Those unions have certain means of securing justice for their members, just, as the interests which back this Government possess means of securing what they desire. Those interests control the press and the radio and afford financial backing to the Government party. The director of the National Union in Victoria is paid a salary of &#163;3,000 a year, and the Government party experiences no difficulty in securing all of the advertising hoardings at 6s. each a week for use in election campaigns. A cheque to meet that expenditure is invariably forthcoming. On the other hand, the Labour party cannot afford to spend more than &#163;3,000 for the whole of Victoria on any general elections. Is there any justice in adopting compulsion in respect of manpower but not in respect of wealth? The wealthy people and the large financial concerns continuously advocate conscription in every form. Conscription of manpower but not of wealth is their cry. The wealthy expect the young men of Australia to prepare for war, and if war should come, to give their lives. They go even further and demand that all of these men should be conscripted, and offer them in return for their services a  meagre  monetary pittance. As the unskilled are to be found among the unemployed, no compulsory register is necessary in order to discover that fact. Honorable senators receive numerous inquiries from such men in search of work. Recently I interviewed three men who informed me that they had no qualifications for employment in the munitions factories. They told me they had been on the land. Unfortunately, in this and every other country, the unemployed man is usually unskilled. Furthermore, he is unable, in most cases, to undertake heavy labour. Consequently, industry has no use for him and society treats him as an outcast. No register is required by the Government to inform itself of the industrial qualifications of these men, because such information is available at the various employment bureaux throughout the States. This measure is the forerunner of compulsory military training and the conscription of the people generally. Consequently the Labour party will oppose it to the utmost of its power. Speaking at a recruiting rally in Sydney in January, the Minister for Health and Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Frederick Stewart)</inline> said - </para>

                    <para>Those are the words of a member of tin&#39;s Government who, as honorable senators know, poses as a great social reformer. Indeed, so emphatic were his utterances on national insurance and child endowment that we expected he would join the Labour party. Nevertheless, he remains to-day a member of the Government party which so far has failed to budge one inch in order to effect any social reform. Although he is a member of the Ministry, it remained for a private member, the honorable member for Perth <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Nairn),</inline> to move for the establishment of a wealth register. One proposal accepted by the Government in that respect, however, is innocuous. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Frederick</inline> Stewart must realize that the proposed wealth register is sheer political humbug, because not the slightest use will be made of it. In order to be able to call upon the wealth of the country we should have the fullest details on record. Australia has paid &#163;298,000,000 interest on loans raised in connexion with the Great War, whilst our interest and sinking fund payments&#39; amount to between &#163;9,000,000 and &#163;10,000,000 annually. In addition, Australia still owes &#163;179,000,000 on Avar loans raised within Australia. Is there any sound reason why we should not compile information concerning the wealth of Australia? Why will not the Government make such provision in this bill? In an article published in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily News,</inline> Sydney, of the 3rd May last, it was pointed out that 40 large companies held . reserves amounting to &#163;70,000,000.That money is not in use. Nevertheless, I suggest, it will not be covered by this so-called wealth register. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Anderson, in supporting theproposal for a voluntary register, said - </para>

                        <para class="block">We are always being urged by honorable senators opposite to tune in with Great Britain. Well, if it is right to do so in . respect of other matters, it must be right in respect of this measure. The trade unions of Australia, including some of the most conservative organizations, have communicated with all their members calling upon them to resist the compulsory register. Probably no measure ever introduced into this Parliament has aroused such widespread hostility as has this one. </para>
                        <para class="block">The Labour party favours a census of wealth, but it should be a comprehensive census. The Government claims to have provided for such a census, but that provision does not satisfy the Labour party. The census which it is proposed to take would be of no value at all, and the Government does not intend that it should. The taking of a census of wealth, as proposed by the Government, could be of use only as a preliminary to a levy on wealth, but this Government would never have the courage to take such action. I do not propose to speak in mere generalities by saying that the Government represents the rich interests of the country - that does not mean anything; but it is a fact that amajority of honorable senators opposite are associated with some kind of business, and are, therefore biased in favour of the business interests. </para>

The Country party, in the House of Representatives, supported the main principles of the measure, and was mainly responsible for the addition to the original bill of a provision for a census of wealth, as well as of manpower. </para>

                        <para>- I said that the Country party supported it, and without that support neither this measure nor the Supply and Development Bill could ever have come before this chamber. I am the last person who would desire to take from the honorable member for Perth the credit for having moved the actual amendment which was subsequently incorporated in the bill, but I repeat that the main principles of the measure were supported by members of the Country party, without whose support the bill could not have passed through the House of Representatives. I cannot see any valid reason for the vehement opposition to this measure by the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in this chamber, by his colleagues in the House of Representatives, and by the trade union movement throughout Australia.. I admit the seriousness of the opposition from the trade unions, but I think that it is due to a misconception. The unionists do not understand the full scope of the Government&#39;s proposals in their amended form, particularly those having to do with the taking of a census of wealth. Unionists have been misled by repeated and deliberate misstatements that the taking of a register of man-power will be merely a preliminary to conscription. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> himself road the statement of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> that, during the life of his Government, there would be no conscription, and particularly no conscription for service outside Australia. </para>

                            <para>- We did not get a complete record by voluntary enrolment, and so Parliament, with the support of the party opposite, insisted on compulsoryenrolment for electoral purposes. If it be necessary to have compulsory enrolment for electoral purposes, how much more necessary is it to have the compulsory registration of both manpower and wealth? Compulsion is necessary because it is the only way in which we can obtain from the citizens full and complete records of man-power and wealth. For years we had voluntary registration for electoral purposes, and ii was a failure. In this case compulsion is just as necessary as it is for electoral purposes. </para>

                            <para>- No. I think that the Labour party can be congratulated on the amount of voluntary work it gets done after having supported the measure providing compulsorily that the electors shall register and vote. Yet the party that was in the van in insisting that those duties should be done compulsorily says now that it will not have a compulsory registration of man-power or of wealth, such as is provided for under the measure. That attitude is ridiculous. The only effective steps to obtain a true record are those which the Government is taking. I supported the Lyons Government defence policy right through, and I support th is Government&#39;s policy in regard to defence. Defence matters are questions about which the Government&#39;s expert professional advisers have a good deal to say. I am satisfied that this legislation is in accordance with the advice given by them to the Government and by the Government passed on to Parliament. I regret that the repeated pleas of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> for Labour&#39;s co-operation in the federal sphere in defence matters have not been responded to by the party opposite. </para>

I dp not know what good a survey will be if the results of the inquiries are not entered in a register, any more than a survey of the electoral strength would be unless its results were entered in a roll which might be called a register.

On that subject the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> wrote to all the State governments of Australia, some of which have been formed by the United Australia party and the Country party, and three of which are Labour. It is to the credit of those State Labour governments that they replied assuring the Commonwealth Government and the Prime Minister of their complete co-operation in all matters relating to the defence of Australia. </para>

                            <para>-I am willing to give the Leader of the Opposition assistance to have that position rectified. I remind the Minister that this Government cannot expect continued support from the distant administrations - which happen to be Labour - unless a fair proportion of the defence expenditure is decentralized. We want decentralization, and not expenditure in any one particular State. There should be a much greater expenditure on defence in Western Australia. Decentralization may involve a big outlay on the establishment of complete defence units for the production of munitions and aircraft in the outlying parts of the Commonwealth. </para>

                            <para>- That is not a generous statement. I supported the principle of free speech in this chamber, without regard to the effect of my vote. The State governments liberally offered their full co-operation with the Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. I regret that I can see no sign of that excellent example being followed by the members of the Commonwealth Labour party in either this chamber or in the House of Representatives. The State Labour governments and parties have set an admirable example to the Federal Labour party, and I trust that even at this late stage the honorable senators opposite will see fit to agree to the pleas addressed to them. </para>

                    <para>That statement is quite correct. We members of the Labour party believe that the introduction of this measure is a move to bring about, not only industrial conscription, but also military conscription. This is the thin end of the wedge, and the final punch will be given when troops are needed for service overseas. </para>

So I attended the Interstate Labour Conference as the representative of the people who had elected me to express their wishes. </para>

                            <para>- This speech will be consistent with the attitude that I adopted before &#39;the State Labour Conference took place in Canberra. If the honorable senator follows me on this occasion and also my speeches in Tasmania, he will find that what I am saying is correct. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> stated that no state of emergency exists. If that be so why is there any necessity for the introduction of this bill? If there is a state of emergency looming up why does the Government not give us details? If there are any potential enemies likely to invade Australia why does . the Government not tell us who they are? I have said, and I repeat, that we can forget, for the next ten years, any idea of a foreign power landing an army to invade Australia. I do not say that we should not be prepared to meet any attacks that might be made by warships. </para>

                            <para>- I said that so far as a foreign power landing to take Australia is concerned, we can forget our fears of such an invasion. Should Great Britain be involved in war we shall be liable to attack from bombs hurled from the air or from shells fired from big war vessels. That would not be an invasion of Australia by an army. </para>

                            <para>- In view of the extraordinary success of the militia voluntary recruiting system, the only purpose of this bill is to camouflage the spending of money in assisting private manufacturers of this country, and to provide employment for those officers of the Commonwealth Public Service who were to have been engaged on the abandoned national insurance scheme. Positions must be found for these people somewhere. Tip to the present, the national insurance scheme has cost the country 6162,026. In respect of a census of manpower only, the national register is estimated to cost &#163;40,000. Now that a census of wealth has been added, the cost will be considerably more, so it may be assumed that, together, the national insurance scheme and the national registration scheme will cost the country something in excess of &#163;200,000. And for what? The national register will be just as big a hoax as the national insurance scheme. For what purpose is the national register designed ? The Commonwealth electoral rolls already provide a list of all people over the age of 21 years so that this measure will supply additional information only in respect of boys between the ages of IS and 21 years - the youth of Australia. As has been stated in the House of Representatives, this legislation is designed to provide the Government with an accurate record of all boys between those ages, so that should an emergency arise, the Government would know exactly where to put its hands on them. When the Government is ready to bring in conscription, those boys will be compelled to fight in defence of this country, or of some &#39;European country; yet they are not given a vote for the election of representatives, to this Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- I am dealing with the registration of youths between the ages of 18 and 21 years. It has been conclusively demonstrated that all the man-power necessary for the defence of this country could be obtained by voluntary means. Obviously, the Government does not want volunteers, because to-day thousands are offering their services to the country and are being rejected. Why is a. compulsory national register essential ? The Government claims &#39; that it wants to know what work men would be able to perform should the necessity to defend the country arise. But if the Government will call for applications for a job in the Commonwealth munition factories, it will get a response from almost every skilled tradesman in Australia. Workers are only too anxious to obtain jobs in any branch of the Commonwealth Government Service, because they know that conditions are good and that the positions are more permanent, than they are outside the Service. If, instead of resorting to compulsion, the Government were compiling a voluntary national register of man-power, and. tradesmen were being asked to state what work they were capable of doing, I am confident that there would be a registration of 95 per cent, of Australian workers. With regard to the voluntary system of recruiting for the militia, I state definitely that there are many places throughout Australia from which applications have been made for the establishment of a militia unit, but the Government has refused to grant them. Yet the Government turns round and claims that there is necessity for a compulsory national register so that men capable of doing essential defence work may be found in time of emergency. All that this bill sets out to do with regard to the registration of man-power could be accomplished without compulsion. </para>

                            <para>- I am not aware of that. Let us examine just what this legislation implies with regard to conscription. The Government wants to know exactly what people are studying in the universities for the various professions. It is well known that the majority of university students are from the wealthy sections of the community, because the working people of Australia are not in &#39;a position to give their boys a university education. </para>

                            <para>- The object of the bill is to obtain a true detailed record of youths between the ages of 18 years and 21 years. These people are obliged, under the threat of severe penalties, to notify any change of their address. Changes of address among the adult population can, of course, be obtained from the electoral roll, but whereas failure to notify change of address under the doctoral laws of the Commonwealth might result in a maximum fine of only &#163;2, this bill provides that these youths may be fined &#163;50 for a similar offence. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators on the Government side complain that we are thin-skinned, but, obviously, it does not take many facts to get under their skin. I do not think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was quite fair when he said that, at the  last general elections, the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> pledged himself to the introduction of a compulsory national register. Although the political creed of the right honorable gentleman was different from my own, 1 give him credit for having given an assurance to the whole of Australia at the last general elections that he would not stand for compulsory &#34;military training. Yet this national register is the forerunner of compulsory military training. By bringing the late Prime Minister down to his own level on this issue, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> was not doing justice to the reputation of the dead. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> also said that it would be a simple matter to take a census of man-power and of wealth, but he omitted to tell the Senate what was implied by a census of wealth. In my opinion, the questionnaire in regard to wealth omits several items of importance. There is no mention, for instance, of assurance policies, which certainly are wealth. </para>

                            <para>- Some honorable senators opposite contend that under this measure assurance policies should not be regarded as property. The value of all life policies is excluded from the questionnaire, but in order to prove that  such  policies should be regarded as property I direct the attention of honorable senators to the following paragraph in a letter written by the  Deputy  Commissioner of Invalid and Old-age Pensions and Maternity Allowances, Hobart - </para>

                    <para class="block">The letter also gives the surrender value, of a policy in -the claim under consideration as &#163;118. That amount is to be treated by the Deputy Commissioner . in the same way as if the claimant had &#163;11S in the bank. It is difficult to understand why the Government has excluded the surrender value of assurance policies from, the questionnaire, as there are thousands of men who invest in assurance policies with the object of collecting the surrender value. During their currency they always have a surrender value which is equivalent to cash in the bank. There does not appear to be any valid reason why this omission, which will benefit only the wealthy section of the community, should be permitted. </para>

                            <para>- That is exactly why insurance policies have been omitted. I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> what the farmers and other primary producers will think when they are confronted with the problems involved in completing the questionnaire. They have considerable difficulty in completing their income tax returns to the satisfaction of the Taxation Department, but they will now have to complete this questionnaire or be subject to a heavy penalty or even imprisonment. . This is a further responsibility which will embarrass them unduly. The whole registration system provided for in this bill is a huge blunder, similar to the national health and pensions insurance scheme, which the Government is now compelled to shelve. At the next general election, honorable senators opposite will have a good deal to explain to the electors; that applies particularly to the members of the Country party, of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> is a member. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> stated in the House of Representatives that in the event of an invasion of Australia all industrial awards would be scrapped and Australia would be under martial law. If the Government be given too much power, it will be exercised to the detriment of the people. If a registration card should be lost in transit, as sometimes happens with ordinary mail matter, the onus of proving that it has been despatched to the Commonwealth Statistician will rest upon the individual. </para>

                            <para>- If this measure is administered by the present Government the maximum penalty may be imposed. If an employee is compelled to supply the name of his employer why should not employers be compelled to give the names of all their employees ? All the embarrassment is being placed upon the employees and very little upon the employers. According to the second-reading speech of the Minister, 95 per cent, of the responsibility involved is placed upon the industrial section, and only 5 per cent, upon employers or those possessing wealth. </para>

                            <para>- Of course it is, according to the Government, which believes that only the workers should shoulder any responsibility. The measure also provides for an objectionable form of compulsion which will doubtless be followed by the conscription of our manpower for defence purposes. Many honorable senators opposite who support a policy of compulsory military training have referred to the defence policy adopted by the Tasmanian Labour party. For their information, I direct attention to paragraph c of rule 5 adopted at the Hobart conference, which reads - </para>

                    <para class="block">Such a policy would not have the support of &#39;honorable senators opposite, because they do not believe in the mobilization of wealth and industry before the compulsory registration of employees. Provision for a census of wealth was not incorporated in this measure until it was brought forward by a private member, and was supported by the Labour party in the House of Representatives. The objects of this bill are to create war hysteria in the minds of the people, to cover up such blunders of the present Government as the national health and insurance scheme and its assistance to private manufacturing industries in the armaments race. Otherwise, it is the thin edge of the wedge of conscription. Tn the event of war overseas, the Government would know exactly where to obtain conscripts for overseas service. </para>

When he was speaking I was reminded of the ne&#39;er-do-well who, when unable to obtain employment, served as a missionary in the mandated territory of New Guinea. Living far removed from other white persons, he preached only to the natives, and in the end he converted himself. The honorable senator has for so long been touring the country and endeavouring to make the people believe that conscription is a part of the policy of this Government that in the end he believes that it actually is. The honorable senator poses as an opponent of conscription, and if his speech was as sincere as it seemed, it would have something to commend it. This measure was foreshadowed some time ago by the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons).</inline></para>

                        McLACHLAN.No; in September of last year. It was also mentioned by the present Minister for Defence
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline>
                        in introducing a. bill in December last. On that occasion the Minister mentioned that, in order to implement the Government&#39;s defence policy, the Government- would endeavour to bring about Commonwealth and State co-operation, industrial mobilization&#39;, the regulation and control of primary industries, and the organization of man-power and women&#39;s voluntary effort. Commonwealth and State cooperation was discussed at a conference of Common wen 1th and State Ministers in March last, when State Ministers representing different political parties said that they were prepared to give their wholehearted support to the Commonwealth in the interests of the defence of Australia. In the organization of primary industries, the Department of Commerce is doing excellent work. Industrial mobilization of secondary industries was embodied largely in a measure which was recently before the Senate. I was pleased to hear the second-reading speeches of honorable senators opposite on that measure, but I was very much surprised at the attitude they adopted when it was in committee. The fourth point mentioned by the Minister for Defence was in relation to the organization of manpower and women&#39;s voluntary effort. The women in all States have responded admirably to the appeal. The objective of the bill now before the Senate is to  prepare a register of the man-power of this country. When we have achieved the four objectives outlined by the Minister for Defence, I do not, think for a moment that we shall have finished the job, but at least we shall have established the groundwork upon which to build the defences of this country. This bill simply aims at a stocktaking of our resources not only in industry but also in man-power.

                            <para>- That is so. On contemplating any new venture a private individual would first summarize the whole position in order to ascertain what capital would be required to finance it and what labour would be needed to operate it. He would explore every avenue so that the risk of failure would be reduced to a minimum. If that caution is necessary in our private affairs, how much more is it necessary in respect of a matter which concerns the welfare of the- nation? The present method of approaching this all-important subject of defence is quite new so far as this nation is concerned. Australia&#39;s contribution to the Allied forces during the World War of 1914-18 was magnificent. Our troops distinguished themselves on the field of battle and earned the respect, not only of our allies, but also of our adversaries. When they were sent overseas, they became part of the great army of the British Empire whose efforts were directed by the British War Office. On the battlefields they were led practically all the time by veteran soldiers who had previously been under fire. To-day, we are not preparing to send a contingent overseas to assist the Mother Country, but we are staging a. full-dress rehearsal for the defence of this country on land, on the sea, and in the skies. This is an altogether new departure in defence preparations, and to render our efforts worth while, the first thing necessary is to have a stocktaking such as is contemplated in this bill. Some time ago we had a visit from the Australian High Commissioner in London, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> who issued an invitation to all members of the Commonwealth Parliament to meet him in the capital cities and hear his views on the international situation. I only regret that that wonderful gesture on the part of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> was not fully availed of by members of the Parliament. </para>

He emphasized that, in the event of war on a large scale in Europe, Australia would have to rely on its own defence preparations for three or perhaps, six months. Therefore, it behoves us to make adequate arrangements for our defence.

                            <para>- They are not compelled to do so to-day, but when this bill is assented to next week, the giving of this information will be made compulsory. I take it that the purpose of the register is to enable skilled men to be placed in positions which they are best fitted to occupy at a time of national emergency. Is it intended that should one of the defence annexes require 10, 50 or 100 men, application must be made fortheir services to the National Registration Board? What useful service could the board serve in that regard ? It is obvious that the men required would have to be selected by those who understand the work which they will be called upon to perform. Only the foremen and those in control of the factories could say whether or not a man was competent to do the work required of him. Therefore, I fail to see what important work the members of the National Registration Board will perform. </para>

                            <para>- I shall deal with that. During the discussion of a bill recently passed by this Senate, a great deal was said about, methods of costing to be applied for the regulation of profits. In my opinion the establishment of a costing department is very necessary. Everything inrelation to the defence of this country, even to the foes paid by those occupying high posi tions in various organizations set up by the Defence Department, should come within the ambit of the inquiry as to costs. I shall reduce my argument to a minimum by saying that I would rather employ ten men at &#163;4 a week than one man at &#163;2,000 a year. Some considerable time ago the -Prime Minister issued an invitation to the Australasian Council of Trade Unions to nominate representatives on an advisory panel on matters of this description. I think that a panel composed of members of that body would be of immense value in the administration of the provisions of this bill. </para>

                            <para>- A good deal is said about the part played by capitalists in the last war. Not for a moment would I try to refute the statement that there was profiteering; I admit, that there was profiteering, but it was not all on one side. Probably some of those capitalists about whom we hear so much from the Opposition side of the chamber did fairly well out of the war, but in England there were men working in the munitions factories at &#163;10 or &#163;12 a week, who struck for higher wages for manufacturing munitions for the1s. a day men in the trenches. Was that not profiteering? </para>

                        McLACHLAN.This is not a bedtime story; it is an absolute fact. I do not judge the whole of those people who worked in munitions factories by the few who went on strike, and I ask honorable senators opposite not to judge capitalists generally by the misdeeds of the few. Not all capitalists were profiteers. Some men in each section may have done certain wrongs, but we should not assess the patriotism of both sections by the exploiting tactics of a minority in each.

                            <para>- I am talking about income tax. It is in that field that we find our capitalists. During the war we raised &#163;213,490,810 in war loans, and, although even to-day we have only 220,240 payers of income tax, 742,747 people subscribed to those loans. The interest therefore does not all go to big capitalists. The population of Australia in 1918 was approximately 5.000,000, of whom about 750,000 persons subscribed to the war loans. In the 5,000,000 there would be about 2,000,000 adults. Therefore, practically one in every three of the adult population of Australia profited from investments in war loans. Not all of them are capitalists. </para>

                    <para>I was somewhat doubtful regarding the passage of this bill, but I was heartened very considerably in hearing honorable senators opposite reiterate the statement that they are in favour of adequate defence for Australia. At some time or the other all honorable senators, I think, have expressed themselves as being in favour of an adequate policy of defence for Australia. I thought that I had a fair knowledge of the meaning of the word &#34; adequate &#34;, but in order to make sure I referred to the dictionary, which gives the meanings of the word as (1)  &#34; to make equal to &#34; ; (2) &#34; commensurate with a requirement or occasion&#34;; (3) &#34;fully sufficient for a purpose&#34;; (4) &#34; proportionate to a specific end &#34;. Honorable senators &#34;must agree that if words mean anything, &#34; adequate &#34; is most comprehensive and, applied to defence, the definition &#34; to make equal to &#34; means to make our defence equal to the force of a possible aggressor. In regard to the second meaning, &#34; commensurate with a requirement or occasion &#34;, the requirement and the occasion are now here. All nations of the world are in a tense state of anxiety as to what may happen. The third meaning is &#34; fully sufficient for a purpose &#34;. That purpose is to protect our citizens and maintain this country for the people who have developed it. The fourth meaning is &#34; proportionate to a specific end &#34;. To be proportionate in this instance is to neglect no detail, however insignificant it may be or appear to be, not only in raising an army, creating munitions and war machines, but also, as nearly as possible, in making perfect the organization of our strength. This bill is a means to that end, and, if honorable senators are in favour of adequate defence for Australia, they will support the measure. </para>

                        <para>. - This bill, like the Supply and Development Bill, has its origin, in my judgment; not in what the Government would have us believe, namely, the need fora national register for defence purposes, but in, the economy peculiar not only to Australia, but also to other countries - unlimited profits for capitalists and wartime financiers. Let us look at the economic background to see if that deduction is justified. Since 1932, practically every attempt to float a loan by Commonwealth Governments has resulted in undersubscription. We have also an annual interest bill of &#163;45,500,000. I can quite conceive of those behind the scenes who are responsible for the bill reviewing the position. I can imagine them saying &#34; We cannot float loans; they are undersubscribed. We have an increasing interest bill and we have also a stationary or diminishing population&#34;. I propose to cite some figures from a statement by the Minister for Agriculture in Victoria, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hogan,</inline> which was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of the 12th June. He said that whereas in 1930, the attendance of children at Victorian state primary schools was 228,756, the number in 1937 dropped to 209,000, and last year there was a further decline of 9,060, so that to-day there are fewer than 200,000 children attending at Victorian primary schools. Thus the economic background of the bill is an increasing annual interest bill, loans failing, and a diminishing population. I can quite imagine the persons behind the scenes asking themselves, &#34;What are we going to do in these circumstances The only answer that I can conceive of them giving is, &#34; Something must be done to maintain the margin and volume of profits. How can it be done ? It must be done by reducing the status of the workers. How can that be done? As it has always been done in the past, by more coercive legislation &#34;. </para>

                            <para>- I am giving to the Senate some of the facts, and I should like the honorable senator to take cognisance of them. Profits from loans are regulated, but profits from industry are practically limited only by the extent to which workers can be coerced. As I have pointed out previously, the interest paid on war loans up to date is &#163;297,000,000. Only &#163;147,000,000 has been expended in the provision of war pensions. Money-lenders and financiers and other capitalists have received about &#163;150,000,000 more than the invalided soldiers and their dependants. So when I say that this bill has its origin in the economy based on the principle of unlimited profits for capitalists and wartime financiers I am not exaggerating. </para>

In my judgment the bill is a means to an end, and that end is a more despotic form of industrial and military conscription.

                    <para class="block">I assure the Minister that I am saying seriously that to-day we have industrial conscription. I challenge the honorable gentleman to dispute that. Thousands of young men and young women in this country are denied the right to earn a decent livelihood and access to many of the things of life to which they are entitled. They are industrial conscripts. They have either to submit to that form of conscription, or be treated as the law prescribes they shall be treated. If they proceed to help themselves, without the authority of those who own the things which they need, they can be placed in gaol. That is industrial con&#60;scription with a vengeance. It operates with respect to the thousands of persons in our midst who are compelled to seek sustenance in order to exist. It is no exaggeration to say that industrial conscription does exist. The only difference between industrial conscription and military conscription is that, under industrial conscription as it obtains to-day, the workers have the right to bargain for better treatment and to refuse to render service, whereas, under military conscription, they are deprived of the right either to refuse to work or to bargain for better treatment. Military conscription lays it down that a man who does not conform to the law can be dealt with in various ways prescribed by law; he may be gaoled, or, in extreme cases, placed against a wall and shot. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly ! We view the bill not just as it appears, but in the light of existing circumstances and the motives of those who introduced it. Honorable senators will recollect that before this bill was spoken of seriously, towards the end of last year, there was a lot of talk about conscription and compulsory military training. Numbers of members of the House of Representatives advocated at every opportunity compulsory military training. Suddenly, however, they ceased to speak in that strain; there was a dead silence on the subject. Now they urge the need for a department of supply and development and a bill to establish it, and an other bill to establish a national register. They have realized that they are more likely to achieve their desire by adopting means not so likely to arouse the antagonism of their potential victims. </para>

                            <para>- I come now to the statement of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> that the Government would not. introduce conscription for overseas service. I give to the Prime Minister no credit for that statement, for he was only making a virtue of necessity. He probably had had a private talk with the High Commissioner, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> and learned from that gentleman that, in the event of another war, the Empire generally would not expect Australia to send troops overseas. Now the Prime Minister claims credit for a policy of no conscription for overseas service. But when challenged to say whether or not he favoured conscription for service in Australia, he said, in effect, that he would meet that hurdle when he came to it. He is not prepared to give an assurance in that connexion. </para>

I shall show that many who pledge their word in politics cannot be believed; their word cannot be relied on. So far as I know, the present Prime Minister has kept his word up to date, and I trust that he will continue to do so; but the fact that he refused to give that assurance convinces me that he is not prepared to take the same risk as is another honorable gentleman whom I shall name presently. </para>

                    <para>Under this bill it will be possible to establish in Australia - and probably the attempt will be made - labour camps similar to those in Germany, because the economic conditions under which we are operating are practically the same as in Germany. If there be any difference, it  is a difference of degree rather than of kind. In Germany, the. wages of the workers are based on the cost of subsistence. The same is true of Australia. The less the workers in Germany can be induced to accept, the less they receive. That is the position in Australia also, the only difference being that the Australian worker has not yet been driven down to the same low level of subsistence as obtains in Germany. But the attempt will be made. It will be made when the pressure of unemployment becomes greater, and when the resentment of the workers against the conditions forced upon them increases. If the workers of Australia can be misled to the same extent as has happened in Germany, Italy and some other European countries, including England, they will get the same treatment as is meted out to their fellow-workers in those countries. </para>

                    <para>In this bill, as in a previous measure which I am not permitted to discuss, we find various clauses empowering the Governor-General to do almost anything that the Government may desire him to do. He is to be given practically a free hand. That means that the Government will have a free hand. I should not be astonished to find another bill introduced to provide that men may be shot without trial. The actions of the Government are leading to a dictatorship similar to that of which the Prime Minister spoke so highly after his return from Germany. </para>
                    <para>I cannot help comparing the war financiers of to-day and their objectives with the slave-owners of old. I say emphatically that the war financiers of today, and their political henchmen, constitute a greater menace to society than the slave-owners of old ever did. It is always interesting to review matters in the light of experience. In 1915 a measure similar to that before us was being advocated in England. I have here a copy of the <inline font-style="italic">English Economist</inline> of the 5th June, 1915. That publication is controlled in the interests, not of Labour, but of those holding anti-Labour views. In the issue mentioned, the following appeared :  - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>At such moments as this in the national life, things vital are too readily sacrificed to speculative chances of doing a little more harm than you would otherwise do to your enemy. And the danger is all the greater because of the well-known methods which have been adopted with such success in the recent past, of &#34; tuning &#34; the press in advance. Newspaper proprietors and editors are a very small class, and with the help of the great newspaper trusts, the appearance, though not the reality, of public opinion can be manufactured by a crafty demagogue. </para>
                        <para>Thus the catchword of. national service or national organization is being used to cover  ii multitude of sins, or, rather, of harmful proposals. It appeals especially to wellmeaning people who have been accustomed to do nothing and want to do something; still more to those who want to force others into spadework, and to &#34; teach a lesson to the working classes &#34;. But if it be examined, it will be found to mean, like most other war emergency headlines, just nothing at all. The &#34; national &#34; register of industry recommended by Lord Milner and the bishops is merely a dodge for introducing compulsion in the Army and a w,11 t-martial regime in workshops as a sub.situte for voluntary work at properly paid rates. In some factories, where the managers arc incompetent and are unable to get the best work out of their hands (and especially out of the new hands who have been called in to fill the places of men gone to the front), there is the masters&#39; demand for compulsion. But employers who know the character of English workpeople and of the trade unions know that the dangers of compulsion are very much greater than the difficulties which compulsion and bureaucratic interference are supposed to &#39;be going to cure. </para>
                        <para>A compulsory national register is suggested by those who want to draft all the young men of the country from productive industries into the Army or into the manufacure of munitions. That will involve a new army of public officials, in comparison with which the army of land valuers and the army of incometax collectors will look very small. It will also mean <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> rapid deterioration of public finance. </para>
                        <para>If the natural organization of trade, upon which the astounding commercial wealth and manufacturing&#39; and shipping supremacy of Great Britain has been built up, is a mistake, and if the individual freedom of Great Britain, which distinguishes us from all the nations of the Continent, is also a mistake in peace and in war, then wc can very well understand the proposal for a government inquisition in the form of a compulsory national register. By this means such voluntary organizations as the trade unions might be dealt n deadly blow and instead of strikes and lock-outs, when masters and men fall out we shall have class movements and revolutionary movements by armed organizations. </para>
                        <para>It is noticeable that the present cry for a national organization proceeds mainly from ecclesiastics and academic persons who contribute to the Harmsworth Trust, and also from journalists and newspaper proprietors in close touch with the Government. The late Government was discredited by various misfortunes and mistakes, and the new Government is casting about for some strong measure, or rather, some measure which will look strong - and appeal to feeble-minded people who are feeling flurried and cannot stand the east winds, of adversity. </para>

On the 4th May last, speaking in the House of Commons, he attempted to justify the introduction of conscription.

                        <para>Therefore, during the initial period of six months during which they will be undergoing their training, they will receive ls. per day, without any addition for rank or trade. That ls. will not be subject to tiny stoppages. (Laughter.) Well, everybody knows that there are stoppages from the pay of those who are serving in the regular and auxiliary forces, so I thought it necessary to say that there would be no stoppages. ... In the case of allowances to dependants, which, if they were granted, would be at the rate of 17s.  a  week for total dependancy, and 12s.  a  week for partial dependancy, it is clear that these should only be paid where the need for them was established. </para>

                    <para class="block">In Great Britain there was first a demand, and then legislation, for a voluntary register. Then, an undertaking was given that conscription would not be introduced, but finally it was imposed. In Australia, we notice a similar sequence of events. First. a demand was made for compulsory military training, which is conscription. Then a proposal was put forward for voluntary national registration, and nowwe have a bill to impose compulsory national registration. Ultimately, no doubt, an attempt will be made to introduce conscription, solely because the Government cannot continue to meet its enormous interest bills and allow wartime profits to be made, unless the workers be reduced to the lowest level of subsistence. That seems to be the process through which we are passing. If the Government be sincere, what is there to prevent it from training prospective soldiers under conditions similar to those under which men are trained for the police force, in which they receive the highest rates of pay and the best working conditions obtainable? Why not train 9,000 or 10,000 under such conditions for a given period, and subsequently train similar batches? If this were profitable to the Government, no doubt it would be done; but, of course, it would not be profitable, and, therefore, will not be done. The object of the Government is to adopt the cheapest possible method of training, so that interest and profits may be collected as visual. </para>

                <para>Distinct contrast with the views of other military experts on the question of conscription is provided by the military correspondent of <inline font-style="italic">The Times,</inline> Captain Liddell Hart, in a letter to that newspaper. </para>
                <para>Captain Hart suggests objections first on practical grounds. Ultimate efficiency, he contends, is impaired, not assisted by enlisting men before adequate equipment with which to train them has been provided. The keenness of many Territorial recruits is suffering from lack of equipment. A still more difficult problem, he claims, is the provision of efficient instructors. &#34; On the grounds of the spiritual risks,&#34; he continues, &#34; we are threatened by nations where compulsion is an end in itself - a principle of life. Compulsion under the pressure of their challenge would be a definite surrender of our own vital principles -an admission of spiritual defeat. </para>
                <para>Compulsion is fundamentally incompatible with the claim for defending the principle of individual freedom. </para>
                <para>It is easier to adopt than to shake it off. There would be no such prospect of immediate release, as at the end of the Great War. </para>

                        <para>- The Government excels in that direction when it is dealing with children. It is a cowardly attitude for men to take towards youths between the ages of 18 and 21 years who may not be acquainted with the law providing that persons who neglect to notify the department of a change of address may be fined any amount up to &#163;50 or imprisoned for three months. A questionnaire is to be sent out under this legislation. In 1915 also, when the war census was taken, a questionnaire was introduced. As the papers were returned to the authorities we found that copies of the information supplied were handed to various politicians, and it was used on public platforms in order to bully men to enlist. Possibly that form of coercion is intended on this occasion. </para>

It is his right to refuse employment or to serve under unjust conditions. The bill aims at depriving him of these rights and making him subject to the will of military officers, or the police, or any body else who may coerce him to the extent that the law permits. In the circumstances the Labour movement&#39;s opposition to the bill is justified. Thousands of men who support the Labour party lived before the outbreak of the Great War, and they are alive to-day. They know what happened in the past, and they are telling the younger generation what it must expect. As word goes round, the intentions of the Government are seen in a clearer light and the opposition increases. Ultimately, it will become still stronger and will defeat this bill even though the Government may succeed in having it passed in this Parliament. </para>

Surely it is obvious to honorable senators that the measure was submitted because of the promise given at the last election that if the Government were returned it would do everything it could to put this country in a state of defence, so that it would be able to withstand aggression. The bill before us is one of several measures which have been designed to carry out that undertaking . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> takes a very pessimistic view of what will happen should this legislation be agreed to. I have carefully studied the measure, and I consider that it will do a great deal of good in providing work for more people and in turning that work to the best possible advantage, for the safety of the Australian people. He contended that the bill would tend to reduce the standard of living of the working people of Australia. That is his view, but the more people we can provide with work the greater will be the uplift of the general conditions in this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> also made a great deal of his fear of military conscription. I fail to see any provision in the bill dealing with that subject, or anything from which one may deduce that the Government intends to introduce conscription subsequent to the passing of the bill. The measure is a sequence to the Supply and Development Bill that we passed yesterday. Following on the organization of industrial activities in Australia, this measure aims at organizing the man-power of the country. In that respect we have learned from the experiences handed down to us&#34; from the Great War. Instead of waiting for hostilities to break out and then beginning to act, the Government is preparing in peace time for the training of the people for any eventualities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline></para>

                            <para>- That is probably the honorable senator&#39;s view, but the measure passed yesterday was considered in a cool, calm and collected manner, just as this bill is being considered. Any hysteria that may have been caused is due to hostility to the measure by honorable senators opposite, and the insinuations which they have made concerning the alleged intentions of the Ministry. Actually the Government is merely doing what any other sensible administration, in the circumstances,  would seek to do, namely, make adequate preparations for defence by arranging for a comprehensive survey of the nation&#39;s resources in man-power and wealth. I fail to see any items in the proposed return to which exception may be taken. The person requiring to fill in the form is asked to state - </para>

                <para>In that form there is nothing of which any person need be afraid nor to which he need take exception. Nor is there any ground for the suggestion that the information furnished will be used for ulterior purposes. All that the Governments seeks is reliable data in order that there may be no wastage of man-power by the employment of persons in occupations for which they are not suited or trained. During the Great War numbers of men had to be returned from the front line for employment in some craft or occupation in which their special peace-time qualifications were needed for military purposes. When this bill and the measure which was passed yesterday have received the Royal Assent, the Government will obtain the necessary information. The authorities will then be better able to fit men into positions for which they are best suited. </para>

                        <para>- I would not say that it would be possible to do that. The State governments have some responsibility in respect of unemployment. The compilation of this national register will enable the Government, in time of emergency to make the best use of its manpower and resources. Without a national survey it would be impossible to do this. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline> this morning, declared that in a crisis the people would voluntarily respond as loyally and enthusiastically as they did in the last war. I agree with the honorable gentleman. But, I think, he will admit that Australian soldiers would not have been able to give such a good account of themselves in the last war if they had not undergone five months&#39; concentrated training in Egypt before landing at Gallipoli. </para>

The point I am endeavouring to make is that without the information which this national register will place in its hands, a government will have no knowledge whatever of the qualifications of Australia&#39;s man-power which, in a national crisis, must be put to its best use in the shortest possible time. The intention is to organize the resources of the Commonwealth more efficiently than was possible twenty years ago. The inclusion of a wealth census will make the national survey complete. Opposition senators have pointed out that this proposal was inserted in the bill at the instance of a private member of the House of Representatives. </para>

                            <para>- The fact that it was not in the bill originally, but was inserted as the result of the discussion of the bill in committee of the House of Representatives, is indisputable evidence of the freedom enjoyed by members of the parties supporting the Government. They do not blindly follow the Government. They do not take the attitude that because a proposal has been brought in by the Government it must not be criticized or altered in any way. </para>

                    <para>The wealth census for which the bill now provides will, I believe, be of material assistance in assessing the financial and economic resources of the nation for use in a national crisis, although it is true that, in time of war, much of the information which will be obtained could be secured through the medium of the Taxation Department under the provisions of the Defence Act. Honorable senators opposite take the stand that because a proposal is submitted by this government with the support of members of the United Australia party and the Country party members, it must necessarily be suspect. Consequently they set out to destroy it instead of assisting the Government to improve it, and in the case of the bill now before the Senate, ensure the defence of Australia. </para>

                        this morning, mentioned that trade unionists throughout Australia are opposed to this bill. I do not doubt that there is some opposition to it, because I, and no doubt other honorable senators, have received many letters of protest from trade union organizations, some of which threaten drastic action in the event of the bill receiving the Royal assent. In this connexion I remind
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline>
                        that when he was a member of the House of Representatives in 1930 the Labour Government which he supported introduced a measure to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act. On that occasion also members of the Senate, as well as of the House of Representatives, received many letters and objections to the proposal. In fact, this building was so crowded with trade union officials that it was hardly safe for honorable senators who opposed the bill to proceed from one room to another.&#39; These union officials button-holed members so persistently that some honorable senators had to come in through the back entrance in order to avoid meeting them. At that time the Opposition of which I was a member used its majority in the Senate to reject certain objectionable clauses of the bill and send it back to the House of Representatives. It was subsequently returned to the Senate .and again those same clauses were disputed. Finally, it was referred to a conference of managers and a compromise was arrived at, the main objectionable clauses remaining in. If the Labour Government had believed that the people were solidly behind the bill, it would have brought about a double dissolution and appealed to the electorate for an expression of opinion in regard to it ; but it was content to back down.

                        <para>. - J. was hopeful that, during this debate, I should receive some enlightenment from honorable senators opposite as to the real purpose behind this measure. We should have been told what caused the Government to alter its policy from a voluntary to a compulsory national register. It seems extraordinary that a Cabinet decision to compile a voluntary register, arrived at in Hobart as recently as last February, should be reversed. Apparently a few members of the Cabinet who favour compulsory military training or out-and-out conscription have been able to shout loud enough to overcome the objections of the majority. This bill has obviously been introduced only to quieten those members of the Cabinet who have clamoured for conscription. Some honorable senators on the Government side are out-and-out conscription!

                            <para>- By virtue of his membership of this Parliament, the honorable senator is not included in the category of persons required to supply the information asked for in the schedule to this bill. The honorable senator can sit here and prattle as much as he likes in regard to this measure; he is not affected by it. &#34;When, during a time of national emergency, he had the opportunity to go on active service, he did not accept it. If the Government, as stated by the late Prime Minister, was satisfied with the voluntary system - such a statement has never been made by the present Prime Minister - and that the young men of Australia have such a love for their country as to inspire them with sufficient patriotism to enlist for its defence, why is there necessity for the introduction of this bill to introduce a form of conscription? In the last six years, definite assurances which have been made to the people by anti-Labour governments have never been honoured, with the result that the people feel that the present Government can no longer be trusted. That lack of trust is demonstrated by the presence in this chamber of no less than sixteen Labour senators, and in the results of the recent by-elections for the House of Representatives. This Government, with the assistance of the capitalistic: press, for too long has been tricking the electorate. with lying propaganda into returning a majority of anti-Labour representatives to both branches of the legislature. Apparently, the Government party is not very happy, for according to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> of to-day, the Prime Minister is likely to resort to an election in order to extricate him from his difficulties. When the people are given the opportunity they will demonstrate how solidly they are behind the representatives of the organized workers of this country. The organized workers are holding meetings of protest against the actions of this Government in all the capital cities. One meeting has already been held in Melbourne, and another large meeting is to be held- in the Sydney Town Hall. They were arranged long before the Government determined that this measure should be debated in the Parliament. These meetings have not been summoned by the Australian Labour party. </para>

                            <para>- The organized workers issue no instructions to their parliamentary representatives. They  merely  watch their actions in the Parliament. If a representative of the workers carries out the job for which he was elected to the Parliament, the workers endorse his candidature for future elections. This Government is making itself still, more unpopular by this proposal for the compilation of a compulsory register of man-power, which is but the forerunner of conscription. It Iras become more and more clear to me during recent weeks, from letters which <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> have received and talks which I have had with many people, that many of those who have argued in favour of a compulsory register, have done so without realizing that they -are really arguing in favour of quite a different form of compulsion altogether - of compulsory service or compulsory military training, or, at any rate, something which goes far beyond the mere putting of one&#39;s name on a card for the purpose of record in time of emergency. It cannot be denied that  this  bill is but the means of imposing compulsory military training and industrial and military conscription upon this country. Probably the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett.)</inline> is sincere when he tells us that he believes that there is no intention on the part of the Government to bring about compulsory military service or conscription in any form. &#34;We have to remember, however, that when the present Attorney-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> was Prime Minister, in June, 1916, he said, &#34; There will be no conscription &#34;, and that by September of that year he wrecked, the Government by trying to foist conscription on the people. What has happened in the past may happen again. That is why the workers are suspicious of the Government. What is the reason for clause 23, which provides that a.11 male persons between 18 and 21 years of age must notify any change of address? </para>

                            <para>- It is perfectly clear to me, especially when I recall that when a voluntary register was adopted in England, the conscriptionists were not satisfied, but went further and forced conscription on the people. Men between the ages of IS and 21 cannot be classified as skilled artisans. Indeed, most of them have been denied the right to learn a trade, or even to work. </para>

                            <para>- Nor was there any need for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> to refer to a double dissolution. I was going to remind you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deputy President,</inline> of his transgression of the Standing Orders, but I feared that in referring to it I, too, would be a transgressor. Therefore, I let it go. Not only has the Senate sat on few occasions, but also some of its sittings have been exceedingly short - only an hour or two. Recently, . <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur</inline> and I interviewed a number of lads at the Commonwealth Bank on behalf of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley,</inline> the honorable member for West Sydney. The lads told us that they could not enter a technical college for training, notwithstanding that they were prepared to pay the fees. In order to test the accuracy of their story, I communicated with the head of the Ultimo technical . school, and I learned from him that there was no possible chance of those lads entering the school unless either they were under the age of sixteen years or were sent by the Employment Council for the State. Those lads were denied the right to receive technical training unless they gave up the jobs which they had taken in order to try to maintain themselves decently. And if they had left their jobs, they would have been denied food relief. Those who were responsible for this legislation - I refer to the people behind the Cabinet as well as to Ministers themselves - had in mind the early introduction of conscription. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> predicted that one form of conscription would be the placing of men in labour camps. No conscript can ever be trained to equal a trained volunteer. All the storm troops who were so successful in the last war were volunteers. That compulsory military training does not produce the best men has been proved time and time again. Although I was fighting overseas at the time, I know what happened in connexion with the &#34; Hughesiliers  &#34; who were called up in 1916. The Government knows that since&#34; that time organized labour has made considerable progress. It must know, too, that organized labour is endeavouring to enlist the support of the people for a campaign against having anything to do with, the national register. We on this side realize that, however forceful our arguments, or however long we may talk, when the time arrives the Government will have sufficient numbers to put this measure through&#39; the Senate; but that is not the way to treat the workers of this nation. I predict that this compulsory register will do much to kill the pa triotism of the Australian people. Any form of conscription is regarded with suspicion as a potential danger to the liberty of the people. There are many in our midst who are always urging conscription of some kind - especially those who would benefit as the result of the increased defence expenditure. No reason has been submitted by the Government for the decision to discard the proposal for a voluntary register. Those who shouted the loudest for compulsion and conscription were able,, ultimately, to force the Government to accept a compulsory register. Can the Government say that any appeal to the spirit of patriotism, made in a time of crisis, has not been responded to enthusiastically and successfully? Does the Government doubt the patriotism of the people of Australia? It must do so, or it would not try to foist compulsion on them. The people will resent their sincerity and patriotism being doubted. Their loyalty and patriotism, have been proved on many Occasions. Is the Government so blind as to think that force is a weapon which can be used with equanimity and without repercussions? That a volunteer is worth tcn conscripts is as true to-day as it has ever been. The last war proved that the Australian soldier was the best worker and fighter in the field - ^Senator Dein does not know anything about that - but despite all the past glorious record, the Government now wishes. to force the stigma of conscription upon the Australian people. The Australian worker will always work for his country, and, if necessary, fight for it. All that he asks in return is a decent job, decent wages, and a decent standard of living. Me does not expect to have to wait until the exact number of unemployed is known before he obtains a job. The Government must know that there are 200,000 unemployed in the Commonwealth today. The restriction of credit, and the refusal of the banks to advance further credit to various societies have caused numerous people to become bankrupt. </para>

                            <para>- The Opposition claims that the number of unemployed in Australia at the present time, including those who get short rations by way of sus.tenance, is at least 200,000. Men who are able and willing to work cannot find employment. Recently the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> admitted that 29,000 men had registered for work at the various munitions factories. Probably, that number has been increased by another thousand in the meantime. </para>

No one denies that; but I say emphatically that the workers of Australia are willing to take their share of the responsibility for the defence of Australia - more willing in fact than are those financial concerns whose main object is to see how much profit they can extract from the people during times of crisis. The Government, has no justification whatever for saying that the workers are not prepared to shoulder their full share of that responsibility.

The rich people expect the young men of Australia to enlist, drill and prepare for war, and, if war should come, to give their lives, if necessary, to protect their country and the interests of its people. Many returned soldiers are now physical wrecks, and have suffered tremendous hardship through being unable to prove that their present disabilities are due to war service. Thousands of &#34; diggers &#34; have been laid in the cemeteries, and thousands more, who will soon pass away, are suffering injustice because they cannot prove thai, they served .in a gas area, or because they are unable to find the doctors who treated them. I cannot imagine that they or their dependants will be ready to support the present proposal for a compulsory national register. </para>

It will not be the rich man or the wealthy company whose money is invested in public loans which are used, amongst other purposes, to protect their financial- interests and ensure to them the receipt of full rates of interest. Recently, when a Commonwealth loan was floated in London to provide funds for defence purposes, about 60 per cent, of the loan was left with the underwriters. Clause 21 provides that the board may, with the consent of the Minister, from time to time, require any person who comes within -the provision of the bill to furnish fresh returns as may be asked for, and to supply any further information not on the present form, but as may be required by the board. Clause 20 also gives power to the Commonwealth Statistician, or any other authorized officer, to demand replies to any questions, and to compel the persons questioned to produce any documents demanded. I recall that a measure recently passed by this Parliament provided that no questions might be asked regarding patent processes. In the case of the big man, the Government is prepared to go only a certain distance, but the small man receives no protection. Will the worker bc asked whether he is a trade unionist? </para>

                            <para>- No ; but I say that,  if the questions already set out are insufficient, the schedule should be enlarged, so that we shall know exactly what questions are to be asked. These clauses give unlimited power to the board, which, it must be remembered, will be definitely under military control, as two of its members will be representatives of the Defence and Supply and Development Departments, and the Minister referred to will be the Minister for Defence. The Government not only adopts compulsion, but also reverts to methods similar to those of the inquisition. Privacy and that sacred liberty of mankind recently referred to by the Prime Minister are to be trampled underfoot. The schedule as printed would surely provide sufficient information for the purposes of a national register. It would enable persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years to be registered, and, if necessary, called up and shipped to Singapore. </para>

                    <para>It is much to be regretted that a government of the same political colour as that now in office determined to hand the Cockatoo Island Dockyard over to the Davis Gelatine Company. One of the three members of the board required to sign the necessary agreement represented the workers, and had been employed at the dock for eighteen years, but he was denied employment there because he refused to sign the agreement. That is the kind of thing that will be done under this measure in conjunction with the bill that was passed yesterday. When the Government has the names of the workers on the index it will &#39;be able to handle them as it likes. It will see that any to whom it objects are not retained in a branch of the Commonwealth Public Service, and also that they are not kept in the employ of any State department. Why was not <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Burnett</inline> given his job with the Davis Gelatine Company? The Government knows all about that matter. </para>

                            <para>- I trust that the Government will get some satisfaction out, of the passing of the measure, because the working classes of this nation will not ger much. If the workers refuse to sign and return the cards, and the Government decides to take action against them on the ground that they have broken the law I hope that the Ministers will remember what the Opposition said. We shall not laugh at them as they have laughed at us. I ask them not to provoke trouble, but if they do so they should take what comes to them and not squeal. We were happy to. think that a voluntary system of registration would suffice. I believe that the Government would receive more cards under a voluntary register than under a compulsory system. I shall lea ve the subject until the bill reaches the committee stage when, I hope, the Government will not again apply the &#34; guillotine &#34;&#60; Cabinet would be well advised to revise the legislation and not provoke the trouble that is threatened. </para>

                        <para>.- I view this bill not through any party spectacles but as a patriotic Australian who wants to make any potential enemy think twice before making a hostile move in this part of the world. Such an enemy must be impressed by the fact that Australia is undivided in its preparations to meet any attack, and will be undivided in the event of attack. There is no doubt whatever where the supporters of Labour will be should war occur - they will be well to the front as they were in the Great War. The bill debated yesterday and this measure are to make preparations to avert war. Yesterday the Opposition castigated the Government for not doing, this and that thing for the proper defence of the Commonwealth; to-day, honorable senators opposite are criticizing the Government for doing something in that direction. The word &#34; conscription &#34; is loosely used. Conscription is associated with the raising of troops to serve abroad. That does not come into this argument. Section 59 of the Defence Act, which was passed in 1909, provides for the calling up of all males between the ages of 18 and 60 years for service in Australia in time of national emergency. All this bill sets out to do is to ensure that should that time unhappily ever arrive, the law of the land shall operate intelligently and functionsmoothly. The authorities want to be sure that there will be no confusion in getting the defending forces quickly out to sea. into the field, and up in the air. Nothing militates against efficient mobilization more than the withdrawal of personnel and their transfer to avocations for which they are better fitted. We do not want medical students digging trenches&#39;, skilled mechanics peeling potatoes, telephonists acting as batmen, wireless operators driving army wagons, and&#39; railway engine drivers cleaning guns. We had experience of that in the Great War. I am not a great lover of compulsion, but we seem to get nowhere without some form of compulsion. How many of us would pay our income tax if not compelled to do so, or pay dog licences if we could evade them? Honorable senators opposite know full well that the employees who are endangering the standard of wages and working conditions in any industry are those who will not register and become trade unionists. If compulsory trade unionism is good for any industry, compulsory registration of every Australian citizen as a help to the effective preparation of defence measures, is infinitely more important. Wars are not made in these days after long parleys; they comewithout formal declaration, out of the blue. I cannot help believing that honorable senators opposite, all reasonable fellows, are being pushed from behind. Their objection to the bill is all &#34; hooey &#34;. To me there is &#34;no nigger in the wood pile &#34;. This is just a straight-out honest attempt by the Government to obtain a census of avocations - a guide as to how Australian man-power can be profitably used to the best advantage in time of national emergency. </para>

                        <para>. - Before I undertake a reasoned consideration of this measure I shall refer briefly to some of the most recent speeches delivered by honorable senators opposite. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> made a definite statement - I am not sure how he related it to the bill under discussion, but probably he did so - about the failure of the Labour Government in 1930 to bring about a double dissolution. He said that fear of . what would happen as the result of a dissolution was the cause for that omission. I do not suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> knows that the statement is not in accordance with fact, but I do suggest that he does not understand very clearly at any time what is happening around him. The Scullin Government could not obtain a double dissolution in 1930, for a number of reasons, but a statement of one of them should suffice for this occasion. The Government could not dissolve Parliament until it had validated all of its -extreme tariff measures, which had not then been ratified by the House. Had Parliament been dissolved before those measures had been validated, the manufacturers could have demanded refunds of all the duties that they had paid under the Scullin Government&#39;s heroic measures. Such refunds would have amounted to millions of pounds and their payment would, of course, have been impossible. A Senate hostile to the Labour Government would not have validated the bills. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> errs either in ignorance or deliberately. In either case, as a legislator of this country, he is culpable.  His  statement is on all fours with another equally inaccurate that he recently made in this chamber about the action of the Queensland government in connexion with the sale of meat. He quoted from a book which was not official and which had been written by an acknowledged bitter tory opponent of the Queensland government. </para>

The reverse of the picture that he painted is that the Queensland Government had passed legislation which cut in half the retail price of meat in that State. Whatever the Government lost through the competition of its own butcher shops with those of private owners, was counterbalanced by the money it put into the pockets of the consumers. </para>

                            <para>- I shall now deal with some of the remarks made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand.</inline> He is such a friendly and genial soul that it hurts me very much even to contradict him. He stated that compulsory training is the simplest thing in the world, because the Defence Act already provides that all men between the ages of 18 and 60 years may be called up in times of national emergency. He could not, therefore, understand the Labour party&#39;s present objection to compulsion. We do understand the provisions of the Defence Act and have understood them all along. Our opposition to this measure is entirely in conformity with that understanding. One of the main planks of the Labour party&#39;s defence platform is the deletion from the Defence Act of all sections relating to compulsory military training and compulsory service. Therefore <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> does not get anywhere with his argument. I know that honorable senators opposite are hostile to my remarks, and I am proud of the fact. No man in this chamber is happier than I am when I am under fire from the apologists for the wealthy interests of this country. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> also made a statement which, I suggest, is unworthy of him. He was only repeating what most of the other speakers, on the Government side have said. They interject with all the glibness in the world : &#34; What about compulsory unionism ! &#34; Let us consider it. It was not brought about by accident nor had it just &#34; growed  &#34; like Topsy. It happened because of the cruel, cowardly and callous rapacity of the Australian employers of half a century ago, and because the standard of the wage workers was reduced to such a low level that industry experienced everrecurring strikes. That did not pay the capitalists, so they tendered the workers this advice: &#34;You do not win anything by strikes. Usually you are defeated; you always have to give in when your women and children are hungry. Why not put men into Parliament to pass legislation for the benefits of the workers ? &#34; The capitalists were not in sympathy with the workers and gave that advice only because strikes were also disastrous to them. The captains of industry had sole command of government in every State in those days, and in Queensland they organized the military forces with instructions to proceed against the striking bush workers, &#34;fire low, and lay them out&#34;: I was on the job when the shearers strike was in progress, and I saw gangs of my mates going through the streets of one of the western towns wearing leg irons and handcuffs. Their swags were torn open in the streets in order to discover whether or not they contained incriminating evidence. My only sister married one of those shearers after he was released from a long term of imprisonment which he suffered because of his love of liberty and his enthusiasm for the organization of &#171; the workers. We got into Parliament and with the passing of the years we succeeded in passing through the legislatures of this country measures for the benefit of the class which we represent. We made laws which eventually took the control of industry out of the hands of the captains of industry. As the result of our activity in the various parliaments &#34;we now have on the statute-books of the several States measures providing for .compulsory unionism in some industries, and in all, the right for government inspectors to walk through the factories and into the offices of sweaters in -order to examine their wages sheets and see that they are obeying the law. </para>

                    <para>Do not let me hear any more of this jibe about compulsory unionism. If Government supporters could get a mental picture of the interests which I and my Labour colleagues definitely represent in this chamber, they would realize that there are in industry to-day some people as rapacious, and some companies as bowelless and soulless as those whom in those earlier days we had to fight and over whom we eventually triumphed through the organization of compulsory unionism. </para>
                    <para>Having probably somewhat stirred Government supporters out of their complacency, I believe that now I shall have their attention for what I am about to say. The Government has completely failed to realize the great importance to all the people of Australia of the measure which was passed yesterday in circumstances which I regret, but for which the Government is entirely responsible, and the bill now before the Senate. These measures, if one reads them casually, and if one took them at their face value in the same flippant way as Government supporters regard them, might be considered harmless measures for the purpose of collecting certain statistics. The bills will, of course, do that, but I want Government supporters to get some idea of the reason for the opposition to the bill by the organized workers of Australia represented in this chamber by the Labour opposition only. </para>

                            <para>- I have never flattered myself sufficiently to hope that I shall receive the votes of the interests which the Leader of the Senate represents. I should be ashamed if I did. But my wish is to establish the right atmosphere for the proper consideration of this measure... I would like to get the right background in the chamber, in order that senators supporting the Government may be the better able to understand the full import of this bill and why honorable senators on this side cannot see it as they do. Over other senators I have the advantage of age. I can look back to the very beginnings of the struggle for a true democracy in this country.I can look back and see how Australia has developed industrially and politically. In imagination, I can see again the workers - by the workers, I mean the people of Australia as a whole, struggling against tremendous odds to establish the Commonwealth as we know it to-day. I can recall things that were done by the class which I represent, things which to-day I would not consider right, but which were inevitable in the circumstances then prevailing. For example, if there is one principle of Australian national policy to which all parties now subscribe, it is that of a White Australia. A great many years ago I was one of a probably ill-advised group of young men who, long before this idea of a White Australia had crystallized into a definite plank of the Australian national policy, were fearful lest the influx of foreigners should jeopardize the industrial standards which we were then endeavouring to establish. I remember how we agitated to have every article of furniture made by other than a white worker stamped in order that the people would boycott its sale in the shops. I well remember a crowd of us on one occasion walking from one to the other end of the suburban area of the capital city in which I live, a distance of probably five or six miles, and smashing every window of every Chinese warehouse in our path. I would not advocate doing anything like that to-day. I mention the incident now in order to get in its true perspective the organization of the Labour movement of this continent which has been responsible for the national character of our industrial institutions. At that time we were receiving large numbers of migrants from the older countries of the world and there came from Ireland as fine a fighting band of rebels as ever came to advantage a new country. We were also receiving worthy settlers from Germany and from other countries; migrants who left the older countries of Europe because of lack of opportunity there and because also of the crushing of the democratic spirit. These people came to Australia, then a group of self-governing colonies, and started work. Gradually, as the result of united action, there grew up in this country a conception of national ideals. a hatred of autocracy, and a love of democracy and freedom in all its forms. 1 feel that if I can establish this right atmosphere in this debate, Government supporters will cease to sneer at the remarks of honorable senators on this side, and will take some note of our complaint about the undemocratic nature of this bill. They will, I hope, admit that we are the product of the freedom-loving and liberty-loving Australian continent. </para>

                            <para>- I should not have taken notice of the interjection if it. had come from a lesser light on the Government side, or if it had been made by one with less responsibility. I ask the honorable gentleman not to be cowardly by implying that the Australian people, to whom I have been referring, enjoy all the privileges of a democracy, but are not prepared to fight for them. The interjection was unkind and entirely unworthy of the Leader of the &#39;Senate, for whom I have great respect. The records of the great struggle between 1914 and 1918 show what the class to which I belong did to support the liberties which we all enjoy in this country. It is true that they were not alone; they were joined by equally gallant young men belonging to the well-to-do and privileged classes, and what is more important, there was no suggestion of compulsion about the whole business in those years. They volunteered to serve this country because the Government appealed to the best side of their nature. It did not attempt to employ compulsion. For what is the Government preparing? Is it a state of war, a danger of war, or apprehension of war? Why are we fearful that war may occur? We all know. We are preparing because certain nations with policies, ideas and ideals entirely foreign to Australian ideals, are endeavouring to drive the world into difficulties. This is a perfectly honest reason for apprehending danger. But do not let us forget that the complications in Europe are the result of political theories of capitalism run mad; the result of a frantic search for profits. We are preparing for war be cause of international complications arising from ill-digested theories of capitalism, communism, and, mark my words, of dictatorships and all forms of totalitarianism. It is because of the existence of these respective forms of go,vernment, in which large sections of people in Europe and elsewhere in the world believe, that we in Australia apprehend the danger of war. </para>

                            <para>- I am opposed to it lock, stock and barrel. I am opposed to it because it reeks of compulsion, communism, capitalism, dictatorships and totalitarianism. I shall oppose every line of the measure to .the last breath that I m&#39;ay draw. Whatever action the Government may take to get it through this chamber, that will not be our responsibility. I say definitely, and I accept full responsibility for my statement, that when the Government has passed this bill, when it has slaughtered in this chamber, free speech, as it was slaughtered last night when the Senate committee was compelled to pass nineteen clauses of a bill without even being able to read, let alone criticize , or intelligently discuss then - when the Government has done all this, I ask Ministers never to forget that, to the extent that they had the opportunity, created only by the strength of their numbers, they stabbed Australian democracy and the principles of liberty and freedom to the heart. This Government has done its best in these two measures to destroy all that Australia really stands for and the best and most desirable aspirations of every loyal and good Australian. I now approach the bill on the basis which its sponsors have asked us to accept. The principle involved in the bill is that human beings and human life are regarded in the same  way as machinery, stock in trade, &#38;c. Honorable senators opposite may deny it - they probably will - but their denial  &#34;will be just as untruthful as their other denials. Human lives are to be taken stock of, we are told. After 150 years of the development of this great nation, after those ideals to which I have briefly alluded have been fostered and brought to fruition, after we have gone so far along the road of human liberty and progress, have we in 1939 only reached the stage at which wc are asked in the Australian National Parliament to take stock of human beings ? </para>

                            <para>- The only regret 1. have is that no matter how much eloquence I might possess, I could not make &#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> realize something of his responsibilities, or convert  him from  his soulless outlook. In every clause of this bill, human life is merely considered as the raw material for combating international complications in Europe. It is given no other consideration. I ask honorable senators opposite to review the schedule of this bill. I ask them if, in one line of it, or of the Minister&#39;s second-reading speech, or of any speech made by any Government- supporter, there is recognition that these men, of whom it is proposed to take stock, are living, breathing, human entities, each with a soul, each with aspirations, each with responsibilities, and most of them having standing in the shadows behind them dependants for whom they must care and succour. Human product, human raw material to be taken stock of, to be dragooned into answering questions so that you may use them - for what? For the defence of Australian ideals? No, but for the defence of the very things we dislike in the nations from which the trouble is threatened. If the Government were appealing to them to defend Australian national ideals or to do something to increase freedom and democracy in this country, something might be said for compulsion, but nothing of the kind i=&#62; c on templated. </para>

                            <para>- A voluntary questionnaire was sent by the Government, not by the Opposition, to the interests represented by honorable senators opposite. The employers in industry were asked to submit answers to a few pertinent questions. One half of them did the job and the rest of them rejected it. That was the extent of their co-operation. Just as the response to the appeal for volunteers in 1914 was wonderful, so would there be a wonderful response if this system were made voluntary. In spite of our political differences, all of us have at least some faith in Christian democracy, using the term &#34; Christian &#34; in its highest sense. Regardless of our political creeds we as Australians can subscribe to the ideal of Christian democracy and unless that is our inspiration we shall get nowhere worth while, no matter what we may do. In this measure to-day the Government is ignoring every worth while principle of Christian democracy. It is ignoring human rights and putting men on the same level as- it would put machines in a factory. If honorable senators are in doubt .as to the truth of that statement I ask them to read the schedule of this bill. What are the people to whom this compulsory bill will apply to become? If they are compelled to answer these questions, and otherwise to be dragooned into this channel and that channel, no matter what the reason or excuse may be, the Government will be treating them only as slaves. After all they are but the slaves of a bad social order. There is little chance, if any, for them to accumulate property which would free them  from the slavery of low wages, unemployment and the dole. Honorable senators opposite know that these conditions exist. There is no need to talk about the 150,000 men in this Australian democracy, who are able and willing to work and for whom no work is made available - men who know that they are condemned to the slavery of economic insecurity or unemployment. When there is an opportunity to ask them to serve their country they are not to be allowed to do so voluntarily. The Government has said in effect, &#34;We shall not appeal to the better side of your nature and allow you to volunteer for this job. We do not trust you. You are slaves and we shall treat you as slaves and compel you to answer these questions &#34;. I protest with every bit of earnestness I have against this measure. I may not have many years to live but when the end comes to me, as it must come to all, I shall at least know that for myself, for every other honorable senator on this side of the chamber and on behalf of this freedom loving Australia, I did my earnest best to prevent this bill from becoming law in its present form. Just as I believe that when the day of reckoning is at hand and we stand before the Judgment Seat, God will not look us over for medals, but for scars, I am sure that I am doing right in objecting, for as long as I have breath and energy left, to this nefarious measure. </para>

                    <para>Speaking in regard to national defence and major Australian policy generally, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith said that he was coming to the conclusion that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies</inline> and his Government regarded politics as a game, not as a national service. There is evidence to supportthis conclusion. First of all, in the Griffith byelection <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll,</inline> in opening the campaign for the United Australia party, said that they were going to make defence the major issue in the campaign. In this way the Commonwealth Government tried to make defence a party political issue, thereby playing the fool in a time of national danger. </para>
                    <para>The national register proposal now before Parliament, being so one-sided in character, can only be regarded as a political move, provocative in character, at a time when the co-operation of all sections of the community should besought.In 1915 there was a complete census by the Labour Government, not only of man-power, but into every detail of the resources of individuals throughout Australia. The omission of a wealth census from the national register and other provisions contained in the bill can only be construed in one way, that the Menzies&#39; Government intends to adhere to the historic policy of conservatism, namely, that all public interests within the nation must be subordinate to the financial interests in the community. </para>

The Labour party are naturally hostile to the bill in its present form, but amendment to what is considered an unjust law in a democracy can onlybe obtained through the Parliament itself by constitutional methods. To advocate any other course would be contrary to democracy and merely play into the hands of those anti-social forces who seek an opportunity to destroy parliamentary methods and replace them by a dictatorship. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator who has interjected is entirety hopeless. Is there anything democratic in inserting in a bill a provision which, in the Minister&#39;s own language, is so much humbug, and is only put there in order to keep the party to which he belongs on the Government benches. The Government does not dare to face a general election and allow the people, who are the masters of parliament, to decide. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> describes as &#34; most democratic &#34; the worst exhibition of insincerity, of sparring for time, and of making a show in order to deceive the electors, that I have ever witnessed. </para>

                        referred to some of the difficulties that have occurred in connexion with the alleged patriotism of some people. Here again I know all about this subject, for I was in at the inception of the whole business, and know every phase of its development. I know that when the men came back from the theatres of war in their thousands - some of them, as the result of marvellous escapes, whole in body and in mind, but others, of whom there are some honorable examples in this chamber, maimed - leaving tens of thousands of their comrades dead on the other side of the world, the whole nation agreed that the best possible should be done for them because of the great sacrifices that they had made. Consequently, the governments of all the States devised schemes of soldier land settlement. But these spurious patriots - the men whom we were fighting yesterday when we sought to curb their profiteering instincts - who wrapped themselves in the flag and decried other men who did not subscribe to their 39 articles of alleged patriotism, sold to every government in Australia land which was entirely unfitted for the purpose for which it was sold. Not only so, but they sold it at extravagant prices, with the result that the records of Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, South Australia, Western Australia and Tasmania reveal broken hearts and bodies, and tormented souls of returned soldiers in whom hope was crushed because they could not make a living on the land which these alleged patriots had sold at inflated prices.

Senators Foll and Crawford, although not participants in the unholy gamble, will know whether or not I speak the truth. On one occasion, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Coyne</inline> spoke .to me in the following terms: - &#34; J oe, I believe that you are going into the Stanthorpe district. We are getting a flood of correspondence from that district as to what is going on. I wish that you would have a look at the settlement there. Take down the evidence of the men, and let me have it. I have gone there time after time, but I cannot make any headway. They think that I have come prepared with an answer to their complaints, and, therefore I cannot gain their confidence. See what you can do &#34;. I went to Stanthorpe, and I saw that the settlers were brokenhearted. I have in my mind a vivid, picture of what I saw in another district. I went to a block on which a returned soldier was settled. He was a young Scot, who had recently married, and he was trying to carve out a living from land that was badly infested with prickly pear. He and his wife worked like trojans-  the job that they tackled required men and women with stout hearts - and lived like&#34; rats in a hole. Eventually, they were forced to leave their block. In the Stanthorpe district, hundreds of men and women were broken in body and soul, and they and their dependants were forced to leave their blocks. Their discarded orchards can be seen to-day. Every attempt made by the Government of Queensland to put much of that land into production proved hopeless. That land had been sold by spurious patriots at racketeering prices. Yet, in spite of these things, we are asked to accept this bill at the Government&#39;s own valuation. </para>
                    <para>In defence of this measure, it has been urged that the census will provide a true record of the extent of unemployment in Australia. That has been commented <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> by other honorable senators, and I shall not repeat what has been said. There is, however, no need to argue about the number of unemployed persons in this country. I know that applications were recently invited for 51 jobs in respect of which returned soldiers were to be given absolute preference. Over 800 men sat for that examination, so that at least 749 of them must have left the examination room with their hearts broken and without hope, </para>

                            <para>- Even if half of them already had jobs, there would still have- been 349 who went out of the examination room with their hopes crushed. But what does it matter how many of them there were ? Is a census - of the unemployed necessary for us to know what is going on? This afternoon there was placed in my desk a statement relating to the number of migrants admitted into Australia during the last financial year. It showed that 1,309 persons, including 535 Italians, had entered Australia from foreign countries. They are not our kith and kin, but they are still human beings with souls and bodies. We all regret that these people are refugees from their own countries, because either capitalistic or communistic dictatorship methods have driven them out; but we have a right to expect that first consideration will be given to that lost legion of Australians - those young men who have never had a chance.

Although born in Australia of Australian parents, they are refugees in their own country; and Government policy means that jobs will never found for them. </para>

This morning <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> spoke of insurance being an asset. .1 believe that there are many other things which those who are responsible for this bill claim to be assets. I have a lady friend who has been left by will an interest in an estate.  Her  husband died recently, leaving her as his sole executor. But because he had been left a reversionary interest in his father&#39;s estate, the value of that estate was treated by the authorities as an asset, and was included in the amount upon which she had to pay probate and succession duties, although it &#39; is highly improbable that she will ever be able to do anything with the asset. In any case, it is not liquid. </para>

                    <para>Certain remarks were made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan about the recent visit to Australia of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> He said that it was a great pity that more Labour men had not heard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> on that occasion. I, did not have an opportunity to hear him, because I was not in Brisbane when he visited that city. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan did not state all that  <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> told him, but during the honorable senator&#39;s speech, interjections came from Labour senators who had met <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> and had heard what he had to say. Honorable senators opposite are silent about much of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> told them, because it would not suit their books to disclose it.  In September last, I was a member of an Empire-wide conference that met at Lapstone, New South Wales. Delegates were present from every country in the British Empire, including India. The press was not repre sented, and, therefore, every delegate was free to express his convictions candidly. The result was that we had a conference that was invaluable to me, and, I believe, to every delegate. It was not necessary for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> to come to Australia this year, and tell us that an expeditionary force would never again be required to leave the shores of Australia, because, from the delegation from the United Kingdom, which included representatives of all shades of political opinion, we had that assurance on the best possible authority. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators opposite know the fate of the National Insurance Act. I suppose that not less than &#163;250,000 has been wasted on that proposal. </para>

                            <para>- Perhaps so. The Government gagged the bill through the House of Representatives, so that it would reach this chamber when there were only three members of the Labour party in the Opposition ; now the Opposition consists of sixteen members. </para>

                    <para>One of the reasons why the Government is prepared to hang on to office by hook or by crook, and is hoping to go into recess on Friday or Saturday next, is that it intends that the new Governor-General and his wife shall be received in Australia by a Ministry formed by members of the party opposite. The social climbers of this country are pressing the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> to hang on to office, because it would be deplorable if the Duke and Duchess of Kent had to be received in Australia by a government composed of representatives of the working class. Whenever Queensland has been visited by royalty, the Labour party has been in office in that State, and I have yet to learn that any serious <inline font-style="italic">faux pas</inline> has been committed. I shall let the people- know how Senators Foll, Crawford and Cooper fought strenuously for this bill, because they could not trust good Australians. I shall also let them know the kind of answers which this Government gives to questions asked in the Senate. I deliberately asked how much the Government was spending on Yarralumla. That residence was good enough for <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Isaac</inline> Isaacs, the finest Governor-General Australia has ever had. Extravagant expenditure is now being incurred at Government House, Canberra, and the additions that are being made are more extensive than the original building itself. From the answers to my questions I was able to elicit that &#163;36,000 had been already expended on Yarralumla. </para>

                            <para>- I am charging this Government with insincerity regarding defence. If the Government were sincere it would have stopped the waste on the national insurance scheme when it knew that the scheme was not to be proceeded with. If it were sincere it would not have spent &#163;36,000 on Yarralumla. This morning&#39;s press contains an inspired statement that the Government is considering the purchase of a property in&#39; Melbourne to accommodate the Duke and Duchess of Kent when they are in that city. If the nation be really in danger, and if the Government apprehends a state of war, as it would have us believe from its bills, it should shut down on every expenditure, particularly in view of the fact that every time the Opposition asks for help for a distressed section of the community we receive the stereotyped answer: &#34;Nothing can be done because all the money available is wanted for defence purposes &#34;. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> deserves to be congratulated on his speech. If he had said nothing else but. read the illuminating quotation from the <inline font-style="italic">Economist,</inline> he would have rendered great service to the country. Every word of what he read applies to the situation to-day. Government supporters talk about tuning in with Great Britain. They know that the Government of that country had stood for the voluntary system, and that only recently Parliament decided to impose conscription. </para>

Ear be it from me to belittle any army that fought on the side of the Allies, but because Great Britain had conscription, can the Minister tell me that the rank and file of the &#34;Tommies,&#34; was equal to the Australians in service, in virility, and in quickness in the uptake? When on one critical occasion it was necessary to stem the tide during a retreat, it was the Aus.tralian troops who were called upon. The Minister should not talk to me about what system Great Britain had during the Great War. Because the Australian Government did not dare to put into force its policy of conscription we had soldiers as good as those of any other nation, if not better. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> said that the enactment of this legislation would have the effect of bettering things for the workers. </para>

                            <para>- This bill is not: one on which there is need to make a second-reading speech. It is a committee measure, and the Ministers will hear us in full cry then. When there is talk about the enactment of this legislation making work, I ask the Ministers whether one line in either this measure or in the Supply and Development Bill shows that they have considered what will happen when the defence expenditure has been discontinued. Not a line in yesterday&#39;s measure nor in this bill indicates that the Government is prepared to sen.&#39;! o::.&#39; :&#39;. questionnaire which will help to plan against the economic insecurity that must occur when the defence expenditure ceases. Then there will be a depression, social services will be starved, business stagnation will occur, and there will be malnutrition and all the other horrors associated with unemployment. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> says that one of the reasons why he supports the bill is that it will give some people work. </para>

                            <para>- Either my statement is correct, or it is not; the event will prove. If I am proved incorrect, I shall apologize. These census forms are to be stacked at the Brisbane Post Office, where, owing to the congestion in the inadequate building, a person can hardly enter to buy a stamp. If he can see his form, he will be able to take it out and fill it in. If, however, he does not comply with the act, the penalty prescribed is a fine of &#163;50 or imprisonment for three months. Is it not a fact that as soon as the boys handle these census forms they may break a law ? Tens of thousands who will have compulsory census forms will not be able to supply all the details demanded. </para>

When the question of the voluntary register was being &#39;considered in the House of Representatives, a member of the Opposition asked about the promise made by the late Prime Minister on the matter. Have the Government supporters in this chamber forgotten the answer that was given in the House of Representatives? There the Minister said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons&#39;s</inline> statement did not refer to service outside of Australia; it referred only to compulsory military training. That statement was a falsehood.

                        <para>- My purpose is to bring to the Senate a realization of the motives behind our very definite opposition to this measure. If, in the course of my address, I have succeeded in conveying even an impression of our feeling in the matter I shall be more than satisfied. But I am not sure that I have accomplished what I set out to do. All the special pleading that we have had from Ministers and their supporters, all the interjections that were flung across the chamber while my colleagues were addressing themselves to this bill, suggest that ministerial supporters have not got a grip of the situation; that they are unable to get behind the verbiage in which the intentions of the Government are clothed in this bill. I want them to feel that we are very earnest in our opposition to this measure, as well as to the one that was forcedthrough the Senate yesterday. We are in opposition to it because we are Australians in an Australian Parliament, legislating for Australians; and we are actuated by sentiments which, as I said this afternoon, are not <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> prerogative of onesection of the community, but are common to all our people as a result of their struggle over the last century and a half to escape from the political and economic thraldom which still lies upon the populations of other countries. </para>

                <para>I conclude with a few thoughts which. I think, are apropos, and will probably round off better than anything else could the address I have delivered. The Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett)</inline> knows that I have very great respect for him, but I say to him that, he made the very best of a bad job in his second-reading speech. This bill has not been drafted within the last few days. The proposals contained in it have been under discussion for some weeks. They are not entirely the outcome of the Government&#39;s desire to do anything that will get them out of a very difficult political situation. If the Minister in charge of the measure would realize, as we do. that the cure for democracy which in this country and othercomponent parts of the British Empire, is said to be on its trial, is more democracy; and that the danger to the world lies in autocrats and autocracy and rule by the privileged classes, he would see the unwisdom of attempting in Australia to apply compulsion in any shape or form. I say deliberately that compulsion is only another word for conscription. We <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> this side decline to camouflage what we believe is the real objective of the bill. Norman Angell has well said that - </para>

The honorable gentleman ranted and raved and beat the air in frenzy. But although he spoke for an hour and a half he did not touch upon the bill. We were disappointed because, when the sitting was suspended he had almost reached the bill. Of course, the honorable gentleman must not be reproached for his failure to deal with the bill &#39;because, under the Senate Standing Orders a member of this chamber may not speak for more than one hour and a half on a motion for the second reading of any measure presented to it. At one stage, the honorable gentleman, as I have said, nearly touched the bill. He said something to this effect: &#34;This bill will have the effect of making criminals of young men &#34;. </para>

                        <para>- Such a statement was entirely unworthy of the honorable gentleman. No one should remain a member of this chamber if he believes that it is legislating to make criminals of any persons in the community. If I thought that way I would go out of the Senate to-morrow and do so in honour. Nearly every piece of legislation which we pass contains a penal clause for offences committed against its provisions. I say, therefore, that it is sheer nonsense for any member of the Senate to suggest that a bill of which he disapproves will make criminals of some one. As is usual with, and characteristic of, the honorable gentleman and his followers, he made a strong attack on employers, and looking across the chamber suggested that honorable senators on this side were the representatives and tools of the wealthy and employing classes. I referred to this matter yesterday and took occasion to tell the Leader of the Opposi tion that although no Labour senator or combination of Labour members of Parliament ever does anything to provide jobs in this country, none of them ever hesitates to hurl insults at men who subscribe capital to business enterprises and give employment to Australian workmen. In view of the frequency of those attacks on the employers made by honorable senators and their Labour colleagues in the House of Representatives, as well as in the State Parliaments, no one could be surprised if the people who invest money in these industrial undertakings sometimes asked themselves whether they were justified in risking their capital. Some day Labour in this Parliament may reach the treasury bench, and if honorable senators opposite do, then what they now suggest the interests of the investing public will be in jeopardy. </para>

                <para>Honorable senators opposite would show come practical sympathy for the working classes of this country if they applied their own capital and some of their energy to the establishment of industrial undertakings which would provide jobs for Australian workers. The truth is, however, that some of the leaders who are behind this campaign in opposition to the Government&#39;s proposals to establish a national register are the very men who batten on the working men of this country. Numbers of these parasites are to be seen hanging around the Trades Halls of the various capital cities. Their one purpose seems to be to create discontent among the workers, but they themselves do nothing to provide jobs for fellow Australians. Most of their time is spent in abusing people, who, at least, are rendering some service to this country by furnishing the capital for industrial enterprises and giving employment to our people. </para>
                <para>The Leader of the Opposition objected to the questionnaire contained in the schedule to the bill, but directed his attention principally to a questionnaire which, I believe, was submitted to recruits for the police force. That, I understand, is a voluntary questionnaire, and some of the questions are a little bit difficult. The honorable senator went through it question by question, and held it up as a horrible example of what the Government  proposed to do under this bill, although, as a matter of fact, he did not deal in any detailwith the schedule to this measure. Let us examine the questionnaire that is before the Senate in order to see if there is in it anything to which objection can be taken.

                <para>Those are all simple questions that could be asked of, and answered by, any person without any doubt or suspicion. But honorable senators opposite, who are subject to the dictates of leaders of outside unions, know that they must find fault with it. We had an example of this last week when we saw, in the House of Representatives, a considerable number of these trade union executives watching their servants oppose this bill clause by clause. They came here for that purpose. The fees of the unionists were utilized to send them here to see how their servants in this Parliament were obeying their dictates. I have read the questionnaire ; that is the sinister document which honorable senators opposite say will bring about the introduction of conscription in Australia. Who are the people who issue instructions to honorable senators opposite? The following paragraph appeared in a letter addressed to me by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. J.</inline> V. Stout, secretary of the Melbourne Trades Hall Council: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Because it is felt that should the bills become law, there will follow much disruption in Industrial life, I have been directed to ask that you exert your influence to improve or at least maintain the present relations existing in industry. 1 can assure my friends of the Trades Hall and honorable senators opposite, that my efforts have always been, and always will be, directed towards the maintenance of the industrial standards of the people. I do not need the prompting of the Trades Hall Council to do so. Nevertheless, I can conscientiously vote for the bill now before the Senate. What does the Trades Hall Council say about the bill? Its spokesmen say that this bill will lower the industrial conditions of the workers, that it will make slaves of them, and all the rest of the rubbish we have heard from honorable senators opposite. Unfortunately, some honorable senators opposite swallow every word written by their mentors, and echo such sentiments in this Parliament. The trade union executives set out eight methods by which it is proposed to defeat the purpose of this bill. I shall not read them all; there is no necessity to do so. I content myself with saying that this letter sets out how the council proposes to exert its influence to defeat the national register. Then it appeals to me to oppose the bill on the ground that if I do not do so I shall be helping to interfere with the industrial standards that obtain in Australia. The party on this side of the Senate is responsible for having introduced the legislation establishing the Arbitration Court and it is pledged to maintain the standards and conditions established by the court. It ill becomes the Trades Hall Council to ask me to join forces with it in its attempt to defeat this measure. My answer to that nefarious suggestion is the speech which I am now making, and this is the proper place for such an answer to be made. Unlike honorable senators opposite, I do not read a pamphlet for the accuracy of which I cannot vouch, and at the same time refuse to divulge the name of its author. I have given , the name of the author of this document, and I am prepared to allow any honorable senator who cares to do so so to peruse it. The following resolution was carried at a meeting of executives of trade unions held on Sunday, the 4th June, last: - </para>
                </quote>
                <para>Further, in order to initiate a fund to finance propaganda against the national register, it be a recommendation to the Trades Hall Council that each union be requested to subscribe an amount of at least &#163;1 for each delegate to the council. </para>
                <para>From what source is that money coming? From the pockets of the unionists. I say that the law of this land should prevent a few of these union parasites - I do not refer to the unionists, but to those who live on their dues-from fostering this campaign against the law. </para>
                <para>SenatorCameron. - This bill is not yet the law of the land, and the Government has no mandate to make it so. </para>

                        <para>- It soon will be the law of the land. These people have no right to filch the dues of the unionists who are told that their contributions to  union funds will be used to preserve or to improve their industrial conditions. Hundreds of thousands of unionists see no harm in this bill. They have an inherent love of their country and they are prepared to play their part, not only by filling in the questionnaire set out in the schedule to this bill, but also, if the occasion arises by going very much further than that. Many thousands of these unionists never have and never will vote for our friends opposite; but their dues are used not only to keep a handful of people hanging around the Trades Hall but also to finance the propaganda to defeat a bill with which many of them agree entirely. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad that the honorable senator interjected; otherwise I might have overlooked him. The honorable senator spoke on the bill this afternoon, and at one stage, after taking a deep breath and swelling out his chest in self-satisfaction, he taunted honorable senators on this side of the chamber with being the representatives of industrial magnates and wealthy friends. Just to show whether or not that, taunt is justified let us consider for a moment some election figures. In 1934 when I was a candidate for election to the Senate, I got by many thousands a higher number of votes than had been recorded before or has since been recorded in New South Wales. </para>

                        <para>- On my merits, certainly not because through an accident of birth my name happened to be on the top of the ballot-paper. My friends opposite were kind enough to place my name number thirteen on their voting card, even below that of the Communist candidate. My majority was 189,000. In view of this, can it be said that the electors of New South Wales regard me and my colleagues as being the representatives purely of the wealthy classes? That vote of 729,000 represented a majority of the working men in 1934. In other words, more working men and women voted for me than for the members of the Labour party. </para>

                <para>Went on to land Great Britain because, he said the British Government had introduced a voluntary register. The honorable senator said &#34; I shall tune in with Great Britain&#34;. He did not tell us, however, that only a few weeks ago conscription, not compulsory training, was introduced in Great Britain. Apparently the honorable senator meant that in some instances he would tune in with Great Britain, and in others he would not. He should be fair enough to say in what respects he would tune in with Great Britain.. He wants it both ways. </para>

                        <para>- The honorable senator asked why we should not follow the British example and have a- voluntary national register. The essential aims of a voluntary national register in Great Britain and a compulsory national register in Australia are quite different. Australia wishes to determine the total available supply of man-power and to assess the supply of skilled &#39;labour. More than 100 types of skilled labour are required by a modern mechanized army. Great Britain has conscription and sufficient supplies of skilled labour, and wishes, by means of its register, to collect information relating to possible volunteers for emergency auxiliary services. Australia does not compel any one to perform any service in time of peace. The honorable senator also said that the unemployment register will not provide any information that is not already available. I remind him that no information is available of the total number of males unemployed, and the duration of unemployment. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> was ranting about this questionnaire^ - this inquisitorial examination to which certain people will be subjected - be did not say that in 1933 he supported the taking of a compulsory census of every man, woman and child in Australia. The questions asked in that. census were far more searching than those proposed to be asked under this bill. So it is no less than idle talk for honorable senators opposite to say that they object to our men being asked to supply answers to these questions, when they are prepared every ten years to support a compulsory census. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> said that the </para>

                <para class="block">Lyons Government decided in February last to introduce a bill for the taking of a voluntary register and that in the following May the Government changed its mind and decided to introduce a bill for a compulsory register. That sounds a very harmless statement, but I draw this deduction from it: In February of this year the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> was Prime Minister. As far as I can judge, in fixing the month of May for the change over to the voluntary register, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> wanted to have  an unfair dig at the present Prime Minister. The decision to take a compulsory register was made in March of this year while the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> was in office. Tho present Prime Minister was not even in the Ministry at the time. I may be wrong, but I believe that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> did not &#34; play cricket &#34; when he said that the change was made in May. Like many of his colleagues, he looks for something that might be hidden underneath. </para>

                        <para>- When the Ottawa Agreement was introduced into the House of Representatives similar charges were levelled against the Government of  the  day, but they were never proved. The making of such charges is a common practice with the Labour party. I assure the manhood of Australia that I have no sinister purpose when I say that I believe that this national register is necessary. I see nothing sinister in it. I admit that when I read what a person says, I am prepared to accept it in good faith. I do not discard the good and grope in the mire for some evil. Good reasons for supporting the bill can be advanced. I shall support it, first, because I believe that a national register would be invaluable to Australia in the event of an emergency arising. Secondly, I believe that I am right in supporting it, because since the bill was introduced into this Parliament I have read all that I could find about it, and have listened to the views of honorable senators and members of the House of Representatives. and I have not found any logical reason for not supporting it. The only objection to the bill appears to be the fear of industrial conscription or military conscription. Honorable senators opposite use those two terms in the hope that the trade unionists of Australia will oppose the bill. If the bill has no merit at all, honorable senators opposite should  point  out its weaknesses; but they should not say that there is some ulterior motive for its introduction. I assure honorable senators opposite that those who support the measure have minds just as .lofty as have its opponents. Although I have not been able to find any logical reason for the opposition to the bill, I have found two miserable excuses. I have already named them; they are industrial conscription and military conscription. What industrial conscription means, I do not know, but I do know that industrial conditions in Australia are regulated by arbitration courts, which the party to which I belong is pledged to support. Never yet has any non -Labour government opposed obedience to the laws of the land, but I cannot say that of some of my friends opposite. I should be glad to know what they have in their minds. The terms &#34; industrial conscription &#34; and &#34; military conscription &#34; have been coined for the purpose of deceiving the unsuspecting public. Let us seek to ascertain the source of the opposition to this bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> C. Crofts, of the Melbourne Trades Hall, objects to compulsion in any form ; so does the Leader of the Opposition, although until to-night I did not know that that was his opinion. What a delightfully easy-going old  gentleman <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crofts</inline> must be! Compulsion in alr form is anathema to him. &#91;Quorum <inline font-style="italic">formed.&#39;&#93;</inline> I spoke a little  earlier  of &#34; cricket &#34;. Is it &#34; cricket &#34; for honorable senators who smart under just criticism to arrange with their colleagues to go out of the chamber so that the Senate will be left without a quorum? This delightful <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Crofts,</inline> who is the guiding force behind the opposition to the national register, objects to compulsion in any shape or form. Therefore, he must object to compulsory unionism, notwithstanding that he relies on it. for his bread and butter. I imagine also that he could make a strong plea for a compulsory levy on unionists, because it might mean more bread and butter for him. This free and easy old gentleman must also believe in voluntary education, and voluntary payment of taxes. </para>

                <para>In considering this bill, I ask myself whether a -compulsory register is necessary in Australia, or elsewhere in the world, under existing conditions. I honestly believe that it is necessary,- and that its existence would help to make this country more efficient in a time of emergency. I also ask myself whether the questions in the questionnaire are reasonable. I have read them again, and I find nothing wrong with them. Even if I wanted to, I could not find a sound reason for objecting to any question set out in the schedule. I can honestly and conscientiously support a compulsory register. </para>
                <para>I was interested in the small book with a yellow cover which the Leader of the&#171; Opposition produced. The colour of its cover has frequently been changed. I do not know whether its contents vary to the degree that its cover does. Two or three years ago the book was coloured blue, but it got such a trouncing in the Senate that its publishers decided to republish it with a yellow cover. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> has supplied from the book some information for which I had intended to ask him. The Defence Act contains a provision authorizing compulsory military service for home defence. That act in its present form makes every man in Australia between the ages of 18 and 60 years compulsorily liable for service in an emergency. I intended to ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> whether he advocates the repeal of that provision. </para>

                        <para>- Do the Leader of the Opposition and his party believe that if Australia were attacked service would be voluntary? In the event of Australia being attacked, the manhood of Australia would respond as it responded before; but even so, I do not believe that voluntary -effort would be sufficient. If Australia were attacked every man should be required compulsorily to give of his best. Will the Labour party advocate the repeal of that provision? I do not believe that it is game to do so. The defence policy of the Labour party is published in a booklet, the cover of which is changed every three years. The words &#34; adequate defence &#34; are belched forth from the throats of Labour politicians in season and out of season. With that, little book and verbosity they hope to beat an aggressor. If the position became very serious, and every man in Australia were required for service in the defence of the country, the Labour party would be prepared to consider the taking of a referendum of the people. If the. enemy would postpone its attack foi- a sufficiently long period - and, of course, it would be good enough to await the result of a referendum - the Parliament would meet, and, if the enemy would delay its operations for about nine months, it might then be informed whether Australia was prepared to put up a fight. </para>

                        <para>- I am glad to have that interjection. Shortly before the last war. a Labour government  introduced  compulsory military training. &#34; the present Opposition claims relationship with the Labour party of those days, why does it not now support, compulsory training? There is as much difference between the Labour party prior to 1916 and that of to-day as there is between chalk and cheese. Then there was mutual trust among members of the party; but, since 1916, Labour governments in both the Commonwealth and State spheres have been broken up by internal dissension, suspicion and distrust. </para>

                <para>It was stated yesterday by some honorable senators that the world position had eased &#39; somewhat, and that this led them to doubt whether it was necessary to continue the defence programme that has been outlined. I can understand that line of reasoning; but, if the position has eased, this is due to Great Britain&#39;s tremendous effort, and to its increased preparedness. While -the world Contains dictators with aggressive designs, we can never feel free from danger, and, even if they could be compelled to abandon their aggressive tactics, they would have the tremendous task of re-absorbing in industry many millions of men who, for some years, have been mobilized for war. I fear that it may be beyond the power of the dictators to have those men re-absorbed in industry. If the dictators find themselves in difficulties, they may embark upon a foreign adventure in order to distract attention from their internal troubles. .Until those millions of men find their way back into productive work, we cannot confidently believe that the international crisis has passed. Therefore, it behoves Great Britain, Australia, and the rest of the democracies to go ahead with their defence programmes, and to perfect them, for in that direction our&#34; safety lies. </para>
                <para>Notwithstanding the gibes of honorable senators opposite, we on this side would do nothing injurious to the working people of Australia. We merely ask them to answer a few simple questions, so that, in the event of a national emergency, information of incalculable value would be available. This would enable each man to render the most efficient service of which he is capable. The bill has no sinister motive, and the Government is entitled to the plaudits of the people generally for having&#34; introduced it. I claim to have even a greater desire than the Opposition tohelp the working man, because 1 am prepared by ray actions in this Parliament  to encourage people to engage in industry, knowing that some of my fellow men will thereby obtain employment. I ask honorable senators opposite to forget the idle talk and nonsense that is pumped into them from the Trades Halls. We can safely trust to the good sense of men between the ages of 18 and 65 years, and they should be allowed to think for themselves. All that can be expected, judging by the part played by the Opposition in connexion with this measure, is, that, as some honorable senators opposite have suggested, bonfires will be made of the questionnaire proposed to be circulated. </para>

                        <para>- There is much in that clause that is alarming the people of this country. When there is a proposal to give such powers to a Minister we can only be guided by the experiences of the past, and our minds go back to 1916 and 1917, when representatives of the wealthy classes governed the Commonwealth. The leader of our party pointed out that we should be guided by the aliases under which the Nationalists have operated. During the war they changed from Liberals to Nationalists; later the Nationalists became the United Australia party, which joined the Country party. Now there is a one-party Ministry which will soon be known as the &#34; all out &#34; government. We recall that a previous government gave a definite pledge to the people that in no circumstances would it introduce conscription in Australia. The Government fought the election on that pledge, but only a few weeks later there was a cry for conscription. A proclamation was issued, bearing the name of George Pearce, and men were called into the &#34; stew camps &#34;, but the people rejected the conscription proposal. </para>

                        <para>- During the discussion, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> took exception to the idea that he had been elected by the rich to further the purposes likely to be effected when the bill becomes law. He did not like the references to the rich men connected with his party. When it was necessary to protect the people the Commonwealth Prices Commission was established, through which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Catts,</inline> then a member of the House of Representatives, learned &#39;that much exploitation was taking place in Australia. Eventually, the New South Wales Government introduced the Necessary Commodities Commission to protect the people against the profiteers who to-day are represented by the Commonwealth Government supporters. This bill contains no clause designed to afford protection to the people. There has been a desire to create an atmosphere in which the people would believe that the Government has no bad intentions. The Supply and Development Bill, that was passed yesterday, and the measure now under consideration combine to form a replica of the War Precautions Act. We know what happened in the year in which that act was passed, and we also recall the famous secret memorandum which said, among other things, &#34;You must create a fresh atmosphere; you must close the picture shows, racecourses and sporting bodies &#34;. </para>

                    <para>. - It has occurred to me that I might with advantage make a few observations on the conduct of this Senate. Although I doubt that it would have good effect, I should like to have it on record in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> that, in the discussion of this important measure, the only Minister present in the chamber is the honorable gentleman in charge of the bill, backed by five Government supporters. The arguments of honorable senators of  the  Opposition are not likely to have any influence on the views of absent senators. Perhaps we should do better if we conducted the Senate proceedings by correspondence, hut I assure the Senate that I speak in all sincerity when I say that the proceedings in this chamber on occasions become farcical. In the debate on this bill, honorable senators on this side are sincerely anxious to state their views for the benefit of Government supporters, but so few aro present. </para>

                <para>Let me now say something about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Adam</inline> Kemball Dein. That honorable gentleman would like to give  the  impression that he always discusses legislation from a lofty point of view. In fact the honorable senator regards  himself  as a model of propriety and a gentleman of the first order. Yet in his speech this evening he referred in scathing terms to representatives of trade union organizations, and complained that they made representations to members of the Senate and of the House of Representatives with respect to this  bill  as well as the measure which was passed through the Senate yesterday. The honorable gentleman called them parasites, whereas the truth is they are officers of legally constituted and registered trade union bodies. They are doing the work expected of them in all sincerity and to the best of their ability. It ill becomes <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> to refer in such disparaging terms to gentlemen who are performing a duty to those  who  employ them. I expect that they sometimes speak of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> as a &#34; sanguinary parasite of a politician &#34;. If they  were  to express themselves in good Australian language, I doubt if I should be  allowed  to repeat it in this chamber. But I do not regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> as a parasite. Nor do I think of any honorable senator opposite as such. Every  man  doing honest work is worthy of respect. I therefore ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> in future, not to degrade  himself  and the Senate by referring to  the  representatives of trade union organizations as parasites. I speak on this subject  Avith  some warmth, because I know the facts. For many years I was an officer employed by a certain industrial organization. I served it to the best of my ability, and the members  were  sorry to lose my services. I have been in close contact with  working-class  organizations for the whole of my. life, so I know  how  hard they have to fight against the organized opposition of the captains of industry. I know personally the officers of many trade union bodies and have no hesitation in Saying that they compare favorably with members of this chamber or of the House of Representatives. There may be rogues among them just as rogues are to be found in any other section of the community. Some may act as stool pigeons for the bosses. Such men have done harm to the working-class movement; but, generally speaking, trade union leaders play their part honestly and do splendid  work  not only for their members, but also for the community as a  whole  through their efforts to improve the general conditions of the people. 1 hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> will,  in  future, refrain from speaking so disrespectfully of nien who are doing their duty by their employers. </para>

                <para>I express regret for having digressed in this way from the subject matter of the bill, but I thought that it  Was  due to the Senate that I should offer some comment upon the unfair statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> regarding representatives of the trade union organizations. I turn now to the bill itself. </para>
                <para>There has been aroused in the minds of the people a fear that the measure is a prelude to further proposals which will have the effect of enslaving the workers and instituting a political system similar to, if not exactly the same as, that  operating  in many countries of Europe. There is the danger that modern democracies, in their desire to organize for the purpose of defeating those who, in other countries, are opposed to the democratic form of government, will forget their function and institute a system of government which smacks of Fascism. We  on this side are not alone in this view of the trend of political events. The whole trade union movement of this country regards the bill and the preceding measure with suspicion. In the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> of the 12th June, there appeared the following report of a speech delivered by the Reverend W. A. Hardy, at Holy Trinity Church, Woolloongabba, on the previous night: - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>Though the Church must keep clear of politics, there are some political issues with implications for religion upon which it must declare itself. The proposed national register raises one issue. </para>
                    <para>The proposal, though innocent enough in itself to all appearance, created grave misgivings when considered in conjunction with previous arbitrary and tyrannical acts of the present Government. </para>
                    <para>The history of the last ten years shows how deeply Australian officialdom sympathizes with the methods, if not the aims, of Fascist government,&#34; he continued. &#34; We know how Germany has treated religious organizations and leaders, and the same tendencies which have led to religious persecution in Germany are active in government circles and behind the schemes of Australian government to-day. </para>
                    <para>The register is to be condemned, moreover, because it is one more invasion by officialdom of that sphere of private life which must he kept inviolate if humanpersonality is to develop. The proposed nation-wide inquisition is an attempt to violate that sanctuary of individual life, wherein alone true religion can take root and flourish. </para>
                    <para>The pre-requisite of religion is liberty of individual conscience and action. . Political and religious liberty stand or fall together, and their price is eternal vigilance. </para>
                    <para>Will Christian people be vigilant enough to see in the national register a threat, not only to their political freedom, hut to their religious liberty as well ? </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">That is not the opinion of , a red-ragger or of a member of the Labour party. It is the considered view of a gentleman who, obviously, is a serious student of political trends in Europe and elsewhere; and as such it should be noted. I may not agree with everything that the reverend gentleman said, but I repeat that this measure has created in the minds of various sections of the community a. fear that it is the forerunner of other legislation to undermine our democratic institutions and institute a form of government described under the generic term of Fascism. </para>

                    has told us that this bill is an innocent proposal; that there is nothing sinister in it and that it will not hurt any one in the community. He has endeavoured to persuade us that the only purpose which the Government has in mind is to obtain information. The honorable gentleman referred in some detail to the first schedule and asked what objection could be taken by any person answering the questions contained in it. I admit that many of the questions are unobjectionable.

Simply because <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> believes that I played some part in persuading honorable senators on this side to leave the chamber while he was speaking, he called for a quorum, knowing that many of his own party were out of the chamber. I ask that the facts be recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> so that the people will know why so many ministerial senators had left the chamber. </para>

                        <para>- If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> was allowed to make certain untrue statements surely I should be given an opportunity to refute them. So long as this little political game is understood, I do not mind playing up to our friends opposite. They have had a victory on this occasion, but there will be other occasions when they will not do so well. This incident will make known to the public the childish stupidities indulged in by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein.</inline> Our good friend, the Solon from Sydney, quoted at length t he questionnaire that is included in the bill.I hold in my hand the census paper for the 30th June, 1933. I find therein that questions are asked regarding the name of the individual making the return, the sex, the relation to head of the household, number of dependent children, orphanhood, duration of marriage, whether any members of the household are deaf, dumb or blind, where the members of the household were born, and, if born elsewhere, the period of residence in Australia, race, nationality, religion - that is not compulsory - foreign languages, schooling, and was service. The 17th question deals with occupation, and asks for information as to whether members of the household are engaged in wheat-farming, coal-mining, contracting, woollen mills, retailing, banking, law, &#38;c, &#38;c. Information is also required as to craft of each person engaged in industry, and grade - if working on own account without paid assistants. Information is also asked as to whether any members of the household are unemployed, and if so, the time lost, and the cause of unemployment. </para>

The Minister who introduced the bill, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> have said that this bill provides merely for the taking of a simple census similar in every respect to the census taken in 1933. If the Government wants a simple census why not take a census similar in every respect to that taken in 1933 If that were done it could obtain all the information desired without arousing fears in the minds of the people. </para>

                        <para>- They have already been aroused. Various organizations throughout the country are holding meetings to discuss this measure. Resolutions have been passed at those meetings to the effect that if the bill becomes law direct action will be taken to prevent its provisions from being enforced. The workers have said that they will not wait for a parliamentary majority to be given to the political party which represents them in this Parliament. It is obvious that there is something more behind the bill than the innocent &#34; babes in the wood &#34; opposite would have us believe. We are told that it is for the definite purpose of securing necessary information in order to enable this country to&#39; be prepared to meet an emergency. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> says that it is an innocent measure; but outside there is a furore against it. The people&#39;s suspicions aro aroused. They remember the past tyrannical actions of the Governments of the same complexion; they know the present Ministry is composed of selfconfessed conscriptionists, and that it has for its leader a clever lawyer. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies,</inline> the leader of the present Government, is a highly- capable man. . He is a King&#39;s Counsel, and has frequently appeared, very often successfully, in the courts of the land. A brilliant lawyer may plead any cause equally convincingly. Only those with limited mentality cannot argue both sides of a question. The clever lawyer can take either side and very often come out successfully. Quite a number of honorable senators on this side of the chamber have dealt with the bill clause by clause, and have shown that, once the National Registration Board has been set up under the aegis of the Department of Supply and Development, it is possible that regulations derogatory to the best interests of the workers will be promulgated. The workers are not exactly fools; they have had experience of to ry politicians in the past. They have had experience in the industrial arena of working conditions being broken down by unscrupulous employers operating under a government unsympathetically disposed towards the workers. My experience as a worker has taught me to be suspicious of the employers as a class; such is the fight for profits that often workers are unscrupulously exploited and deceived by their employers. Is it any wonder, then, that the workers are fearful and suspicions of this bill, despite what they have been told in regard to it by our friends opposite? They know that if this bill be passed by the Parliament it will be a step towards the fastening of the shackles of conscription upon them. </para>

                        <para>- Not necessarily. Belief is a psychological state of mind that does not depend exact.y on facts. Honorable senators opposite have many political beliefs; but they are not based on facts. We, on this side of the chamber, have a certain psychological outlook, a certain mentality which enables us to base our actions on real facts. What is the cause of that? Is it because men who have been through the industrial arena, who have earned their living with their own hand - artisans, miners, sailors, farmers, and workers generally - are realists? They are not given to flights of the imagination; they are accustomed to dealing with the facts of life. During the course of my life I have been an active worker in no less than 35 different occupations, as the result of which I have gained considerable experience. I always seek to get down to the facts, and do not allow my imagination to run away with me. Honorable senators opposite suffer through lacking the experience gained by working men. When certain resolutions are passed at gatherings of workers, they are based not so much upon imagination as upon cold, hard fact. The workers know only too well the struggle and fight they have to endure for a living; they know what it means to be unemployed; they know what it means to be exploited ; but, above all, when it comes to fighting a war, they know very well that they are the very people who will have to bear the brunt of the bloody struggle. </para>

                        <para>- What U wrong with that? Do you object, sir, to the use of the words &#34; bloody struggle&#34;? If so, I repeat them, and say that the workers know only too well that they will have, to bear the brunt of the bloody struggle of war. I would like to express myself in even stronger terms if I were permitted to do so. Many of the workers who know the horrors of war do not want this measure, which, they fear, may lead them to further enslavement. The bill itself may appear innocent enough, but, having regard, to the calibre and past actions of the men responsible for its introduction, the workers believe that under it, action may be taken to destroy the democratic principle which they value so much. We are told that for the purpose of organization the Government must have the information sought in the schedule. First, there are questions relating to nationality.  Within  a few hours a bill providing foi&#39; the registration of aliens which has already passed this chamber will be passed by the other branch of the legislature. If all aliens be registered, as they will be when that legislation becomes law, what need will there be for the information concerning nationality set out in the questionnaire? How far is it proposed to go in the direction of adding to something that already exists ? Another question relates to dependent relatives. Why is it there? I believe that there is a reason for these things. Is it possible that, when conscription comes, a man with, say, ten dependants will be exempted ? There was a census in 1933 and another census will Lc taken shortly. The Government already knows about the blind, and dumb, and maimed in the community; yet this schedule contains a question relating to them. How much better prepared to resist an aggressor should we be if the information contained on this form were known to the Government? If, instead of all this &#34; bally-hoo &#34; and &#34; boloney &#34;, the Government directed its energies to the real defence of Australia, it would be doing something worth while. I imagine that, in their present state of mind, many persons in the community will not answer the questions truthfully. But even if all the questions be answered truthfully, I do not think that the answers will be of any value in strengthening our defences. In order to divert attention from its sins of omission and commission, the Government seeks to create a state of nervous tension by its talk of the imminence of war. Perhaps it is part of a great game of bluff, a matter of political expediency. The Government is in a constant state of uncertainty. It has no majority in the House of Representatives; it is shot at from, right and left by the Country party and the Labour party; and in order to continue in office, it has to divert the minds of the people from the facts. We consider that Australia is a democracy, but, in my opinion, there is no true democracy anywhere in the world. Democracy implies equality of opportunity. It certainly presupposes economic security for every man, woman, and child in the community. In Australia and in other countries also that security does not exist for thousands upon thousands of workers. The first duty of an organized State is to see that the masses of working men and women and their dependants shall have security of livelihood. That cannot be said truthfully of thousands of our fellow citizens in this country. Whenever jobs are advertised the applicants far exceed the number of nien required. In our large cities there are thousands of men, women and children insufficiently clothed, insufficiently housed, and ill-nourished because they are on the dole through lack of employment. Even in Canberra, there are some of the worst slums in any part of Australia. Before we talk glibly of responsibility, and the need for every man to do his duty by the State, the State should do its duty by the individual. We have reached a stage in our economic development when thousands of our fellows can no longer find a place in the industrial life of the country. It is not sufficient to say that men should have more initiative, - that, furnished with a tin of treacle and a. bag of flour they should go out into the bush in order to make a living for themselves. Modern life is such that many young men to-day lack the enterprise and initiative which their forefathers exhibited. There would be as much justification for condemning a lunatic for being a lunatic as for condemning a city worker for lack of initiative in not seeking work in a country district. If it be true that there are thousands throughout Australia who have no jobs, and are so. insecure economically that they are dependent on charity or a government dole, how can we ask them to accept responsibility? We cannot do so fairly. If the Government were sincere, long before this it would have had a register of the workers, both employed and unemployed, as well as the periods of employment. That register would have been compiled in order to find out how men who have Been out of work could be placed in industry and enabled to earn a livelihood. What a splendid thing it would have been for Australia if the community had been &#39; organized in that direction ! </para>

                        <para>- It would not matter to me whether the register were compulsory or voluntary, so long as the information was obtained. What a splendid instance of Christian ethics it would be to find a community so actuated by great ideals that before men were asked to register their names with a view to fighting, they were given employment and the means of earning a livelihood! I have been fighting ever since I was a lad of fourteen for these things. I have spent a lifetime advocating them. By so doing I have gained no economic benefit for myself, because time after time I have been thrown out of employment. I have worked in mines, on railways, on board ships, on farms, and in many industrial establishments, all the time spreading the gospel of Labour. I have spent a lifetime in promulgating Labour&#39;s principles, and I have a right to be heard in regard to these matters. If every man were part and parcel of the community, not only politically, but also economically, how different things would be .&#39; We have political freedom in that every person over 21 years of age has a vote; but why do we deny to some individuals their economic rights? Instead of men being mere bundles of energy, to be offered for sale on the economic market, how much better it would be if every man, woman and child was regarded by the community as being entitled to proper food and clothing ! In such circumstances, it would be right to impose compulsion upon every man to do certain necessary work in the community either as an industrial unit or as a military unit. That is my stand. I am not opposed to compulsion if, first there be a change of the economic relations in society so that every man, woman and child is provided for, and is recognized as a unit deserving of the best that the community can give. I am not a pacifist in the ordinary sense of the term. I do not turn the other cheek to the aggressor. Bather am I like the old Quaker who first carried out the biblical injunction,  but later used his boot with good effect. I do not contend that compulsion is wrong in al&#93; circumstances. Compulsion is not necessarily wrong. </para>

                        <para>- Compulsion is sometimes necessary, especially in a growing community. In the training of children compulsion is necessary. In education, compulsion has to be used. There was a time when parents would not allow their children to be educated. As a result, compulsion had to be exercised. There is nothing wrong in that, hut the gentlemen who deal with these matters attempt superficially to relate compulsion in regard to education with compulsion of people, against their conscience, to fill in cards to be used for war purposes. Men on the Government side, representing the dominant class, would put a dog-collar on the workers, such as was worn by the slaves of ancient Rome. They would probably like to see every worker wearing a brass collar and a number. They talk about patriotism and the good of Australia, hut they desire the workers to he kept in a state of servitude. Above all, they wish to have the workers so regimented that their services may be used at the lowest possible cost. Their slogan seems to be, &#34; Give us cannon fodder at the rate of 6d. or ls. a day&#34;. This measure may be innocent in itself, but I regard it as the first step towards the organization of the workers so that they will be available as cheap cannon fodder. </para>

That is why the Australian soldier achieved unique distinction on the fields of Gallipoli and Flanders. Honorable senators opposite desired, some time ago, to bring in a measure to make the working man pay for his own invalid and old-age pension, because it was said that the pensions bill had become too high. The richest man who has ever sat in this Senate was one of the strongest opponents of the old-age pension, and, if he had had his way, not a penny qf pension would have been paid to any poor old slave who had spent his life in working for the community. </para>

                <para>The Labour party claims that there should be industrial and economic, as well as political, freedom. If it be necessary to enlist an army of fighters, they should be paid for their services. The industrial soldiers have the advantage of awards of the courts. Some of them are injured and killed in the course of their employment on the battlefield of industry. They are often broken in body and spirit, and many of them are afflicted with lung trouble. They go from job to job, and, although they are being exploited, they value their freedom. I see no reason why a man&#39;s pay should be cut down when he joins the Army. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> advocated a standing army of 20,000, but the cry was raised, &#34;Just imagine paying for all those soldiers. What an expense it would be. We cannot afford it&#34;. This shows that members of the party opposite are conscriptionists at heart, and desire to be little Hitlers and Mussolinis.

                    <para>.- I regret that this bill has been brought before the Senate. Whilst I believe that the Minister in Charge of War Service Homes <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett)</inline> is deeply interested in this matter, I am afraid that the bill is not such a simple and harmless one as his second reading speech might lead us to believe. Honorable senators opposite who have spoken about industrial matters appear to know very little concerning them; a lifelong experience as a trade unionist is necessary to enable one to appreciate the severity of industrial conditions. The Minister said, in the early part of his speech - </para>

                    <para>The object of the measure is to provide for the taking of censuses for the purposes of national registration, and for the establishment of a national register. This is ancillary to the expanded defence programme of the Government, and marks a further step towards the completion of plans for all phases of national activity in an emergency. The intention of the Government to press on with this work was pointed out by the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> in a speech made by him early in 1938, when he said that the aim of these plans was to provide for the parts that could be played by every organization, industry and citizen, either in respect of their normal work in the life of a community, or by special voluntary effort. </para>

                <para class="block">In 1937, when the Government appealed to the people, it was returned upon the policy of no conscription or compulsory military training. That policy was advocated on every platform. Now that the party is in power it is trying to bring in conscription. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> referred to Trades Hall officials. Apparently he imagines that he has complete knowledge of them. He may know, the building, but if he spoke of the workers there as he does here he would be thrown out. He knows no more about the Trades Hall than the hen which hatched a setting of duck eggs knew about the ducklings when they took to the water. The proposed register is an absolute slur on the people of Australia. During the last war 370,000 men volunteered without a word being said about conscription, and they proved to be the finest soldiers that went overseas. </para>

                    declared that with the introduction of this bill the Government was fulfilling its promises to the people. When were those undertakings given? The conscript cannot be compared with the volunteer. I have been a union secretary for a number of years, and I say that a worker who is forced to join an organization cannot be trusted. Those men and young women who are employed in shops and who come forward and voluntarily join a union can be trusted. This bill should be thrown out, just as measures have been thrown out of the windows of the Legislative Council in Western Australia. I am sure that 90 per cent. of the people of the Commonwealth are opposed to the bill. I congratulate the Leader of the Opposition on his remarks.  His  appeal to the Government and his description of the dismay that the passing of the bill would cause were worthy of the serious notice of the Senate. I have heard members speak in different Houses of Parliament, but I have never heard a better effort.

                        <para>- It is .a man&#39;s service that counts, not mere protestations of patriotism. This bill will be used for purposes similar to those for which the English measure was used. Men who had come home after the retreat from Mons preferred to return to the trenches in Flanders rather than engage in the filling of shells with high explosives. I have seen them led out blinded through the filling of shells. Yet, Government supporters talk about sheltered occupations, and munitions workers receiving &#163;10 or &#163;12 a week. </para>

                        <para>- I am opposed to these young men being compelled to fill in these census forms. Many boys have been guilty of committing small offences, and some of them have been compelled to go to the police court to answer insignificant charges. Such boys are deprived of the opportunity to serve Australia in either the navy or the air force, and the regulations prohibiting them from doing so are wrong. Boys who have been branded in this way have a grievance. </para>

                        <para>- I am referring to that clause of the bill which requires young men under the age of 21 years to furnish certain information to the Commonwealth Statistician. Obviously it is the intention of the Government to use this bill to enforce industrial conscription upon the country. And the bill is a preliminary to conscription for military service. When the late Prime Minister met his Cabinet in Hobart some months ago, the proposal at that stage was for a. voluntary national register. But the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has always been a strong advocate for compulsory military training; hence our fear that under this bill we shall have industrial conscription. </para>

                        <para>- And we shall have it in Australia if this legislation passes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> has often boasted that he topped the poll at the general elections in 1934. Need I tell him that it may be easy to fool the people once ? I am sure that he will not be able to fool them a second time. I will, however, say to the credit of the honorable gentleman that up to the present he is the only member on the Government side who has had anything to say in answer to the criticism of honorable senators on this side. No social legislation designed to improve the conditions of the people has ever been introduced by governments of the same political colour as this Administration. Despite all that the Minister and his supporters may say about the desire of the Government to do something for the workers, about the only thing which Nationalist governments have done has been to bring in legislation such as the Transport Workers Act in order to penalize workers who dare to stand up for their rights. This measure, we believe, will lead to industrial conscription. It contains provision for certain penalties to be imposed on persons who fail to furnish information in the prescribed form. Yesterday when we were dealing with a complementary bill, and were discussing particularly the proposal to limit and control profits, it was significant that no penalty was suggested by Government members for evasion by manufacturers of that law. If this bill be passed, as I have no doubt it will be, it will be because of instructions given to the Government by its masters, the capitalist and monopolistic interests in this country. </para>

                    <para>. - As a freedom-loving Australian, I believe that I should say something in opposition to the passage of this bill, despite the conciliatory attitude of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett)</inline> who introduced it. The honorable gentleman almost persuaded us that it could be accepted without discussion. But unfortunately for the Minister, the ancillary bill which came to the Senate from the House of Representatives, where it was passed with the aid of the guillotine, was suddenly subjected to the same treatment here last night. In the circumstances, is it a matter for wonder that honorable senators on this side are suspicious of this measure? Surely the bill which was passed yesterday by the guillotine and the one now before us merit full debate. The use of the guillotine should not be necessary. Because of the attitude of Government supporters, the people of Australia will readily believe that there is something sinister in this measure. I agree with the view expressed earlier in the evening that this bill is a slur on the people of Australia, especially upon the young manhood of this country, and I subscribe to the opinion that it will lead to some form of industrial conscription as well as compulsory military service. Honorable senators opposite have asked where provision is made in the bill for that. My authority for that is the statement of SenatorCollett that nothing less than organization on the following scale would give a democratic State a degree of preparedness comparable to that of an authoritarian State :  - </para>

It is provided in the bill that the National Registration Board shall be established, and shall consist of three members, one of whom shall be a representative of the Defence Department. Honorable senators opposite have suggested that we need not fear any interference on the part of the military authorities in the deliberations of this board. We have suggested that it will be possible, if this measure becomes law, for that militarism which we so abhor in other countries to be introduced into Australia. The very fact that one of the members of the board is to be an officer of the Defence Department lends weight to our contention. </para>

                        <para>- Another member of the board is to be a representative of the Department of Supply and Development. The board is to exercise such powers and perform such duties as are conferred upon it by this bill or by regulations. If this board is to do nothing but deal with the register, what necessity is there for its establishment? Why set up for the collection of this information an organization additional to that which already exists under the Census and Statistics Act ? A census of the Commonwealth is taken every ten years by the Commonwealth Statistician, whose staff is competent to undertake the compilation of all information sought in this bill. Honorable senators opposite have told us at great length that this measure proposes nothing more nor less than the taking of an ordinary census of the people: If that be so, why is not the Commonwealth Statistician entrusted with the work? Why is it necessary to call in the aid of an officer of the Defence Department and another officer of the sister Department of Supply and Development? The very nature of the constitution of the board exposes the desire that lies behind the measure which it is sought so adroitly to foist upon the people of this country. We can carry on with the means which we already have at our disposal. There is also to be appointed to the board an executive officer who, subject to the control of the board, shall exercise and perform such powers and duties as the board directs or prescribes. We all know that when the War Precautions Bill was introduced in this Parliament it appeared to be a very innocuous measure. All the members of the then Labour Government who spoke in support of it were warned of the power which it would place in the hands of the Administration. Not very long after, those who were instrumental in bringing that measure into operation had it used very effectively against them and the organizations which they represented. One would have thought that this Government, in introducing a measure of compulsion, would have studied the characteristics of the people against whom it is to be directed. The average Australian abhors compulsion. Our history is a record of fighting against compulsion and oppression. The very fact that this country is peopled by freedom-loving people to-day is because in its early history people came to these shores in order to evade oppression in the older countries of the world. Just as his predecessors in years gone by put up a fight at Eureka for freedom, the Australian of to-day will be prepared to defend the principle of the liberty of the subject. It is rather remarkable that every attempt to whittle away the freedom of the people has been made by stealth. That is what is happening in this bill to-day. The people are being told that there is nothing in this measure of which they need be afraid ; but once it becomes law they will know to their sorrow what it really means. Some reference has been made to the fact that a Labour government was responsible for the introduction of compulsory military training in this country. That is true, and it is equally true that honorable senators on this side of the chamber are the lineal descendants of the government responsible for the introduction of that system. It is true also that there are on this side of the chamber to-night men who at. the time that system was introduced were active in the counsels of the Labour movement. The Labour government of the day believed that it was necessary for the defence of the country to introduce the compulsory military training system. The Labour party listened to the blandishments of those who were endeavouring to foist compulsion upon it. It is rather remarkable that the great foe we were taught to fear in those days is the same foe as, we are told, threatens our security to-day. Much was made then as now of &#34; the yellow peril &#34;. A picture was also painted of what was likely to happen to this country if it came under German control. In the circumstances which we thought then existed, the Labour movement introduced compulsory military training. We were foolish enough to believe that the type of compulsory military training introduced and administered by the Labour government would be democratic in form and that, under it the awfulness of the German military system, as we knew it then, would never be known. Not long afterwards we found that we had made a  grievious  mistake.&#39; Honorable senators on both sides of this chamber, who took an interest in the operation of the compulsory military training system, know that the detention camps in this country were filled with mere boys who had had no say in the election of a parliamentary representative or in the making of the law, and who had refused to undergo military training. Then the awfulness of that militarism which we had so much abhorred in other countries was unmasked. I have a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Conscription under Camouflage; Compulsory Military Training in Australia,</inline> from which I propose to quote one or two paragraphs which I regard as apropos the matter we are now considering. Certain clauses of this bill lay down penalties for breaches of its provisions. There is, for instance, a clause which demands that youths between the ages of 18 and 21 years shall report their movements. They are required to notify the authorities of changes of address. These are lads df the same age as those who came under the provisions of the Defence Act relating to compulsory military training. The book to which 1 have referred gives the following summary of prosecutions launched under the Defence Act in connexion with breaches of the law relating to compulsory military training- </para>

Pethybridge, secretary to the Department of Defence, to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Arthur</inline> Watts, the organizer of the Australian Freedom League. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> will accept them as being authentic. When members of the Labour movement voted for compulsory military training, they did not think that such things would ever occur in this country ; but they found militarism in all its ugliness unmasked. The thought of what would happen under a government not so democratic causes one to shudder. I know of one case in which a young man taken compulsorily into camp in Western Australia was thrown from a horse in front of a body of laughing officers and received a broken spine. Although crippled for life, he received only &#163;191 as compensation. In many instances lads were punished by being sent into camps and supplied with only bread and water for food. There were scores of such cases. Yet those same lads who objected strongly to compulsion enlisted willingly when war broke out. Thousands of them rallied to the colours. They resisted compulsory training, not because they were cowards or shirkers but because inherent in them was a feeling of rebellion against compulsion. The same thing will happen again under this legislation. In preparing this measure, the Government has failed to recognize the calibre of the people of Australia. If Australia were either invaded or threatened with an invasion men would rally to the defence of their country in such numbers as to make compulsion unnecessary. Last year, during the September crisis when the </para>
                <para class="block">Prime Minister, acting on the advice of military experts, said that the militia force would be increased, the response was immediate. Australian youths rallied to the call, and before long more than sufficient had volunteered to meet requirements. It is well known that to-day thousands of young men are willingto enlist, but the wherewithal for their training is not available. </para>

                        <para>- That sounds all right ; but the leader of this &#34; promising &#34; Government which came into office as the result of an unfortunate occurrence, promised that he would never agree to the  throwing  overboard of the greatest piece of social legislation that this country has ever seen. To-day he is preparing for its abandonment. Although there is now in the bill provision for the taking of a census of wealth, if will be impossible to achieve the objective that the Government has in mind. The bill that was passed yesterday, and which is ancillary to this measure, ostensibly provides against profiteering. For a similar reason the measure now before us contains a most wonderful schedule. All that will be necessary on the part of the wealthy section of the community - those who possess property valued at over &#163;500 - will be to fill in this schedule, and show what wealth they possessed at the 30th June, 1939. The question which they will be asked to answer reads, &#34; What was the approximate value of the real and personal property owned or held by you on 30th June, 1939?&#34; I should like to know what is proposed for 1940 and succeeding years during the life of this legislation. Will it be necessary for those who are required to supply this information to notify the department of any change of address? Will it.be necessary for them to submit another return in 1940? </para>

                        <para>- That is one of the clauses to which the Opposition objects. It allows the Minister to do certain things. We on this side are confident that the board will not receive any instructions from the Minister to act in the direction that I have already indicated. Something has been done in this connexion, but so far as this measure is concerned, I claim that it will be impossible to eliminate profiteering. In a previous debate, several honorable senators went to much trouble to show that profiteering had occurred in certain branches of industry. We know that the talk of preparations for war has caused some industrial stocks to rise to peak prices that have not been equalled since the last war. The experience of those days should be sufficient to .convince the Government that its present proposal  would  not enable it to keep track of all profits. </para>

                <para class="block">I draw attention to an essay published in the <inline font-style="italic">Encyclopaedia of the Social Sciences,</inline> over the signature of Ida Craven  Mirriam,  who dealt with the difficulty of tracing profits. &#34; Profiteering &#34; is a term of opprobrium that came into wide use during the last war, but it is on record that unsuccessful efforts were made to prevent even the early Roman generals from profiteering. Yet honorable senators opposite are so trusting as to imagine that excess profits could be prevented under this measure. The American writer to whom I have referred points out that the average profits of the steel companies were 4.7 per cent, in 1912, 2.8 per cent, in 1914, and 24.9 per cent, in i917. Extensive profiteering was found to have been practised in the packing industry, and examples of excessive gains were discovered in other industries. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and little notice was taken of it; but, when it was observed that profiteering was being practised against the people of the United States of America, an effort was made to prevent it. Even in Germany, a careful tabulation published in 1918 by Fuchs Rudolf indicated similar conditions in trade and industry there. For instance, the gross profits, expressed as a percentage of the share capital of a selected list of sixteen mining and steel companies, ranged in 1912-13 from 13 per cent, to 65 per cent., and in 1916-17 from 35 per cent, to 2.19 per cent. ; but, since increases had not occurred proportionately, the increase of gross profits in 1916-17 over 1.912-13 ranged from 18 per cent, to 467 per cent., whilst the increase of average profits in the 1914-17 period over the average for 1910-13 ranged from 33 per cent, to 846 per cent. I could cite further examples of such profits. An interesting work by J. A. Hobson, <inline font-style="italic">Taxation in the Nev; State,</inline> contains the following interesting information at page 170: - </para>

                    <para>To these must be added innumerable other minor profiteers taking advantage of war shortages to raise prices to extravagant heights on pretexts of dear materials and labour. Several reports of government committees reveal the huge profiteering done by many business firms in their dealings with the Government, especially with the Ministry of Munitions. But careful analysis, were it possible, would probably show that the biggest aggregate of profits were made by ship-owners, brewers, farmers and bankers. No published accounts give any true notion of their dimensions, which lire concealed by various devices. The case of ship-owners is particularly flagrant, and has been brought before the public by statements of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leo</inline> Chiozza Money, whoso official position us a secretary to the Ministry of Shipping gives authority to his revelation. &#34; In the first two years of the war the net profits of British ship-owners came to about &#163;300,000,000. In the same time the capital value of British ships rose by another &#163;300,000,000&#34;. In respect toships sunk by the enemy, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Leo</inline> informs us that &#34; the Government paid out to ship-owners the war price ofships &#34;, thus converting into cash these enormous war profits. It is important to realize that the bulk of the profits here indicated never figured as income and never contributed a penny to war taxation, either under the bead of income tax or excess-profits tax. They wore an addition to capital values attributable entirely to high freights and sinkings. These huge fortunes of ship-owners came out of the misfortunes of war. </para>

                        <para>- I realize that the Minister would like me to desist from making references that he finds unpalatable. I have endeavoured to awaken honorable senators opposite to the fact that a measure of this description should not be rushed through the Parliament without mature consideration. The bill should not have been introduced in its present form. It has been gradually evolved since the last elections, when the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> emphatically denied that he and his party stood for compulsory military service. In September last, when he still had some Labour sentiments left, he again declared that his Government would not stand for compulsion. Almost immediately after his death the claim is made that this measure is a corollary of his statement. it is unfair to the memory of the former Prime Minister for senators to endeavour to maintain that he stood for compulsion. At the time when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> made those remarks there were &#34; soolers &#34; for compulsory military training, and there are still some. There will always be some, notwithstanding any effort made by the community to preserve itself. The Parliament of the United Kingdom has been forced to agree to compulsion, not because its members desired it, or believed that it was necessary, but because they were compelled by a foreign power to place the necessary legislation on the statute-book. So there is pressure behind this measure just as there was in the Old Country, where the Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> was obliged against his better judgment to declare in favour of conscription. Pressure is being brought to bear in a similar way on those who are controlling the destinies of the Commonwealth. The Labour senators have been asked why they fear industrial conscription. We do so because we know that those who are guiding this Government are representatives of the big business interests of Australia. The present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has represented those industrial concerns in legal proceedings. Since we know the history of countries where there is despotism, are we not justified in warning the people of Australia against any encroachment on their liberties? The Australians do not need compulsion to rally them to the defence of their country. If they are asked they will respond to the call as a freedom-loving people. They appreciate the great heritage that has been handed down to them, and that tradition should not be sullied by the passing of any law compelling them to prepare to defend their country. The mere submission of this measure brings discredit upon the Government because it is besmirching the name of this great Commonwealth. I hope that honorable senators will at least desist in their efforts to show that the Australians need compulsion to do things that they are prepared to do of their own free will. </para>

                    <para>.- I take this opportunity to refer to a statement made this afternoon by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> regarding British troops in the Great War. I regret that he is not in his place at the moment, but I am sure that he did not mean all that he said.  His  comments will appear in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> and will create a wrong impression in the minds of readers. I recall the momentous days in March, 1918, when 31 German divisions attacked and drove back nine British divisions over 50 miles. Australian and other British troops were hurried down from Belgium to relieve the shattered divisions and restore the broken line. The brigade I commanded was to restore a particular sector of the broken line by stopping the enemy&#39;s onward march near Hebuterne. We got into position after dark on the 26th March. Next morning, I visited the battalion, and I came across small groups of three or four remnants from various British battalions - the Yorkshire Light Infantry, the Lincolns, the Notts, and Derby WestRidings - which had lost their officers and non-commissioned officers. It was about seven o&#39;clock, and they were enjoying hot stew which the Diggers had given them. Isaid, &#34;You fellows must go hack to the village of Souastre, four miles away, and find any other men left from your battalions &#34;. Their reply to me was : &#34; We have had a good sleep and a good feed, and we want to box-on again with the &#39; Aussies &#39; &#34;. That was the spirit of the &#34;Tommies&#34; who had gone through hell for five days and nights. Farther south, where the British and French armies joined, were the second Devons. They had been driven back day after day and night after night, until eventually they stood their ground to prevent the Germans from turning the French left flank. The position was taken over by another unit, and put of a strength of 586 only three answered the roll-call when relieved. This episode is recorded in the French official history of the war. The 9th Scottish division also figured conspicuously in that momentous week, and its deeds stand out in the Great War. It is unworthy of any person to belittle the part that these young Britishers played against crushing odds. The majority of them were youths under twenty years of age, and some were C.3 men, for the United Kingdom had by that time reached the limits of its manpower. I thought that I could not let any belittling remarks concerning our British comrades pass unchallenged without giving my first-hand knowledge. </para>
