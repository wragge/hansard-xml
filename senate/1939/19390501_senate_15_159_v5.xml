          <para>. - As you, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. President,</inline> have already announced, the former Prime Minister, the Right Honorable Joseph Aloysius Lyons, died in Sydney on the 7th April, 1939.  His  death has left a void in our hearts, and many years will elapse before the memory of him will be dimmed. The news of his death, coming as it did so suddenly, was received by the nation with feelings of greatest grief, in which the peoples of other countries shared. Shortly before his death he had presided over momentous meetings of Commonwealth and State Ministers, and, during the course of the journey to Sydney to fulfil a public engagement, he contracted the illness which afterwards proved fatal. I shall not dwell on the circumstances of that illness, or the deep concern of the Australian people when first they learned of its serious nature, or the wave of sorrow that swept across Australia at the news of his death. It is all so recent that no words of mine are required to describe what is so generally known. </para>
        </talk.start>
        <para>On an occasion such as this it is proper, however, that we should recall to mind some of the principal facts of the public career of our late Prime Minister.  His  record of public service is a long and distinguished one. Entering Parliament in 1909 as member for Wilmot in the Tasmanian House of Assembly, he continued to represent that electorate on his election to the Commonwealth Parliament in 1929. He was a Minister of the Crown for lengthy periods in both Parliaments. From 1914-1916, he was Treasurer, Minister for Education and Minister forRailways in the Parliament of Tasmania ; he was Premier, Treasurer, and Minister for Railways from October, 1923, to March, 1924; Premier, Treasurer, and Minister for Mines from March, 1924, to August, 1927; and, from August, 1927, to June, 1928, Premier and Treasurer. In the Commonwealth Parliament, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> in addition to being Prime Minister from January, 1932, to the date of his death, held the following portfolios for various periods: Postmaster-General and Minister for Works and Railways, Acting Treasurer, Treasurer, Minister for Commerce, Minister for Health, Minister for Repatriation, Vice-President of the Executive Council, and Minister for Defence. Such a record of service indicates the extent to which the late Prime Minister had entered into the public life of Australia.  His  Majesty the King had recognized <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons&#39;s</inline> great services to Australia and to the British Commonwealth by appointing him a Privy Councillor in 1932, and by making him a Companion of Honour in 1936. </para>
        <para>In recalling his inestimable services for the welfare of Australia, we do not forget his sterling personal qualities, which won for him a sure . place in the hearts of all those who were privileged to come in contact with him. A man of the people, he knew the aspirations of the people and he remained ever sensible of those aspirations and sympathetically disposed to aid their fulfilment. High office did not spoil him, and he remained to the end the same Joe Lyons as he had been popularly referred to throughout the years. A deeply religious man, he was faithful to the principles of his Church, and both in his private and public life he was ever actuated by Christian motives. I mourn his passing. Opportunities of knowing him more intimately came my way during recent months, and I found that to know the man was but to &#39; increase the regard I had entertained for him. But whilst the loss to Australia of one  of her noblest sons is great, the loss to his helpmate, Dame Enid, and to their- children is irreparable. We sympathize with them in their bereavement, and hope that they will receive all the consolations that it is possible to give in a time- of such great sadness. </para>
        <para>Before concluding this humble tribute to my late leader may I add that, as in the case of Wordsworth&#39;s <inline font-style="italic">Happy Warrior,</inline> he was one - </para>

          <para>- On my own behalf, and on behalf of every member of the Opposition, I second the motion. Once again at the reassembling of the Senate we arc brought face to face with the toll that death takes of those who are engaged in the work of government. That that work becomes increasingly responsible as the days go by is evidenced by the fact that we rarely reassemble after a recess without the proceedings commencing in an atmosphere of great solemnity. Public nien are entitled to a far greater measure of sympathy than is usually shown to those who are engaged in work of such great responsibility and importance that it tends to shorten life. In the face of death we forget our &#34; isms &#34; and our creeds, and join hands and hearts as members of the great human family; at all times and in all lands &#34; one touch of nature makes the whole world kin.&#34; As has been stated by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> the late Prime Minister had qualities which endeared him to all with whom he came in contact. Of those qualities probably the most outstanding were his kindliness and friendliness and a willingness to work and serve according to his lights. The Opposition freely acknowledges that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> never shirked responsibility. It may be excused for taking some pride in the fact that for two-thirds of his long political career the late Prime Minister served as a member of the party which now comprises the Opposition in this chamber. Those outstanding qualities to which the Leader of the Senate has referred were developed while the right honorable gentleman was a member of the party to which we on this side belong.

          <para>- With the concurrence of my colleagues, Senators Johnston and Cooper, I associate the Country party with the motion made by the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay),</inline> and supported in such eloquent terms by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> One could not witness those great gatherings in Sydney and elsewhere in Australia, and see the spontaneous sympathy and sorrow of the people, without realizing that a great man, a great friend, and a great Australian had passed. In the city of Sydney, I saw a vast concourse of people in the park outside St. Mary&#39;s Cathedral, and dense throngs filled the lanes leading to Man of War steps whence the body of the late Prime Minister was conveyed to his native State. One could not but be moved, knowing that every heart that day was beating in reverent sorrow, and in deepest sympathy with Dame Enid Lyons and her family, and realizing that a great man and a great gentleman had passed to eternity. I may be permitted to quote an epitaph, which I think ought not to be lightly applied unless truly deserved. All honorable senators will agree, I believe, that these words of Shakespeare, from <inline font-style="italic">Julius Caesar,</inline> can be applied appropriately to the late Prime Minister : </para>

          <para>- It is with feelings of the deepest sorrow that I rise to support the motion before the Senate. The words of the three leaders who have spoken adequately express our feelings on the occasion of the passing of this great Australian, and the sorrow of members of the Senate is shared by the people generally. For  28  of the  30  years in which the late Prime Minister served Tasmania and the Commonwealth with the utmost zeal, and, may I add, with conspicuous success, it was my good fortune to be associated with him, first as one of the six members who represented the division of &#34;Wilmot in the Tasmanian legislature, and afterwards when he became Treasurer and, later, Prime Minister of the Commonwealth. It is well known to the people of Tasmania that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> represented Wilmot faithfully and well, and was always a staunch advocate of the interests of that State. It is not necessary for me to do more than add my tribute to the sterling worth of the great man who has passed, for the expressions- of regret at his death have been general throughout the Commonwealth. Great as were the tributes paid to his memory in the capital cities, no greater recognition of his worth could have been shown to a public man than that offered in his own town of Devonport. Although the normal population of this town is not over  5,000,  it is estimated that between  20,000  and  25,000  people assembled there to pay their last respect to the memory of this great Australian. With bowed heads they demonstrated their deep regret at the passing of one who had served them well. It is the wish of all of us that Dame Enid and her family may find some consolation in these sincere expressions of sympathy. </para>

        <para>By the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker,</inline> as the result of a motor car accident in Brisbane a few weeks ago, the House of Representatives has lost one of its youngest members. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker</inline> had been a member of the Commonwealth Parliament since  1931  when he was elected as member for Griffith. He had won the admiration of all by reason of the energy and devotion he displayed in carrying out his parliamentary duties. In order to perform these duties the more efficiently, he had entered on a course of legal studies, and it is not too much to say that he gave promise of rising to further heights in the public life of this country. A keen debater, he fought hard for the cause he had espoused. The loss to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Baker</inline> and her small daughters is great. We extend to them our sincere sympathy. </para>

          <para>- I can say truthfully that I knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Baker</inline> from his early childhood. I know how and why he entered public life. I know, as the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has said, how enthusiastically and energetically he carried out his public duties, and I know how great a loss has been suffered by my party, and by Australia, through the sudden cutting off of this young life. I can cite one little incident - though perhaps it was not so little after all - which indicates the nature of the inspiration which sent Frank Baker into Parliament. It may be said that he entered public life because of his resentment of injustice. He was a public servant, and a very young man at that, not then married, when, because of his political activities, it was .sought to banish him from Brisbane to a place in the far outback. The injustice of the proposal was obvious. Young Baker came to see me, and asked my advice. I said to him, &#34; &#34;Well, you have to make the decision. You either accept the transfer, and knuckle under to injustice, or you refuse it, and have to leave the Service &#34;. He said, &#34; I think I shall refuse it, and I will fight for a seat in Parliament, and win it if possible. Then some day I may be able to get a credit entry to balance this debit in the ledger &#34;. . He resigned, contested a seat in the National Parliament, and won it, to become the youngest mem&#39;ber of the House of Representatives. Moreover, he won at his first attempt. That was the spirit that actuated Frank Baker in all that lie did. </para>

        <para>The Leader of the Senate has, I am sure, expressed with great sincerity the feelings of all honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber. Those sentiments are shared by every member of the Opposition in this chamber and in the House of Representatives. To <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Baker,</inline> known to most of us because of her frequent visits to Canberra with her husband, and to her two lovely little girls, it is natural that we should extend our sympathy. Indeed, it would be very difficult and ungracious to withhold it. On can hardly realize what the loss of her husband means to this young woman. I think that the loss is felt even more acutely in such a case, than when the loved one has passed his prime; when, in fact, he has lived his life. Young Baker had undoubtedly a future before him. He was a student of law, and keen in his work, and there is little doubt that, but for this unfortunate accident, he would have made his mark in the public life of the country. At the time he met his death he was returning from a meeting connected with his parliamentary duties. Now his widow and children are left to mourn their loss, and to face a future of difficulty and loneliness, the hardship of which we can all appreciate. I second the motion, and tender to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Baker,</inline> on behalf of every member of the Opposition, our very sincere sympathy. </para>

Entering the Commonwealth Parliament in 1922 as member for Fremantle, he was again returned at the general elections in 1925.

One could not pick a quarrel with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Watson,</inline> for it always takes two to make a quarrel, and he would never make one. Those of us on the Opposition side of the chamber who knew him liked him because of the very kindly and friendly qualities, which he possessed in large measure.

          <para>- On behalf of the Country party senators, and on my own behalf, I join in the tributes paid this afternoon to the memory and work of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Watson. I had the privilege of his friendship for many years. He was a remarkable man. He held the Fremantle seat in the House of Representatives for two periods entirely by reason of his own magnetic personality, and without any party endorsement or financial assistance.When he retired from political life it was of his own accord and not in consequence of defeat at an election. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. William</inline> Watson was a very generoushearted and public-spirited Western Australian. He was not only trusted by the people of Fremantle, whom he represented, and among whom he lived, but he was also very popular personally with the industrial community of that &#39;port. No appeal for persons in distress ever went unheeded by him. He was a very practical friend in time of need to a great many people, particularly at a time when a severe industrial disturbance occurred in the port. Our sympathy goes out to <inline font-weight="bold">Mrs. Watson,</inline> who is still a well-known figure in Fremantle, and also to the other members of the family. </para>

I refer to the Honorable Francis Clarke, who died on the 18th April. Entering the New South Wales Legislative Assembly in 1893, he remained a member of that chamber until 1898, when he resigned. He was again elected in 1900, and retained his seat until his election to the House of Representatives in 1901 as member for Cowper. He was unsuccessful at the general elections of 1903. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke</inline> continued his association with public affairs and was a member of the Royal Commission on the Customs Tariff 1904-1907, and of the Northern Territory Commission of 1913. It is fitting that when death calls those who have played their part in moulding the destinies of Australia, we should remember them and recall some of their more notable public activities. We are appreciative of their efforts, and we deem it a duty to record our regret- at their passing. On behalf of honorable senators, I extend to the members of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Clarke&#39;s</inline> family our sincere sympathy in their bereavement. I move - </para>
