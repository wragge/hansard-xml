                <para> I askthe Minister  representing the Prime Minister whether it is true that deductions are being made from the salaries of officers of the Public Service in order to provide funds for the Bed Cross Society? Is it a fact -that certain officers of the Canberra branch of the Bed Cross organization have made quick visits to Sydney and Melbourne for the alleged purpose of interviewing officers of the central Bed Cross organization, or of attending meetings of that body, and have drawn substantially on Bed Cross funds for expenses, including fares by aeroplane? Are such costs regarded as a fair or necessary charge on funds provided by public subscription, including contributions by public servants? </para>

                        <para>- The goods that have been sold to the United Kingdom Government have been sold f.o.b., which means that that Government has to make arrangements for their transport. The Commonwealth Government has been in constant touch with the British Ministry for Shipping, which is doing all in its power to provide sufficient space to lift the commodities purchased by the British Government. As to apples, barley and wheat, the British Government is not yet&#39; in a position to inform us what vessels will be available, but it has given an assurance that it will do all in itspower to provide as many vessels as possible. As honorable senators know, a good deal depends on happenings from day to day. The&#39; Government appreciates the great difficulties confronting the United Kingdom Government in this matter. </para>

Is the Minister for the Interior able to say whether the States will be required to expend their share of that money oncertain specified works associated with defence, or will they be able to use it as they themselves think fit? </para>

                        <para>- The money has been made available for specific works of a defence nature, of which the State governments have been notified. Some of the works will be undertaken by the State governments, others by municipalities. They are all, however, definitely Commonwealth defence works which will be undertaken in co-operation with the State governments. All of the  proposed works have been approved by the &#39;State governments concerned. </para>

In peace time Fremantle is the only place in Western Australia where auction sales. are conducted.

                    </quote>
                    <para>The provisions of the bill consist broadly of four main, sections. The first embodies proposals relating to the method of determining the order of the Senate groups, and the placing of the names of the candidates on the ballot-papers of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. The second relates to a proposal to simplify the directions on the &#39;ballot-papers and to render formal slightly imperfect votes, and thus reduce the number of . informalities. The third section embodies proposals to extend the postalvoting facilities, particularly by reducing the difficulties experienced by voters in remote districts. The fourth comprises a series of more or less formal machinery amendments to remedy certain omissions in the existing law or to facilitate administration. </para>
                    <para>It is proposed that the order in which the respective groups shall be placed on the Senate ballot-papers shall be determined by a draw publicly conducted &#39;by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer immediately after the close of nominations. It is considered that this will provide&#34; a much fairer method than the existing system of arranging the names of candidates in alphabetical order. Further, it will remove entirely any advantage or handicap experienced by some candidates in the matter of names. It will also check a tendency, &#34; which might develop, of selecting candidates whose names come early in alphabetical order. It is proposed that the names of candidates not included in any group shall continue to appear on the ballot-papers below the groups as at present, but that the order of such names whichhitherto have been placed in alphabetical order shall in future be determined by ballot. The bill also provides that candidates forming a group may, if they so desire, agree upon the order in whichtheir names shall appear in the group and, if they so agree and notify the Commonwealth Electoral Officer accordingly, their names shall be placed on the ballot-papers in such order. As the law empowers candidates to form groups, it seems logical to permit them, if they so desire, to determine the order in which their names shall appear in the group. Where candidates in a group fail to notify any order a draw shall be conducted by the Commonwealth Electoral Officer and the names shall be placed on the ballot-papers in the order drawn. The hill provides that- the system of determining positions on the ballot-paper by a draw shall also apply to candidates for election to the House of Representatives. The Divisional Returning Officer shall in each case, at the . close of nominations, publicly conduct a draw and the names of the candidates shall appear on the ballot-papers in the order drawn. Each candidate will be given an equal chance regardless of name. Candidates will obtain no advantage or suffer no disability if their names commence with the letter A or the letter Z. A candidate named Zacharias- will have the same opportunity as one named Aarons. </para>
                    <para>The bill also contains a proposal designed to reduce informalities by rendering formal ballot-papers which, although not completely marked, comply  substantially with the law. It is proposed, in both Senate and House of Representatives elections, to admit votes where the voter has indicated his preferences for all the candidates except one. It is believed that in such cases it is reasonable to assume that the voter&#39;s preference for the candidate against whose name he has made no mark is his last, and that it would he safe to accept the vote. I propose to move an amendment to provide that the names on the ballot-papers shall be recorded horizontally instead of vertically, so that each group will be given an equal opportunity, and the possibility of obtaining what has been termed a fluke vote may be eliminated. During the scrutiny conducted in the various States after the last Senate election it was found, in some instances, that where the names of twelve candidates appeared on the ballot-paper the voter had shown his preference for only eleven, leaving one square Wank. It was quite obvious that that candidate could only be regarded as the twelfth in preference, and it is therefore proposed that such votes shall not be regarded as informal. Such an arrangement would not favour any party. </para>

It is further proposed, in the case of remote subdivisions, such as, those embracing the Kimberley districts of Western Australia, that resident electors may obtain postal voting papers from the registrar for the subdivision. In the past these papers had to bc obtained from a far-away divisional returning officer. It is also proposed that postal votes received by the returning officer up to seven days after polling day shall be accepted for scrutiny when the returning officer is satisfied that such votes were actually recorded and posted prior to the close of the poll. </para>

                    <para>Two other proposals relating to postal voting are included in the bill. The first- is that the word &#34; elector &#34; in subsection 2 of section 85 of the principal act shall be deemed to include a person enrolled on the roll of electors for the Australian Capital Territory, or the Northern Territory. Thus such a person may witness the postal vote application of an elector of a State who happens to be visiting the territory concerned. At present territory electors are not electors within the meaning of the Electoral Act, and consequently are not qualified to witness the postal vote application of a </para>
                    <para class="block">State elector. The fact that not even the highest official in Canberra is now able to witness the application, although any elector in Queanbeyan can do so, has led to caustic criticism by electors visiting the Australian Capital Territory on the occasion of past elections. The second provision is merely the addition of secretaries of hospitals to the list of authorized witnesses before whom a postal vote may be recorded. The inclusion of such persons in the list has been strongly advocated by the executive committee of the Country Hospitals Association of Victoria, and is favoured by the department. </para>
                    <para>In order to improve the general effectiveness of the electoral law, it is proposed to add two new machinery sections. The first applies to election propaganda broadcast from radio stations conditions similar to those already existing in relation to like matter published in the press. Any such propaganda broadcast during an election, or referendum, campaign must henceforth include the name and address of the author thereof. The second proposal prohibits any officer, or scrutineer, from wearing or displaying in a polling booth on polling day any emblem or badge of a candidate, or political party. This proposal, which is similar to one embodied in the Queensland Elections Act, is considered a logical and reasonable extension of the existing provisions which prohibit, in polling  booths,  the soliciting of votes, the exhibition of any unauthorized sign, or any attempt by a scrutineer to influence any elector in relation to his vote. Its object is to ensure an atmosphere of strict impartiality within the polling booths in order that electors may record their votes absolutely free from party suggestion or influence. </para>
                    <para>I also propose to include an amendment in order to meet a request made by a number of members of this Parliament in relation to organizations which advertise in the press, or issue tickets on which are included names of certain candidates without the permission of the candidates concerned. Many organizations follow this practice which, however, is very often quite unfair to many candidates. The amendment, which I shall move in this direction, will make it an offence for any person, or organization, to include on any ticket the name of a candidate without the permission of that candidate. This improvement is long overdue. </para>

                    <para>Summarized briefly, the proposals are: that the provision iu the law relating to the formal appointment of assistant returning officers at elections be made applicable in like manner to referenda; that the sub-section authorizing the preparation and printing of a supplementary roll for a general election be made applicable also to by-elections and referenda; that the second proviso to paragraph <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> of sub-section (1) of section 47 of the principal act be omitted for the reason that, whilst it now serves no useful purpose, it involves a considerable waste of time, labour and expense which might he profitably employed in other directions; that it he set out in the disputed elections part of the act by whom the petition may be signed, and the period within which the petition may be lodged in the case of a petition disputing the choice, or appointment, of a senator, by the Parliament or Governor of a State under section,15 of the Constitution; and lastly, the substitution of the word &#34; person &#34; for the word &#34; elector &#34; in section 216 with a view to widening the applicability, and ensuring the effectiveness, of the section. This measure is most democratic in that it will give to all candidates, irrespective of party, an equal opportunity at the ballot-box. I feel confident, therefore, that it will be welcomed by the Senate, and will be given, a speedy passage through this chamber. </para>

                    <para>Speaking for the Opposition, it is unnecessary that I should again state in detail the terms of Labour&#39;s defence policy. On the 6th September last, I placed upon record in the Senate a declaration defining where the Labour party stands in relation to this war and its prosecution. That was, as I said then, the unanimous declaration made at a joint meeting of members of the Labour opposition in both branches of the legislature, at which every member was present. Since then, that declaration has been officially adopted in its entirety, and without the slightest alteration, by each State labour political executive in the six States, by the Federal Labour political executive, which consists of delegates from each of the States, and by the Australasian Council of Trade Unions which represents the &#39;whole of the industrial unions comprising it. Upon that declaration, and upon Labour&#39;s platform, after exhaustively reviewing the position in the light of all that has occurred since the beginning of September last, and also considering what is apparently likely to happen in the immediate future, Labour remains unshaken and unshakeable. I have made this definite statement because I desire to eliminate from this debate, as far as speeches from the Government benches _are concerned, any further unjustified and untruthful reflections regarding the policy of the Labour party. In September last, honorable senators opposite heard where Labour stands, and I have shown that this declaration lias been ratified by every section of the working class movement, which the Opposition specifically represents in this chamber. Surely there is no occasion, even in the heat of discussion, to say things which are not - - </para>

                    <para>I suggest that an obligation rests upon each member nf the Senate to examine thoroughly the facts of the position, so far as we have been permitted to know them, so that we may arrive at a calm and balanced judgment. I do not ask for protection from interjections. As far as they are allowed I shall welcome them, but I suggest that it is impossible to come to a calm and balanced judgment if our  minds  are already made up, and we refuse to listen .to reasoned argument, or if we create an atmosphere that will result in recriminations across the floor which, having regard to the serious matters to he considered, appears to me to be undesirable. I submit that we have a very grave responsibility to discharge, as members of the Parliament of a country which is still a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and in which most of us have some regard for democratic and constitutional government. </para>
                    <para>For the purpose of this debate, I shall divide my argument into three sections, each separate, yet together making a constructive whole. First, I shall review the purely Australian situation; secondly I shall deal with the position of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and, thirdly, I shall refer to the international outlook. I do not propose to indulge in criticism merely for the sake of criticizing. If I offer criticism; - and I shall do as I proceed - I desire honorable senators opposite to believe that the Opposition wishes to assist the Government. We desire to help it to prosecute this war to a successful conclusion. In saying that, I do not wish to be told later, as was said last night, that the Opposition has promised to support the Government in anything and everything it does or proposes to do. However, I do mean - and I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> should make a note of this, so that he will not be guilty later of misrepresenting what I have said - that my desire is to assist the Government to prosecute the war to a successful conclusion. I mean that I hope that complete, not partial, victory will be achieved by the democratic forces involved. I mean success and victory through all stages, and in every essential respect, now, during, and after the war, victory and success abroad and at home. Honorable senators will realize the implication of those words. </para>

                            <para>do not intend to paint a word picture of the horrors of war, because that would take up too much time and is more or less unnecessary; but I desire every member of the Senate to realize what this war will involve - if, as the Minister says, it has not yet properly begun - when it eventually gets into its stride. It is difficult to relize what it means. Some of my colleagues of the Opposition, and some honorable senators opposite, were personally engaged in the last great struggle, and it will he easier for them to visualize the implications of war than it is for those who were fortunate enough not to be on active service. It is somewhat difficult, in the first place, to realize the fact that this war, when it gets into its stride, will be more frightful by a hundredfold than that experienced between 1914 and 1918. It is hard to realize it in an atmosphere like that of this chamber, where we are thousands of miles from the scene of conflict. I hope that Australia will always be far from the theatre of war; but the responsibility of trying to visualize what war in 1939 means, as compared with what it involved a quarter of a century ago, is a heavy one. I desire honorable senators to recognize that we are threatened by a catastrophe which, in its final result, may cause the annihilation of civilization and everything forwhich democratic countries stand. Nobody can say what the outcome may be. Nobody can say that victory is certain for one side or the other. Therefore, the things that it is essential for the Commonwealth Government to do, should be subjected to the most careful scrutiny. Think of the destruction of human life, and of wealth - of the death, carnage and hatred that have been liberated again. People who to-day are neutral, and with whom we are now friendly, may, against their wishes, become involved in the struggle. They may be against us, and then we shall begin to hate them. The government directly responsible for the situation in which we are placed has taught its people to hate all other nations, although millions of the people of the country with which we are at war probably regret as much as we do the position into which we have been forced. </para>

                            <para>-That interjection recalls to my mind a speech made on the other side of the world only a. few days ago. We have been accustomed to hearing temperate statements by the Prime Minister of Great Britain <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chamberlain),</inline> Lord Halifax and others; but we heard an outburst from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> a short time ago, and if he did not ask every one of us to hate, insult and to be cruel to the people as well as to the rulers of the country to which I am now referring, I do not know the meaning of words. </para>

                            <para>- I do not wish to enlarge upon it. The Opposition wishes the war to be won on behalf of those who, in most countries, love democracy, liberty and freedom, and all that we mean when we employ those terms; but, while we have that desire, we need not have our hearts so full of hatred of any other nation that we cannot come to a sane and balanced judgment as to the wisdom of the action which we propose to take in the conduct of our share of the struggle. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister is quite right there. I do not think that the Prime Minister, in his public statements or in his speeches in the House of Representatives, can be accused of anything like the conduct of which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> was guilty, but the Prime Minister cannot control the forces in Australia which war has unleashed. We should see that we are not trapped into the same kind of conduct as that which these forces will cause. I mention these matters for particular reasons. Whatever we are forced to do, owing to the exigencies of the situation, we should keep uppermost in our minds the fact that some day the war will end ; and the sooner the better. When the war ends this question of success and victory will have to he decided. It, will not be a success and victory merely because Great Britain and her allies have vanquished their present enemy. Success and victory will be ours only if during the time of this conflict we refuse to give way to passions which war always unleashes in the best of us. and if we resolve now, not a month, a year, or three years hence, to give thought to the things that alone matter. We must resolve that when the time comes to negotiate a peace, when the time comes to establish, a new social order throughout the world, those of us who are left in responsible positions will be equipped mentally for the task which then will become ours. There must never again be a patched-up peace, never a treaty dictated by revenge. These are things which we must scrupulously avoid. We can say now, as good Australians and responsible members of this constitutional parliament, and with all the enthusiam  which we can command, that, when the war ends, we must try to secure a peace that may be celebrated, not once a year as hitherto we have celebrated Armistice Day, but every day because it will be a peace that will ensure. This will be possible if, beforehand, we eliminate from our minds the idea of a peace founded on revenge. .We must have a peace based on justice and righteousness; a peace that every individual of goodwill in every country will he willing to accept. We must seek a peace that will lay the foundation of a new world order. That is the spirit in which I am approaching the consideration of this subject. </para>

                            <para>- I know, but I must not be led astray by interjections in this discussion of a subject of such moment to the world. My own thoughts are fairly well regimented. This is what I want to say : We on this side declare that we are irrevocably opposed to the rule of force; we are irrevocably opposed to the suppression of freedom of thought or speech. I would like honorable senators to remember these declarations. W&#176; stand for the principle of arbitration in peacetime and in wartime. We stand for liberty of thought, of speech and of action. We stand for liberty in all these things, but not licence; for that freedom which recognizes no limit except the full right of all others to enjoy the same privileges, provided, of course, they are prepared to accept all consequent responsibilities. In the declaration of Labour&#39;s policy there appears the statement that the Australian Labour party affirms its traditional belief that all international disputes should be settled by arbitration. I believe that to be one of our war aims, I believe that, in future, we shall be able to press our demand that there shall no longer be an appeal to the cruel arbitrament of war, for the settlement of international disputes ; a decision reached by war can never be satisfactory because it is based on force. I believe that we must appeal to the saner process of arbitration. The words which I am now about to use are not my own. but I would like to read them. I am not aware of the author so I cannot make acknowledgment - </para>

                    <para class="block">It is well-known that negotiations are going on to bring about a settlement of the war in Europe. The Prime Minister indicated that in his statement and I think that his words were repeated by Ministers in this chamber.  Apparently  the Government of the United Kingdom does not at present regard the proposals favorably. I arn not criticizing the British Ministry for that, because I have some idea of the tremendous difficulties which confront it. But proposals have been made by, for instance, Queen Wilhelmina of Holland and King Leopold of Belgium. We have been led to believe, if reliance is to be placed on what we read in the newspapers, that opinion at the Hague - where the League of Nations was established, and to which eventually we must appeal for if the League of Nations ceases to function, we shall have at once, when war is ended, to set up some similar organization - is that immediate results are not expected from the negotiations. We on this side declare that in no circumstances must the door be closed <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> mediation for peace. We must be, at all times, willing to examine impartially every proposal made, so that, if possible, and before the war breaks upon the world in all its cruel virulence, peace may be secured even at this eleventh hour. I know that it is not necessary to impress the seriousness of the international situation on Government supporters or my colleagues, but I would like to place on record some comments of leading world authorities on this grave situation.

                    <para class="block">Now I want to be quite sure that we are not deceiving ourselves and that we shall not fail to realize that when this war ends we shall not return to those social and economic conditions that obtained when it started. In this matter the decision will, of course, rest with those who, for the time beings may be charged with the responsibility of government. We do not fail to recognize that. We have knowledge of some of the problems facing this Government, and the governments of other countries that arc involved in this struggle. But whatever we do during this war we must, when it ends, be prepared for a change in our social conditions. We must face the fact that that change will come by either the evolutionary process or the revolutionary method. If it comes by the latter method, it will b6 engineered by those to whom our present constitutional procedure is anathema. If by the former process, we shall have an intelligent re-organization of society in which all the peoples will be encouraged by the full exercise of the spirit of freedom, which must not be interpreted as licence, to do all those things for which we now stand. Everything as regards that hoped-for new world order depends on what we do now and during the con-  duct of this war. </para>

                            <para>-Whenever there is a war private enterprise, like a vulture, gathers to feast on the carcass. I agree with the Prime Minister&#39;s statement - and I hope that I shall be forgiven for doing so - that it has become increasingly clear that the machinery which was appropriate in time of peace is not only inappropriate, but also inefficient, intime of war. Indeed, I go further, for I say that that machinery has always been inefficient and inappropriate in times of peace. The right honorable gentleman has confirmed tie age-old faith of members of the Opposition. Let me carry the argument a little further, even though I know it will be distasteful to honorable senators opposite. I shall not put up any counter suggestions, because I am not impeaching the Government. I shall hot worry it with any proposals of mine ; I shall not suggest that it should do something different from what it is doing. The Government is the Government, and upon it rests the responsibility to carry on as it thinks fit. After a year&#39;s controversy, which had nothing to do with the war, there has &#39;been among members of the other chamber one long and continuous manoeuvring for political advantage. </para>

                            <para>- During this week the same sordid struggle has been going on, the same political manoeuvring has been in evidence. What does it matter to those engaged in that struggle that this country is facing an emergency caused by war ? To them nothing matters so long as they can prevent an election, and deny to the peoplethe right to say whether or not they endorse what the Government is doing. Did not an honorable gentleman from Western Australia say recently in the other chamber, in a debate associated with one of Australia&#39;s most important industries, &#34; I will make any sacrifice rather than hand this country over to the. Labour party&#34;? He was prepared to sacrifice an important section of the community in order to gain  a political advantage. I tell honorable senators that they cannot do the right thing by Australia in the present struggle unless they put these sordid ambitions out of their mind, and concentrate on how best to come out victorious from the struggle, to limit its duration, and reduce, if possible, the destruction, debt and death which must result from it. In the House of Representatives, as well as in this chamber, the Opposition asked that a committee should be set up to scrutinize proposed war expenditure, so that the country might be assured that value was being received for every pound expended. That request was refused with contumely. I know that I shall be told that boards, presided over by wonderful captains of industry, have been appointed to attend to this and that matter, but I say that not one person appointed to such boards has been placed there to ensure that the common people of the community shall get value for every pound that is expended. </para>

                            <para>- I emphasize that unless we are prepared effectively and ruthlessly to control expenditure, we shall find that the heads of the Navy, Army and Air Force will, as they always . - do in such circumstances, get the bit between their teeth, and spend money regardless of what is obtained in return. I say advisedly that money is being wasted to-day. The Government can appoint whom it likes to these positions, but once the orgy of spending commences, liberty becomes licence, and money is metaphorically poured down the sink. Most persons who get temporary control during wartime spend money regardless of the needs of the nation ; all that they are concerned with is making a splash in an attempt to show that they are worthy of the positions which they occupy. </para>

                            <para>- The Assistant Minister and his colleagues cut a sorry figure last night; and they know it. Their dejected heads and crestfallen looks, to say anything of their crimson blushes, showed that they were ashamed of themselves. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> will have something to say about, the imposing list presented by the Minister for the Interior. I agree with the Minister that, under existing conditions, defence works must, have priority. I feel confident that if the Minister&#39;s notes were available they would not contain any reference to his subsequent statement that they did not mean the abandonment of other works. That was an afterthought. The Minister&#39;s statement that defence works must have priority means, has meant, and will continue to mean a restriction of opportunities for employment in other directions which should never be allowed. </para>

Two years ago the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives said, in definite language and in some detail, that whilst the Army and the Navy had their parts to play, the chief arm of defence for a country like Australia must be a strong air force. At the time, his statement was ridiculed ; but since then every defence authority who has come here from the Old Country, as well as those experts on whose advice the Government is now acting, has repeated it. They emphasize that Australia&#39;s protection must be provided mainly in the air, and also that there is no occasion to send men out of this country to serve abroad. , </para>

I do not propose to go through the whole sordid story which has been told from the opposition benches on numerous occasions, but I ask Government supporters to realize that at the outbreak of war this country would have been  in  an infinitely better position had the Government still been controlling such instrumentalities as the Commonwealth Woollen Mills, the Commonwealth Clothing Factory, the Cockatoo Island Dockyard and the Australian Commonwealth  Line  of Steamers which were established by the Labour government. In 191 6 the Commonwealth Government purchased fifteen vessels for &#163;2,000,000 and by 1921 the profits which had accrued, after writing off the purchase price, amounted to &#163;1,699,000. In the  five  years between 1916 and 1921 the profit derived was &#163;4,826,000. </para>

                    <para>I now wish to direct attention to the treatment which is being meted out to Australian volunteers. Again I desire to assert very definitely that I am submitting facts, not in a spirit of carping criticism but with a desire to assist the Government. I am directing attention to these matters in the hope that the points I am making will be given the consideration which they deserve. In the matter of rates of pay we believe that the men who are asked to defend this country should be treated as fairly as other seclions of the community. On the 6th October it was announced that the rates of pay for the 2nd Australian Imperial Force, or the 6th Division as it is officially known, should be a pre-embarkation rate of os. a day and after embarkation an additional ls. a day in the form of deferred pay. Provision was also made for a separation allowance for all ranks of 2s. 6d. a day for a wife and 9d. a day for each child under sixteen years. The Militia pay for privates was fixed at 8s. a day, which was to be continued for the first 30 days&#39; training, and the pay for the subsequent three months was to be at the same rate as that provided for the 6th Division. There was also to be a separation allowance of 5s., but no married man was to be paid less than S.s. a day. At that time it ,was understood that the men were to be in camp for sixteen days. On the 20th October increased separation allowances for the Army were announced, making the rate 3s. a day for a wife and ls. a clay for each child under sixteen years. It has been stated that the separation allowance of 3s. will only be sufficient in some eases to pay the rent, and a wife will be fairly successful if she can secure suitable accommodation for less. That is a matter to which the Government should give immediate attention. It should also be noted that the Militia pay is made up by os. a day ordinary pay, plus 3s. a day efficiency pay. Separation allowance is not paid to Militia men, and after the first month&#39;s training they will receive the same rate of pay, including separation allowance, as is received by the members of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. In the first instance, the period of training was to be for sixteen days, and the Commonwealth Government decided that it would make up the difference between the civil and military pay of its employees during that time. The period was then increased to one month and then to an additional three months. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> went back on his slogan of &#34; Business as usual &#34; by declining to make up the difference in pay of government employees over the longer period. State governments and other employees immediately followed the lead given by him. Government employees now in camp will not have the difference in their pay made up after sixteen days have elapsed. Why were the men not informed at the outset that they would have to undergo four months&#39; training? </para>

                            <para>- It is not. The Government proposes to conscript for military service youths who will he 21 years of age by the 30th June. The Premier of Queensland, who is known from one end of the Commonwealth to the other, said that the only reason why the Government is conscripting men of that age is to enable it to conduct its part of the war &#34; oil the cheap.&#34; If I could be sure that the Government proposed to treat other sections of the community in the same way as it is treating its man -power, I would not be so critical; but I am not sure on that point. <inline font-style="italic">&#91;Extension of time granted.&#93;</inline> I do not believe that the Government has ever favoured the voluntary system. It has never . endeavoured to make the system a success. About two years ago when an honorable senator who is not in the chamber at present had something to say on this subject I said &#34; Now the cat is out of the bag &#34;. He made a declaration before the Government had done so, and for having made it, I believe, he got a rap over the knuckles. The Government did not wish the voluntary system to succeed ; it preferred that the man-power of this country should be conscripted. </para>

                    <para>Complaints have reached me concerning the treatment of men in camp. I am not unmindful of the difficulties associated with the assembling of large numbers of men, and in making provision for their welfare, brit I believe that these arrangements could have been made in such a way that no one would have been given just ground for complaint concerning the quality of the food and insufficiency of clothing and uniforms. I noticed a report in the press recently that  His Excellency  the Governor-General  on  one occasion inspected a camp and was very interested in all he saw. When he returned to Sydney he made a public appeal for blankets for men in that camp, the weather at that time being very cold. The Government has no excuse whatever for allowing men who are willing to serve, as these men are, to go short of anything essential to provide them with a reasonable standard of comfort. I notice that even in Canberra a local welfare committee has been formed and has appealed for funds in order to provide for some of the men in camp from this district &#34; for clothing necessaries which they cannot personally afford &#34;. </para>
                    <para>I propose now to deal with the Department of Information, and I feel as serious about this as I do about any matter upon which I have spoken to-day. I should like the Minister to tell honorable senators just what need existed for the creation of this department. I think that it is a scandal. I took particular note of its preliminary proceedings, and of the meeting which was held recently in Brisbane. The, Chancellor of the University of Queensland, who is also the Chief Justice of that State, presided. Addressing the gathering the Minister for Information <inline font-weight="bold">(&#39;Sir Henry Gullett)</inline> said that six honorary State councils would be appointed to co-operate with the Government, and branches of the department would be established in the capital cities, provincial cities, and large country towns. He also said that the objective of the department was to disseminate information through every agency open to it. He added that the department knew no party. I should like to <inline font-style="italic">give some</inline> idea of the proceedings at. the meeting to which I have just referred. It was held in a fairly large hall and was attended, I understand, by over 500 representatives of various organizations. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir William</inline> Glasgow moved - </para>

                            <para>- No. It was also stated that these organizations would be grouped according to interests, and would form committees which would elect a small State advisory committee. The organization would be in working order by Christmas. I suspect that these organizations have been formed for two very definite reasons: First, to make on ite sure that every citizen can be rounded up if his neighbour is prepared to spy, or even without spying, report him to the organization should he express opinions which in the estimation of the Department of Information or the Minister or the informer may not be in exact accord with the policy of the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I am glad that the Assistant Minister made that interjection, because I am sure that he could, with very great profit, suggest to <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Henry</inline> Gullett that Trades Hall methods be adopted in this new department because those methods are always open and above-board. No member of the Trades Hall spies on his mates with a view to having him placed in a concentration camp. Yet I have no doubt these people have been got together for that purpose. If there is one thing which the Opposition hates it is censorship, but we recognize that a good excuse exists for the establishment of an official censorship during a time of national emergency. In Queensland we have a censorship board, every member of which I know personally. Not one of them, has the slightest sympathy with the policy of the party to which I belong, but at least they are decent and honorable men. All of them, in fact, held the same positions during the last war. To-day they are doing their job in a far less savage way than they did it in the last war., because they are aware of the different psychology of the people to-day. If they were left alone they would do the job. I repeat that the new Department of Information is an impudent attempt to supersede the censorship boards, for the simple reason that the existing censorship has not been applied savagely. Having regard to the personnel of the new committee established in Queensland by the department, and to other, factors with which I shall deal in a moment, as well as information which I have learned from persons who do not belong to the Labour party, I am convinced that the Department of Information has been deliberately established in order to enable certain officials appointed by the Government to tour Australia on a propaganda campaign in the interests of the United Australia party. I say that definitely, and I shall repeat the statement whenever I get the opportunity to do so. This new department is a governmentconcontrolled an d governmentfinaneec  propaganda. machine for the United Australia party. I take very strong exception to the officials who have been appointed to control this organization. For the information of honorable senators I shall give their pedigrees. They include E. F. Hanman, who has been appointed principal of the Queensland branch of. the department. We have already had one brawl with that gentleman because, so it is alleged by the press, he incorrectly commented upon certain statements made by a member of this Parliament. Although the Department of External Affairs already issues <inline font-style="italic">Current Notes,</inline> and is quite capable of disseminating war information, we have never been able to get anything additional to what we. glean from the columns of the daily press. Despite the ability of the Department of External Affairs to handle war information, the Government has created this new and expensive organization. It is nothing more or less than a Keith Murdoch control proposition, and honorable senators opposite are aware of that fact. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hanman</inline> was connected with the Murdoch press, and so also was P. Jenkin, who has been appointed Chief Censor in Adelaide; whilst C. P. Smith, general manager of the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian,</inline> who is now in charge of the Melbourne office of the Department of Information, was formerly a Murdoch employee. It really means that the public is to be fed on news cooked in the Murdoch ovens and dressed with pro-Menzies sauce, the intention being to create a psychology favorable to this Government, which has proved by its manoeuvring during the last few weeks that it will do anything rather than give to the electors an opportunity to say what they think of its policy with regard to affairs both at home and abroad. </para>

                    <para>Reverting to the treatment of members of the Military Forces in camp, honorable senators on this side have received from the Victorian. Western Australian and Queensland branches of the Commonwealth Public Service Clerical Association very strong protests against the decision of the Government to make up the difference between defence pay and civil pay for a period of sixteen days only, in spite of. the extension of the period of training to four months. While waiting to depart from the interstate station in Brisbane on our return to Canberra last week, Queensland members of Parliament were interviewed by young men who complained of the treatment they had received from the military authorities. These men had come from different parts of the State. At the Militia head-quarters at Kelvin Grove they had been medically examined and given a certificate of fitness. They were then accepted for enlistment, but after they had been three weeks in camp they were again medically examined, declared to be unfit, and dis&#62; charged. I considered that if their state- ments were true the position was very serious. I and other members of this Parliament immediately took an opportunity to place their case before the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street).</inline> I pay a compliment to the Minister. Of all the men handling affairs in connexion with the Army, he is probably the most human and the most approachable.  I referred these complaints to him, and he has done me the courtesy of sending me a reply with the promise to furnish further details later. It appears that these men were suffering from minor disabilities, which should not have debarred them from qualifying for military service. Their complaints could have been remedied after a few days or a week in hospital. Some of the physical disabilities were merely dental defects. The point, however, is that these men were placed in a most unfortunate position. One of them who came from Stanthorpe, 100 miles from Brisbane, told me that he would not go back to hi3 home town. Ee said that the military authorities had turned him out of camp, but had not told him what his disability was. At no time in camp had he paraded sick; yet he was told that he was not wanted-. He said &#34; I won&#39;t go back to Stanthorpe, my home town, because the people there gave me a good send-off, and I could not face them &#34;. The other man said that he could not understand why they had been rejected. The men also remarked that they had their own -working clothes in the camp, and had not been provided with working outfits or uniforms. At the end of three weeks they were turned out, and all they had, apart from the clothes they had taken into camp with them, were a new pair of military boots and a pair of socks each. I told them that, if the facts were as stated by them, they were entitled to compensation. They replied that they did not want compensation, because all that they asked for was the privilege of serving their country. Had they been told in the first place that they might be rejected within two or three weeks this trouble might not have occurred. I hope that the Government will give the same courteous attention to the statement that I have made as was given by the Minister for the Army to representations made to him. One of these men ha3 written the following letter to me: - </para>

We arc getting the benefits already. We have been paid for four days more than we actually served in the Army. We have also been told what our disability was. Most of the men that I know have been discharged for some very slight disability and are being treated for same at the general hospital. My own case was slight scoliosis. The doctor at the hospital said that it was practically nothing. 3!te also told nic that he would fix my legs for mc so that any doctor would pass me, but that takes six weeks. I received the first injection last Friday. This is for varicose veins. We will find some way to live till we are cured. Our only trouble now is, will we get back in the army when we are cured? I have made inquiries, but cun get no satisfaction. </para>

                    <para class="block">These men have only one desire, yet they were treated in a cavalier fashion. It seems that when military officers have large bodies of men to deal with, they cease to be human, and treat the individuals in their charge as merely living units to bo put through their hands according to the approved fashion. </para>
                    <para>I pay to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> the compliment that he takes seriously the responsibility which he has accepted as a Minister of the Crown; but, while making his statement, I thought that he was not altogether happy. Although I may be doing him an injustice in saying that, I believe that he knows that there is not the slightest need to compol any decent Australian to respond to the appeal made for volunteers. Nobody hates war more than I do, but, I do not know that I would not, even at my agc, offer my services to the country if the necessity arose to defend .it. There will be no lack of man-power to defend this country, and it will not bc necessary to ask twice for men. The Government not only has no mandate for introducing conscription, but I do not accept its protestation that it does not intend to go any further than introduce conscription for home defence. I do not believe it any more than I have believed its statements in the last eighteen months that it favoured voluntary service and would not introduce conscription. The Government quibbles whenever the words &#34; compulsion &#34; or &#34; conscription &#34; are used. </para>

                            <para>- One of the main planks of the platform of the Labour party is the abolition of compulsion in connexion with military service. The death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> resulted in the appointment of the new Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies),</inline> who frequently denied any intention On the part of the Government to impose compulsion. First, there was to be no conscription, according to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Menzies.</inline> There was no qualifying remark in that statement. Then we wore told that conscription for service overseas would not be applied. Now we are to have conscription for home defence, and I predict that eventually there will be conscription without qualification. What is the difference between conscription and compulsory military service? The Oxford dictionary defines &#34;conscription &#34; as &#34; compulsory enlistment for military or naval service&#34;. What is the Government doing with regard to men of 21 years of age? Are they not being compulsorily enlisted for military or naval service? Has any one of them been asked whether he desires to enlist? </para>

                    <para>I conclude my remarks by expressing the fervent hope that even at this late hour, war in its most disastrous aspects may yet be averted, not by yielding to the insatiable demands of power-drunk dictators in other lands, but by the efforts of those countries which still love democracy and liberty. To the assistance of all such the Opposition will give its support. But if that cherished ideal is not to be realized, we shall not shirk one jot or tittle of the responsibility, which should be gladly accepted by all of us, of seeing this war through to victory. </para>

                            <para>- All right. I remember the position that obtained prior to federation. At the time of the South African war I had a commission in one of the militia regiments in New South Wales, and I know that the law then, in the different colonies, was exactly the same as the law of the Commonwealth to-day. That is to say, in the event of this country being attacked in war, every male citizen, from the youngest adult up to, I think, men of the age of 60 years, was liable for military service. Why do the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues so consistently overlook this fact? </para>

                            <para>- Why are not the people told the truth? Why do we hear so much of this hogy of conscription? Why are not our people told that if at any time this country be attacked, every  citizen will be liable, under an act that has been in operation since 1903, to be called up to take part in some form of war activity, whether in the front line trenches or in some other sphere, in defence of this country? I ask our friends in the Labour party to be fair and tell the people the truth about this matter. I urge them not to be always covering up this fact, as I submit it has been covered up, whenever any declaration is made on this subject by Labour critics of the Government. </para>

If the need arose the Leader of the Opposition, if not beyond the age of 60 years - aud his appearance and vigour suggest that he is not - would, with me, be liable for military service. This fact ought to be put before the people. </para>

                    <para>I am not an advocate of conscription. I am not in favour of unnecessarily sending Australian troops overseas, and I do not want &#39;to see conscription introduced for that purpose. But  1  think that our friends opposite should face this fact honestly, and tell the people what are their obligations under the existing law. They object, apparently, to what the Govern.men.t is doing to instruct young Australian manhood in military tasks. But would they dare to send them to fight in defence of this country without knowing the first thing about modern military weapons and equipment? Do they not realize that our young men need technical training in order to become proficient in the handling of modern war equipment? And is there anything wrong in saying that they should be trained, so that if, unfortunately, they were called upon to defend this country, they would not be ruthlessly murdered because of lack of knowledge? Who can say, in this dreadful state of international affairs, that Aus-  tralia may or may not have to face such a national emergency? Will anyone dare to boast that we shall pass through. this crisis without being menaced? We are all hoping, of course, that this country will not be threatened, but if it is, we shall feel the more secure if our manhood has had some training in the task of defending it. Our system of compulsory education is, in essence, conscription, and if it is fair to conscript our school children in order to equip them with knowledge to play their part in the civil life of the nation, are we doing a wrong to the manhood in this country when we say that they should receive instruction in the business of defending it? It is positively wrong for our friends opposite to mislead the people on this issue, because there is no threat of conscription. I challenge the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> or the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber to face this issue fairly, either on the public platform or in the press, and tell the people exactly what is contained in the Defence Act. If they do this, and if they produce evidence of an attempt to conscript the manhood of this country for overseas service, we shall have to hang our heads in silence, and admit our error. But there is no such evidence. </para>

Every responsible member of this Government, as did every member of the preceding Government, has given an honorable assurance that no such action is contemplated.

Every member of this Government, every leader of parties on this side in politics, is held up as being as untruthful and as unworthy of trust as the present dictator of Germany. </para>

                    <para>I do not wish to pursue this aspect of the subject further. Like my friend, the Leader of the Opposition, 1 have a strong leaning to peaceful methods for the settlement of all disputes. But I recognize that there can be no lasting peace among nations until the world rids itself of certain elements that have disrupted good relations between the powers. Until we effectively remove, not merely the leader of one nation, but also those other elements in that country and other countries that are responsible for so much misery among the peoples at the present time, we cannot expect to make the world a reasonably safe place for peaceful-minded human beings. That is what the British and French nations are fighting for. That the cause to which Australia is committed. </para>
                    <para>During the recess, the Prime Minister made a number of broadcasts. In one he made a declaration of the Government&#39;s war aims with which I do not agree. The right honorable gentleman stated, I quote from memory, &#34;Australia is not out to dictate to Germany or to any other country, the kind of government, that it shall have &#34;. I disagree with that. I say that that is the very thing for which we are fighting. Perhaps I should say that we are out to dictate the kind of government which Germany shall not have. That is a government whose policy is to  threaten, bully, and interfere, with the peace and good government of other countries and the liberty of their peoples ; a government which threatens the very existence of our own democratic system; a government which challenges the very right of the exercise of conscience, of free expression through those democratic institutions to which we have become accustomed and which we so highly value. We are fighting to dictate to not only Germany, but also other nations in future, the kind of government that they shall not set up for the purpose of threatening the liberties of other peoples. We are- fighting to remove the bullying and tyrannizing party which at present has the unfortunate people of Germany under its heel. </para>

                    <para>I desire now to deal with an aspect of this question which was touched on by the Leader of the Opposition. What are our aims for the world after the war, assuming that we shall he successful in the conflict? I disagree with those who think that this is a small war, which will be over quickly. Bather do I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that it will be a dreadful business - that the troubles and difficulties in which the world will find itself, materially, spiritually, physically and economically, will be such that men will be forced to take stock of themselves, and set to work, in a spirit of conciliation, to establish among all the peoples of the world a system which will at least give some guarantee of lasting peace. After the last war the League of Nations came into being. Many people think that it has failed, but in my opinion that is a wrong attitude to adopt. It is true that, at the moment,the League appears  to have failed, but its establishment gave to the world a basis upon which to build something better. The League of Nations failed for the same reason as we should have failed in this country if we made it. . obligatory for the police never to be armed, whilst members of the criminal and lawless classes were entitled to carry machine guns as they liked. The League of Nations was a fine ideal, but it had no force with which to back up its decisions. In this connexion, I recommend to honorable senators a book entitled <inline font-style="italic">Union Now.</inline> by Clarence Streit. I do not suggest that all of his recommendations be adopted, because I do not agree with all of them, but there is much food for thought in the book. It is not too early to start planning, or at least thinking, of the steps to be taken when the day of peace comes. I shall not go into the history of the League of Nations because it is well known to honorable senators, but I point out that In his book Clarence Streit draws a distinction between a league and a union. He says that in a league, such as the League of Nations, the delegates of the nations are not armed w ith discretionary powers, but act according to instructions received beforehand. Should any question of which they have not previously been acquainted arise, adjournments must be made in order to enable the delegates to obtain instructions from their governments, and then they re-assemble and, perhaps, arrive at decisions. There is a great difference between a league of that sort, and a union consisting of elected representatives of the nations, meeting to deal only with those matters which are delegated to them by the nations which they represent. Whilst I do not agree with many of the conclusions of the author, I suggest that Australia and the great republic of the  United  States of America have something of value to offer to the world, because written in their constitutions is a model for a future league of nations. Why should not the League of Nations, or whatever term may be applied to such a body after  the  war, be entrusted with the powers of force and discipline? Why should not the power to enforce peace and order and international moral conduct be concentrated in one representative international body as the sole custodian of peace? I suggest that to such a body each nation should elect its representative on the basis of equal representation, such election to lie under the control of the central body along lines similar to the Commonwealth electoral legislation. It would not be a league of nations in the old sense, because its operations would be limited strictly to a few functions, the chief of which would be the enforcement &#34;f peace and the exclusive control of and the manufacture of armaments and the means of war. It would also have charge of the periodical elections of representatives to such body. In short, it would, in those few but important matters which affect the peace and happiness of mankind, be an effective international parliament, and the sole body to control the means of enforcing .the collective will of the -peoples of the world. There would be no interference with any nation, but once the whole of the means of making war was concentrated in a body representative of all the peoples of the world, I venture to say, in the light of the experience of the misery caused by recent wars, that there never would befound a majority which would permit disorder and war so long as such a body lasted. </para>
                    <para>In conclusion, I urge that, in these days, when the public mind is distracted,, we shall not arrive at conclusions in the absence of vital facts. </para>

                        <para>.- Australia to-day is in the midst of one of the greatest crises in history; a wave of unparalleled barbarism issweeping over the world, threatening todestroy all that is best in human society. The great issue that faces mankind is whether men are to live as free citizens of a democracy, or are to be the docile followers of a  despot,  and forced to develop that servile mass mentality which dictators demand from their subjects.. The truth is that the defence of Australia docs not depend upon arms alone; it is equally a political question. In my opinion, the will to fight depends upon what men are fighting for. We are conscious, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> has said, of the promises made during the last war as to the state of society that should be established when it was over. Among other things the world was promised a peaceful and contented Europe, but that does not exist to-day. On the contrary, the world is in a worse position to-day than it was when the great struggle of 1914-18 began. In ray opinion one of the main causes of the present unhappy state of affairs is the attitude adopted by the British people towards Russia. I have in mind the attitude, not of the people generally, but of the Conservative element which to-day is in power in Britain. When I last spoke on this subject I demanded, as the people of Great Britain demanded, an alliance with Russia. Such an alliance would have resulted in a brake being applied to Hitler and would have prevented the present crisis. The British people demanded a pact with Russia, but certain organizations in Great Britain were working in the opposite direction. I have just read a book issued by the Left Book Club of Great Britain in which are given the names of persons and organizations which aim at bringing about in Great Britain a state of society similar to that which exists in Germany to-day. If therehad been a more democratic outlook and more concern for the welfare of the people generally, we should have entered into an alliance with Russia andHitlerism would have been overthrown. </para>

                    <para>Like the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> I believe that Australia would get all the fighters it requires if the men were properly paid. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> said that the manhood of Australia was not being conscripted, but that the law provided that men could be called up at any time for the defence of their country. The Labour party believes that one volunteer is worth ten pressed men. It is admitted on all sides that an army of volunteers will do better work than is possible with an army of conscripts. In my opinion the men in the Militia are not paid enough ; they should receive 9s. a day. I arrive at that figure on the basis of the amount, paid to members of the fighting forces during the last war. At that time, when the basic wage was about 7s. ft day, the men were paid 5s. a day. In Tasmania there has been a strong agitation in favour of increased pay for soldiers. I have here a letter which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Launceston Examiner</inline> of the 14th November in answer to another letter on the same subject - </para>

                            It has been stated by yourself and military officers that the &#34; pay question &#34; for the military forces is not deterring men from enlisting in the special force. I beg to differ. 1 have asked quite a number of those in the Militia (and others) if they are going to join up, and the answer in every case has been, &#34; No, notfor five bob a day &#34;. Much has been paid of patriotism, but the Federal Government expects it to be all on the side of the men.

                    <para class="block">We are engaged in this war in the conviction that our cause is just, and we are determined to win. The war must be paid for, and that should be done, not by reducing wages and the standard of living, but by using the credit of the nation. A Federal Labour Government established the Commonwealth Bank with the object of utilizing the credit of the nation, but since Labour has been in Opposition that institution has been transformed by our political opponents into a mere puppet of the private banks. In order to assist national defence the Commonwealth Bank must have its original charter restored, and when the Labour party is again in power the Commonwealth Bank will occupy the position it formerly held. The cost of war can be met without&#39; piling up huge debts, and without permitting interest payments to destroy our national life. Under a Labour Government the Commonwealth Bank would1&#39; provide a freer and fuller service to our people. The rich should pay an insurance premium for the safety of themselves and their possessions, and for the special privileges which they enjoy in the community. In order to assist in the successful prosecution of the war higher taxation should be imposed upon wealthy interests. To ensure a continuance of our security there must be industrial decency, a limitation of the profits made by private enterprise, a cessation of profiteering and amore effective use of national credit. Our duty to the British Commonwealth of Nations does not mean that we shall condone the rascality, robbery and monopoly of those who would batten on the workers. The basis for social readjustment when the war is over should be considered and even established while the struggle is in progress. I have always advocated a national defence contribution based upon profits made during the period of the war and for two years thereafter. Such a contribution should he made by those engaged in any trade or business of any description, including in the case of bodies corporate whose functions consist wholly or mainly of the holding of investments or other property, a tax of 10 per cent. or 20 per cent. according to the amount to be raised. It is true that some businesses have different accounting periods, but a suitable basis could be adopted. The tax should be imposed on the profits of trades and businesses carried, on in Australia whether by companies, individuals or firms, or carried on outside Australia by organizations operating in Australia.

                    <para>Reference has been made to the proposal to despatch an expeditionary force. Although the opinion may be held in some quarters that Australia will not be attacked, we have no definite assurance on that point. The man-power of Australia must be conserved. Our immense area and tremendous coastline tax our resources to such a degree that the maximum of our man-power constitutes the minimum required for our own safety. The Labour party has repeatedly stated that in providing for the security of Australia we render the best possible service to the British Commonwealth of Nations. Members of the Labour party made that statement before &#39; the last general elections, and it is receiving additional support to-day. Of what avail would it be to- Britain if after our man-power had been sent abroad, Britain lost this great storehouse of grain, wool and manufactured products? Imagine the feelings of Australian troops on the other side of the world if they were informed that their country, their homes and their loved ones had come under alien control. Britain will not look in vain to Australia for many commodities which will be of more assistance to it than an expeditionary force. It is exceedingly dangerous to send an expeditionary force abroad until there has been a definite alignment of other powers. In this connexion, I refer honorable senators to the following statement made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> in this chamber on the 13th September of this year :  - </para>
                    <para>Nothing would give the people of this country a greater feeling of confidence and composure, than an official announcement that a trained home defence force, equal in numbers to the Australian Imperial Force, is the Government&#39;s objective. Honorable senators should not think for one moment that I am visualizing an expeditionary overseas force. I have already said in this chamber that the despatch of such a force, voluntarily enlisted, is a remote possibility. No government would dare denude this country of its virile manhood unless some extraordinary developments warranted&#39; such action. No one can foretell what the future has in store for us. I, for one, would not stampede the Government into doing what the Opposition, for political reasons, imagines will be done. Our defence problem is different altogether from that of New Zealand or any other dominion. </para>
                    <para class="block">I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> as one of the best military strategists in Australia, and his opinion on this important subject is worthy of respect. Following are some startling comparisons showing the area and population of Japan and Australia, and separate figures in respect of Queensland :  - </para>

                    </para>
                    <para>The population of one city in Japan (Tokio) is 6,274,000, as compared with Australia&#39;s total population of 6,806,752. This table discloses that the population  of Japan is 91,193,248 greater than that of Australia; and whereas the area of Queensland is more than four times as great as the area of Japan proper, the population of Japan (including Korea and the islands of Formosa and Sakhalin, &#38;c.) is 98 times as great as that of Queensland. If the war in Europe becomes intensified and Holland and Belgium should be attacked the former country may find it impossible to defend its possessions in the East Indies. Japan, which is fighting an undeclared war in China, may invade the Netherlands East Indies, and thus directly menace Australia. As further evidence of the necessity to maintain the security of Australia, instead of sending an expeditionary force overseas, I cite the following paragraph which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> of the 20th September - </para>

We must speed up production in order to supply Great Britain with the commodities it requires in order to prosecute the war. At present there is a stalemate on the eastern front, with Hitler holding one half of Poland and Russia holding the other half. What will be the position should Germany he defeated? Shall we then declare war on Russia in order to recover the part of Poland which Russia now holds? The restoration of Poland is impossible, and we should realize that fact. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abbott</inline> that we should make some endeavour to bring about security in the world based on a just peace. I have not much faith in the League of Nations, or in a policy of collective security; but I believe that a conference of the great powers - Great Britain, France, the United States of America, Russia, Germany and Italy - could establish a just and lasting peace based on democratic principles. Australia&#39;s relationship to Japan is of paramount importance to our interests, and we must constantly bear that fact in mind. &#34;We should not send an expeditionary force abroad. We are doing a real jab in supplying Great Britain with all of the things it needs, and we should best continue to do that job by conserving our man-power in order to be able to defend this country most effectively. </para>

                        <para>.- The present crisis has revealed to the Government that the preparation of our defence services to meet any contingency can no longer be regarded as a spare-time occupation. Camp training for eight or sixteen days sufficed in peace time. That system did not seriously interrupt the civil employment of the volunteer. The  permanency of his employment and his advancement therein were not threatened ; but to-day both he and his employer consider the disadvantages of the longer period of camp training to be too great. The result is that the militiaman either has to hand in his kit or risk the loss of his job at the termination of his intensive camp training. No matter what his pay and the allowances for his family may be, the militiaman has to look to his future. I do not know how many have sought their discharge, but I understand that considerable numbers have done so. Although volunteers are still available, the number in the aggregate is not sufficient to make good the wastage. A much longer period of training is essential for the co-operation and cohesion of the various units that are necessary before a division can take the field and acquit itself with any degree of success. An individual or a unit might be efficient, but unless a unit can take its allotted place and be exercised as a component of a brigade or a division, that brigade or division will be only half-baked. If I judge public opinion rightly, something more than half-baked divisions is expected. Every honorable senator opposite desires, I feel sure, that our home defence troops should reach the highest standard of efficiency possible under existing conditions. That standard can be achieved only when adequate numbers undergo intensive training over a given period. There should be no inequality of sacrifice. Volunteers who enlisted before the present crisis for sparetime training have practically been  subjected  to compulsion. Is that fair? Why should they carry the full burden? Why should the unselfish employer be at a disadvantage in competition with the employer who scowls at the young employee who wants to do his bit? This inequality should be removed by requiring the same sacrifice of every one - employees and employers alike. Universal training is fair and democratic; during ray long years of service I did not find any serious objection raised to universal training except when the trainees&#39; Saturday sport was interfered with. They enjoyed and look forward to camp training. A few, like the brumbies, were difficult to handle. </para>

                            <para>- I understand that it is intended to cut out Saturday parades and to concentrate on training in camps. My chief criticism of the Government&#39;s proposal for the resumption of universal training early in the new year is that a start is to be made with men 21 years of age. We found, in the Australian Imperial Force, that the men &#39;between the ages of 25 and 30 stood the strain best. Those under 25, particularly those 20 and 21 years old, went down like ninepins after carrying heavy packs on long marches. Although they continued gamely next day, their constitution failed them. It might be urged that in the present war infantry ride in mechanized vehicles. That may be so, but they must still dig trenches, and man them day and night, with possibly little or no sleep or rest. Train the 21 -year-old young man by all means, but start first with the 25-year, or even the 27-year class. Let us hope that before the 21-year-old fellow is called into camp, the necessity for training him will have passed. </para>

                    <para>The Defence Act prohibits the sale or consumption of liquor in compulsory military training camps. When the compulsory system was replaced by the voluntary system in 1929, approval was given for Militia officers&#39; and sergeants&#39; messes to have a locker in their respective drill halls. No doubt, when universal training is in full swing next year, the provisions of the Defence Act regarding liquor in camps and drill halls will be strictly observed. A wet canteen has been for years, and still is, part of the regimental life of the permanent soldiers in all of our defended ports. The question of a wet or dry canteen refers more particularly to camps of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force. The personnel of this force are now permanent men of mature age, like the Royal Australian Artillery and the Royal Australian Engineers manning the forts. Unlike the old Australian Imperial Force, they may remain in Australia until this present war ends. Why should they not be treated in the same way as the permanent gunner or sapper? Should the 2nd </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian Imperial Force go overseas, the wet canteens in the British Army will open to them. I can see no valid reason, why this force should not have a wet canteen under military control and administration. The hours would be regulated and the quality of liquor guaranteed. Those who do not desire a glass of beer after a strenuous day&#39;s work can be provided for in a Young Men&#39;s Christian Association or Salvation Army hut, with stimulants to their taste. To deny members of the 2nd Australian Imperial Force such liquid refreshment as they are accustomed to in private life is distinctly unfair. It penalizes patriotism. On the other hand, a wet canteen properly supervised obviates illicit trading and excessive drinking and consumption of injurious liquor. &#39; </para>

I also said twelve months ago that the present monetary system had brought the world to a state of poverty, and was rapidly heading for a war that would destroy our civilization. As the result of my experience in the League of Nations Union, I thought that machinery was already at hand to maintain world peace.

                        <para>When the whistle blew for the start of the great war in August, 1914, the Bank of England possessed only nine millions sterling* of a gold reserve, and as the Bank of England was the bankers&#39; bank, this sum constituted the effective reserve of all the other banking institutions in Great Britain. The bank managers at the outbreak of the war were seriously afraid that the depositing public, in a panic, would demand the return of their money. And, inasmuch as the deposits and savings left in the hands of the bankers by the depositing public had very largely been sunk by the bankers in enterprises which, at the best, could not repay the borrowed capital quickly, and which, in several and large-scale instances were likely to be submerged altogether in the stress of war and&#39; in the collapse of great areas of international trade, it followed that if there were a widespread panicky run upon the banks, the bankswould be unable to pay, and the whole credit system would collapse, to the ruin of millions of people. </para>

During these three or four days when the banks and stock exchanges were closed, the bankers held anxious negotiation with the Chancellor &#39;of the Exchequer. And one of them has placed on record that &#34;he (Lloyd George) did everything that we asked him to do &#34;. When the banks re-opened, the public discovered that, instead of getting their money back in gold,, they were paid in a new legal tender of Treasury notes (the &#163;1 notes in black and the <inline font-style="italic">\0s~.</inline> notes in red colours). This new currency had been issued by the State, was backed by the credit of the State, and was issued to the banks to prevent the banks from utter collapse. The public cheerfully accepted the new notes and nobody talked about inflation. </para>

                        George got the bankers out of their difficulties in the autumn of  1914  by the issue of the Treasury money, than they were round again at the Treasury door explaining forcibly that the State must on no account issue any more money on this interest-free basis; if the war was to be run, it must be run with borrowed money, money upon which interest must be paid, and they were the gentlemen who would sec to the financing of a good juicy War Loan at  3}  per cent, interest, and to that last proposition the Treasury yielded. The war was not to be fought with interest-free money, and/or with conscription of wealth; though it was to be fought with conscription of life. Many small businesses were to be closed and their proprietors sent overseas as redundant, and without any compensation for their losses, while finance, as we shall see, was to be heavily and progressively remunerated.

                        <para>The report of the Cunliffe Committee (  1927 )  relates the story of the progressive piling up of our War Debt burdens. But it is in no wise a complete <inline font-style="italic">chronique scandaleuse</inline> of usury in war-time, nor did its authors intend it to be. We find in its pages no reference or hint of the magical process by which, while the nation struggled almost at death&#39;s door for its very existence, and while masses of our manhood were daily being blown into bundles of bloody rags, our banking fraternities continued to create for themselves a great volume of new credit and to lend that credit to us at interest, and indeed, at progressively increased interest; no reference to the fact that by this manufacture of bankers&#39; credit some portion, variously estimated in amount, of what now stands as the public debt, was simply fabricated for private ends and was not a bona-fide loan of real wealth to the nation. Professor Soddy has estimated that the bankers actually created two thousand million pounds, no less, of this bank credit, and lent it out to us at  5  per cent. That means  &#163;100,000,000  a year on nothing. The first war loan at interest was floated in </para>
                        <para class="block">November,  1914,  at  3-J  per cent., and the investors were only required to subscribe  &#163;95  for each  &#163;100  of scrip. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">The investors received &#163;100 worth of bonds or scrip, hut contributed only &#163;95 worth of bank credit - not money. </para>
                    <para>The total amount of the loan was  &#163;350,000,000,  but as there were not  &#163;350,000,000  of money in the country, what the State received was credit - the pledged credit of individuals and corporations and banking houses (the same banking houses which, as we have seen, three months earlier had been begging the Treasury notes on loan from the Government to, save their precious banking system from bankruptcy). </para>
                    <para>The second war loan was issued at par in June,  1915,  at  44  per cent, interest; and such investors and corporations and banking houses as had held the previous war loan stock at  34  per cent, were permitted to transfer into the new loan at the increased rate of interest. Actually, of the  4-}  per cent, loan, the sum of  &#163;176,000,000  was not new loan money at all, but  was a  considerable portion of the old  34  per cent, loan silently &#34; jumping the counter &#34; on the higher rate. And, in addition to that, the holders of no less than  &#163;138,000,000  of the new  44  per cent, loan were old holders of the 24 per cent, consols and 2| per cent, and 2} per cent, annuities, who also had been permitted to transfer into the higher rate of interest yield. These conversions at the higher rate of interest meant a clear gift of at least  &#163;4,000,000  a year in extra interest to the money lenders. </para>
                    <para>But the story of this great finance ramp of June,  1915,  is incomplete without a reference being made to the pledge extracted from the state by the finance houses and banks that, should there be any subsequent issue of war loan at a still higher rate of interest than  44  per cent., the holders of the new  44  per cent, loan  (&#163;901,000,000  in amount) would be entitled to convert at a higher scale, and this the great bulk of them succeeded in doing. </para>
                    <para>We must note another, even more amazing and more impudent, of the methods of debt and interest concoction in these delirious wartimes. The banks actually issued circulars to thousands of their customers inviting them to apply for a portion of the new war loan and to borrow credit from the banks for that purpose at  3  per cent. The customer was to put up no money for his war loan, no margin, no securities. The bank was to supply the credit, or rather was to back the customer&#39;s credit, and was to charge the customer  3  per cent, interest for so doing; but the State was pledging itself to pay  44  per cent, interest on the war loan which the customer was purchasing with his  3  per cent, money. The customer, after allowing for  Mb  income tax, &#38;c, was clearly  1  per cent, better off on the deal. </para>

                    <para>In March, 1916, the Bank of England, without any apparent sense of shame, issued press advertisements which ran : &#34; If you cannot fight, you can help your country by investing all you can in5 per cent. exchequer bonds . . . Unlike the soldier, the investor runs no risk&#34;. </para>
                    <para>Yet all these efforts surely paled before the shameless greed of the third great war loan in January, 1917. . No foreign conqueror could have devised a more complete robbery and enslavement of the British nation. The rate of interest in war loan was jumped to 5 per cent. (or at the option of the investor 4 per cent. free of income tax until October, 1942), and the holders of previous war loans and Treasury bills and war expenditure certificates were invited to&#39; come in and convert their old stock into the higher rates of booty, and for each &#163;100 of stock in the new loan, only &#163;95 had to be subscribed, so that the rate of interest really had been raised to 5&#189; per cent. Into this 5 per cent. war loan tumbled the holders of &#163;820,000,000 of the 4&#189; per cent. loan, thus securing an extra <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> per cent., or &#163;4,000,000, in addition to the increases which many of them had secured when the rate of interest was previously jumped from per cent. to 4&#189; per cent. And not only were the 4&#189; per centers permitted to convert into the 5 per cent. war loan, but the holders of &#163;130,000,000 of Treasury bills and &#163;280,500,000 of exchequer bonds also converted. The new 5 per cent. loan of &#163;2,075,750,000 secured only, in fact, &#163;844,750,000 of new loans, the balance being paper conversions from the old lower interest stocks, whereby the converters were enabled to dig deeper into the national pocket than they had hitherto done. </para>

It has been stated by the Prime . Minister that , there will be no suppression of news, and I was wondering whether the speech by the Premier of Tasmania had been censored. If it has, a great injustice has been done to the people of that State. </para>

                            <para>- To my mind, it is most important that we should discuss the means by which money is to be raised for war purposes. Since this Government takes no notice of the recommendations of a royal commission appointed by the Lyons Government, somebody should remind it of its duty to the taxpayers.

                        <para>By June, 1919, we came to what was gleefully described as the Joy Loan. The rate of interest was nominally 4 per cent., but the investor had only to pay &#163;80 for each &#163;100 of stock, so that the yield was 5 per cent., and the holders of the previous4&#189; per cent. war loan, various exchequer bonds, and the first three series of national war bonds were accepted at par. The total issue of the loan was &#163;409,000,000, but &#163;120,000,000 of this sum was simple conversion from a lower rate of interest and really meant an annual increase of over half a million sterling for the taxpayer to meet in interest. . . . The Joy Loan, moreover, was made more joyous still by a clause decreeing that stock costing &#163;80 was to be accepted in payment of death duties as if that stock were the equivalent of &#163;100  -  a clear gift of over 17 per cent. to the heirs of the patriotic lenders . . . </para>

                    <para>. - I ask the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> whether he will be good enough, at as early a date  as  is convenient, to make a statement relating to the Government&#39;s proposal for the marketing of apples and pears. This subject is causing anxiety to growers, particularly in Tasmania. There is a good deal of confusion regarding this scheme and the price likely to be received by the growers. I should also like to know if the attention of the Minister has been directed to a statement made by the Minister of Agriculture in Tasmania, and, if so, whether the statement is a correct representation of the Commonwealth Government&#39;s attitude in connexion with the acquisition of the fruit crop. As the harvesting of the crop is fast approaching, it would be in the interests of all concerned if the Minister would make a complete statement as soon as possible. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply</inline> - The statement which appeared in  the  press, and purporting to have been made by the Minister of Agriculture in  Tas  mania, was not correct in all its details. I received a deputation from members of both Houses of this Parliament and representing all parties, requesting that the advance be increased from 2s. to 2s. 6d. a case for apples, and from 3s. to 3s. 6d. a case, for pears. I have also received an urgent request from a large section of the peargrowers in Victoria, directing attention to the fact that the pear crop in that State is not likely to be so large as was anticipated, and I am to receive a deputation from their organization on Wednesday. Their request is that Victorian pears be not included in the Commonwealth apple and pear acquisition scheme. As I do not yet know whether we shall get refrigerated space for overseas shipments, I am not in a position to reply to the deputation, but I shall inform honorable senators of the Government&#39;s intentions as soon as possible. I hope to be able to make a complete statement next week. </para>
