                            <para>- Owing to the fact that the Commonwealth&#39; Prices Commissioner fixed the price of leather in Australia, it became necessary to formulate some plan by which tanners could get their normal supplies of hides. Unless that were done the tanners would he restricted as to the price that they could pay for hides. Owing to the increase of export parity, which has, in fact, meant that Australian tanners have been unable to obtain supplies of hides at prices at which they are allowed to sell their leather under the Commissioner&#39;s ruling, it was necessary to form a Hide and Leather Industries Board to take control of the selling of hides. A formula has been prepared under which hides will be appraised at prices which will be in line with the prices at which tanners can dispose of their leather. Australian tanners will then have the opportunity to purchase their requirements of hides at the appraised prices. </para>

                        <para>- Not at the moment; but it is expected that they will -do so later. Hides that are not required by tanners for local use will then be submitted to public auction, and ordinary dealers and exporters will be able to participate in what will be known as the second auction. By the grant of permits to oxport hides and skins bought at the second auction our normal export of hides, over and above domestic requirements, will be continued with as little interruption as possible. The board has already been set up, and held its first meeting on Monday. I understand that appraisements under the control of  the board will be in progress during the present week. It is not expected that there will be any further hold-up of the normal disposal of hides for either local requirements or export. </para>

                            <para>- No. The distribution of any excess over the appraised prices which may be received at the second auction - and, owing to the higher overseas parity rate, it is reasonable to assume that at the second auction hides will bring- more than the appraised prices - was considered at a meeting at which all of the interested parties were represented. Delegates representing the cattle interests agreed- that it would be difficult to return to the actual producers of the hides any excess above appraisement prices that may be received at the second auction. So far, no definite decision as to the disposal of any such excess has been arrived at, but the matter is receiving the consideration of the department and the board. At the first conference to which I have referred a representative of the graziers suggested that the money should be earmarked for scientific research into diseases and other problems affecting the cattle industry. He expressed the opinion that the disposal of any excess in that way would meet with the general approval of the industry. However, the matter has not yet been decided ; when it is, I shall be pleased to give the information to honorable senators. </para>

            <para>The <inline font-weight="bold">PRESIDENT (Senator the Hon. J. B. Hayes).</inline> - On the 22nd September last, during the debate on the -second reading of the Defence Bill (No. 2) 1939, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> desiring to show the policy of the Labour party .with regard to the compulsory provisions of the Defence Act, was proceeding to quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 14th June, 1939, the report of a speech made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> during the debate on the National Registration Bill. I informed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> that he might not do so, but upon a point of order being raised, I stated that I would look into the matter and give a considered opinion on the next day of sitting. During the adjournment I have taken the opportunity to consider this point. Standing Order 414 reads - </para>

            <para class="block">Originally the words &#34; except <inline font-style="italic">Hansard &#34;</inline> did not appear in this standing order, but in 1903 they were inserted on the motion of the then <inline font-weight="bold">President, Sir Richard</inline> Baker, who stated that if a senator wished to quote from a speech delivered by another senator he ought to be able to quote from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> However, Standing Order 414 is governed by Standing Order No. 413 which reads - </para>
            <para>No senator shall allude to any debate of the same session upon a question or bill not&#39; being then under discussion, nor to any speech made in committee, except by the indulgence of the Senate for personal explanation. </para>
            <para class="block">In accordance with this standing order quotations from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> must be strictly relevant to the subject under discussion, and I desire this to be regarded as my ruling in the matter. </para>
            <para>The quotation read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> after I had informed him that he might do so, was from a debate on the National Registration Bill. The subject under discussion was the second reading of the Defence Bill (No. 2). It might be held that the quotation was not relevant, but, on perusing it in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard,</inline> I consider that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> was in order. </para>

                    <para>My  reasons for submitting this motion I shall -give in the course of my remarks. But, first, I assure the Government, as I seem to have developed a habit of doing, that I om not raising this matter in any spirit of carping criticism. This motion is of very serious import to every honorable senator. It involves a principle extending far beyond this Parliament, because serious inroads have been made by the Government upon the rights of a free Parliament, which is an integral part of the system of constitutional government enjoyed by the British Commonwealth of Nations. If we wish to encourage the onslaughts being made in other parts of the world on democracy, all we ourselves need do is to allow particular and favorable features of democracy to be slowly, but surely, whittled away from this Parliament. If we look through the history of constitutional government, the situation becomes exceedingly interesting, because the history of parliamentary control of taxation, is the whole history of constitutional government, n.s we know it to-day. It is a wonderfully entrancing chapter of the world&#39;s development from crudity to at least a measure of democratic control. Parliament in its origin was a very humble institution, so far as the nature of the power which it exercised is concerned. It had the power to vote taxes - which, paradoxically as it may appear, did not include the power to refuse them - to humbly petition and to answer questions. What, then, is the reason for the development of so powerful and vital an institution as the modern parliament? The reason can only be found in the gradual growth of the control of parliament over taxation. There is no need to go into the history of different classes of taxes, although the development of parliamentary control of them differed in each instance. But it is fairly safe to say that the recognition of parliament&#39;s power over taxation was well established in the reign of Edward I., the end of the thirteenth century. This recognition, however, was subject to all sorts of exceptions, and also to the claims of various monarchs who retained the prerogative to tax without the consent of parliament. These exceptions and these claims of prerogative formed the basis of the struggle which continued over so many centuries. That struggle is still going on. The power of parliament is not yet recognized as the complete thing which most of us imagine that it is, and which all of us believe it ought to be. </para>
                    <para>The early history of parliamentary control of taxation shows that the Commons were prepared to vote a tax rather than have it imposed without their consent. They thus sometimes voted taxes to which they did not agree, rather than have them imposed against their will, and often they tacitly asserted their right to control the public purse. Another development that is most important is that during this long struggle, the theory also arose that, although the King could modify or apply an old law on his own prerogative, there was impropriety in his making new laws without the consent of the barons, or, as it later developed, the consent of Parliament. Elements of confusion arose in this connexion, but this was the beginning of the legislative power of Parliament. The real origin of Parliament&#39;s right to initiate legislation was the petition for the redress of grievances, and, as it became established that the King could  not tax without the consent of Parliament, the Parliament found that it had a valuable lever by which it might force the King to consent to proposed legislation initiated by it. Thus it may be seen that, at root, the whole legislative power of Parliament depends on the control of taxation. Take that power of control away from the established Parliament of this or any other democratic country and Parliament might as well close up. I stress the fact that the development did not occur without a struggle. &#34;We are the heirs of all the ages, and of all the victories won by the struggle throughout the centuries to secure for Parliament that supreme power which it is supposed to exercise to-day in democratic countries, but which, as I have already indicated, is being slowly whittled away. The struggle was not unmarred by civil Avar, and, indeed, resulted, as honorable senators know, in the execution of one king and the deposition of others before the modern constitutional practice was established. To-day the control of taxation is the protection which the people have against the arbitrary action of the Executive, and will, I hope, be just as jealously guarded as it was jealously fought for during the long centuries of the constitutional struggle. </para>
                    <para>I have made these introductory remarks because I am asking honorable senators to forget for the moment their political alliances. We on this side are, I hope, just as loyal to the party to which we belong - and that will not be denied even by political partisans - as honorable gentlemen opposite are loyal to their parties ; but, we on this side, at least,&#39; do occasionally take action in this Parliament and cast votes for what we believe to be in the best interests of the nation as a whole, rather than give slavish, adherence to the tenets of our political creed. I do not impute improper motives to honorable senators opposite. All that I am asking them to do is to approach this matter, not in a spirit of political partisanship, but with a desire to deal impartially with a matter that goes to the roots of the rights of this Senate. If my motion be not endorsed - and there can be no compulsion in regard to the votes of honorable senators - it will mean that those who oppose it are not jealous, as I believe they are, of the rights ot tins branch of the National Parliament. I am not putting the matter from that aspect in any unkind or disrespectful way. </para>
                    <para>There are occasions when we cannot afford to submit to tyrannical action, and then boast that we are members of a deliberative assembly of a country that is part of the British Commonwealth of Nations. If we look at the situation abroad, and remember the statements made in this chamber only last night, in which war aims were spoken of, we shall find that one of the evils we are resisting is the power of those who have ceased to respect the democratic rights of the people or their institutions, and are riding rough-shod over the community, because they have achieved the. power to defeat the democratic institutions and to become complete and ruthless tyrants. Honorable senators may say that, that is a far cry from the motion now before the Senate, but I ask them to cast their minds back over the remarks that I have just made, and to realize that, after all, this motion is but one more phase of the constitutional struggle down the ages. I know that we arc at liberty to say what we feel about this matter without being arrested or beheaded, but, unless we are prepared to uphold the more civilized methods made available co us by parliamentary and constitutional procedure, we shall be recreant to th?. heritage handed on to us, and achieved only by the willingness of those who have gone before to sacrifice themselves in the struggle for liberty. </para>
                    <para>What are the facts regarding this regulation ?  A certain measure was  submitted  in the House of Representatives for the consideration of the Parliament. The bill passed the House of Representatives, and was then received by the Senate. Honorable senators realize, of course, that when a measure comes here from the House of Representatives&#39; it is not then a law; it is only a bill. Until it leaves this chamber bearing imprimatur of the Senate it cannot become a law. That bill reached the Senate and was fully debated here, but this chamber in its wisdom decided by a majority- </para>

                            <para>- The Minister&#39;s smile and chuckle of satisfaction are a bit premature, because no government has ever attempted to do what this Government has done. The Scullin Government did promulgate regulations repeatedly which were repeatedly disallowed by the Senate. But those regulations were made under a measure which had become law, whereas the regulation which I am now asking the Senate to disallow was made in defiance of the -Senate&#39;s rejection of a measure of similar import. I hope honorable senators can see the distinction between the two proposals. I do not deny the right of an executive to govern by regulation on occasions, and provided it has the authority of a law to do so. I do not regard the National Security Act as such a law. </para>

                            <para>-I say this because section18 of that infamous act, which we on this side of the chamber did our best to prevent from becoming law, condones this offence, but it does not dispose of the vital principle that is at stake - the right of the Senate to do as it pleases and as in its wisdom it decides, and the right to have its decision respected by the Government. If I wished to indict the Government, I could point to a long list of damning political crimes which it has committed ; but nothing could be more condemnatory than its action in foisting this tax on the people by means of this regulation. Without the authority of Parliament, and behind the hack of this Senate, after we had gone into recess, it issued this regulation which, in effect, is merely a. clever device to thwart the will of this chamber. If Government supporters endorse its action, I shall be perfectly happy about the matter because I shall know that this afternoon, at all events, the Opposition has endeavoured to get rid of its share of responsibility for what the Government has done. I leave the matter there. Summed up, the questionwhich every Member of this Senate has to answer Can be answered in one of two ways. One question is: Are youagreeable that after an orderly and properly-conducted debate, and after one of the most &#39;exhaustive in vestigations&#39; which I have ever heard given to so simple a measure as that which we were then considering, the will of the Senate should be flouted? Honorable senators can say &#34; yes &#34; with all the enthusiasm that they wish to display, by voting against my proposal. </para>

                        <para>. - The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has availed himself of the undoubted right of every member of the Senate to review a regulation which has been issued by the Government. Consequently I do not disagree with the remarks which he made in the early part of his speech this afternoon. Indeed, I believe that all honorable senators entirely agree with him that we should, as far as possible, maintain in their entirety the democratic principles underlying the rights and privileges of this legislature. But when the honorable gentleman endeavoured to show that the Government, in taking certain action, attempted to undermine the rights and privileges of this Parliament, he was on much less sound ground. Anticipating that some other honorable senator would raise the point, he admitted that the Government, in issuing this regulation, had acted entirely in accord with the powers conferred upon it by the National Security Act. He also referred to the action taken by a previous government in repeatedly promulgating a regulation of which the Senate had definitely expressed its disapproval. If ever there was a flouting of the will of the Senate, surely it was when that Government acted in direct conflict with the expressed view of the Senate.On this occasion, &#39;the Government, &#39;exercising a &#34;right which it undoubtedly possesses, issued a regulation, well knowing that the Senate could either approve or reject it. The honorable senator also made some references to what he described as the iniquitous National Security Act. </para>

                            <para>- I think that the honorable senator spoke of the act generally; but even if he referred only to section 18 of it, I remind him that the act containing that section was approved by both branches of the legislature. I also remind him that a previous government with views similar to his own introduced the War Precautions Act, which I suggest was a worse piece of legislation than the National Security Act. </para>

                            <para>- That is entirely a matter of opinion. I do not admit that the National Security Act is a bad piece of legislation. 1 believe that the people of this country recognize that, in times of war, it is sometimes necessary for a government to act promptly along the lines represented by this regulation. I do not think that the people believe in the policy which has been advocated by the Labour party - although I do not say that any policy of that party is adhered to for long - of taking a referendum of the people in order to decide whether or not this country should engage in war. </para>

The Leader of the Opposition did not advance one argument as to the merits or demerits of this regulation, nor did he show that the intention of the regulation is in any way contrary to what ought to be done in the present circumstances. On this matter, the Labour party, which is usually noted for its solidarity, has split. When the legislation referred to by the honorable senator was before the other chamber, it was supported by the Opposition, but when it came to the Senate we saw evidence of a split in the party. </para>

                            <para>- The Government did not defy the Parliament in this instance, because the proposals contained in the regulation were never considered by &#39; the Parliament. The hill to which reference has &#39;been made was for a 75 per cent, collection of any amount above a certain price whereas the regulation provides for only 50 per cent. The attitude of the Opposition on this occasion is inconsistent with ite professed views regarding unearned increment. If ever there was an unearned increment, it is the increased price of gold which has resulted entirely from the war. In my opinion, that is a proper field for the levying of a tax, and therefore I ask the Senate to consider the regulation entirely on its merits, and not as an attempt by the Government to flout the will of the Senate. </para>

As I listened to the democratic sentiments expressed by the Leader of the Opposition, I regretted that he was not a member of this chamber some years ago when it devoted a good deal of attention to certain regulations dealing with waterside workers. </para>

                            <para>- Very little petrol is produced in Australia, and consequently very little excise is paid on that commodity. &#39;Gold production, which in Australia is exclusively a country industry, is confined chiefly to Western Australia; that State produces 75 per cent. of the gold output of this country. Onboth those grounds, I object to gold being subjected to the differential treatment which is applied to it under this regulation. On the 20th September last, when I dealt at length with the position of the Wiluna gold-mine and other low grade mines in Western Australia, I stated that those controlling suchundertakings are strongly opposed to this tax. Although capital amounting to &#163;1,559,012 has been invested in the Wiluna mine and nearly &#163;2,000,000 has been expended on machinery and developmental work, the shareholders have not received a dividend for over three years. </para>

                            <para>- If the Wiluna mine had not been managed efficiently it would have been unable to carry on. For three and one-half years it has been kept in operation for the benefit of the employees, the business people in the township, and the community generally, because the shareholders have not received any return on the heavy capital expenditure. Two years ago the general manager of the mine, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carroll,</inline> in formed me that if there should be only a slight increase of costs the mine might be compelled to close down, and if that should occur practically 1,000 men working on the property would lose their employment. </para>

                            <para>- It cannot be expected to carry on if costs increase. That gold-mine is the mainstay of the &#39; township of Wiluna, which has a population of 7,000 persons, and it is being jeopardized by this tax on production instead of on profits. When the bill on this subject was before the Senate, I read a lengthy telegram from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Carroll,</inline> the general manager, in which he objected very strongly to a tax on production. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, as do all those who are associated with low-grade and prospectingshows. The prospectors operating in Western Australia and in other parts of the Commonwealth are willing to pay a tax on profits, but they object strongly to a levy on production. In Western Australia hundreds of prospectors operating on a. small scale are ekeing out a very precarious existence. No work in Australia is conducted under conditions of greater hardship than that of prospecting, particularly in Western Australia, where it is undertaken in isolated arid inland districts. Owing to the shortage of water prospectors in many instances take their jives in their hands. In the early days they could not travel far from the railway without camels, but although motor transport has now almost entirely replaced camels, the risk to life, owing to the absence of water, is always present to the out-back prospector. When the Gold Tax Bill was before the Senate a number of semi-official suggestions, if not promises, were made that serious consideration would he given to the exemption of the production of prospectors until they were deriving profit, but no such concession has been granted. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald and others have been most active in that respect, but nothing has yet been done to relieve prospectors of the heavy burden imposed on them by this tax on their gold production. We can visualize the protests that would be lodged should the Government decide to acquire 10 per cent. of the value of the total production of the Australasian Glass Company, the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, or the Colonial Sugar Refining Company. </para>

                        <para>From Canberra came the intimation during the week that recommendations may be shortly made to the Federal Government to institute a campaign for Australia to accelerate gold production. It is emphasized inmaking this announcement that an increase in the gold production of the Commonwealth would help Australia to build up American credits for national purposes.As the gold industry., which is mainly Western Australian, has already been singled out by the Commonwealth for special taxation, this announcement is in keeping with a lot of the fool statements that have come from Canberra since the war. </para>

                            <para>- It provided a gold bounty which was strongly opposed by some honorable senators. The payment of a bounty on gold production stands to the credit of the Scullin Government, and, like the financial guarantee which the Commonwealth provided in connexion with Wiluna, did not cost the country anything, and only one small bonus was ever paid. That Government was anxious to assist the production of gold, but this Government, which also wishes the output to increase, is imposing an unjust tax on production. If the Commonwealth Government seriously desires to accelerate gold production in Australia it should abolish the excise on production. Should it decide as an alternative to tax excess profits little objection would be raised and a substantial production of gold would be assured. With gold alone can the Commonwealth purchase from the United States of America aeroplanes, fuel oil, machinery and other equipment which it must obtain. I have received a cablegram on this subject from <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. C.</inline> de Bernales. of London, who has been responsible for the investment of several millions of British capital in Western Australian gold mines. </para>

                            <para>- In Western Australia and Tasmania gold-mining companies pay income tax or else a dividend tax. In addition, through the tariff, they have been taxed by the Commonwealth in respect of the major part of their requirements during the past 25 years, and that impost has been continually increasing. Irrespective of State taxation of these companies, however, the Commonwealth should take a broad national view of this subject and translate into deeds the desire which it has so often expressed to see the production of gold increased as much as possible. I opposed the Gold Tax Bill in September last, and I shall at least be consistent in opposing the continuance of the present excise duty on gold. I can give the Government no better advice than that it should abolish this tax and so enable Australia, by increasing its production of gold, to play a greater part in assisting the Empire to win the war. </para>

                        <para>. -  I support the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> I was rather surprised at the casual manner in which the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride)</inline> dealt with the introductory remarks of the Leader of the Opposition. From his attitude one would think that this was not a serious matter. He suggested that because certain action had been taken by a previous government, this Government, therefore, enjoyed a licence to do likewise, or worse. That, I submit, is not the issue before us. This chamber, as a part of the Parliament of the Commonwealth, was called upon to endorse, or reject, the Government&#39;s proposal to levy a tax on the price of gold. The Senate rejected the proposal. The Government then resorted to other means; it levied an excise duty on gold, a form of taxation which, I submit, is unprecedented in the history of this or any parliament since the inception of  responsible government in Australia. Today we must ask ourselves whether the Senate is to remain part and parcel of the Commonwealth Parliament. Is the Senate to have any say whatever in the legislation of this Parliament? As senators are we not jealous of the rights of this chamber? For what purpose are we here? The Assistant Minister is not fully alive to the responsibilities of his position in this chamber, otherwise he would have adopted a more serious attitude when dealing with the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition this afternoon. We have been told repeatedly in this chamber, and Ministers have announced the fact when travelling through the Commonwealth, that the Senate- is the States&#39; House, that the framers of the Constitution provided a second chamber in order to grant the States representation on an equal basis, thus ensuring that the rights of any individual State would receive proper consideration at the hands of our legislators. Each of the States look to the Senate to do the right and proper thing by it, when taxation measures come before this chamber. In September last we fulfilled that duty by each of the States, when we rejected the Government&#39;s proposal to levy a tax of 75 per cent, of the price of gold in excess of &#163;9 an ounce. </para>

                            <para>- I think it was about &#163;10 Ils. an ounce, but that is beside the point. The issue to-day as it was then, is whether the Government should levy a tax on price instead of on profit. When its previous proposal was rejected the Government imposed an excise duty of 50 per cent, on all gold sold to the Commonwealth Bank at over &#163;9 an ounce. That kind of taxation savours of back door methods, and embodies the same principle as the Senate rejected in September last, because it is a tax on price. It was said that the reason which prompted the Government to introduce the Gold Tax Bill was that any system of securing the revenue it required by means of a tax on profits would be too cumbersome. I do not agree with that view, because the necessary computations &#171;o far as gold production is concerned, could be made quarterly. Indeed, no reason exists why such computations could not be made monthly, with annual adjustments. &#39; In any case, however, I do not believe that that was the reason which actuated the Government. On the contrary the Government realized that onlyestablished profit-producing mines would be called upon to pay a tax on profit, whereas a tax on price would embrace our total gold production. The existing excise duty applies to all gold whether it be produced by companies operating at a profit or not, so long as the price of gold exceeds &#163;9 an ounce. Is it just to tax companies which are not making a profit on the same basis as those which are operating at a profit? To-day many concerns are working low-grade propositions at a loss. These* include syndicates, prospectors and companies which are carrying out developmental work in order that when the price of gold falls they will be able to reap the benefit of this work, and thus be enabled to continue in production, despite low prices. To-day certain mines cannot be operated at a profit  with  the price of gold at &#163;9 an ounce. If the producers were allowed to retain the full benefit of the price ruling to-day, namely &#163;10 13s. an ounce, the possibility is that many low-grade propositions would be brought into production. The Leader of the Opposition has submitted a motion asking for the disallowance of a regulation promulgated to frustrate the rights of Parliament. Is there any good reason why Parliament was adjourned hurriedly a few weeks ago? More time could have been taken for giving this matter necessary consideration before the Government fled into recess and imposed an excise duty to replace the tax that had been defeated. If it were important then that a tax should be levied for the purpose of securing the revenue necessary to enable the Government to play its part in the successful prosecution of the war, could not time have been taken for the purpose of giving that proposed legislation proper consideration ? Even now the Government has made no pronouncement as to what it proposes to do. We are told that we must wait a few more days until a supplementary budget or some newfinancial proposals are introduced. </para>

                    <para>The Senate should accept this motion, irrespective of what, previous governments have done. Even in connexion with, the Mother of Parliaments there has been a movement to reform procedure and adopt more up-to-date methods of introducing taxation and other measures. Is there any reason why, because some government in the past took certain action, the present Government should follow the precedent then established? Not at all, because to-day we are faced with a new issue. Thinking people throughout the world are seriously reviewing what is taking place in countries where systems of government other than the parliamentary method are being introduced. As a unit of the British Commonwealth of Nations we should, rather than belittle Parliament, be ever on the alert to uphold the high ideals of parliamentary government. The present ministry is adopting totalitarian methods ; the practices of the dictators are apparently useful to it. The Opposition declares that the Government would be justified in bringing down in this session legislation similar to that rejected at the previous sittings. The Government is entitled to submit legislation to recover the revenue necessary to enable Australia to take its part in the war against the enemies of democracy, but this Senate has the right to request such amendments as it thinks fit. We should stand . up for the preservation of the rights of this branch of the legislature, because there is a movement in this country in the direction of placing governmental powers into fewer hands. This tendency must be combated in the interest of the democracy of Australia. The Opposition is not prepared to give away any of the powers of the people, and, if the Government desires to get its taxation measures through Parliament, it will have to allow the Senate sufficient time for their fair and proper consideration. </para>
                    <para>We had a discussion on the proposed gold tax and we rejected it. The Senate should now challenge the right of the Government to collect the tax in the form of an excise duty by means, of a  regulation  issued under the National Security Act. It was never intended by the Parliament that the powers conferred under that act should be used in this way. When the measure was presented to the Parliament, the avowed object was to secure the interests of the people of the Commonwealth against what might be done within &#39; </para>

                        has based the whole of his argument for the disallowance of this regulation on what he terms the control by Parliament of the power of taxation, and he contended that the Government, in doing something which amounted to ignoring a vote of the Senate, was bringing this branch of the legislature into disrespect. Not one word did he say regarding the justice or otherwise of the imposition of this excise, except as to the method by which the Government had applied it. He gave no reason whatever for disagreeing to the tax and its incidence on the people engaged in the industry.  His  case was built up solely on the fear that the Senate would be brought into disrepute by the Government&#39;s action. Any member of the Labour party who makes such a charge in this chamber should hold down his head in shame because, if there was ever a government that brought this noble chamber  into disrepute, it was the Scullin Government of the same party as that now in opposition. That Government deliberately flouted the wishes of the Senate, not once, but a dozen times. After the Transport Workers Regulations had been disallowed many times,

Every honorable senator has the right to move for the disallowance of regulations, and it is advisable, in order to retain a right, to exercise it.

I have had several interviews with the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> with a view to bringing this form of tax into the realm of sanity, because I still disagree with the methods employed by the Government. For this reason, and because the Ministry would not agree to my motion for the adjournment of the debate when the Gold Tax Bill was being discussed in the&#34; Senate, I voted against the Government. My purpose was to ensure proper consideration of the proposal to tax the gold industry of Australia. I feel confident, as the result of my inquiries, that something will be done to iron out some of the anomalies clue to the imposition of a flat rate of tax. </para>

                    <para>As I said, I have made a number of inquiries, and have had interviews with the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender)</inline> with reference to the incidence of this tax. I have also consulted representatives of the Western Australian Goldfields Prospectors Association. During the recess I visited Kalgoorlie three times in order to meet the prospectors, who, I feel sure, are fully aware of what actually happened in connexion with the Gold Tax Bill in September last. They are anxious that some relief should be provided for those whose return approximates the basic wage. Many prospectors earn less than the basic wage. I have tried to impress upon the Acting Treasurer the need for some form of relief for these men, numbering about 800 in Western Australia. I &#39;understand that a validating bill will come before the Senate during this session and that it will contain some provisions exempting prospectors. Whilst not wishing to panies.  One glaring instance shows that say anything that might be regarded as a threat, I tell the Government that if some such relief be not given in a validating bill, I shall have fo consider my position and probably vote against the Government. </para>

                            <para>- I have sufficient faith in the Assistant Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McBride)</inline> and his colleagues, especially the Acting Treasurer, to rest assured that the position of prospectors will be dealt with in a validating measure. Some such provision should apply, also to lowergrade non-dividend-paying mines. A very large number of miners in Western Australia, working low-grade propositions, have been responsible for the production of a huge quantity of gold, although very many of them have not been profitable enough to pay dividends. Those who venture their capital in the exploitation of mining shows are entitled to a return in the form of dividends. In Western Australia many lower-grade mines have not paid dividends during the last two or three years. I hope that the Government will seriously consider their position and grant similar exemptions, only stepped up somewhat, as I have asked for on behalf of prospectors. </para>

                    MacDONALD.There are so many matters requiring attention in connexion with the gold-mining industry that the time is ripe for the Treasurer or the Taxation Department to consult with the industry concerning the most equitable method for the imposition of this tax. All of the representatives to whom I have spoken are unanimous that, especially during the war, the industry must contribute its quota to the success of the British Empire effort. But there is not unanimity as to the method to be employed for the imposition of the tax. I am, however, convinced that any difficulties that stand in the way may be overcome. To this end I urge the Acting Treasurer to consult representatives of the industry, so as to obtain a clear-cut idea of the most appropriate method for the collection of this tax, instead of merely making a stab in the dark by the application of a flat rate.

                        <para>--In that country conditions in the gold-mining industry, are totally different from those obtaining in,- say, Western Australia. I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> that the figure which he has mentioned, &#163;7 10s. an ounce, is on a sterling basis, which is equivalent to about &#163;9 7s. 6d. a fine ounce, so that the Commonwealth Government is taking very little less than the tax levied in South Africa. Also, as I have said, mining conditions in South Africa are totally different. The government there helps the industry in ways that would not be tolerated in Australia. Eoi- instance, it assists in obtaining black labour for the industry and the South African Government enjoys additional benefits from the proceeds of the sale of gold. In the 1939 issue of <inline font-style="italic">Skinner&#39;s</inline><inline font-style="italic">South African Mining Journal</inline> - a very interesting publication - reference is made to the amounts which the Government of the Union of South Africa receives from the mining com-  the Government received a colossal sum in return for benefits extended to certain companies. I refer to the Modderfontein leases, which are known as the Government Gold-Mining Areas. The accounts for 1927, which are the last to be published, show that the profit of that mine was &#163;3,01S,000, that the dividend paid to the shareholders was &#163;1,200,000, and the amount paid to the Government, &#163;1,700,000. It will be seen that the Government received more than was paid to the shareholders. The conditions which obtain in South Africa cannot be applied to gold-mining in Western Australia. </para>

                    <para>I remind the Senate that this motion for the disallowance of a regulation is an attempt to forestall the debate on the validating bill when it is presented to this chamber. The action of the Leader of the Opposition will not lead to the more efficient management of gold-mining If this motion were carried - and of that there does not appear to be much chance - the Government would have to refund to the industry the amount which it has already collected under the  excise, amounting to probably &#163;200,000, or even &#163;250.000. The whole subject of the taxation of gold-mining would then be put into the melting pot, in which event the Government, instead of taking the &#163;1,000,000 which it proposes to obtain by means of the excise, would probably revert to its former proposal to take &#163;1,500,000. </para>

                            <para>- By throwing the whole question into the melting pot we may do a disservice to the gold-mining industry, which I am sure the Leader of the Opposition does not desire. As the weeks pass, the expenditure on defence grows apace, and it may be that the Government would seize the opportunity tl&#62; obtain from the gold mining industry more than &#163;1,000,000. Since that amount was decided upon, the price of gold has risen 2s. an ounce. </para>

The members of the Prospectors&#39; Association know the conditions in the industry much better than do honorable senators opposite. I conclude by repeating that the inadequacy of the attention devoted by the Labour party to this subject is equalled by the inattention given to it by the Government. That is the reason why on a previous occasion I voted against the Government, and why on this occasion I shall vote against the motion of the Leader of the Opposition. </para>

                    <para class="block">On the occasion referred to, the honorable gentleman took strong exception to the action of the Government in introducing that legislation. He then contended that the only logical way to tax gold-mining was by the imposition- of a tax on profits. Since then representatives of the Chamber of Mines have probably told him that they are prepared to accept the Government&#39;s proposal in preference to a tax on profits. Accordingly, the honorable senator is not now willing to assist the Opposition to disallow the regulation. He attempts to justify his change of front by saying that he has made representations to the Minister and is confident, that something will be done for the prospectors. I remind him that the case for the prospectors was put before the Senate when the bill was under discussion, as was also the claim of the companies working low-grade ores. I have not so great a knowledge of gold.mining as lias <inline font-weight="bold">Senator</inline> Cunningham,  but I do know that the application of this excise will be disastrous to men working in a small way, who have to cart their ore 30 or 40 miles. The large mining companies are making such enormous  profits  that they prefer an excise on gold to a tax on profits. </para>

                            <para>- No; but as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald has intimated that he will not support the motion for the disallowance of the regulation, the hill will probably be passed. If we must accept the less of two evils, I say in all sincerity to the Assistant Minister that the bill should contain provision to protect those engaged in gold-mining in a small way. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald is not alone, in having consulted with the men who are engaged in gold-mining at Kalgoorlie, Coolgardie and elsewhere. I am concerned particularly with the men who from time to time win small quantities of gold. Under the financial emergency legislation in operation in Western Australia, a wage-earner has to pay a tax of 4-}d. on every &#163;1 by which his income exceeds the basic wage, and if at the end. of the financial year his aggregate earnings do not exceed a specified amount the tax is refunded. In these circumstances the Government, should give some consideration to the men conducting gold-mining operations on a small scale, many of whom do not receive the equivalent of the basic wage and find it exceedingly difficult to make a living. I trust that provision will be made in the validating bill to exempt prospectors. Apparently <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald. intends to oppose the motion because some influential persons prefer to pay the excise now imposed rather than a tax on profits. </para>

                        <para>. - Honorable senators opposite have dealt at length with the position of those engaged in the gold mining industry, and particularly prospectors; but in doing so, they have overlooked the effect of the motion moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> Had the honorable senator been able to show that the Government is endeavouring to defy a decision of this chamber, I should have supported him. What do the regulations accomplish? They have been promulgated under the National Security Act, but they do not enable any government, however eager it may he to collect taxes, to levy such taxes. When the decision &#187;f the Senate on the Gold Tax Bill became known, the Government tabled an excise schedule in the House of Representatives in which provision was made for the imposition of a rate of tax lower than that provided in the bill which the Senate rejected. Excise has been levied in the customary manner, and the allowance or disallowance of these regulations will have no effect whatever on the duty imposed, this debate is futile. Excise duties tabled in the House of Representatives have to be agreed to by Parliament, and when they arc before the Senate, honorable senators have an opportunity to debate them. It is wrong to suggest that the action of the Government in this instance has been taken in defiance of a decision of this branch of the legislature. All that the Government has done has been to promulgate certain regulations to facilitate the collection of the excise duty imposed.&#34; Under regulation, the export of gold from Australia is prohibited, and sales can be made only through the Commonwealth Bank. The privileges of the Senate have not been violated in any way, because the Government has the power to table an excise schedule whenever it so desires. The proper time to request amendments will be when the schedule is before this chamber. We can then act on behalf of those who we think may be penalized. </para>

For a moment I was &#39;under the impression that taxation was being imposed under these regulations, but I find that they are only of a machinery character. I doubt whether power is provided in the National Security Act to impose taxes by regulations. </para>

Perhaps the honorable senator, who possesses such a logical mind, has not had time to read the statutory rule. For his benefit, I point out that it covers definitions, the method of collection, and arrangements for the payment of duty through the Commonwealth Bank, which is constituted the agent of the Government.. There are other provisions dealing with other matters, including refunds of duty to producers of any amount overpaid. </para>

                            <para>- Apparently, if the Senate had passed that measure, every thing in the garden would have been lovely. However, the Senate rejected the bill, and the Government promptly imposed an excise duty. Now, it is for us to wait until we have an opportunity to consider the duty. Then we can insist on such amendments to that excise as will give relief to men who are doing a very valuable service for this country by going into the outback and producing gold. That, however, is beside the question now before us, because we should not help them . in the slightest degree by adopting this motion. All we should accomplish would be to upset the detailed arrangements of the Government, for collecting an excise duty which is perfectly lawful. I suggest that we should wait until that duty comes before the Senate in due course, when we may voice our views regarding the importance of the gold-mining industry to this country, and to the world at large. </para>

                            <para>- The policy of the Government is unwise, particularly when we can assist the Empire so much in the present war by increasing our gold output. Undoubtedly this is one of our most valuable industries. The Government of Western Australia has strenuously protested against this tax. The duty is wrong in principle, and I go so fa,r as to describe it as unconstitutional. Having done all in its power to foster this industry, the Government of Western Australia is greatly discouraged by the action of the Commonwealth Government, which apparently desires to reap all of the benefits resulting from the State governments&#39; work on behalf of the industry. This duty is cruel and unjust in its incidence. Undoubtedly, gold plays an important part in maintaining our credit overseas. It is vital to our economic welfare as a whole. No one can deny that. I do not agree with <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald&#39;s remarks as to the views held by prospectors concerning this tax. In recent weeks I have been closely in touch with prospectors in Western Australia, and invariably they expressed opposition to any tax on price. They suggested that the only just method of taxing the industry was on the basis of profit. One man told me that in eleven months he had found 4 ounces of gold. He will be obliged to pay tax on those 4 ounces. That is most unfair. During the last war a request was made to the gold-mining industry throughout the Empire to increase production as much as possible. This tax will have the effect of discouraging production. The Government, therefore, will be making a serious mistake if it continues to levy the impost. </para>

                    <para>In view of the fact that the profitable mines in Western Australia are working on low values and owe their success wholly to present high prices, the only fair and equitable method of taxing the industry is on a profit basis. Through the expansion of the mining industry in Western Australia in recent years, employment has been found for 10,000 additional men, whilst to-day the value of gold produced in that State is &#163;10,000,000 greater than it was about ten years ago. Obviously this increased production has contributed in a large measure to the maintenance of our favorable trade balance and our credits overseas. I repeat that any tax on price is wrong in principle. If it wishes to treat the gold-mining industry fairly, the Government will abandon the excise duty on gold and substitute a tax on profits. </para>

                    <para>I Was privileged on Sunday last to address a public meeting at Ballarat. I remarked that parliamentary democracy based on private individual property relations had gone forever, and that we  noW  had a parliamentary dictatorship based on private monopoly relations. An interjector asked &#34; What about Australia &#34;. I replied that this change applied to Australia, and that just as dictatorships had arisen in Europe they would be established in Australia, unless the people take a definite stand against them. </para>

                            <para>- It was profoundly impressed when I stated that,  although  a bill providing for a gold tax had been &#39; defeated in the Senate in accordance with the Constitution, a regulation had been brought down a few minutes afterwards to provide for the levying of the same tax by means of an excise duty. I pointed out that the Government Was acting consistently Avith the policy to  which  it Was committed - that of conserving the interests of big business. I was asked how a gold tax would affect those interests, and 1 explained that the tax as imposed and collected by the Government applied to all concerned in the industry, irrespective of their ability to meet the impost. All people who produce gold are taxed, not in accordance with their ability to pay, but so that the tax will be spread over as many people as possible, in the interests of the gold monopolists in this country. If profits instead of prices  were  taxed, the profits of the companies would be reduced to the extent of the tax. But, when prices are taxed, every body concerned .is compelled to pay the levy. Thousands of the men who are now engaged in searching for gold  have  very small incomes, yet they will have to pay the tax, even though they may not be receiving the equivalent of the basic  wage. </para>

                            <para>- If the honorable senator were in the witness box, I think that any impartial jury would convict him of perjury, and, in saying that, I do not reflect on the honorable gentleman personally. I desire to know why the Government asked the Senate for additional power to impose a tax on gold, when we arc assured by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride, Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan, and others well qualified to speak, that the Government already has full power in the matter. In my opinion, the Government had an ulterior motive in bringing down a bill which its own supporters say was unnecessary. The Government refuses to state the reason for its action. </para>

                    <para>The gold industry is different in many respects from other industries. It is one in which poor as well as rich men are engaged. It is very different from an industry such as that controlled by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which has a monopoly. Many miners are engaged in treating old dumps by means of the cyanide process, which enables them to secure an income of a few pounds a week, which they could not obtain in that way if the price of gold were not high. I suggest that the increase of the price of gold is due, first, to the inflationary policy of practically every country, including Australia, and, secondly, to the demand for gold for war purposes. We are told that the price now paid in the United States of America for Australian gold is &#163;10 13s. an ounce, and we receive in return for it a credit on the ledger or commodities. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has said, gold, at the inflated price, buys less to-day of many commodities. It might interest honorable senators supporting the Government, if, apart from lip service, they have any interest in this matter, to know that, in terms of gold, the present basic wage is about 25s. below what it was in 1907. In that year the basic wage was &#163;2 2s. a week; to-day it is &#163;4 ls., but the purchasing power of the pound note has depreciated by more than 62 per cent. This represents, in round figures, a reduction of the purchasing power of the present basic wage, compared with the basic wage in 1907, by about 25s. </para>

                            <para>- There was never a time in the history of this country when so many thousands of men, women and children depended on Government relief. All that we have done since 1907 up to to-day has been to stabilize poverty. There was never a time when so many children in Australia were suffering from malnutrition, or when so many thousands of adults were prevented from earning a decent livelihood. This afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> directed attention to the fact that thousands of citizens of Brisbane were reduced to the bread-line despite the fact that we have more foodstuffs - more wheat, more eggs, more butter and more meat - than we know what to do with. In terms of goods we were never richer; in terms of actual purchasing power of the basic wage, we were never poorer. The price of wheat was never lower and the price of bread was never higher. </para>

                    <para>I join with other honorable senators in supporting the motion because I can see what is coming. This Government, consistent with its principles, and because it is tolerated by the people, is giving effect to its policy of defying the will of Parliament on every occasion that it. deems fit to do so. So long as we refuse to acquiesce in what the Ministry does, it willcontinue to defy Parliament when it suits its convenience to do so. Notwithstanding that its policy was challenged in the Senate, which defeated its original proposal to levy a tax on gold, it imposed the tax in defiance of the will of this Parliament. In order to justify their action all sorts of specious arguments are being employed by Government supporters who should know better. It has been stated that the tax will stand because the Government is determined to retain it. This motion was necessary in order that we might be able to inform the people that we are opposed to any executive act, the purpose of which is to defy the will of Parliament. If we on this side had not taken this stand, we should not be able to justify our existence as a Labour party. It has been said that Labour is split on this issue. That is not true. Our leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> submitted his motion this afternoon with the full approval of the party. </para>

                            <para>- Finally, I desire to refer to the hope expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald that in future the Government will confer with the representatives of industry before again acting in a similar way. When he made that statement I wondered whether the honorable senator was serious, because I could not imagine the Government doing anything of. the kind. Even if it desired to do so, with whom would it confer? Did the honorable senator mean the directors of the mining companies, and if so, how does he think that arrangements could be made to meet them all? Did he mean that the Government should confer with officials of the Mine Owners Association, or with the mine managers, who would act under instructions from the mine-owners? Or did he mean that the Government should confer with representatives of the labour organizations? I cannot imagine the present Government even attempting to do anything of the kind. The mere expression of such a hope will not assist <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, or any one else. I can see no way out of the difficulty but to challenge the Government all along the line. It has given ample evidence that it intends to act in a dictatorial way, rather than in a legislative capacity. In the future we can expect more of government  by regulation and less of government by legislation than in the past. The protest that is contained in this motion is both timely and justified, but it will have to receive more solid support from the people if the Government is to change its policy. </para>

                        <para>.- The Senate is engaged in debating a motion by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> for the disallowance of Statutory Rule No. 100 of 1939. The action taken by the honorable senator is constitutional, for the law provides that either House of the Parliament may disallow a regulation made by the Government within fifteen days of such regulation having been tabled in the Parliament. What are the facts in connexion with this matter? The Government, acting under the powers, conferred upon it by the Constitution, endeavoured to persuade the Parliament to grant to it the power to levy a tax upon the price of gold in excess of that which obtained on a certain date. In accordance with the long-established practice of the mother of parliaments, hills imposing taxes must originate in the popular house. The Government was able to persuade the other chamber of the legislature to approve of the tax, but that did not end the procedure; the consent of this chamber also was necessary. Honorable senators know that the Senate has not the power to amend money bills; it can make requests for amendments or it can refuse to pass the measure. Acting within those powers, the Senate refused to pass legislation designed to give to the Government the power that it desired. Almost immediately after the Parliament adjourned, the Government decided to do by regulation what the legislature had refused to allow it to do. </para>

                            <para>- Some honorable senators believed that the proposal of the Government was a departure from the established practice in connexion with the raising of taxes; others objected because they were of the opinion that profits, rather than prices, should be taxed; still others believed that if the Government were granted this power a great injury would be inflicted on the industry concerned. This afternoon the merits of the proposed tax, rather than the merits of the motion before the Senate, were discussed by many speakers. I remind the Senate that the motion before it aims at the disallowance of a regulation which the mover claimed was promulgated behind the back of Parliament. This afternoon <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald endeavoured to lead the Senate to believe that he had some inside information as to the intention of the Government in respect of some future legislation. That is not the matter at issue; the question is whether or not this chamber should assert the right conferred upon it by statute to disallow a regulation issued by the Government. </para>

                            <para>- The Labour party does not intend to sabotage the Senate, as honorable senators opposite would do. The action of the Government, against which this motion protests, tends to bring discredit upon the Senate. The&#34; attitude of honorable senators who voted against the proposed tax, but to-day are opposing this motion and are endeavouring by specious reasoning to salve their consciences, is amazing. In other words, they are bending to the pressure that has been brought to bear upon them by those interests which would rather see legislation of this kind in operation than be required to pay a tax upon profits. Those honorable senators who are prepared to yield to pressure are not concerned with the dignity and powers of the Senate, or with the preservation of the rights and privileges that have been held dearly by every British parliament. The Labour party is not prepared to allow this country to drift until its government becomes similar to that which exists in another country with which the British Empire is now at war. One of the reasons for engaging in the present war is that we believe that the totalitarian form of government should be destroyed. Yet, under the pressure of war conditions, an attempt is being made to introduce into this country a similar form of government. It is true that the Parliament has vested certain powers in the Executive, but should the Parliament disagree with a policy upon which the Government has embarked, the Government is in duty  bound  to accept the decision of the elect of the people; it should not go behind Parliament to do by regulation what the legislature has refused it permission to do. Surely this branch of the legislature which has been affronted has the right to say to the Government that it shall not do this thing, and therefore the Senate should disallow the regulation referred to in the motion before it. As the Leader of the Opposition said in introducing his motion, the point at issue takes us back many years in the history of constitutional government. The honorable gentleman referred to the struggle to take from the Crown and vest in the Parliament the right to levy tribute on the people. This regulation seeks to levy taxes which the Parliament refused to sanction. </para>

I do not pose as a constitutional authority, but I do know that this Parliament refused to sanction the action which the Government has taken. I shall cite one or two authorities on the principle involved. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Cecil</inline> S.

                        <para>The legislature has from its earliest individual existence claimed the function of being the sole authority for the raising of money for the purpose of government. The right to exercise this function was formerly reiterated in the Bill of Rights, 1088, in which there appeared the clause &#34; Levying money for or to the use of the Crown by pretence of prerogative -without grant of parliament for longer time or in other manner than the same is or shall be granted is illegal &#34;. The check on the compliance with this principle is usually applied through the judiciary, and . will accordingly call for treatment in a later chapter. It is possible therefore to pass at once to an examination of the manner in which the legislature checks the expenditure by -the executive of money duly and properly raised for the public service. </para>

In view of the fact that millions of men are likely to be engaged in slaughter for the preservation of our democratic institutions, honorable senators opposite should at least endeavour to give this subject the consideration it deserves, and they should not by flippant and irrelevant interjections try to belittle the statements I am making. This regulation is closely related to the subject of taxation. </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite will endeavour by specious argument to bolster up the case of the Government, which they know could not be. sustained before any judicial tribunal. Whether the method adopted is the best means to raise revenue is beside the point. What we have to determine is whether the Government has the power under a regulation made under the National Security Act to ignore a decision reached by Parliament. Some honorable senators have directed attention to the difficulties experienced by prospectors, many of whom it is said cannot bear the burden of this additional impost, but there are also many mining companies which are working at a loss and upon which the tax will he a very heavy burden. </para>

                            <para>- The Leader of the Opposition has moved for the disallowance of this regulation because we believe that the Government has made a determined attempt to defy the decision of this branch of the legislature. &#34; When the party whip is cracked, honorable senators opposite, who know that the Government has acted wrongly, are brought to heel. A few months ago <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> was indignant when the Government issued a regulation prohibiting the export of iron ore from Australia. Tonight he merely raises irrelevant objections when we .protest against similar action by the Government. Here, I suggest, we have an explanation of why responsible government has disappeared in other countries, and is fast disappearing in this country. Our people&#34; are slowly but surely losing faith in our democratic institutions because the Government makes laws behind the back of Parliament. If for no other reason but to assure the people of Australia that we believe in democratic government and respect the rights of the elect of the people, honorable senators should agree to the motion. In different circumstances we might pardon the Government for issuing a regulation of this kind, but when it makes a regulation deliberately to affront this branch of the legislature we must endeavour to disallow it. The imposition of the excise duty on gold under our tariff legislation is not at issue, and the argument that, even were we to adopt this motion the Government could continue to collect this tribute from the gold-mining industry, is also irrelevant. Honorable senators should concentrate on the real issue at stake in this matter. This motion has been submitted with a view to preserving to Parliament its right to say &#34; aye &#34; or &#34; nay &#34; to the intentions of the government of the day, irrespective of the political complexion of that government. In all circumstances we must defend that right of the Parliament. If we depart from that established principle we shall experience in another form the new despotism, which was apparent during the last war, and of which we have heard so much in this debate, That is the issue before honorable senators at the moment, and they should disregard entirely every other issue. We are not now concerned whether the Great Boulder Company, or any other wealthy gold-mining company, financed by overseas capital, might or might not escape its just measure of tax. We are simply concerned at the moment with the preservation of the democratic rights of the Australian people. That is the issue before us to-night. For that reason every honorable senator should support the motion, particularly when, as senators,  we  represent  the people as  a whole, and constitute a truly democratic chamber,  in  which the intricacies  of  electoral boundaries and vested interests  do  not operate. </para>

                        <para>. - I listened with interest to the lecture just given by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> on constitutional reform, but I should have preferred him to confine himself to the motion before the Senate and to direct to that question some of the wisdom with which he seems to be endowed. &#34;When the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> was submitting this motion I was reminded of an incident which occurred many years ago in a South Australian district in which I lived. At the time a drought was being experienced, and some of the good folk in the district requested the minister at the local church to set aside a day of prayer for rain. The minister, who was very practical, and also Scotch, replied, &#34; What is the good of praying for rain while we have an east wind ? &#34; That remark can be aptly applied to the Leader of the Opposition in respect of the Government&#39;s original proposal to tax gold. When, the Gold Tax Bill was before this chamber he declared that the Opposition would not oppose it, but as the debate proceeded the wind veered, and, reluctant to miss a golden opportunity to embarrass the Government, he saw to it that the voting was even and the  bill  consequently rejected. In expounding his arguments to-day the honorable senator did not say one  word  against the excise, duty itself, but simply objected to the way in which it had been imposed. In his <inline font-style="italic">resume</inline> of the development of parliamentary government  he  dealt with legislation by regulation. Personally, I am opposed to abuse by any government of legislation by regulation, but, as the honorable senator is well aware, occasions arise when a government is obliged to adopt such a method. If, as the honorable senator contends, his motion has no bearing on the excise duty itself, I do not think he can say for a moment that the Government imposed that duty without the authority of Parliament. It imposed it under the National Security Act, which is similar to the War Precautions Act enacted in the last war by a government politically akin to the present Opposition. One honorable senator from Western Australia suggested that the Government should not have imposed the duty under that legislation because,  he  said, the National Security Act was framed with the object of protecting us from our enemies. Surely, it is quite reasonable to invoke that act in order to protect ourselves from our internal, as well as our external, enemies. </para>

                        McLACHLAN.The Great Boulder Gold mining Company in Western Australia cannot be said to be poor. We have been told that an excise duty is a direct tax on production. I remind honorable senators who raise that objection to this regulation that we have several taxes of that kind, including the excise duty on wine. Perhaps, I can take it judging from their remarks, that honorable senators opposite during next summer will refuse to have a drink of beer because beer is subject to an excise duty. I urge honorable senators to look at this matter reasonably. On the 31st August the price of goldwas ?9 8s. 7d. an oz., whereas to-day it is ?10 13s. an oz. This gives  a profit over &#163;9 of 16s. 6d. ian oz. to the Government, and 16s. 6d. an oz. to the producer. Although the Government 19 better off to-day by 16s. 6d. an oz., the producer is receiving 8s. an oz. more than he was receiving on the 31st August.

                            <para>- No. This tax falls not on the gold producers, but on shareholders throughout Australia. An honorable senator from Western Australia cited the Wiluna Gold-mining Company as being in sore distress ; but I maintain that any mine winning gold, which is worth &#163;10 13s. an oz., or, with the excise duty deducted, &#163;9 16s. 6d. an oz., is doing well. The position of the prospector has been mentioned in this debate because it is convenient to argue that the gold tax has been imposed on the poor man. There are nearly 800 prospectors in Western Australia, and they do not rely so much on the small quantities of gold- that they find from time to time as they do upon their chances of striking a reef that may prove to be a payable proposition. </para>

It is only fair that the money required should come from the people generally, and from those who have most of it. Why it should be suggested that those connected with the gold-mining industry should be exempt from taxation I do not know. </para>

                            <para>- The tax is being imposed on excess profits, in that it is collected only in respect of the amount by which the price realized for gold exceeds &#163;9 an ounce. One honorable senator from Western Australia pointed out that the Senate, being a States&#39; House, should protect State rights. I quite agree; but we should protect those rights only as they affect the whole of Australia, and, in this case, I am afraid that our friends from Western Australia are anxious about the gold tax simply because it affects mainly their own State. I remind those honorable senators that, when the gold mining industry was in such a low condition that it could not be carried on successfully, this Parliament granted a bounty on gold which enabled the industry to recover. At that time the price of gold was about &#163;4 an ounce, but to-day it has increased by over 150 per cent. I feel sure that honorable senators, in their good judgment, will not support the Leader of the Opposition on this occasion, and I am almost positive that some honorable senators who did not support the Government on its original proposal will do so to-night. </para>

                        <para>. - Having misinterpreted the remarks of some members of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan has been unfair. The Opposition is as bitterly opposed to the exploiter of gold-miners as to the exploiter in any other industry, and no honorable senator on this side is anxious to assist those who are making excessive profits from gold. It is grossly unfair for honorable senators on the tory side to give a false impression to the public of the remarks made by members of the Opposition. We recognize that the commencement of the great struggle in </para>

During the progress of the war, prices of many commodities will no doubt be excessive. Under the present system of finance, there will be inflation, but will honorable senators opposite contend that heavy excise duties should be imposed on industries in which prices are inflated? </para>

                        MacDonald, in the course of his backing and filling, has fallen from grace. At the outset, he took a stand along with that champion of the rightsof Western Australia,

                        against the imposition of the gold tax in the way in which the Government sought to impose it, but now he. has thrown in his lot with &#39; the Government. While he was performing a somersault he patted himself on the back. I am always amazed at the mental contortions of some honorable senators opposite.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline>
                        MacDonald would have us believe that he alone is interested in, and has done something for, the struggling gold prospectors. The truth is that members of the Labour party have always striven to improve the lot of this section of .cold-seekers. We voted against the Government&#39;s proposal to impose a tax on gold, and we are taking action now in the hope that the Senate will disallow the regulation that &#34;was promulgated in defiance of this chamber.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline>
                        MacDonald has &#34; turned turtle &#34;. He now intends to support the Government which imposed this tax on struggling prospectors.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline>
                        refuses to do any somersaulting. For that we give him due credit. The honorable gentleman stands firmly by his convictions on this issue.

No amount of specious pleading can dispose of the fact that the Government&#39;s original proposal to impose a tax on gold was defeated. To say that it was rejected but not defeated is merely to juggle with words. If honorable senators who are now supporting the Government were in opposition, they would certainly take the stand that a Government which had done what this Government has done was flouting the decision of Parliament. No one can deny that the Government&#39;s Gold Tax Bill was defeated in a constitutional manner, and if Government supporters now vote against this motion they will be lending support to action which is contrary to the principles of parliamentary government. </para>

When it attempted to do so., it was defeated, as I have stated, by a hostile Senate. </para>

I admit that in disallowing those regulations the Senate was within its rights, but it does not follow tint this Government, which, we are told, believes in, and is fighting for, the survival of democracy, should do what it thinks fit in defiance of Parliament.

If the Labour party was wrong in 1931 - and Government supporters declare that it was wrong - that is no reason why we should remain silent in regard to a wrong done by this Government. I very well remember listening to a number of Tory speakers during the campaign that preceded the defeat of the Scullin Government. They declared! that the action of the Scullin Government in promulgating regulations which the Senate disallowed was a negation of democracy. Now, simply because it suits their purpose, these supporters of a Tory Ministry prefer to regard similar action by this Government as democracy <inline font-style="italic">in excelsis.</inline> And they dare to say that they are not turning political somersaaults ! </para>

                        <para>. - We have been given to understand that whatever decision is reached by the Senate on this motion the Government, by some subterfuge, will retain the tax on gold. The regulation provides for the disposal of a certain unspecified tax which &#39; is imposed by &#39;excise. The original bill which was rejected by the Senate imposed a tax of 75 per cent, on the price of gold in excess of &#163;9 a fine ounce. Theexcise which replaces the rejected proposal provides for a tax of 50 per cent, of the excess price. But the regulation does not enact that all gold produced must be delivered to the Commonwealth </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">Bank or its agents. There is a loophole in it. I believe that companies producing gold could send sufficient of the metal to the bank to pay their expenses, and could hold the remainder until the war was over. Under an act passed by the parliament of Western Australia a tax is levied to recompense the Government for money which it disburses to miners who contract occupational diseases. Among miners in Western Australia industrial diseases are many and extensive, and for that reason the State Government has imposed a tax to meet the cost of combating those diseases. The Commonwealth Government has added a further tax. The Gold Tax Bill was negatived in this chamber on the 20th September. Three days later a regulation, similar in effect to the rejected bill, was promulgated. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald reached Kalgoorlie on the 27th September, where, I understand, he was met by representatives of the Chamber of Mines, with the result that he remained there in order to consult with them further. On the 28th September, he is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Western Australian</inline> as having said that his heart was bleeding for the small prospectors and that he proposed to do something for them. It is significant that the Chamber of Mines is in favour of the Government&#39;s present proposal. That is because a. large proportion of the gold obtained in this country is won by small men. The imposition of this duty means that the levy is spread over the whole of them, and thus the big companies are saved from heavier taxation. </para>

                            <para>- In my opinion, it would be better if there were no tax at all on gold. I predict that the tax will be removed if the war and the destruction of shipping continue, making it difficult to establish a favorable balance of trade. In such circumstances, gold would be the only commodity which would enable us to meet our commitments overseas. Then, instead of taxing gold, it would be better to expend, say, &#163;2,000,000, in order to encourage an increased production of gold. The Government speaks of gold  as  if it were the only commodity whose price has been increased since the war began. There is a precious metal known as cinnabar. The British Government has prohibited its exportation and told us to get it from Italy. Recently, two promising finds of cinnabar in New South Wales have been reported. I am informed that one organization has told the discoverers that, if given a working option for six months with the right to a further extension of six months, it will pay to the owner 10 per cent. of its nett profits. At the beginning of the war that metal cost 5s. 6d. per lb. A fortnight later the price rose to 9s. 6d. per lb. Not long afterwards, it jumped to 19s. per lb. and three days ago it reached &#163;1 5s. per lb. Is the Government prepared to say to those engaged in that industry, as it says to the prospectors for gold, that it will impose a tax on the excess profit? Many minerals are required for the successful prosecution of the war, particularly for use in the manufacture of munitions. Because of the war, the price of wolfram has increased by &#163;100 a ton. Similarly, there has been an increase of &#163;70 a ton in the price of antimony since the commencement of the war. The price of asbestos during the same period has risen by &#163;20 a ton ; of manganese, by &#163;15 . a ton; and of magnesite, by &#163;150 a ton. Prices of copper, feldspar and other minerals have advanced tremendously. Does the Government intend to treat all these cases alike? Most of these mines are operated by wealthy people. </para>

I should like the Minister to enlighten me as to whether the mandate granted by the League of Nations in respect of New Guinea does not contain a provision that all taxes imposed on the people of New Guinea shall be expended in that territory. We are told that the tax on gold is necessary for war purposes. What is the position in respect of gold produced in New Guinea? In making this regulation the Government has gone behind the back of the Parliament. </para>

                            <para>- The Government was placed in power in order to carry on the work of this country. Since it assumed office, it has been faced with the greatest crisis in the history of the world, and, naturally, it has to find additional money for the prosecution of the war in which it is engaged. We on this side are constantly blamed for not being willing to vote sufficient money for social services, and the requirements of defence. Yet, when the Government brings forward a proposal to augment its revenue by obtaining money from an industry which has not previously been taxed by the Commonwealth, but has, on the contrary, been assisted by bounties, objection is raised. I did not object to the payment of those bounties, but during recent years the price of gold has increased, and the industry is no longer in need of assistance. Indeed, it is today in a better position than anyother industry. </para>

                            <para>- An industry which is able to pay taxes should be called upon to do so in a time of emergency like the present. Members of the Opposition who claim that money should be obtained from profitable companies should support this proposal. Why was this regulation necessary? A bill to impose what was believed to be a reasonable tax on the excess price of gold due to the war was defeated in the Senate, and the Government had to find other means of raising revenue from that source. Consequently, it promulgated the regulation with which the Senate is now dealing. It is wrong to say that the proposal contained in the regulation is exactly the same as was embodied in the bill which was defeated. It is certainly a tax on the gold industry, but it ia different from the Government&#39;s original proposal. Moreover, the proposal of the Government meets with the approval of the industry generally. </para>

In the circumstances, the gold mining industry should pay its fair share of the cost. I shall give to the Senate a few figures in order to show that that industry can pay a  reasonable  tax. Accepting as a basis the figure 1000 for 1928-29, the following table shows the present position of a number of industries : - </para>

                            <para>- I realize that; but I am dealing with Commonwealth taxes. Had an excise duty not been imposed when the Gold Tax Bill was defeated in this chamber, the Government would have been unable to collect anything from the industry until some other tax had been imposed. As the gold-mining industry is the only primary industry that has shown such marked improvement during the last ten years, it should make some contributions to the national revenue. The excise duty now in force has to be validated by  Parliament,  and should the validating bill be not passed, the money which has already been collected will have to be refunded. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston,</inline> who admitted that those engaged in the industry are willing to assist in the prosecution of the war, believes that the tax should be imposed on profits and not on production. The index figure of the pastoral industry, which in 1928-29 was 1,000, decreased  in  ten years to 657, and that industry  is  paying both Federal and State taxes.  In  these circumstances surely the gold mining industry, which is prosperous, should contribute in some form. </para>

                        <para>. -  Notwithstanding what has been said by the intelligentsia, the members of the Opposition understand clearly the  object  of the regulation which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings} has</inline> moved to disallow. We realize that an excise duty has been imposed, and that this regulation provides the machinery by which it shall be collected; but  the  only way in which we can protest against the manner in which the Government has flouted the decision of the Senate is  by  moving for the disallowance of the regulation. We cannot expect very much from this Hitler-minded Government, which is endeavouring to control the country By regulations rather than  by  statute.  The  voting on the second reading^ of the Gold Tax Bill being equal, the bill under  the  Standing Orders was rejected.. At  that  time the Government was not sure  of the  course it proposed to follow, and  an  excise duty had not then been considered. After the defeat of the  bill <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Arthur,</inline> who was speaking on another measure, was asked by the Minister  for  the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> to ask for leave to continue his remarks  at a  later hour. He did so, and the Minister then obtained leave to move that the Gold  Tax </para>

I believe that certain persons associated with the gold-mining industry had informed the Government that they preferred a tax on production rather than a tax on profits. During a suspension pf the  sittings of this chamber an excise schedule imposing an excise duty on gold was tabled in the House of Representatives, and had the Government not been in such a hurry to get into recess and thus avoid the criticisms which were  being  levelled against it, the matter could have been dealt with during the following week. </para>

                            <para>- In that case the validating measure which the Assistant Minister has forecast will not be necessary. Honorable senators opposite contend that the Scullin Government acted wrongly in repeating a regulation making a law which the Senate of the day had rejected. I submit, however, that the Opposition in the Senate at that time was antagonistic to that law because it was designed to benefit members of the Waterside Workers Federation, and to raise  their  standard of living. . In any ease, i&#39;t seems strange that those honorable senators who complain of the action taken by the Scullin Government at that time are themselves prepared to sanction a similar course on this occasion. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald is opposed to the motion. Obviously, the disallowance of this regulation would interfere with the interests of those people who secured his election to this Parliament. At the same time he is prepared to overlook the fact that it is inimical to the interests of the men who go outback prospecting for gold. The honorable senator is not interested in the claims of those men. In New South Wales, thanks to the Lang Government, an allowance of fi a week is paid to prospectors. This Government, apparently, wishes to grab from those men as much as it can of that amount. I am not concerned in the slightest degree about the interests of gold-mining . companies. That matter is irrelevant to the issue now before us, but it has been contended that the Government should tax the profits of such companies. An honorable senator informed us that one company had made a profit of &#163;1,000,000 on which not one penny of tax had been levied. Such profits should be taxed. This Government, however, is prepared to tax the prospector who might win no more than 10 oz. of gold a year. If he produces 1 oz. of gold he must pay tax on his meagre output if the price of gold be above &#163;9 an ounce, whereas a company -which makes a- profit of &#163;1,000,000 is taxed on a production basis also. That is most unfair. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald claimed that he alone is seeking to assist the prospector. If this Government is so anxious to assist the prospectors why did it not propose to exempt them from tie provisions of the Gold Tax Bill? Who can say that the bill validating the excise duty on gold will not be considered an urgent measure^ and, like the rest of this Government&#39;s legislation, - be gagged through this chamber? We should have heard nothing of the Government&#39;s intention to bring in an amending measure in order to exclude the prospectors from this tax had not the Opposition moved for the disallowance of this regulation. But .for  our action the Government would have been prepared to sit pat on the basis of the Gold Tax Bill, in which no indication was given of any intention on the part of the. Government to consider the claims of the prospectors. I trust that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will vote for the motion. I regret that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald is opposing it, because only last week in the King&#39;s Hall he informed me that he was very anxious that this regulation should be disallowed. Apparently, something has happened in the meantime to account for the honorable senator&#39;s change of front. I sincerely trust that a number of honorable senators opposite will support the motion. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the motion for two important reasons : First, because it involves a vital democratic principle; and, secondly, because gold is a commodity which we need very urgently in a time of war. Tn this war Great Britain and the Empire are fighting for the preservation of democracy. When the Senate rejected the Gold Tax Bill it rejected the principle involved in the&#34; regulation for the disallowance of which the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has now moved. The Assistant Minister is quite correct when he says that the regulation was issued under the provisions of an Act Of Parliament, but the point is that it was issued after a measure which involved the same principle had been rejected by the Senate. The Govern- * ment then took action under the National Security Act. Before I was elected to this chamber I was urged by people throughout Tasmanis  to do my utmost to prevent government by regulation. A similar cry was raised by the people as ft whole in all of the States. I was not long here  before  I heard a very able speech by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator&#39; Wilson</inline> in which he attacked  the evil of legislation by regulation. On that occasion he severely criticized the Government for issuing a regulation prohibiting the export of iron ore from Australia, but his attitude today is at variance with his remarks then. Speaking of legislation by regulation he said, &#34; The effect is to whittle away the authority of this Parliament &#34;. His speech is reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 20th October, 1938, page 954. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister said that they were making large profits, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> also referred to the progress that they had made. I am pleased to hear of their progress^ but I claim that it is only just that they should be taxed. The right way to proceed is to impose a tax that would apply to the companies, and not to the prospectors who cannot afford to bear the impost. It should be a tax that would not prevent the industry from making further progress* That could have been done a couple of months ago, instead of introducing the present, regulation in defiance of the wishes of the Senate. Reference has been made to companies that are making profits amounting to millions of pounds. If the Government knows of such companies, and is not taking action  to see that they assist in paying for the war, it is falling down on its job. The wealthy companies could have been taxed on their profits: Gold is more essential to Australia at the present time than it ever was, but if the Government imposes a tax on the production of gold, the industry will be stifled* The greatly enhanced price of gold has encouraged prospectors to become more active than in the past, and there is every indication that shows which were not payable when the price was low may now prove to be a commercial success. In the last few years, the price of gold has increased to a marked degree, and a further considerable increase is possible in the years to come* Consequently many of the old mines that have been closed down may be reopened ; but, if the Government imposes a duty on the production of gold, the chances of these mines being reopened will disappear. </para>

                    <para>The main reason why production should not be restricted is that Australia needs gold more now than ever before. It requires hundreds of fighting planes and other defence equipment for the protection of the Commonwealth, and gold is required to pay for them. We should have 100 fighting bombers within the next month, and we may need another 500, but how are we to pay for them? We could buy anything we required if we had the necessary gold, and, therefore, it would be foolish to discourage the production of that commodity. If the Government submitted a proposal to tax the profits on gold, the Opposition would support the measure. I hope that the Government will not whittle away the democratic rights of the people by retaining a regulation imposing precisely the same tax as the Senate has already rejected. </para>

                        <para>.- I have listened carefully to the debate, and it has provided the greatest exhibition of shadow-sparring that I have ever witnessed. When this motion was submitted, the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and members of the Opposition generally said that, if the regulation were disallowed by the Senate, the taxation of gold would immediately cease; but all of their arguments have been directed to the point that the Senate should stand on its dignity and see that a proposal which has been rejected by it shall not be persisted in. I point out, however, that whatever be done with regard to the regulation will have no effect on the gold excise. The regulation which the Opposition now seeks to annul is merely a machinery measure for the protection of, not only the gold producers, but also other people, so that they may easily obtain payment for their gold. If the regulation were annulled it might cause temporary annoyance, but this would be experienced mostly by the prospector himself, who would probably have to go to a good deal of trouble to sell his gold. A cry has been raised about the poor prospector, of whom we heard when the price of gold was only &#163;4 an oz. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> &#39; remarked that gold is needed to enable us to pay for bombers, but who is to pay for the gold? The Government does not take the gold, in the first instance; it has to pay the producers for it. The argument has been advanced that the profits of the gold mines should be taxed, but everybody knows that the dividends paid represent simply a return of the capita&#93; that has been invested. A gold mine isa wasting asset, and the profits cannot be ascertained until the value of the ore reserves is known. The annulment of the regulation would accomplish nothing. </para>

I do not know what the changed attitude of the Opposition amounts to, because <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> shows that the Leader of the Opposition remarked that he would not oppose the Gold Tax Bill. He agreed that the money to be raised was necessary for&#39; the carrying on of the war, and he agreed also that the war had caused the increase of the price of gold. But the opportunity arose to embarrass the Government, and, despite the fact that the Opposition had promised to help the Government to win the war, there was a complete turn-over. Whether members of the Opposition scratched their backs in the process of accomplishing a somersault I do not know, but they are quite capable of doing it. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator is as inaccurate in that statement as he is on many other occasions. He knows that the wages paid by manufacturers are fixed- by tribunals over which the employers have no control. He also knows, or he should know, that wages in the manufacturing industry are higher, and that manufacturers are giving more employment than at any other period in Australia&#39;s history. Knowing this, the honorable gentleman still indulges in cheap sneers about manufacturers who are providing good wages for Australian employees whom he is supposed to represent. In his speech this afternoon, the honorable gentleman drew largely upon his imagination. Usually that does not cause me concern, but I do object when he deliberately distorts the facts. The time of the Senate to-day has been occupied - I was about to say wasted - in the discussion of a motion, the carrying of which would not accomplish anything. It would not remove this tax from gold prospectors or any other section of the community. The tax would still be .collected. For this reason, I believe that the purpose of the motion was to embarrass the Government in this great crisis. Although the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> declared that his party would give the strongest support to every measure introduced by the Government that was necessary to uphold the honour of Australia . and defend this country, in this chamber, there has been a strong attempt to-day to take away from the Government the sinews of war - the money that is so urgently needed to make effective the defence of Australia. </para>

                    <para>I am very disappointed with the quality of the debate upon my very simple motion seeking the disallowance of Statutory Rule No. 100. It will be &#34; remembered that I confined my remarks to one phase and one phase only of the question. I said that if Government supporters voted for the motion to disallow the regulation they would be voting to uphold the rights of the Senate as an integral part of the Commonwealth Parliament, which in its turn is an integral part of the British Commonwealth of Nations; but if they voted against it they would declare, in effect, that the Senate had no rights, or at least that they were not concerned as to how much of its rights were taken away. </para>

                            <para>- I took the precaution to find out whether, if I rose to a point of order when the first attempt was made to introduce a side issue, the point would be upheld, and I realized that if it were upheld the scope of the debate would be limited. I emphasized one point only - that  on  the night of the 20th Septem ber, the Senate refused to pass a bill which was then before it, having for its object the imposition of a tax on gold. There has been a great deal of by-play because I said that the bill was defeated. Honorable senators opposite have repeatedly declared that it was not defeated, but was merely rejected. Only a few minutes ago the same asinine observation was again made by a Government supporter. The Oxford dictionary has this to say about the- word &#34;reject&#34; - </para>

                    <para>This Government was, indeed, &#34;worsted in battle or other  Contest&#34;  on the night of the 20th September, but by the 23rd September it had found a way out of its difficulty. My colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour,</inline> put the position very effectively. He told us  this  evening that the rights of members of this chamber, and the civilian rights of the people, were being whittled away by the Executive in the prosecution of a war to uphold democratic principles. We on this side are fighting against the action of the Government in thus attempting &#39;to whittle away  out  rights, and we &#39;are emphasizing the danger that threatens this democratic state. It makes me sorry to hear people talk about what would happen if these regulations were disallowed. What I said about the Scullin Government is confirmation of the attitude which I have adopted &#39;in connexion  with  this regulation, that I am asking the Senate to disallow. In 1931, the Senate twelve times disallowed regulations which were promulgatedby the Scullin Government. That being so, what is wrong with my asking the Senate now to vote for the disallowance of this regulation? Government supporters apparently think that the Senate was right, when it disallowed regulations made by the Scullin Government. What is wrong with my action now in asking for the disallowance of this regulation? </para>

                            <para>- I see. The Assistant Minister does not object to my motion, but his disapproval of my purpose is so definite that he will not supportit and will also induce his supporters to vote against it. That confirms what I said in my opening address. The Assistant Minister and his friends are not interested in safeguarding the democratic rights of the Senate and the principle of parliamentary government. They have not the pluck to stand up for their rights, which, as I have shown and they know, are being whittled away. We have been told that a validating bill will have to be introduced to safeguard the revenue, and that we shall have an opportunity to say all that we may wish to say when that measure is under discussion. With all respect, I say to the honorable gentleman who made that statement, that that is not in accordance with the facts. The Assistant Minister should know that a validating bill need not be introduced. The Government can adjourn Parliament instead of proroguing it. </para>

The doors of Parliament were closed in order that Ministers could geton with their totalitarian methodsof carrying on the government of this country. The introduction of the excise on gold and the promulgation of this regulation was a &#34;snide &#34; processto circumvent the decision of the Senate. </para>

                    <para>SenatorCollings.- That is a matter to which I propose to -refer. I have  never known any anti-Labour Government in this Parliament that objected to the gag in order to get its legislation passed at the end of a session. In one session the Senate was expected to deal with 29 bills on the last sitting day. In the last September period there were, I think, nineteen bills presented on the last day, and the only available course was to apply the gag, which is always objectionable to the Opposition. This process has been resorted to in every session. of this Parliament since I  became  a  member  of this chamber, and I have no doubt that the heirs and assigns of this Government will continue that process. </para>

I have not touched upon one matter that other honorable senators have not raised. The question has just now been raised by the Assistant Minister for Commerce, who should know better. The only time that the Government complained about the gag was when the Opposition was -strong enough, with the assistance of some of the more liberalminded members on the Other side, to use the party machine. Then ministerialists cried &#34;Shame!&#34; <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald said that I had announced my intention to support the Government&#39;s Gold Tax Bill in September last. I did not say anything of the kind. </para>

Do honorable senators opposite suppose that we were so politically foolish as to enable them to get away with a bill of which we did not approve, if we could prevent its passage ?

                            <para>- Every one of us knows what happened. The Opposition has its secret service, as has the Government. We know all about <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald&#39;s recent visit to his electorate. We know how he peregrinated among the mining companies there, and endeavoured to explain that he had done the best thing possible for them. Unfortunately for the honorable senator, the representatives of the mining companies were not in agreement with him. They told him that he ought not to -nave done anything of the kind: because if he were not careful, the Government would impose a tax on profits, which they did not want. They preferred that the tax should be spread over a wider field, which included numbers of men who should not be called upon to pay it. They also agreed that a 50 per cent, tax was better than one of 75 per cent. They believed that if they got away with the lower impost, they would do very well. Until recently, mining companies have not paid any income tax, State or Federal. They do not pay federal income tax now. </para>

                            <para>- For a number of years the Government knew that preparation for the defence of Australia was necessary, yet it has exempted the mining companies from payment of federal income tax. Moreover, with the exception of one or two States, these companies were exempt from State taxation also. While the Government was treating the wealthy mining companies so generously, it imposed a flour tax on the poorer sections of the community because the wheat-growers demanded the justice to which they were entitled. I do not suppose that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> or <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald would vote with us, but I say to the Government that if it will tax every penny of the amount by which the price of gold exceeds &#163;9 an oz., the Opposition will not object, except on the ground that the incidence of the tax would not be acceptable. If the Government will tax profits, we shall vote to take, all of the&#39; profits due to wartime inflation. We are prepared to take that stand in relation to all wartime profits made by, not only gold mining companies, but other companies also. What is wrong with a graduated income tax on the profits of mining companies? What is wrong with putting a tax on all war profits? Why does not the Government impose a wartime excess profits tax? </para>

Before that increase the State governments could not afford to assist prospectors, because the low price of any gold that they won would not have enabled them to repay the amounts advanced. The Premier of Queensland, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forgan</inline> Smith, was here when I made my second-reading speech on the Gold Tax Bill. When I had finished my speech I asked him what he thought of it, and he replied that I was on the right track. He went on to say that his government was subsidizing hundreds of prospectors, but that the bill then before the Senate, if carried, would force them to leave the fields. </para>

                            <para>- I know what happened on the night that the bill was defeated. I have already told the Senate what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> did. Since then attempts have been made to weaken the loyalty of Senators Johnston and Allan MacDonald to the vote that they cast on that occasion. I know that it was even suggested that there might be a double dissolution as the result of that vote. After that, an attempt was made to influence some of my colleagues. It was suggested that one or two of them might be sent on a fishing trip but I am proud that the sixteen of us are as solid to-night as we were on the 20th September. That is more than the Government can say of its supporters. One honorable senator opposite, who voted with us on that occasion, has weakened, and performed what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> facetiously described as a &#34; back somersault &#34;. I hope that it will not be forgotten that action was taken, to bring in this regulation under the National Security Act; nor should it be forgotten that section 18 of that act gives power to the Government to do anything that it likes. I hope also that it will not be forgotten that there is no need to introduce a validating bill, because that act gives to the Government power to do anything that it wishes to do. It has only to take advantage of that act, as advantage was taken of the War Precautions Act during the last war. The Government can, if it likes, get three times the amount of money that it now proposes to take; and, if it does so, the Opposition will support it, although it will not in any circumstances support proposals to tax prices. It will support measures to impose taxes on profits. That has been the attitude of the Labour party all along. </para>

                        said that the money to bc raised by the means proposed by the Government was necessary to carry on the war. I have already said something on that subject, but I remind the Senate &#39;that the Opposition has expressed its determination, and will stick to it, not to quarrel with the Government about the amount that it says it requires foi the defence of this country. We have said repeatedly that the Government is the Government, much as we may regret it. It is the responsibility of the Government, as it would he our responsibility if we were the Government, to take whatever -means it considers necessary for the safety of the Commonwealth.

                        does not often speak in this chamber, and when he does he is usually kind. He never opens a wound and rubs in salt, but it was not worthy of him to suggest that hy our action today we on this side were trying to prevent the Government from getting the&#39; funds necessary to carry on the war. What have I invited the Senate to do ? I have invited it to declare that under this regulation, framed as it has been under a measure which was gagged through this chamber and through the -House of Representatives, the Government has filched the rights which we as representatives of the people should possess. I ask

                            <para>- I withdraw them without reservation. I shall not say that he -has broken a confidence; but I ask him whether he made that statement on the authority of the Acting Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Spender),</inline> who, unfortunately for him, arrived in the chamber just as he made it. The honorable senator informed the Senate that the Government had decided to introduce another measure in which justice would be done to prospector and to those engaged in - working low-grade shows. If he made that statement on the authority Of the Government, it is apparent that Ministers had awakened to their responsibilities after the Senate had taken certain action. They discovered that the proposal did not meet with the approval of their friends, and they then decided to bring it forward in another form. The Government proposes to introduce another bill, not because of altruistic motives, and if it should impose a tax on profits instead of on production the Opposition will support it. If such a basis he adopted the only complaint that the Opposition will have to make will he that the tax is not high enough. I am not  sooptimistic  as to believe that I have converted a sufficient number of honorable senators opposite to enable this motion to be carried ; but I ask them to consider their position: If the motion be defeated honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber need - never again ask honorable senators opposite to assist them to protect the rights and privileges of this chamber.  They  know that the Senate does not receive fair treatment. We are -called together whenever the Government pleases and are sent away for indefinite periods when there is important public business to transact. It would appear, that  we  shall have to wait until a Labour government is in power before the Senate can be rehabilitated, not  only  in its own interests, but also in the interests of -the people generally. </para>
