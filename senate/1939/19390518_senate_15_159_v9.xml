                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave -</inline> The Right Honorable the Prime Minister has issued the following statement in relation to the establishment of the tinned plate industry in Australia: - </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>The Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited has submitted proposals for the manufacture of tinned plate. These proposals have been reviewed by the Government. Successive Commonwealth Governments have been anxious to see this great industry established in Australia. To this end, a deferred protective duty was incorporated in the Customs Tariff in 1920. Up to the present the whole of our requirements have been imported. Australia's dependence on tinned plate is vital, as it is used for the canning of many essential foodstuffs, as well as for a large number of other commodities. The project involves a capital expenditure of from £2,500,000 to £3,000,000 in the tinned plate plant alone, whilst substantial additional outlay will be required for ancillary services. Direct employment would be given to about 1,000 hands. In addition, an appreciable number of men would be employed indirectly, such as in the mining of iron ore and coal, in the production of the necessary steel, and in transport services. The Government is intensely interested in the proposal to establish this industry in Australia and has decided to refer the matter immediately to the Tariff Board for public inquiry and report. All interested parties, including the canners of Australian foodstuffs, will therefore be afforded an opportunity to express their views on the proposal. The Tariff Board is being asked to ascertain whether assistance should be given to the production of tinned plate in Australia, and, if so, the form which such assistance should take. In order that this inquiry may be completed as expeditiously as possible, the Government of the United Kingdom has agreed that any evidence which tinned plate manufacturers of the United Kingdom may desire to submit should be given to the Tariff Board within eight weeks from the date of reference. Under the Ottawa Agreement the arrangement is that United Kingdom manufacturers should have three months in which to furnish evidence. As the result of this special arrangement the Commonwealth Government expects to receive the Tariff Board report in about ten weeks' time. </para>
                <para>The Government of South Australia is interested in the proposal to establish the tinned plate industry in Australia, and has formulated a plan for an extensive water reticulation system to provide adequate supplies of water to Whyalla in the event of the industry being estab- - lished and that site being chosen. The Commonwealth Government has under consideration a request from the Premier of South Australia for Commonwealth co-operation in this matter. </para>

Manufacturers in Western Australia, in common with those in other States, thus have an opportunity of competing on an equitable basis for defence requirements not only for their own State, but for the very much larger requirements of the Commonwealth as a whole. </para>

                    <para>. - This is a measure which requires more than ordinary attention. It would be easy for the members of the Opposition to express approval, of its provisions ; but in this as in other instances, great care has been taken to prepare a background thus making it very difficult for us to say what ought to be said regarding it. I can say, however, with perfect confidence, that I am expressing the earnest thoughts of every member of the party which I lead in this chamber when I say that our hearts go out in sympathy to Dame Enid Lyons and the members of her family. I know also that a mere expression of sympathy unbacked by some practical effort isof very little value ; but </para>

                <para class="block">I say quite definitely that the duty of honorable senators on both sides of the chamber is to every widow in Australia and not to one only. Therefore, before I commit myself or the members, of the Opposition to this proposal I should like to know a great deal more than I know at the moment concerning the intention of the Government with respect to all other widows in Australia. I am anxious to avoid introducing even a suspicion of bitterness into the discussion of this bill. In fact I am more than anxious to avoid it; but if the task with which I am confronted is difficult and unpleasant I am not to blame. The policy of the Government is at fault. This Government and those which have preceded it in recent years have always been bitterly opposed to -the payment of widows' pensions. </para>

                        <para>- I suggest to honorable senators opposite that they should refrain from trying to do in this discussion what some of them were unwise enough- to attempt yesterday. We should endeavour to discuss this measure on a high plane, and without recrimination. Personally I -will accept the challenge in whatever form it comes. I am  sent here not to fight for well-to-do widows. I have been sent to this chamber not by widows who have capitalized their families. I have not been sent here to approve of every proposal which the Government submits to this chamber. It is my responsibility to represent the interests of breadwinners who, because of the unfortunate circumstances with which they are confronted, are faced with poverty. It is that section of the community that sent us here. It is not our duty to plead for any particular widow, but in season and out of season to demand some measure of justice for all of the widows of Australia. What are the facts? On the statute-book of this country there are acts providing for the payment of pensions to the widows of deceased soldiers. These widows have not been asked to pay for the pensions they receive, but their husbands have paid for them by making the supreme sacrifice on the field of battle at the invitation of the people of this country. Others who survived death on the field of battle have made sacrifices in the industrial arena, and are now suffering mental and physical injury. What pensions do they receive? I know of a soldier's widow who is receiving a pension of only ls. 4id. a week. I know of other cases, some of which are known to honorable senators, of soldiers' widows receiving sums which cannot be accurately described as other than a miserable pittance. The Government has utterly failed to recognize its responsibility to these unfortunate people. Provision was made in the National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill for the payment of a pension to widows towards which contributions would have to be made, but owing to the bungling manner in which this Government conducts its business we shall be asked before this session concludes to postpone the introduction of that legislation still further. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, who said by interjection that provision is made for the payment of widows' pensions under that measure, should hide his head in shame because he knows that nothing whatever is likely to be done, and that widows who would be willing to contribute towards a pension will not be able to do so. </para>

                        <para>- The Labour party will, when it gets an opportunity, give the people of this country a sound national health and pensions insurance scheme, under which it will attack poverty, malnutrition and ill-health at its very base by insuring against unemployment. It is not our responsibility to prescribe the remedy to-day. In this instance the Government is the doctor, and if it continues with its present policy much longer the patient. will die. Unemployment is increasing and thousands of Australians are dying annually because of the callous neglect of the Government in this respect and others. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> does nothing more than convict himself by his callous interjection. In addition to soldiers' widows and the other widows to whom I have referred, honorable senators know that there are many widows for whom nothing whatever is being done. Whenever we are released from our duties in Canberra and return to our home towns - and we are released all too frequently because this Government does not provide business to keep us here and is, in fact, a Government without a heart to feel distress or a soul worthy to be damned - our homes are besieged all day long by people with pitiful tales of the poverty and distress of widows who have been left without means, and who have to go to the washtub or undertake some other equally arduous work to provide for their innocent little children running the streets all day because their mothers cannot stay at home to care for them. Not even a miserable pittance of a pension can be obtained for these unfortunate women. Because of these facts the Labour party cannot vote for this bill. </para>

                <para>I do not wish to be misunderstood. I admit fully and sincerely that something is due to Dame Enid Lyons, and something is also due to the widows of other former members of Parliament. During recent years death has taken heavy toll of members of the Labour party in the Commonwealth Parliament. Some of us have been trying for a long time to move this  incompassionate  Government to help the widows of some of our former colleagues. We have failed. A former  President  of this chamber, who was not a Labour member, left a widow who was practically penniless. After some agitation, the Government made a grant to her, but it was nothing like the grant proposed to be made to Dame Enid Lyons. I regret to say that we have had even less success in our efforts to obtain some assistance for the widows of former Labour members of the Parliament. Perhaps because of the introduction of this bill we may be able to get the Government to do something for these unhappy women, but I am quite sure that any success that we may achieve will be due solely to the circumstances that have lead to the submission of this bill to the Parliament. However, if by any means, or from any motives, we can get the Government to do something for these widows, we shall be glad. We have not asked for a pension of £1,000 a year as provided in this bill. We have simply requested a very modest sum to keep the ravenous wolf of poverty from the doors of these homes. </para>
                <para>Honorable senators are well aware that I have declared in this Parliament on other occasions that the salary of the Prime Minister, prior to the increase made in the last year, was not adequate. I believe that it is now adequate. I do not say that it is sufficient for a large family such as that of the late Prime Minister, but that family cannot be capitalized as far as I am concerned. The family of the late Prime Minister was his own responsibility. I have heard Dame Enid Lyons, who is an eloquent and capable woman, appeal over the air, and from the public platform, on several occasions, to the women of Australia to do their duty in motherhood. I know that she has on occasions almost brought tears to the eyes of some of her listeners. But we have no more responsibility for the children of the late Prime Minister than we have for the dependants of other deceased citizens of this country. I say without reservation that if a means test is to be applied in one case it must be applied in all cases. If the Government tells me, in a nebulous kind of way, that probably the estate of the late Prime Minister will amount to no more than £100, I shall refuse to believe that the statement even approximates to the truth unless definite information is made available. If the statement is proved to be true, then I shall say, " It should not be true ". The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> had a long term of public service. I do not in any way whatever discredit the value of his public service. A man who renders service to the public to the best of his ability, according to his faith and beliefs, should be respected for it, regardless of the political party to which he happens to belong; but I remind honorable senators opposite that whenever they allude to the public service of the late Prime Minister they have in mind only the last eight years of his activities. If anything so extravagant as this proposal is necessary to mark the service rendered to the country by the late Prime Minister in the last eight years of his life, then those interests which he so admirably served should accept the responsibility for it at least until such time as a Commonwealth Government is prepared to accept appropriate responsibility for all widows. Some one said to me yesterday when I made this suggestion in personal conversation that that procedure would lead to bribery and corruption. I replied that it would do nothing of the sort. It is impossible to bribe a man who is dead. I was told that one Australian statesman had received a monetary reward for his services while he was still alive. People may put any interpretation they like upon that case, but the case that we are now considering relates to the widow and children of a Prime Minister who is dead. I repeat that those interests which the late right honorable gentleman served with such distinguished ability should now shoulder the responsibility of maintaining) his widow and children. They should not expect- the general community to do so. </para>
                <para>I admit that something is due to the widow of a Prime Minister of the Commonwealth, but any consideration extended to her should at least bear some comparison with the niggardly treatment meted out by this Government to other widows. If a means test must be applied in one case in respect of dependent children it should also be applied in the other case. If the pension to Dame Enid Lyons and her children is actually paid on the scale at present proposed, this Government will convict itself of being entirely without any sense of proportion. </para>
                <para>I greatly regret that in another place the Government was not willing to accept the liberal compromise offered by the Leader of the Labour party. I notice from the report of the proceedings in the House of Representatives yesterday that Dame Enid Lyons expressed, by letter, the hope that any decision reached would be unanimous. Yet the Government went on in its imperious way and, with the force of numbers and its brutal majority, did in this case, as it has done in other cases, exactly as it desired. An admirable opportunity for a reasonable, decent and generous compromise was offered, but the Government refused it. For that reason Labour senators in this chamber have determined to make a very decided protest. If I did not know it was too late to do so, I should even now ask the Leader of the Government in the Senate to use his influence with the Government to get it to accept the reasonable compromise offered by the Labour party in the other House, in order that a unanimous decision might be reached on this bill. But unanimity is manifestly impossible while such a cruel distinction is made between widows in this country. </para>
                <para>If I thought it worth while, I could bring numerous cases under the notice of the Senate to show that many widows in this. country are living in dire poverty and distress. The logs of their breadwinners has robbed them and their helpless little children of the means of a decent livelihood. Other honorable senators could also bring cases of this kind under notice. We do not wish to lengthen the debate unnecessarily, but I say definitely to honorable senators and also to the general community of this country that the Labour party absolutely refuses to recognise degrees of widowhood. We are not willing to differentiate in the treatment of widows. We shall not, therefore, agree to the extravagant proposal of the Government in this particular instance. Until the Government is prepared to introduce a measure for the benefit of all widows, though I do not say that it should be in every case on exactly the same basis, for that would be just as ridiculous and just as preposterous as the action which the Government is now taking, we feel that we must offer our strongest protest against the passing of this bill in its present form. We desire the Government to introduce a bill which will provide reasonable pensions, on an entirely noncontributory basis, for all widows. We are not prepared to deal with this case in this extraordinarily generous way while we leave many other widows entirely without assistance. I believe that wise statesmanship could meet the circumstances of the widows of this country. </para>
                <para>I conclude by reminding honorable senators of a passage in the Litany of the <inline font-style="italic">Book of Common Prayer,</inline> which I cited when supporting the motion of condolence to Dame Enid Lyons and her children, in which we pray - </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>That it may please Thee to preserve all that travel by land or by water, all women labouring of child, all sick persons and young children . . . that it may please Thee to defend, and provide for, the fatherless children, and widows, and all that are desolate and oppressed. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">The prayer is for all who are in distress, and for all widows. My prayer and plea here this morning is still for all widows and all orphan children. I visualize the possibility of this Parliament doing something reasonable and rational for all widows and orphan children. I oppose this bill because I believe that it seeks to do something that Ls neither reasonable nor rational. </para>

                <para>I was a member of the House of Representatives when the late Prime Minister was a member of the Labour party. I, perhaps, am not so forgiving as other members of this party and remember what he did. I have a very distinct recollection of the fact that, for a long number of years, he received the eulogy of the Labour movement. It lifted him from comparative oblivion into one of the highest places in the Commonwealth Parliament.  His  having a big family was, as my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has said, his own business, but it was a commendable business. He was blessed with a wife of outstanding ability and together they rendered signal service to Australia. The unfortunate part of this matter is that the late Prime Minister was scarcely dead when a section of the press started propaganda for some large amount of money to be made available to his widow and children. That propaganda, I suggest, was the main reason for the hasty pronouncement by the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> that Dame Enid Lyons and her family would receive a pension of £1,000 a year. The newspapers went so far as to say that the right honorable gentleman conferred with the Leader of the Labour party <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> in Tasmania, and that he had agreed with the suggestion. He did not agree. He merely expressed sympathy with the objective and said that the whole matter had to be discussed by the Labour party. </para>
                <para>I join with the Leader of the Opposition in this chamber in saying that discrimination in the treatment of widows and members of Parliament is unfair. When the right honorable member for Corio <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> was Treasurer, the case was submitted to him of the late honorable member for Kennedy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Riordan),</inline> an old pal of mine, who was just as hard working a member as was the late Prime Minister, because he represented one of the most difficult electorates in Australia. When he died, leaving a widow and little children, he was not blessed with many of the world's goods, but the right honorable gentleman was so parsimonious as to suggest that a pension of £78 a year, or 30s. a week, for his widow would be fair. What was fair for <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.</inline> Riordan's  widow should be fair for the late Prime Minister's widow; but it was not fair, and neither would it be fair to pay such a meagre amount to Dame Enid Lyons. The widows of former members, like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McGrath</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. James</inline> Matthews,, were given a pension of £3 a week. These men had given just as good service in the federal arena as the late Prime Minister, who, I am prepared to admit, died in harness, and gave good service, a lot of which I did not like, but which was according to his lights. They even gave longer service to the Commonwealth. A pension of £1,000 a year to the widow and children of one man and £78 a year to the widow and children of another is nauseous. I believe, with our leader, that the salary paid to the Prime Minister has been inadequate. To a degree that has been rectified. </para>

                <para>I subscribe to general provision being made for former members of Parliament. Honorable senators know the men to whom I refer. We meet them in Melbourne. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> knows them. There are at least three former members, trail-blazers in the Australian federation, two of them original members of this Senate, against whom not one word of suspicion has been levelled, who, having served this country, lost their seats in the whirligig of politics, and are now in dire straits. Their position is even worse than that of men who have to subsist on the old-age pension. A government which is so liberal with the dependants of one deceased member of Parliament must surely take steps to provide for them. I believe that the people of Australia would wish it to do so. </para>
                <para>In Great Britain the Prime Minister has a call on a pension of £2,000 a year on the day on which he leaves office. It is a necessary provision to ensure that the chief man of the land does not end his days in poverty, and it is one that should form some part of the organization of this Parliament. I offer no apologies for my belief that a contributory scheme should be adopted. If it be right for men who rank high in the Commonwealth Public Service to receive on their retirement a pension for which they contribute, it is equally right that similar provision should exist for members of Parliament. Public servants have a regular job', but whatever be their political beliefs, the job of members of Parliament is, at the most, temporary. The late Prime Minister served as Premier of Tasmania for a number of years, receiving £1,100 a year - I concede its inadequacy - and he was Prime Minister at £2,000 a year for some years. An additional £1,500 a year was provided for him about a year ago. He was not able to provide for his future in a way in which some people might have done. The Government should have checked the financial position of his family before making this submission to Parliament. Frankly. I do not know what his family is worth, but I understand that it has been said that the estate will realize no more than £100 or £200. </para>

On former occasions, officers of the public service have been detailed to make a report as to the circumstances of the families concerned and the Government has acted on those reports. That is the correct thing to do, but evidently it has not been done in this case. </para>

                        <para>- I accept the Minister's assurance, but I remind him that there is no record of it in the debates on this bill, either in this chamber or in the House of Representatives. The fact remains that Dame Enid Lyons has eleven children, three or four of whom have reached the age of earning capacity. That, leaves seven or eight children for whom provision must be made. A reasonable allowance in those circumstances would be £500 a year. Similarly placed families of deceased members have received nothing like what is suggested in this bill. In the House of Representatives, various suggestions as to the amount of the annuity were made. A payment on a sliding scale was suggested. But the right honorable member for Cowper <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> a hot-headed man, as Prime Minister had mentioned a pension of £1,000 a year, and it was on that basis that this bill was introduced. This bill had its birth in the wrong atmosphere. If the present Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> had been Prime Minister at the time, the matter would have been handled in a more businesslike manner. We, being in the minority, cannot amend it, but my contention is that £500 a year would be ample. It is a pity that it was ever necessary that this bill should have had to be introduced. The Government prides itself on its long-range planning for the defence of this country. Long-range planning for the maintenance of former members of Parliament or their families should also be its policy. There should be no need to consider what the people outside will think. I have never worried about that. If I have thought that a thing is right, I have supported it. But I am sure that the people outside, at any rate those represented by Labour, would welcome it. Honorable senators on this side of the House think that provision should be made for their old age. That feeling would apply more to Labour members than to honorable gentlemen opposite, who, ordinarily, are blessed more with the world's goods than we are. They are usually in some business and are able to withstand the jolts of political life more easily than men on this side who have only their parliamentary allowance to live on. Even gentlemen opposite know how far that goes. I have no illusions about this Parliament. When I was outside I had as good a job as I have here, and had I stayed outside I should have been far better off than I am. I am not pleading for myself, although I shall be lucky if my family is reared, but the position of honorable senators on this side is more parlous than will be the position of Dame Enid </para>

                    <para>. -  I regret that this matter has been most unfortunately handled. Shortly after the death of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page)</inline> acted rather hastily in his pronouncement regarding the amount of the annuity proposed to be paid. We all agree, I think, that, if the matter had been left open for a little while, it could have been dealt with by the Government and the Parliament in a much more satisfactory manner than is proposed under this measure. The contemplated annuity of £1,000 a year is excessive, and the case would have been met by an annuity of £500. That would have given generous recognition of the services of the late Prime Minister. Regrets arc useless at this stage, and in all probability the bill will be passed. Yet we should not overlook the fact that by_ the enactment of this legislation we shall be setting a precedent, and in all probability similar annuities will be sought from time to time. In my judgment the proposed payment is over generous and unfair to the taxpayers. </para>

                    <para>. - I agree with honorable senators who have criticized this bill. The word " unfortunately " has been used in describing the way in which the Government has dealt with this matter, but "indecently" would have been a far more appropriate expression. Members of the Ministry are not neophytes in public life; had they been inexperienced politicians some excuse might have been found for their action in regard to the proposal. In my opinion, the unfortunate lady in question will suffer for years because of the indiscretions of the Ministry in this matter. </para>

                        <para>- I leave honorable senators to form their own opinions regarding the measure. The proposed annuity is, in my judgment, in excess of the legitimate needs of Dame Enid Lyons and her children; the payment of £500 a year would have been ample in the circumstances. The needs of thousands of widows who have reared families are at least not less than those of the widow of the late Prime Minister, but the Government does nothing to help them, except to provide them with jobs as office cleaners. Women in the autumn of life should not be called . upon to do such work, but should be able to pass their days in congenial surroundings and with the peace of mind to which they are entitled. It is sad to reflect that many of them are compelled to clean out dirty offices in order to maintain themselves and, in some cases, their husbands also. </para>

                    <para>.- I admit that this is a very difficult matter to discuss in this chamber, but the country can afford to be liberal in this case, in recognition of the services of a man who, in a particularly trying period, sacrificed many years of his life through undertaking the strenuous work which the Prime Ministership involves. The people of Australia are, I think, willing to do what is proposed under this measure for the widow and family of the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons.</inline> I do not consider that the bill will be regarded as establishing a precedent. Australia's Prime Minister should not receive the comparatively paltry sum now paid to him, because it is less than that of many of the public servants under him. He should get at least £5,000 or £6,000 a year. The late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> received a salary under £2,300 a year, out of which he entertained distinguished visitors, paid for suppers of members of Parliament on the occasion of late sittings, and even paid taxi fares for members. A considerable proportion of his salary was disbursed in that way. Members of Parliament seem to imagine that the Prime Minister draws allowances to cover the cost of many services which he actually pays for out of his own pocket. I hope that in future the Prime Minister of Australia will be treated as liberally as those occupying similar positions in other countries. If an adequate salary were paid to the occupant of this high office, a case such as that with which this bill deals should not arise. </para>

                <para>The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and the  Deputy  Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> referred to the widows of former members of this Parliament, but it is unreasonable to compare their case with that of the widow of the late Prime Minister. Some of the men mentioned were members of this Parliament for only three years and others for six years. This Parliament cannot be expected to make provision for the widows in such circumstances. When a man contests a seat in this Parliament he knows that the period of his political ' life will be determined by public opinion, and that at the end of three years he may be defeated and thrown upon his own resources. He would not be justified in cutting himself adrift from his ordinary occupation if he had a wife and family dependent on him. He should do something to enable bini to earn a living as previously, on ceasing to be a member of Parliament. I have never relied on my parliamentary allowance, and I see no reason why members of Parliament should be placed in a better position than that of people outside the Parliament. The only way to provide for payments to ex-members or their widows is to deduct £200 or £300 a year from members' salaries, invest the money in Government bonds and allow the Government to hold the bonds and the interest, so that when a member is defeated, he can receive his own money back, with interest. </para>

                    <para>. -  I take exception to the amount of the proposed annuity, because the measure was conceived at a time when sympathy and, perhaps, sentiment were greater than discretion. The circumstances in which the decision was reached also, no doubt, induced the Government to feel that it had no option but to proceed with the measure. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cunningham,</inline> I am as sympathetic as anybody in regard to the claims of the widow of the late Prime Minister, but I shall not allow my sympathy to overrule my judgment. Despite all that has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> about the claims made upon the private purse of the late Prime Minister, and the great responsibilities which he carried, I still consider that the payment of an annuity of £1,000 to his widow is not warranted. I agree that the occupant of the high position of Prime Minister of Australia is entitled to fair remuneration for his services. It would be wrong to tempt a public man to stoop to conduct which would not be to the credit of either himself or the nation. A man occupying a responsible position in the government of this country should be paid sufficient to put him beyond temptation of that kind. Despite our different political views I say that it is to the credit of the late Prime Minister that he left the world as poor a man as any of us. But we must remember that, in making provision for these annuities, we are dealing with the people's money. </para>

                        <para>- I am here for the special purpose of safeguarding it. That is the sole reason why I address myself to this bill. I believe that the amounts proposed are too great. Under the bill as it now stands, the people of this country will be asked to pay annuities totalling  £20 a week to the widow and children of the late Prime Minister, the  annuity in respect of the children continuing until the eldest has reached the agc of 33 years. No one in this chamber can justify the expenditure of public money in that way. In common with other honorable senators on this side of the chamber, I recognize the value of the services to Australia of the late Prime Minister, but at the same time, I believe aat annuities one half the amount proposed by the Government would be sufficient to meet the needs of his widow and dependent children. </para>

                    <para>. -  A lot has been said during this debate that cannot be denied. Although the Government believes that it is doing the right thing in this matter, I sincerely trust that in future it will not be unmindful of the claims on the generosity of the nation of a great and deserving class of widows in the community, the war widows. I hope that in future it will deal more leniently with applications for war pensions made by them, that death certificates of doctors attending deceased ex-soldiers will be accepted as final evidence of the cause of death, and that the official medical history of such men will be ignored. Honorable senators have deplored the low plane to which this debate has descended. If any attempt was made to lower the level of discussion in connexion with this proposal it was made in the House of Representatives yesterday when the Prime Minister so demeaned himself as to read a letter which he had received from Dame Enid Lyons. </para>

                        <para>- During this debate it has been said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons5</inline> life was shortened because of the strain of his public office. I remind the Prime Minister that he himself contributed greatly to that strain, when, at a critical time in the affairs of the nation, he walked out of the Cabinet and got the press to stress the need for leadership. I trust that the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> are not shared by his colleagues on the other side of the chamber. Every Australian citizen "has the constitutional right to enter this Parliament, be he a squatter or an industrial worker. If a worker leaves his occupation to enter this Parliament he cannot continue the occupation which formerly he had followed. I feel sure that <inline font-weight="bold">-Senator Gibson</inline> does not think that such a person would be able to continue working in industry after he had become a member of this Parliament. On the other hand, honorable senators opposite occupy higher stations in life; their activities and commercial interests can continue despite their membership of this Parliament. Yet, if they had their way they would not allow an industrial worker to enter the legislature. I sincerely trust that honorable senators opposite will endeavour to induce- the Government to initiate a contributory scheme of widows' pensions for all members of the Parliament, be they ordinary members or those occupying the highest political positions. I hope that never again shall we have to discuss a bill such as that which is now before the Senate. The Government, however, is responsible for the measure now before us, and I have no doubt that when the Ministers next face the electors the widows and the womenfolk who are liable to become widows will make their opinion known. They will want to know why similar consideration is not extended to them. I feel that a much more equitable measure than we have now before us could have been drafted. If that had been done the bill would have received the unanimous support of all sections of the Parliament. </para>

                    <para>. - I shall not oppose this bill. I rise merely to draw the attention of honorable senators to the fact that I have constantly advocated a system of .finance which would  give economic security to everybody in Australia. Proof of the failure of the present unsatisfactory system approved of by this Government is seen in the fact that not even the Prime Minister of Australia can have economic security under it. So long as the present monetary system exists we shall have to take action of the kind proposed in this 'bill. It is quite possible to give economic security to the living and to the dependants of the dead, but not under the existing monetary system. </para>

I do not deny that room still exists for improvement in this class of legislation, but this Government is just as much alive to that fact as are honorable senators opposite. Secondly, the Leader of the Opposition said of the late Prime Minister, " The special interests that he served should be asked to provide the money". The inference to be drawn from that statement is that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> served only one section of the community. </para>

                        <para>- In her letter Dame Enid also said that when she recovered her health and was again able to provide for her family she would not require any assistance for herself. That, I suggest, is evidence of the high spirit which she displayed in her recent great difficulty, and which she previously displayed in rendering great service to this country. It was only after considering all the facts that Cabinet decided upon the amount proposed in this measure as a fitting recognition of the public service of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> and his widow. The Government is prepared to stand up to its obligations in this matter. I trust that Dame Enid's health will soon be fully restored, and that she will live to enjoy her due reward for her great services to the Australian nation. </para>

                        <para>. - I do not propose to debate the bill further, but I desire to make a statement regarding a difficulty which arose this morning in connexion with pairs. An unfortunate mistake was made, with the result that five members of the Government parties who had been definitely paired with Senators Aylett, Brown, Courtice, Lamp and Sheehan, of the Opposition, voted in the division. That was due entirely to a misunderstanding. I rose solely to explain why the names of some of my colleagues are not accounted for in the division list. </para>

                    <para>. - The bill before us is a simple one, and I do not intend to say much about it, as the Opposition will not oppose it. For the most part, it is a machinery measure, but there are some points concerning which I should like some information. First, it appears to me that this bill proposes to do something which has been long delayed. It has probably been brought forward now only because there was no other business ready. Secondly, I am of the opinion that it should not have been introduced before the relevant provisions of the Statute of "Westminster had been adopted by the Commonwealth. I realize that that statute is not now before us, but I cannot understand why it has not been ratified by the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- My third point is that this bill will have the effect of depriving members of military forces of other parts of the Empire, who may be visiting this country, of their remedies under habeas corpus proceedings. I shall not attempt to elaborate that point, because my knowledge of the law is almost negligible, but it is a point on which I should like some of the legal members of the Senate to enlighten me. In his second-reading speech, the Minister drew attention to the fact that special provision had been inserted in the British Army Act with respect to the Dominions to which the Statute of Westminster does not apply. He went on to say that those provisions do not complete the legal machinery for the governing of dominion forces when acting in co-operation, and that, therefore, legislation is desirable. That is so. In my opinion it is desirable, but the point is that the legislation is not yet complete, and will not be complete  until the Statute of Westminster is adopted by the Commonwealth. As to habeas corpus proceedings, we should realize the seriousness of adopting a measure which will deprive British subjects on British soil of their fundamental British right of resort to habeas corpus proceedings, even when they are being dealt with by military courts. It may be said that we need not bother about what may happen to British subjects on British soil. I realize that the bill does not apply to Australian soldiers who may be dealt with by Australian military courts in Australia, nor does it affect any dominion which has adopted similar legislation with respect to the forces of that dominion while at home; but it does deprive members of visiting forces of their right to resort to the long treasured and jealously guarded remedy of habeas corpus.. Normally, a person detained by a military court has the right to a writ of habeas corpus which is returnable in the civil courts, which will then inquire into the legality of the detention ; but clause 6, subclause 4, provides that a certificate under the hand of the officer commanding the visiting f force that a member of that force is being detained for certain purposes shall be conclusive evidence of the cause of his detention, but not of his being such a member; and a certificate under the hand of such an officer that the persons specified in the certificate sat as a service court of the United Kingdom, or of a dominion to which the act applies, as the case may be, shall be conclusive evidence of that fact. The effect of that provision is that the certificate is a complete answer to any writ, and the legality of the detention cannot be questioned by the civil courts, except as to whether the person detained is a member of a visiting force within the meaning of the act. There may not be much in the point which I have raised, but it seems to me to be worth .considering. I should be glad of some enlightenment in regard to it.. As I have said, the bill would have been more fitting had the Commonwealth ratified the Statute of Westminster, but as the Government does not appear to be anxious to do that, this bill becomes necessary. I shall not oppose its passage. </para>

                <para class="block">That clause may contain dangerous provisions. It seems to me that this legislation has been designed mainly fo.r  a  time of turmoil in Australia. It would be easy for the officers commanding  a  visiting force to claim that a certain man was a deserter from the force without having to prove that, in fact, he was a deserter. It might be a case of mistaken identity. In a time of turmoil an Australian citizen might be arrested because some one thought that he was  a  man referred to in certain court proceedings. At such a time feeling runs high, and an innocent man might be deported to either the United Kingdom or a dominion without having a chance to prove that he  wa3  not the man referred to in the court proceedings. It seems to me that this bill opens a door which might lead to  a  great deal of trouble. It may be that in most instances such mistakes as would occur would be made quite innocently, but, on the other hand, they may be the result of spite. I wish to be assured that no innocent Australian could be arrested and not given the chance to prove his identity.. Some provision to prevent possible abuse should be inserted in the clause. </para>

                    <para>.- The bill will remove a number of anomalies which were revealed during the Great War, when Australian troops were stationed in the Old Country. As one who had some small part in administering the law then, I shall refer particularly to the point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> The same position existed then with regard to Australian soldiers in England as will exist in Australia in respect of forces visiting the Commonwealth. Those in charge of gaols or detention barracks iu Britain, accepted a warrant signed by an Australian officer as sufficient authority to imprison or detain any person mentioned therein. They never questioned the membership of the force of the person that they received. As regards the administration of military law in England, I mention that I, as a commanding officer - and other honorable senators were similarly placed - had no status, but that difficulty was overcome" by our being * appointed officers of the British Army,  because that gave to us jurisdiction within the United Kingdom.  The  measure before us contains no traps, but it will remove a number of anomalies and will ensure the fullest measure of justice. I commend it to the Senate. </para>

                    <para>.- If I thought that this bill would have the effect suggested by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> namely, take away any man's right to habeas corpus proceedings, I should certainly oppose clause 6, but I do not think that it does anything of the sort. As I read the clause, it sets up a military court to try military offences by members of visiting British troops, and provides that, when a member- of such visiting force has been tried and ordered to be imprisoned - he would be tried according to the ordinary rules of British justice, but in a special court set up for the purpose, instead of in an Australian court - a certificate under the hand of the commanding officer that he is the man to bc imprisoned shall be conclusive evidence of that fact. In my opinion, the clause does not take away the right to habeas corpus proceedings. It merely provides evidence. Habeas corpus has nothing whatever to do with evidence ; it is merely the right of every individual to require the court to say whether or not he has been properly imprisoned. Subclause 4 would apply to a person who had been properly tried by a recognized tribunal set up for that purpose. A. certificate from that tribunal would be conclusive evidence of something that had actually taken place - nothing more and nothing less. It is simply a procedural provision to deal with the points mentioned by the Assistant Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett).</inline> I see no objection to the clause. </para>

                    <para>. -  This sub-clause is important, and we should be extremely careful to safeguard the rights, not only of Australian citizens, but also of members of visiting forces. The provisions of sub: clause 4 would apply only after action had been taken under sub-clause 3, and after a man had been tried and sentenced by a properly constituted court. Such a <inline font-style="italic">sentence</inline> would be evidence of the fact that the man had been tried and ordered a term of imprisonment. Under our criminal law, when a man is tried and convicted, the warrant of conviction  is  handed to the sheriff. The sheriff's warrant is the authority upon which the convicted man is imprisoned. The authority of a military court could not, of itself, be acted upon by the sheriff. All that the sub-clause provides is that the certificate of a military court shall -have the same effect as the  warrant  issued to the sheriff from a criminal court. It will be conclusive evidence of the fact that a man has been tried by a special court and has been convicted. I think the AssistantMinister will agree that the subclause merely gives to the warrant of a military court the same evidentiary value as attaches to a warrant of the criminal court. I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has raised this point; but, as I have said, I see no objection to it. </para>

                        <para>. - I take this  opportunity  to refer to the approval which, according to the press, has been given to the proposal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to publish a new radio journal. I should like to know the reason for this new and quite unnecessary competition in a field which is already fully and efficiently served by private enterprise. Further, I should like to know why this unnecessary expenditure should be incurred when the commission is unable to meet the pressing requirements of outback communities which have asked for the establishment  of  new wireless broadcasting stations. The provision of such stations should be one of the first desires of the commission and a primary duty of the Government. For some years the commission has entered into serious competition with the legitimate Australian stage by giving preference to foreign artists, who are reputed to receive salaries out of all proportion to those paid to Australian artists when employed by the commission. I understand that the commission is about to publish weekly a new radio journal, and so far as I can gather from the newspapers which I receive in my own- home, the field proposed to be covered is already adequately served in every State. There are such journals as the <inline font-style="italic">Wireless Weekly</inline> published in Sydney, the <inline font-style="italic">Listener In,</inline> published in Melbourne, the <inline font-style="italic">Listener</inline> in Adelaide, and the <inline font-style="italic">Broadcaster</inline> in Perth. Doubtless there are many other similar weekly publications, which serve the people of the various States quite well. In these circumstances, I fail to see why the Australian Broadcasting Commission should publish a new journal which, if issued in Sydney, will be of little benefit to listeners in outlying states. If this journal is to be published in Sydney, it will be at least four or five days old before it reaches Perth, and, consequently the programmes it may publish will be of little use to the residents in Western. Australia. I do not know what the commission proposes in this respect. Is the journal to be a weekly or a monthly issue published in Sydney, or is it to be published simultaneously in each State? Instead of incurring expenditure in that way, any surplus funds of the commission could be handed to the Government for the provision of more broadcasting facilities, particularly in one portion of Australia to which I shall refer later. </para>

                            <para>- If it is to be published in Sydney and is to contain weekly programmes, it will be out of date by tie time it reaches country districts, particularly in Western Australia. It is the policy of the commission to broadcast musical programmes, educational items, news and other matter, but it will be generally admitted that there is room for a good deal of improvement in the programmes broadcast from some national stations. The commission was appointed to control broadcasting by radio and not to enter into the journalistic field. For some time we have been asking for additional national broadcasting stations in Western Australia, particularly in the Geraldton and Murchison districts, which for a time might serve the northwestern portion of Western Australia. There is no national station north of Perth, and an additional station should be erected in the north-west. The Government, which should co-operate with the commission' in regard to new stations has fallen down on its obvious duty to to supply a station that has been requested for years by the honorable member for Kalgoorlie <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr- Green),</inline> public bodies, and honorable senators representing Western Australia. Repeated requests for the establishment of additional stations to serve Geraldton, the Murchison goldfields, and the northwestern portion of Australia have 'been ignored. Although there are insufficient funds to provide additional stations or to provide better programmes, apparently the commission has money to start a journalistic enterprise of . this sort. No doubt this publication will be for the benefit of those living in the capital cities, which are already well supplied with both national and commercial broadcasting  services and daily newspapers. Recently I made two trips to the north-west of Western Australia, -where the reception is  often very unsatisfactory. The best reception obtained in that locality is from B class stations in Western Australia and the stations in Java and the Philippine Islands. I understand - that the commission derives an income of over £600,000 a year from the licence-fees paid by listeners, and that there are over 1,000,000 licence holders, each of whom pays £1 ls. a year. The fee is too high, and it is virtually a tax on a majority of the householders of Australia. I object to this unnecessarily high fee being extracted from the pockets of the people, and used to produce a' journal to compete with private enterprise in a field which is already fully supplied. The undertaking can be regarded only as a.n additional luxury to the residents in the large capital cities in eastern Australia. More efficient services should be provided to the people in the isolated parts of Australia before expenditure  is incurred in the manner proposed. Many of the residents in North- Western Australia do not receive newspapers until three weeks after they are published, and the least the commission can do is to provide a national station at Geraldton or Murchison, which would serve the north-western part of Australia and enable residents in those districts to obtain better reception than they are able to get from the south. Even with poor reception wireless transmission has been a great blessing to many people in the remote parts of the Commonwealth, who have to rely largely on the radio for communication with the outside world. These people have to rely in the main on the commercial stations to obtain news, 'the transmission of which is sometimes seriously interfered with. </para>

What I object to is that members of this Parliament know nothing of the work of the commission apart from what they read in the daily press. The statement has appeared in the newspapers that a journal is to be published by the commission, and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. S.</inline> H. Deamer has been appointed editor. I desire to know the purpose of this publication, and whether the Postmaster-General was consulted before the decision to publish it was reached. Who is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Deamer?</inline> What are his qualifications for the position of editor of the journal? Were applications for the position invited by public advertisement, and was the Australian, Journalists' Association consulted as to the terms of the contract with the editor ? Wo have had discussions in this Parliament concerning the activities of various boards and commissions, such as the board of directors of the Common-  wealth Bank, and it seems that each- of these bodies has been made superior to its creator. </para>

I do not blame the Leader of the Senate entirely for this adjournment, because he informed me yesterday as to the Government's reason for it, but, as a member of the Cabinet, he cannot entirely escape responsibility. The proposed recess of ten days is due entirely to the ineptitude of the Government, which is unable to place further business before this chamber, although we have met for only  a few days this year. I am aware that the Government intends, when we reassemble on the 30th May, to hurry into the winter recess, and I protest against its action. </para>

                        <para>.- From time to time letters have appealed in the press complaining about the activities of the' Australian Broadcasting Commission. The Government is obviously so concerned about this criticism that it now intends to appoint a new commission. The dissatisfaction with the present body is largely due to the fact that Tasmania has never been represented upon it, and I am glad to know that one of the new members is to be a Tasmania!). Listeners in my State pay the ordinary licence-fees, but their interests have been neglected. A new radio station in Hobart has been promised to the people of Tasmania. A site was purchased in Macquarie-street, and the -building occupying it, previously occupied by a doctor, was demolished, but the promise has not been fulfilled. </para>

                        <para>, - I join with my leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> in his protest against the adjournment of the Senate for ten days. The members of this chamber have been in Canberra since the 30th April. We sat for an hour on the 1st May, and since then we have met only this week. Senators from Western Australia are at a great disadvantage because of the fact that they will have to remain away from their homes until the Senate meets again on the 30th May. It will be impossible for them to return to their own State, where they could carry out useful work on behalf of their electors. I hope that the Government will adopt the plan indicated by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> for the arrangement of a schedule of parliamentary business which will enable the Senate to meet regularly over a continuous period. We are frequently called upon to sit for an hour or so and then adjourn for a fortnight, but it is usually necessary for us to remain in Canberra throughout short recesses. Members of Parliament who live in the adjacent States of New South Wales and Victoria can conveniently return to their own electorates. Members from Queensland, South Australia and Tasmania are, of -course, at some disadvantage in this respect, but West Australians suffer most. We are allowed one trip by aeroplane between Adelaide and Perth, but, even with that advantage, a ten days' adjournment does not permit of our returning to Western Australia. </para>
