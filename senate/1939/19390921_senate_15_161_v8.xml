                        <para>. - This measure is one that can be discussed most effectively at the committee stage. Honorable senators have had it before them for some time, and are probably well acquainted with its details. Whilst some of the clauses are more or less innocuous, the wisdom of accepting others is debatable. I agree with the remarks of the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett)</inline> regarding clause 2. It extends the provisions relating to graduates of Australian universities to graduates of universities in other British countries, but provides that graduates of the latter universities must be born in Australia, or, if not born in Australia, they must satisfy the Public Service Board that they left Australia for the purpose of entering the university from which they graduated, and resided in Australia for at least twelve months immediately prior to leaving Australia for that purpose. This clause really extends the operation of the relevant section to graduates of British universities other than Australian universities. </para>

                    <para class="block">It may be argued that such persons should be required to pass the examination prescribed for admission to the Public Service, but I need hardly point out that, being university graduates, they have already passed examinations of a higher standard. The effect of clause 3 is to extend to members of the permanent naval, military, or air forces of the Commonwealth the same provisions as apply under section 42 to officers of the Territorial Service, the Commonwealth railways and the Police Force of the Territory foi- the Seat of Government. Under this clause such persons as the board thinks desirable will be eligible foi appointment to the Public Service. I perceive a little danger in that provision. It contains a measure of justice in that it places all members of the various arms of our defence forces on the. same footing as members of the other services mentioned, but at the same time it seems to open the way, and rather dangerously, to certain persons to push the claims of particular individuals for admission to the Public Service. However, that provision can bc scrutinized in the committee stage. </para>
                    <para>Clause 4 <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> is not, important, because it merely substitutes the words &#34;permanent office &#34; for &#34; salaried office, not being of a temporary or casual character,&#34; and is designed to avoid confusion in the appointment of officers from other services. It is really contingent on the preceding clause. Clause 5 does not deal with admission to the Commonwealth Public Service. It adds to the service mentioned in section 4S, service in the Air Force of the Commonwealth, in order to put members of the Air Force on the same basis as members of the Naval and Military Forces. It also adds service in a permanent capacity as an officer employed under the Science and Industry Research Act, the Australian Soldiers&#39; Repatriation Act, the High Commissioner Act. and the Supply and Development Act. </para>
                    <para>Clause 8 deals with the attachment of salaries of officers and embodies a desirable amendment. Possibly minor objections may be raised to some of its provisions, but what it really sets out to do is to protect debtors, who are members of the Public Service, from unfair treat- <inline font-style="italic">meat</inline> in respect of liabilities to money lenders. The clause defines a money lender, and in a general way improves the position of such debtors, because the money lender, by obtaining a judgment and a subsequent garnishee order, cannot continue to be quite as unscrupulous in his treatment of these debtors as he could if this protection were not provided. Furthermore, this clause makes the money lender liable for the payment of commission at the rate of 5 per cent, on all amounts collected on his behalf by the paying officer of the department concerned. That is a fair proposal. I again suggest that the bill is one which can be best dealt with at the committee stage when I shall submit a couple of amendments I have circulated. </para>

                            <para>- That is a matter of detail. Many persons in the employ of the Government have been employed for a number of years with short breaks in their service. In the Victorian railways service, of which I have a fair knowledge, the service of an officer or an employee is deemed to be continuous if any break is not greater than two months. There are many men with years of temporary service who eventually are made permanent officers of the Commonwealth  Public  Service, and some consideration should be given to them in respect of their temporary service. </para>

Probably the- majority of the appointments to that department will be from other departments of the Public Service, but for the efficient management of the new department, it may bc necessary to appoint some experts to the permanent staff forthwith. In other branches of the Service, however, there are men who have been employed for years but are not regarded as permanent employees. Those men would be nf a disadvantage compared with appointees to the new department. I hope that, in committee, amendments to rectify these anomalies will be accepted by the Government. </para>

                        <para>. - I am in accord with the bill, and I congratulate the Government on its introduction. I am particularly pleased with those provisions which seek to attack the pernicious system by which the salaries of public servants are gaarnisheed, and the Commonwealth Treasury is used as a collecting agency for money lenders, who pay no fees whatever for the service. I imagine that there are many men in commercial life who would like to have a government  department  to collect their outstanding debts at no cost to themselves. </para>

                        MacDONALD.Clause 2 provides for the admission to the Commonwealth Public Service of graduates of Australian universities who were born in Australia, and also of persons who either were born in Australia and left Australia to attend universities in other parts of the British Empire &#39;and subsequently returned to Australia or, not being born in Australia, satisfy the board that they left Australia for the purpose of entering such universities and that they resided in Australia for at least twelve months immediately prior to their departure. I wish to know whether that clause would prevent a graduate of an English university who was bora in the United Kingdom and did not arrive in Australia until after his graduation from becoming an officer of the Commonwealth Public Service? It may be that provision is already made for him in the parent, act.

There is a proviso that no deduction shall be made which will reduce the amount to be received by the judgment debtor to less-, than &#163;2 a week.

We have been informed that there were 243 orders in 1927, 832 in 1930, 1,675 in 1933, 2,034 in 1934, 2,108 in 1935, 2.592 in 1937, and 2,410 in 1938. There was a big increase between 1.927 and 1937, which suggests that some employees of the Postmaster -  General&#39;s  Department are not receiving -salaries sufficient to enable them to meet their obligations. Some borrow money when they should not do so, but the majority borrow because of the decreased purchasing power of money. </para>

                            <para>- I do not. The average employee in the Postmaster-Genera l&#39;&#39;s Department lives moderately, and generally speaking he has to be satisfied with very little. If the employees of that department, used their organized strength to a greater degree they might bc in a better position than they arc  today.  I do not think it can be said that these men deliberately waste their money. The Minister stated that the number of judgment orders issued in all departments in 1938 was approximately 2,800, the bulk of which wore taken out against employees of the Postmaster-General&#39;s department. A perusal of the figures indicates that between 3936 and 1938 the - average yearly wage of employees in that department was ?261.69, which is too low. If these employees wish to borrow money 40 lender will have to take the risk, or   employees  will have to apply to their superior officer for the necessary permission to borrow. Under this measure the department is entering into an unholy alliance with money lenders. </para>

                        <para>. - Probably the Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett),</inline> in reply to the criticism, offered, will be able to make the position clear. We should not lose sight of the fact that legislation with regard to money lending and the garnisheeing of earnings exists in every State, and that the operation of State laws cannot be prevented by Commonwealth legislation on this matter. But this measure is designed to protect Commonwealth public servants from the unbridled avarice of the money lender. If that were not so, I should not have said that the Opposition supports the bill. I should be out of order if I explained fully why public servants fall into the hands of money lenders. The only reason is that the Government does not pay its servants sufficient to enable them to dodge the money lender; but the fact, remains that, because these employees have security of tenure, they are an easy prey of this avaricious class. Nobody would argue that after the employees have contracted debts with money lenders they should be allowed to repudiate them. The money lender can charge interest at any rate that he wishes to impose, and, if the borrower is unable to meet his commitments, the lender can obtain judgment by default, put in a bailiff, sell up the possessions, or even garnishee the wages. This clause merely provides that, instead of allowing the lender to indulge his unbridled avarice to the last degree the chief officer shall see that the debtor at least receives a fair deal, and that unreasonable charges are not imposed. He will exercise his discretion as to the liability and financial capacity of the borrower, and decide what is a fair rate of repayment, having regard to the total debt and he will instruct the paying officer accordingly. The Government claims that, as the lender&#39;s interest will be safeguarded by this legislation, he should pay for the service rendered. If he passes this cost on to the borrower, there will be fewer borrowers. The higher the rate of interest imposed, the fewer employees will get into the clutches of the money lenders. We should do all we can to induce public servants to&#39; avoid borrowing, but when they have done so, we should protect them from the villainy of the money lenders. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> referred to the prevalence of borrowing among employees in the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department.. This matter was brought under my notice when I was Postmaster-General. A variety of reasons were given for the number of loans contracted by officers in that department. As the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has lucidly pointed out, this bill deals with merely one phase of the legislation which the Government has in contemplation to relieve the situation. When I was in office, it was realized that consideration would have to be given by the Government to the setting up of a body to deal with cases of this description, because there are deserving as well as undeserving cases. Notwithstanding the illuminating statement by the Leader of the Opposition, we cannot escape the fact, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> pointed out, that money lenders will endeavour to circumvent legal enactments and under this legislation the borrower will probably be made to sign a promissory note covering expenses as well as principal and interest; but at any rate the debtor will be privy to what is being done. I appeal to honorable senators to realize that under this measure the Government is taking a step in the right direction, and later, when the Government has considered the matter in greater detail, it may decide to introduce another bill to iri ve relief to deserving cases. The proposal, broadly, was to constitute a body, to operate through the Commonwealth Bank, that, would inquire into individual applications for loans. Such assistance should be given not only to public servants, but also to the members of all trade unions, because thousands of unionists are suffering from the evils that we fire now trying to remedy. A body of  r ! i  is kind, with a proper organization behind it to keep a check on the classes of cases in which relief is sought, could prevent many of the abuses referred to by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron.</inline> As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> pointed out, this proposal is a two-edged sword. A limit is to be imposed on the rate of interest to be charged. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> said, the higher the interest rate the less would be the incentive to borrow; but. the unfortunate wretch who is already in the ditch would be dragged deeper into the mire. Nevertheless, I believe that this bill will have a steadying effect on the position generally. </para>

                        <para>.- This bill is one of the most useful measures submitted in this Parliament by any government, and  1  hope that similar legislation will be passed by the State Parliaments. When  1  was an officer in the Victorian Railways Department some years ago, a staff of from five to seven officers kept a close watch on garnishee orders, and that work was carried out at the expense of the Victorian Government. The lender was not asked to meet any portion of the cost, as he will be required to do under this measure. He will not have to pay so much as he would have to incur in legal expenses in order to recover money lent, and the borrower will have the assurance that one of his fellow officers will aci as umpire to see that a reasonable deal is obtained for him. With <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley,</inline> I agree that the money lender will endeavour to get his pound of flesh in some other way, despite this legislation. The fact remains that members of the Public Service, like people in other walks of life, get into financial difficulty for diverse reasons, and seek loans from money lenders, despite the heavy rates of interest demanded. I compliment the Government upon the introduction of this bill, and I should like to see the principle that it embodies applied in other walks of life besides the Public Service. Money lenders engaging in legitimate operations need have nothing to fear from it. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan said that although the Government could devise means to prevent money lenders from making excessive charges, the money lenders would find methods to overcome any obstacles placed in their way. That is a candid admission from an ex-Minister, that this particular clause will virtually be unavailing. As usual, the Government is putting the cart before the horse. Under this measure it seeks in the most willing spirit to safeguard the public servant who is compelled by circumstances to borrow from money lenders. I know  of  many serious and genuine cases - men who, having met with disaster, have been compelled to seek assistance from these bloodsuckers in order to safeguard themselves and their dependants for the time being. Because of their urgent needs, they agree to pay extortionate charges. If the Government is so keenly desirous  of  safeguarding the interests of public servants in this respect, can it not limit the amount of interest which shall be charged  to  public servants on money lent by these financial leeches? Under this clause, a money Sender is defined as a parson who lends money at a rate exceeding &#163;12 per cent, per annum. Would it not be possible in these cases to specify the maximum rate of interest, and provide, in the event of such limit being exceeded, that the paying officer shall have power to approve of only a. portion of the repayments claimed by a lender? I admit that the money lender is to be penalized to the extent that he is to be obliged to pay a commission of 5 per cent, on all moneys collected on his behalf. But I should like the Minister to show why it is not possible, taking everything into consideration, for the Government to limit in the way I suggest the bloodsucking propensities of the money lender who gets a public servant into his clutches. </para>

                        COLLETT  (Western Australia -Minister in charge of War Service Homes) &#91;4.25 J.  -  This clause provides that an officer&#39;s .salary shall not be garnisheed in any case in which any portion of an amount due under a judgment is in respect of money .borrowed from a  money  lender unless the chief departmental officer, after a full examination of all the circumstances, considers it to be desirable. Provision is ako made for a charge of per cent, for the collection of moneys by the department in respect of unsatisfied judgments against public servants. The activities of money lenders have constituted a scandal for some years past, and. consequently, the Government is desirous not only of minimizing that scandal but also of affording some protection to members of the Commonwealth Public Service who, by reason of their circumstances, arc compelled to seek financial aid from these people. One reason for the present position is that money lenders, knowing the security at the back of public servants, have made a specialty of- tempting them to accept accommodation. Any claim made in respect of a public servant under this measure will first be subject  foi  review by the chief officer before the paying officer will accept the garnishee, or make arrangements  foi-  any deduction  front  the salary of the officer concerned. For some years past the paying officers have acted as debt collectors for these people, and certain expenditure has been involved in the provision of special staff for this work.

This measure represents a genuine attempt by the Government to give adequate protection to public servants who, because of their circumstances, are forced to borrow from money lenders. </para>

                            <para>. - Under this measure it is permissible for the chief departmental officer to authorize the amounts to be paid in settlement of judgment orders of this kind, but it is also provided that debtors, without exception, must receive not less, than &#163;2 a week. It may be that a particular authorizing officer, because of his peculiar conception of the evils of money lending, may not be averse to meeting a judgment order too generously as to allow the debtor a bare minimum of &#163;2 a week. Such an officer, for instance, may be averse to borrowing money himself, because he has been on an easy wicket all his life and ha.3 never been confronted with financial difficulties. We know that such persons exist. Only the other day I met a married man <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> works at his profession in the day-time, and whose wife also is in employment. At night-time both of them sing on the radio, whilst the wife also engages in dressmaking in order to make extra money. That couple has no financial encumbrances whatever, but, in conversation with me, the husband said that if he had his way he would  gaol any man who borrowed money. I am not suggesting that departmental authorizing officers are likely to share that outlook, but it is not altogether impossible that one or two such officers would view money lending in that light and would therefore not be averse to leaving a public servant in his department with the bare minimum of &#163;2 provided for under this measure. It must also be remembered that many officers who are in debt to money lenders may have many other creditors besides the one who has secured a judgment against him. For instance, he may be buying some article such as furniture, on time payment. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> has often pointed out, under our present economic system, production is so great that goods are sold to lie paid for in the future. Consequently many families are purchasing goods on the time-payment system. It may be that a judgment is secured against a public servant who has other creditors as 1 have pointed out. Under this measure, it will be permissible for the authorizing officer in arranging payments in respect of an order, to leave the public servant concerned with only &#163;2 a week. Further, that arrangement may continue for as long as six months. If the Government is so keenly desirous of helping unfortunate public servants of this kind, surely it will agree to increase this minimum from &#163;2 to, say, &#163;3 10s. a week. I have no doubt that the Minister will reply that all of the factors have been taken into consideration. Nevertheless, the fact remains that a public servant can be left with only &#163;2 a week. </para>

                        (New South Wales) 1 4.35 J. - This provision is designed to protect public servants who borrow from money lenders. A man who borrows &#163;10 from a money lender is required to sign as having received &#163;12 10s. If the whole of the amount is not repaid at the end of the term, say six months, the money lender will add &#163;2 10s. to the amount then outstanding. That amount is 25 per cent, of the original loan, but it may in fact, represent interest at the rate of 80 per cent. Should the amount outstanding not bc paid within some further period, the money lender may apply to the court and obtain a judgment against the borrower. I know something of the operation of this system because of my association  with a firm by which I was once employed. Even if the borrower has repaid &#163;7 of the original &#163;10 that he obtained, &#163;5 may be added to the debt by way of interest. It frequently happens that a person has borrowed money from several money lenders. Should one of them proceed to squeeze him, all will do so and they will obtain orders against his salary. An instance came under my notice recently of a man who owed money for rent. The&#39; landlord interviewed the paymaster of the New South Wales railways, where the borrower was employed, only to be informed that it would be useless for him to obtain an order against the&#62; man&#39;s salary, as he would have to wait twelve&#39; years before he could hope to collect anything. This legislation will probably do some good; but we must avoid doing any injury to an honest employee .of the Government who, because of unforeseen circumstances such as sickness in his family, requires money urgently. In addition to this measure, legislation to restrict the interest which money lenders may charge should be introduced. The Commonwealth Government can take action in this direction by making the Commonwealth Bank the source from which short term loans may be obtained at low rates of interest. If legislation to that effect were introduced, money lenders could practically be eliminated. The rates of interest charged by many money lenders are exorbitant. Should a borrower be charged interest at the rate of 20 per cent, for six months, it really means interest at the rate of 40 per cent, per annum. A heavy responsibility will be thrown on the paying officers of government departments by this legislation. In some instances, they may find that public servants have borrowed money from a number of money lenders and that several judgment orders have been issued by the court.

It? object is to prevent money lenders from taking advantage of existing legislation  in order to garnishee the salaries of Commonwealth public servants. It must bf&#62; realized that public servants incur many debts besides those owing to money lenders. It may be that as the result of sickness money is owing for medical expenses. In such an event, the doctor could obtain a judgment order and serve it upon the paying officer of the department in which the debtor is employed, and the chief officer would then have to deduct a prescribed amount from the borrower&#39;s salary. The money lender is not entitled to serve such an order. The purpose of this bill is to prevent money lenders from  garnisheeing  a man&#39;s wages, unless and until the paying officer &#34; has scrutinized the transaction and satisfied himself that it was a reasonable one. If, for example, u money lender has charged an exorbitant rate of interest, or unreasonable costs, as many money lenders do, the paying officer could refuse service of a .garnishee order. In those circumstances, not one penny could bc taken from the officer&#39;s salary. An officer cannot lose any of his salary by a garnishee order in favour of a money lender unless the chief officer has investigated the transaction and is satisfied that ir i.f a i r. </para>

That, however, is a matter for the State legislatures. South Australia has already passed legislation to that! effect,  and  T  believe  that some, if not  nil, of the other States have done so.

                        <para>. - Generally, I support the bill, which 1 recognize is an attempt to deal with a very difficult subject. Some of the matters complained of, such as the need, for stricter control of money lenders generally, are the responsibility of the States. This measure is designed to make it difficult for money lenders to operate in the Common wealth Public Service. .1. do not know the conditions in. all of the States, but I do know that a bill recently passed through the Victorian Parliament to prescribe the rates of interest which may be charged by money lenders. Generally, public servants, both State and Commonwealth, are regarded as good marks by money lenders. Notwithstanding that employees of the Victorian Railways cannot have their salaries or wages gar.nisheed money lenders are active among them. </para>

                            <para>-Yes. In the State Public Service, if an officer or employee is in trouble with his creditors and if an order has been secured against him, the head of the department interviews the person concerned with a view to making the necessary arrangements for the payment of an agreed-upon amount from his salary. The question of insolvency may arise. Under the State- law an employee, who becomes insolvent and makes an arrangement with his creditors. has to convince the Commissioner that he is making a reasonable effort to satisfy his creditors. </para>

                            <para>- In the Victorian Public Service, if a man is making  a  reasonable effort to discharge his debts, he is not harassed. This clause goes somewhat further than was indicated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline> The chief officer of the department, not the paying officer, will decide whether or not a garnishee order shall be issued, and I presume that he would make a thorough investigation before doing so. That may be a weakness in the proposed new section. The chief officer may be prejudiced against a certain officer who resorts to borrowing. But still there is the safeguard that the chief officer of the department will investigate the position and if he is satisfied he will allow a garnishee order to go on to the paying officer. I am wondering whether the amount which an officer receives as child endowment can be attached under a garnishee order. </para>

                            <para>- I am pleased to know that such payments to officers of the Commonwealth are protected, otherwise very great injustices might lie inflicted on the wife and family of a judgment debtor. The original act provided that an officer against whom an order has been issued should retain not less than &#163;2 a week, and this bill does not liberalize that provision. As the cost of living has greatly increased since the original act was passed the Government  might very well consider the- advisability of increasing the amount which may be retained by an officer. </para>

                            <para>- I know it is, and I think that it should be increased. We know what happens in the great majority of cases. When a money lender takes action in a court of petty sessions against an officer of the Public Service, the officer concerned is very often unable to obtain leave to attend the court, so judgment goes by default. The order is made. I would say, in answer to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> that if it were possible for a judgment creditor to seize the assets of a debtor, he would not go to the trouble of making application for a garnishee order. We may assume, therefore, that the person against whom the garnishee order is issued is, from the point of view of material possessions, extremely poor. Very often his unfortunate position is the result of circumstances over which he has no control - not all borrowers are completely reckless or irresponsible - and as he has no assets, he is forced to turn to a money lender for temporary relief. Unlike the more fortunate section of the community, he is not able to get accommodation from a bank or from other financial institutions, because, as I have explained, he has no assets. The courts do not always take into consideration the financial position of an unfortunate debtor who may . not be represented in court. Not infrequently an order is made in default, and, once that is done, the salary of &#34;a judgment debtor over the amount of . &#163;2 a week is in jeopardy. No one wishes to protect an unscrupulous person who seeks to evade his responsibilities. The Public &#39;Service organizations have on many occasions expressed their views with regard to this class of legislation. They agree that all members of the Public Service should pay their just debts, but they have &#39;pointed to the many difficulties that arise and have indicated that in some circumstances these provisions in the act will operate harshly. </para>

I again assure them that the debtor is amply protected by paragraph viii of this proposed new section 64. The amount of &#163;2 a week is the minimum which may be -retained on behalf of a judgment debtor. The general purport of the proposed new section is to increase very greatly the protection of the public servant. </para>

                    <para>Section 72 provides in sub-section 2 for leave of absence to officers called up in pursuance of the Defence Act for active service in Australia or for active service in the naval forces. Subsection 4 of the same section enacts that the period of absence shall for all purposes be included as part of the officer&#39;s period of service under the Commonwealth Public -Service Act. In a proclamation by the Governor-General, published in the <inline font-style="italic">Gazette</inline> on the 2nd September, calling out the Citizen Forces, the term &#34; war service &#34; is used. As there is a &#39;distinction between the terms &#34; active service &#34; and &#34; war service &#34; it has been considered advisable to amend proposed new sub-section 2 by inserting the word &#34; war &#34; instead of &#39;&#34; active &#34;. </para>

                    <para>Presumably the intention underlying the proposed new clause is to ensure that service in a temporary capacity in the Commonwealth Public Service shall bo taken into consideration for the purposes of furlough. It is considered that furlough is a privilege which should be granted only in respect of permanent service - a condition of service for those who take up the Public Service as a life career. This was contemplated when the present provision, which the Leader of the Opposition now desires to delete, was enacted. In many instances, qualified candidates for appointment to the service accept temporary employment, and if their temporary service, which is quite fortuitous, were counted for the purposes of furlough, they would gain an advantage over other qualified persons who may not happen to be available for temporary employment but wait their turn for permanent employment. Moreover, if the new clause were accepted, considerable additional cost to the Commonwealth would be involved. Furlough is granted after twenty years of continuous permanent service, and is at the rate of one and a half months&#39; furlough in respect of each completed five years of continuous service. Provision is also made for payment in lien of furlough, and for the grant of furlough or pay in lieu thereof in certain circumstances, on retirement or death, where an officer has had less than twenty years&#39; service. During the year 1937-38. furlough for varying periods was granted to 477 officers, and pay in lieu of furlough was authorized in 31.5 cases, either to officers on retirement or dependants of deceased officers. If prior temporary service were included in the total service of officers, some hundreds of officers would be affected and would become eligible for furlough earlier than under existing conditions, and most would qualify for an additional period of furlough, in most cases one and a half months, before retirement. This would involve increased cost, although figures as to actual expenditure are not available at the moment. This matter has received full consideration on many occasions, but it has not been found practicable to grant the concession sought. In the circumstances, the Government regrets that it is unable to accept the proposed new clause. </para>

                            <para>- Usually we can compliment the public services of other countries, but the Australian Commonwealth Public Service stands out as an inspiring example of loyal and devoted service. There are black sheep in every flock, and I suppose that there are some in the Commonwealth Public Service. 15ut ever since the inception of federation those who have been members of the Commonwealth Parliament have realized how valuable has been the service of the various Commonwealth departments in carrying on the work of this nation. We have been informed by the Minister that one of the reasons why this concession cannot be granted is because of the additional cost that would be involved, but there is no basis whatever for such a statement. Expenditure is being incurred to-day - I am not now referring to war expenditure - in a most extravagant manner without a moment&#39;s thought ; and from it no benefit will accrue. I have only to remind honorable senators that within recent months tens of thousands of pounds have been expended on additions and renovations to a building in the Australian. Capital Territory - expenditure which, in view of recent developments, may be unnecessary. There was no limit to the expenditure on internal and external renovations and additions to Government House at Yarralumla. There was no mention of the cost when the present Minister for Supply and Development <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey)</inline> decided to have a house costing &#163;7,000 or &#163;8,000 built for him with government money in Canberra, for which, of course, he has to pay rent. I could mention many other directions in which money is being expended - I was about to say deliberately and consciously wasted - but when it is a matter of giving a fair deal to those carrying out important duties, and to whom every section of the community is indebted, we are told that the cost is too great. </para>

                        - There are some public servants - I am not now referring to Commonwealth public servants - who have been employed in a temporary capacity for twenty years, and whose services are retained year after year. We say most definitely that the granting of furlough should be based on the length, and not on the nature, of service. Temporary employees should not be allowed to retain their positions if they are not rendering efficient service, and when they are retained in the Service they should not be denied the rights of permanent servants merely because they are classified as temporary officers. For varying reasons, the Government has allowed certain sections to come under the Public Service Act and to obtain furlough, to which they would not otherwise be entitled.

                            <para>- Those temporary officers are working under the Public Service Act, and consequently are bound by Public Service regulations. Why should they be entitled to rights and privileges which are denied temporary officers in other branches of the Service? For 50 years I have come in contact with public servants in different parts of Australia, particularly in Queensland, but more recently with Commonwealth public servants, and I have no hesitation in saying that nowhere in the world are there men who  are better trained or more efficient that those in the Commonwealth Public Service. Yet there is no department in the Public Service in which the rank and file are not grossly underpaid. I point out to the Government that it looks to the lower-paid workers for the great majority of the men required for military service, and the better the wages and conditions provided for employees in every department of life the more efficiently will the Government be arranging for the present and future safety of the nation. I am sure that, when the Minister was stating Iris objections to the amendment, he did not do so with any pleasure, and the argument that he was probably least pleased about was that relating to the cost of this proposal. </para>

                        <para>. -  There is much that appeals to me in the amendment submitted by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> on behalf of temporary employees in the Public Service. After a long period of temporary employment these men reach an age, or suffer illness, which causes a cessation of that employment. I know that a proposal has been under consideration that some form of superannuation or other payment should be given to them in recognition of long and meritorious service. If the Minister can assure me that such a proposal is receiving the serious consideration of the Government I shall support him, because T consider that this furlough is a reward to the permanent public servant. An employee who makes the Public Service his life&#39;s work is entitled to more consideration than is one who serves only in a temporary capacity and who may sock employment elsewhere. Many of the temporary men are returned soldiers, and something should be done for them when they have to leave the service after long periods of employment in it. </para>

                        SHEEHAN  (Victoria) &#91;5.26^. - I support the amendment, and I am pleased that the Minister drew attention to the fact that furlough is granted after twenty years service. That should be a convincing argument in favour of the amendment. One would think, on hearing other portions of the Minister&#39;s reply, that the carrying of the amendment would bring about the expenditure of a vast sum of money ; but the fact that the officers concerned will have to serve for twenty years before qualifying for furlough shows the necessity for, and justice of, the amendment. The retiring age in the Public Service is 65 years, but any officer may be retired at an earlier age. Provision has now been made for members of the Naval and Military Forces and others to be brought under the Public Service Act, and their retirement will take place at. earlier ages than 65 years. One can imagine that temparary employees brought under this act will not be in the service twenty years before receiving their long-service furlough, but many of them may have served in what is termed a temporary capacity for a great many years.
                    </para>
                    <para>It was said by the Minister that some officers might get an advantage through accepting temporary employment, the implication being that they would receive favours. Vacancies sometimes exist in country centres for positions in various grades of the Public Service, and such officers as telegraph messengers or telephonists are given temporary employment. These are mostly young persons. and when, they are appointed to the permanent staff they eventually become entitled to long service leave. Others, however, are brought into the Service as adults, and, although they have had long years of service they never become permanent officers, simply because the Public Service Board refrains from issuing the necessary authority to classify them as permanent officers. It is not right that an outsider should be appointed to the Public Service without examination, simply because a person in authority certifies that there is no officer in the Service able to fill the position. </para>

I hope, therefore, that the Minister in charge of the bill will agree. to the amendment, because it is designed to do justice, to a large body of men who, as the result of giving efficient service as temporary employees, have been placed upon the permanent staff. If they did not render efficient service as temporary employees they would  be dismissed. Prior to their permanent appointment, they fill what is termed a permanent vacancy. The privileges applying to their permanent service should also apply to their temporary service. </para>

                            <para>-I am not referring to temporary employees, but to officers who are made permanent after a period of temporary service, which they claim should be taken into consideration in computing long-service leave. To-day. however, an officer after rendering ten years&#39; temporary service must serve for twenty years as a permanent officer before be can quality for long-service leave. He must do 30 years&#39; service in order to qualify, whereas in respect of officers who enter the Service without examination, or on probation, service for the purposes of long-service leave commences from the  date of appointment. This differentiation is unfair, and, therefore, I hope that the amendment will be carried. </para>

                    <para>As honorable senators know, cooperative societies exist to-day all over the world. In Queensland a miners&#39; cooperative society is -proving a fine proposition. Newcastle : and Adelaide also provide examples of what can be done by cooperative societies on behalf of consumer shareholders. The Wholesale Cooperative Society of Great Britain is one of the biggest trading concerns in the world. Recently a commission was appointed to investigate the high cost of living in Canberra., and the commission&#39;s report is available to all honorable senators. That inquiry arose from the fact that the late Prime Minister, when he moved to Canberra with his large family, was shocked by the high cost of living here as compared with costs in other places where he had resided. The cost of living in Canberra is much higher than it is elsewhere in Australia. The permanent population, which consists mainly of married public servants and their families, can best appreciate that fact. Some months ago a young and enthusiastic public servant approached me on the subject of establishing a co-operative society in Canberra in order to reduce the cost of living to its shareholders, and asked me what I thought of the proposition. I replied that there was nothing I was more enthusiastic about. I suggested that Canberra was a very suitable centre in which to establish such a concern, and urged him to get on with the job, offering to give him any assistance within my power. He and a few other enthusiasts immediately set -about establishing a society, which was -eventually formed with seven directors, some of whom were public servants. That society was not registered because no provision existed for the registration of such a company in the Territory. However, an ordinance was gazetted recently which would enable that -difficulty to be overcome. But these enthusiasts have since come up against another difficulty. They now find that the . powers that be do not like their idea. There has been a good deal of correspondence between the promoters of this society and the Public Service Board and the Prime Minister&#39;s . Department. I shall not read the whole of the correspondence, but I wish to draw attention to the following letter from the Secretary of the Prime Minister&#39;s Department, dated the 10th July, 1939 : - </para>

                        <para>I am directed to refer again to your letter of 5th May, 1939, in which you requested that the Commonwealth &#39; Public Service Act be amended to enable an officer to act on the directorate of a co-operative society, and to inform you that advice lias now been received from the Public Service Board. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>The board is of opinion that it would be most difficult for an officer to take an active part in the direction of a trading concern without it interfering with the efficient performance of his public service position and that, furthermore, it would be undesirable for tin officer of the Public Service to be on the directorate of a, co-operative society, particularly in a place such as Canberra, where the society would necessarily come into competition with shopkeepers whose living was involved. </para>
                    <para class="block">If that means anything, it means that a public servant, merely because he is a public servant, is to be denied his ordinary rights of citizenship. He may not engage in any undertaking, although it may be of some value to the community, even outside public service hours. What a preposterous position ! </para>

                            <para>- These young men have put a lot of effort, into the formation of this society, but not one minute of public service hours has been devoted to it. Although I do not play golf, partly because T cannot, afford to do so, and partly because \ am not likely to excel at the sport, I know that there is a golf club in. Canberra which is a trading concern. It has a bar. and it proposes  10  expend about &#163;10,000 on improvements. With that laudable object I agree, but \. know that the conduct of the golf club occupies the time of some public servants during public service hours. But when a number of young men desire to start in Canberra, an organization similar to many that are operating in every part of the world, without drawing any salaries or receiving any return for their services, excepting such dividends as may accrue to them, as consumer shareholders at the end of certain accounting periods, the Government steps in and prevents them. If such action is to pass without question, the right of every public servant to under.ra ke any activity outside his office work will be interfered with. There are in Canberra a number of denominational schools, which are trading concerns in competition with public schools. Are we  10  understand that a public servant, whose children attend one of those institutions is not to be permitted to act as a member of a school committee in order to increase the efficiency of the institution? Or is a public servant to be denied the right to participate in the activities of the various religious bodies, or militia welfare committees, in the Territory? The two reasons given for refusing to public servants permission to act; on the directorate of this society were, first, that there might be some conflict of interest between his public service duties and the society&#39;s affairs, and, secondly, that the society would compete with shopkeepers in the Territory. Such reasons are so puerile that they ought not to be tolerated. The members of the directorate of the society will receive no salaries - their chief concern is that the public of Canberra shall not be exploited by local tradespeople. Some months ago I addressed a public meeting of workers in the Australian Capital Territory. At the time these horny-handed toilers, working for wages, were deeply concerned about the high cost of living in this city. They told me that, if something were not done to reduce the cost of living, some of them would take it in turn to collect orders from their mates, drive to Goulburn, make their purchases there, and distribute them on their return. Had they done so. they would merely have done what this society proposes to do in a more orderly way. Will honorable senators say that they would have been wrong if they had carried out their intention? They could have bought their requirements at prices at least.  10  per cent, lower than in Canberra.. They were prepared to meet their own transport expenses. If the Government is not prepared to accept the amendment, the Opposition will have to pay orions attention to the activities of honorable senators on the other side, and even Cabinet Ministers, as well as highly paid, public servants who are directors of all sorts of organizations. Not long ago &#163; drew the attention of honorable senators to a booklet entitled <inline font-style="italic">Who Owns Australia?</inline> which showed that many Cabinet Minister&#39;s had shares in various concerns. We are now told that that state of affairs no longer exists; that they have got rid of their shares. Of course they have. Those shares are now held in the names of their wives, their brothers-in-law, or other relatives. The promoters of the proposed co-operative society are spirited members of the Public Service who are trying to render a service to the community by bringing down the cost of living. Their aim is to benefit all persons who wish to become members of the society. </para>

                            <para>-  I know what happened in my State, and I know what would happen here if a co-operative society caused prices to come down. Not only the lower-paid public servants, but also many persons well able to pay extravagant prices, would be keen to get goods at the lower prices.I am not personally concerned, because I have no occasion to buy a great deal in Canberra. 1 get my board and lodging at the Hotel Kurrajong, and generally I am well satisfied.I ask honorable senators opposite intake a serious view of this matter. These young men are trying to render a service to the community, but the whole machinery of government is set in motion to prevent them from doing so. I hope that the Minister will see his way to accept the amendment. </para>

Ministers, apparently, are afraid that if public servants become directors of a co-operative society, they may be able to do something to protect the consumers from exploitation by shopkeepers. The people are being exploited at the present  time by shopkeepers in Canberra. Let me take the argument a little further. What are we but public servants? </para>

                            <para>- Yes, 1 can. We are elected to represent the people in this Parliament, and our duty is to give careful attention to the affairs of the Commonwealth - a job for which we are well paid. But some members of this Parliament claim the right to become directors of companies, and nobody has interfered with them. Why not give the same privilege to public servants? Members of this Parliament, who are directors of companies or other forms of private enterprise, claim that directorial duties do not interfere with their work as representatives of the people. I cannot say, because I have never occupied such a position. As representatives of the people, we have one job to do, and I repeat that we .get well paid for it, but I do not object to members of the Public Service becoming associated with cooperative societies established for the purpose of -preventing the people from being fleeced <inline font-style="italic">by</inline> private profit-mating concerns. If a civil servant is entitled to have a vote as a shareholder he .should be entitled, equally with an outsider, to become a director of a co-operative society.. </para>

He and his friends .would prevent &#34;public servants from exercising some of the privileges which they enjoy. He is absolutely selfish, and does not believe in the full exercise by the people of those democratic rights in which he professes to believe.

                            <para>- I do npt approve of the principle of one man, one job. I believe that, with proper safeguards, it would probably be wise if certain public servants could take part in the management of co-operative societies and thus gain some commercial experience. If the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> is prepared to insert a suitable safeguard in his amendment, I shall support it. I am wholeheartedly in favour of the establishment of co-operative societies, provided they are truly cooperative. Unfortunately, many so-called co-operative bodies become, in fact, purely trading concerns, whose main purpose is to distribute profits among .their shareholders. They do not reduce the prices of goods ; instead they make profits. A truly co-operative society, instead of -making profits would reduce its prices, and thus confer substantial benefits on its members. </para>

                        A. J. McLACHLAN(South  Australia) |8.5|. - The amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition
                        <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline>
                        prompts me to consider the Public Service in relation to the Crown generally. Before a Commonwealth Public Service Act was passed public servants could be dismissed on the &#39;
                        <inline font-style="italic">ipse dixit</inline>
                        of a Minister; but, when the act became operative, public servants were given certain benefits, including the right of. appeal before they could be dismissed. The only power which a Minister or a departmental head now possesses in thai respect is the right to suspend an officer. If the position were as if; existed when, the Public Service Act was passed, 1 would not have supported the amendment, because the underlying principle was that, having given the public servants certain protection and privileges, they were excluded from participation in any other civil occupation whatever. The act conferred upon them benefits which they had not enjoyed previously. What has happened since then? Canberra is populated mainly by officers of the Crown, and they are in a somewhat anomalous position. There is nothing to prevent them from forming a co-operative society ; but I do not see why the word &#34; consumers &#34; should be used. It does not appear to be an appropriate expression.I have never heard of a similar society being designated a consumers&#39; cooperative society. The Government has deputed public servants to various office? in connexion with semi-governmental activities, because of their knowledge of certain classes of businesses. Those officers form a liaison between the Government and the various business entities, in some of which the Government itself has a considerable financial interest. The principle previously observed has been departed from, 1 understand, with the approval of the Public&#39; Service Board. The amendment, which has been improved by the addition of the words suggested by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline>
                        provides ample safeguards, although the position again becomes curious. A member of the Public Service Board may be a member of the society, and the organization will act wisely if it arranges for the appointment of a member of the board to the directorate. The Leader of the Opposition is wise in accepting the safeguards suggested by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline>
                        It is only fair to allow these men, if they possess the necessary commercial genius, to direct the policy of the concern. That is what the directors of a co-operative society should do. They do not handle contracts from day to day, but deal only with broad questions of policy. I presume that shares will be made available to members of the general community in Canberra. With the safeguards indicated, which have been accepted by the Leader of the Opposition. I shall support the amendment, but I ask the Leader of the Opposition and
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline>
                        to consider whether they regard the word &#34; consumers &#34; as necessary. That word, in this instance, has not any significance, and may give rise to some doubt. A co-operative society means a co-operative society, and its cooperative effort can be directed only towards saving the consumers&#39; money. Some public servants are still in receipt of a Canberra allowance, but if the cost of living be reduced as a result of the operations of this society, some may  not  then be entitled to the allowance,  and  so governmental expenditure may he reduced.

This letter ran very close to constituting a case for libel. In addition, a misstatement was made by another Minister for Defence in the House of Representatives regarding Captain Conway passing for the rank of major. No blame is attached to the responsible military officer at Army Head-quarters for including that statement in the Minister&#39;s reply to a parliamentary question, as the question asked was rather ambiguous. Nevertheless, Captain Conway&#39;s truthfulness was doubted as the result of that reply, which was recorded in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline> The committee, whilst satisfied that there were insufficient grounds for compensation, was unanimously of opinion that, as Captain Conway&#39;s health has been seriously affected, particularly since the Minister&#39;s letter dated the 31st July, 1931, it was only fair and equitable that Captain Conway should receive the sum of &#163;100. With that <inline font-style="italic">ex. gratia</inline> payment he  would be able to meet, to some extent, the expenditure already incurred, and still to be incurred, in restoring him to normal health. </para>

                            <para>. - I regret that the Government cannot accept the recommendation of this committee. As pointed out by the honorable senator who submitted the motion for the appointment of the committee, the case of Captain Conway had been dealt with by five consecutive Ministers for Defence, holding varying political views, and on each occasion the case was thoroughly investigated. Each Minister came to the conclusion that no damage had been done to Captain Conway&#39;s reputation, that nobody had suggested for a. moment that he had acted in any way contrary to the best traditions of the military service, and that he had received compensation on the same scale as that applied to other military officers when  compulsorily  retired from the military service. Captain Conway was retired in accordance with the provisions of the Defence Retirement Act 1922. In his evidence be claimed compensation in respect, of loss of opportunities to obtain a position in the Public Service, but he admitted that he did not know of any position to which he could have been appointed. His claim for compensation was based also on loss of reputation and prestige affecting his opportunities to obtain responsible positions. The committee itself, by its own investigations, found that there was nothing in the&#39; evidence to substantiate the claim. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>When &#39;Captain Conway was retired from the Military Forces he was paid compensation amounting to &#163;1,283 6s. Sd., made up of &#163;1,020 16s. 8d. in respect of his retirement under the Defence Retirement Act, and &#163;262 10s. in lieu of furlough. I point out to honorable senators that, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> mentioned, the committee declared, after the most exhaustive investigation, that at) could find nothing that warranted the granting of any compensation., yet the committee concluded, for some unknown reason, that Captain Conway should receive a good-luck payment of &#163;100 from the Commonwealth Treasury. But thousands of persons in the community have imaginary grievances. If every such person could induce an honorable senator to submit a motion for the appointment of a select committee to investigate his claim - and some of them might have more justification for claiming compensation than Captain Conway had - and if he could touch the hearts of a majority of the members of the Senate there would be no end to investigations of this kind, and the Government might be frequently called upon to make <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payments similar to that now recommended by this committee. This case was exhaustively examined, and no new fact was brought forward to substantiate the claim. </para>

                            <para>- lt stated in no uncertain terms that Captain Conway had no right to compensation, but it now recommends that because a certain letter was sent by a Minister to Captain Conway, who said that his feelings had been hurt, a payment of &#163;100 should be made to him. The committee bad every opportunity to call any evidence required by it, and to examine the witnesses. It could have summoned any officer associated with the Defence Department, but there is not the slightest suggestion that any officer of that department, any Minister, or anybody else associated with the case considered that the slightest slur had been cast on Captain Conway&#39;s reputation. The Government recognizes that he was an able officer in the Military Forces, and did his duty well: but he was retired on the same basis as many other officers and was paid adequate compensation. </para>

                    <para>Referring to our conversation. Conway was desirous of going to the front. When his chance came in 1916, I told Dodds I could not. spare him. Conway was rather sore over it for a time. When I gave up the command he told me that as I had blocked him before I owed it to him&#39; to use my influence to get him away. When he was transferred to Brisbane, he pestered me with letters until he became a nuisance. I got a most pathetic letter from him a fortnight ago. He told me his chance had come and. he had to refuse it, completely blasting his career.  His  future was dark, in fact he had no future. But he had to choose between his career and killing his wife. </para>

It&#39;s the sofa, bed or the hospital for her the whole time. She is not strong enough to look after the children. One of them&#39; playing in the street, was run over a couple of years ago and spent months in the hospital. Another was killed. 1. have known Conway who with the expense of his wife&#39;s illness  cannot afford a servant to do the housework. </para>

Conway at first made every endeavour to get away to the front, hut later, when he had an opportunity to do so, circumstances over which he had no control, obliged him to ask that his application should be allowed to stand over. <inline font-weight="bold">Sir George</inline> Pearce, when he was Minister for Defence in 1918, determined that, in view of all the circumstances, Conway should remain in Australia. I am not blaming the present Minister for Defence for opposing Conway&#39;s claim. Indeed, any person who inspected Conway&#39;s file as it was arranged, would have arrived at the same conclusion. Undoubtedly <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley&#39;s</inline> letter to two friends of Conway, caused Conway much concern. The Minister has said that the committee did not give to this matter the fullest consideration. </para>

He said, in effect, that the committee&#39;s recommendation merely amounted to giving a &#34;good-luck&#34; payment of &#163;100 to Conway. That is hardly correct. More than once the Minister said that the committee had arrived at its decision for some reason which was unknown. I refer honorable senators to paragraphs <inline font-style="italic">h</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">i</inline> of the committee&#39;s findings. The first refers to the expunging of certain matters from Conway&#39;s file. Honorable senators will recall that, after considerable agitation, Major-General Bruche was appointed in 1931 to conduct an inquiry into Conway&#39;s case, and, after going into the matter thoroughly, ordered that certain matter should be expunged from Conway&#39;s file. In the course of the committee&#39;s investigation, I had an opportunity to examine that file, and to say the least, I found that the method adopted to expunge that matter was startling. 1 could not resist the conclusion that Conway consequently might have had ground for grievance. I found that Major-General Bruche&#39;s order had been carried out simply by drawing a line in red ink across the matter ordered to be expunged. The references, however, remained legible, and successive Ministers, on looking at the file, were at once able to read all of these unfavorable references. I do not know whether, in view of these facts, honorable senators would consider that that matter had really been expunged from Conway&#39;s file. To me the method employed does not quite savour of fair play. At the moment I am not going into the question of whether Conway is entitled to compensation or to -an <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment. I ask honorable senators to weigh the facts which I have stated, and to say whether Major-General Bruche&#39;s order was fairly carried out. </para>

Captain Conway was not an entirely satisfactory witness ; I regarded him as a man who was greatly upset because he believed that his grievance was genuine.

                            <para>.- I have an entirely unbiased mind about the case of Captain Conway, because I opposed the appointment of the committee. I did so, first, on the ground that it would be better if an outside body investigated his claim, and, secondly, because I did not approve of men, who had expressed definite opinions before hearing the evidence, being appointed to a semi-judicial committee. However, the Senate decided to appoint a committee, and we on this side have no ground for complaint as to its personnel, for a majority of its members were Government supporters. The committee having examined the evidence and observed the demeanour of witnesses, including Captain Conway himself, was much better qualified to judge of the merits of the claim than we are. If the appointment of the committee does nothing else than institute a better system of expunging records that are supposed to be expunged than the method adopted by the military authorities, it will have accomplished something worth while. The expunging of a record merely by drawing a red line through it is ridiculous: such a practice should be abolished. </para>

                            <para>. -  I support the adoption of the report, and I agree with the paragraph which states that Captain Conway has no legal claim for compensation. But there are other things than strictly legal claims, particularly when we are dealing with responsible bodies. Had I been the . legal adviser of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> and had he been sued for libel in 1931, and been offered the chance of getting out of it for &#163;100, I certainly should have advised him to accept the offer. In saying that, I am not necessarily saying that I am convinced that the letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> wrote to a third party was libellous ; but it was so close to the border-line that any wise counsel advising the defendant would say that if he could make a reasonable compromise, he should do so. All of the legal members of this chamber will agree that it is libellous to write of a man that he is not fit to hold the position which he happens to have held, or is holding. The letter which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> unwisely wrote to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Buckland</inline> virtually said that Captain Conway was not fit to hold any position in the. Military Forces. </para>

                                <para>- Under the law relating to libel, it does not matter whether the statement embodied <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley&#39;s</inline> own opinion, or was something which had been conveyed to him. The fact is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> wrote to a third party and thereby published something which, to say the least, was on the verge of libel. The proper course of action for Captain Conway to have taken was to sue <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley</inline> for libel in 1931. Had he done so. and recovered damages against <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline> it is impossible to say now whether the Government of the day would have stood behind its Minister for Defence and paid the amount awarded by the court, or whether it would have said that, if any of its Ministers was foolish enough to libel some person in the community, he should bear the consequences of his action. Honorable senators will see that the committee whose report is before us, could not say whether or not the Government was responsible for its Minister&#39;s letter. There was no evidence one way or the other on that point. Further, from a legal point of view, there is not the slightest, doubt that any action at this stage by Captain Conway would be legally barred by the Statute of Limitations. In spite of what the Minister has said, the committee was not. indecisive. It made a definite finding; it said that Captain Conway had no legal claim. But it also said that certain very injudicious things were done by a previous Minister for Defence, that he wrote a most unwise letter, and, further, that an order for the expunging of certain records was clumsily done by the military authorities. Although the committee is perfectly candid, and says emphatically that there is no legal obligation on the. Government to compensate Captain Conway, it placed the facts before the Senate so that a decision could be made as to whether or not there was justification for an <inline font-style="italic">ex gratia</inline> payment to Captain Conway. </para>

                            <para>. - Some honorable senators have described the budget speech as a national stocktaking or balance-sheet. It is, at least, an indication of the Government&#39;s intentions for the current financial year. Although presented when the nation is at war, it was prepared in a time of peace, and therefore, we are justified in examining it as an indication of the Government&#39;s peace-time policy. I realize that all other matters are overshadowed by the catastrophe that has befallen the world. Nevertheless, I believe that it is well that the Government should be reminded that it is, for the time being, in charge of the Commonwealth. It has been said that this budget is unique inasmuch as, for the first time in the history of Australia, a &#163;100,000,000 budget has been introduced. The fact that it has been found necessary to provide for such a colossal expenditure is indeed historic. Introducing his budget, the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> said - </para>

                        <para>That extraordinary development - and, of course, it is a development that has taken place all over the world, because the British Chancellor of the Exchequer this year presented to the House of Commons a &#163;1,000,000,000 budget - is not, if I may say so, in spite of some carping critics, entirely due to the extravagance of politicians. 1 have no doubt that we are not immune from the common disposition to be generous with other people&#39;s money - it would be foolish for us to deny that charge - but, at the same time, the real and overpowering reason for the growth of &#39;budgetary expenditure is undoubtedly to be found in two things. First, there has been a revolutionary change during the last generation in the view which prevails as to the obligations of governments towards the aged, the sick and the poor - in other words, a revolutionary change in our sense of obligation for what we call social services. In the second place - and this has been increasingly true in the last few years - it has been due to the rapid mounting of defence expenditures in the forcing house of international fear, and, at present, international violence. Those two great factors have, I venture to say, been the real explanation of what might otherwise, be regarded as a most inexplicable growth of government expenditure. </para>

                    <para class="block">One would assume, from the observations of the Prime Minister, that the right of the people to improved social services would be one reason for the presentation of such an extraordinary budget. An examination of the Government&#39;s proposals and a review of Australia&#39;s social conditions, indicate, however,, that the economic position is growing worse, and that unemployment is steadily increasing, though the situation may not yet be as serious as it was some years ago. What has the Government, done to prevent this increase of unemployment? It has done very little. To-day a clarion call is being sounded to rally the people to the defence of Australia. From a purely defence point of view that call is warranted, and we have no doubt that it will be answered, but surely the Government has au obligation to establish social and economic conditions that will make Australia worth defending. This Ministry, which continues the traditions of its immediate predecessors, has no reason to be proud of its record. Every appeal that has been made to it to assist the unemployed has fallen upon deaf ears. Honorable senators will recall that towards the end of last year an effort was made in this Parliament to induce the Government to provide funds for more employment, but when the matter was brought up in the House of Representatives, the debate was abruptly terminated. Much the same treatment was meted out to honorable senators on this side when representations were made to the Government. Ministers gave what amounted to a point, blank refusal to do anything in the matter. Although it is generally recognized that unemployment could be reduced by shortening the working week, the Government has declined to give a lead to private employers. </para>

                            <para>- I do. If the Government were  sincere  in its desire to arrest the increase of unemployment, it would face the facts and shorten the working week in all government undertakings. Ministers have offered a variety of excuses for their failure to stop this economic drift. Among other things, it has been suggested that constitutional difficulties would prevent the introduction of the innovation. But if the Government had been sincere it could have discovered a way to overcome any legal obstacles. <inline font-style="italic">For</inline> instance, no one would question the Government&#39;s right to reduce the weekly working hours in the Commonwealth Public Service. But it declined to do that. The trade union movement has been advised to refer this matter to the arbitration court. Not long ago the Commonwealth Public Service Arbitrator, after a careful examination of the position, informed the Government that the time was opportune for the introduction of a shorter working week in the Public Service; but he left the matter in the hands of the Government, which refused to act upon  the  recommendation of this properly constituted authority. At the same time it urged outside organizations to take this problem as it relates to private industries before some legal tribunal. Surely that exposed the insincerity of the Government. </para>

The fact that those  who  are responsible for the control of the shipping  industry  do not organize their business in a proper manner cannot be cited as a reason against the reduction of the working week. If work is to be provided for every section of the community, the problem must bc approached in a proper and scientific manner. </para>

                            <para>- That may be the opinion of the honorable senator. I ask him to study the record of the governments that, have preceded the present Ministry. Honorable senators opposite who have been members of this branch of the legislature for some years have supported various governments, including the Bruce-Page, the Lyons-Page, and the Menzies Governments. In 1925, the party led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> promised to provide social services, including motherhood endowment, workers&#39; homes, unemployment insurance, and national insurance. Where are those reforms? Have honorable senators opposite done anything to assist the introduction of social legislation which has been promised for years? </para>

                            <para>- We shall do so as soon as we have an opportunity. The action of certain members of the Government during the last few days suggests that the sooner this chamber is abolished the better it will be for the community. The Government stresses the necessity for social legislation, but it does not attempt to improve the standard of living. The statement was made at one time that if an anti-Labour government were elected, one of its first acts would be to provide decent wages and comfortable homes for the workers. Even in this budget, great stress is laid upon the need for improved social services. But nothing has been done. </para>

                    <para>It is to bo deplored that in recent years the number of invalid and old-age pensioners has increased, which is a clear indication of the fact that the economic policy of this and preceding governments has been wrong. Honorable senators will recall that, with a great flare of trumpets, the Lyons-Page  Government introduced a National Health and Pensions Insurance Bill in order to afford some relief to a section of the community that is suffering severe disabilities. When that measure was introduced, stress was laid on the number of persons who are becoming a charge upon the State. The then Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> in dealing with the cost of pensions, said - </para>
                    <quote>
                        <para>The gravity of the prospective growth of the cost of pensions is accentuated by the fact that, 40 years from now, there will be relatively fewer persons in the active productive agc groups to bear the burden. According to the present and recent trends of our vital statistics, and on the assumption that there will be no material change in the rate of migration which has prevailed during the past five years, the population nf Australia will have begun to decline in considerably less than 40 years from now. If one compares the number of wage-earners in Australia - I am using the term as quoted in the  census  returns - with the number of persons in the pension age group, it will be found that whereas to-day there are 26 persons of pension age to every 100 wage-earners, in 40 years from now the proportion of persons of pension age will have risen to 54 for every 100  wage-earners.  These are some of the vital considerations against the background of which the Government has had to consider the framing of this national insurance scheme. The scheme that we have framed takes into account the factors that I have mentioned - some of them quite disturbing factors. </para>

                    <para class="block">It is a very disturbing factor that, in a young country the oldest State of which has only recently celebrated its 150th birthday, while Victoria has just had its centenary, our economic development has been such that the number of persons drawing pensions will increase to the degree mentioned by the Minister. That is a position which should! cause the Government to make an effort to relieve the present distressing situation. In analysing the activities of the Government, we find that nothing has been done to that end. </para>

If it were not for the position with which we are now faced, I would criticize severely the Government&#39;s defence policy. I shall not adopt the role of a carping critic, but, if there be any difficulty in the way of equipping those who have volunteered for service in the defence forces, the anti-Labour governments that have been in ofiB.ce during, the last seven years are responsible for it. In 1914 the war machine was put into smooth operation almost within a month of the outbreak of hostilities, and the credit for that must he given to the Labour government that had prepared the way for the rapid and efficient working of that machine. </para>

For many years anti-Labour governments have not paid sufficient attention to this matter. As well ns introducing universal training, a Labour government made the war machine almost perfect. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator constantly endeavours to disparage the policy of the Labour party, but I remind the Senate of the defence plans of the Labour party. If any section of the Defence Department is working smoothly to-day it is that portion which was created by a Labour government. Great credit is taken for the fact .that there is no shortage of munitions to-day. The thanks for that are line to the foresight of a Labour administration, which established a munitions factory owned and controlled by the nation. Labour is also entitled to credit for the fact that there is no shortage of small arms. </para>

Soon after the outbreak of the last war the primary producers appealed to the Government to protect them against the enormous increase of the freights charged by the private shipping companies for the conveyance of their produce to the world&#39;s markets, and I am sure that those producers will soon be wishing that there were a Commonwealth owned and controlled line of steamers still in operation. </para>

                            <para>- Yes, but that was not justification for the profiteering practices of the shipping companies, which extorted vast sums of money from the British authorities as well as from the Australian producers. </para>

                    <para>The Government has taken credit for the fact that it has introduced a budget providing for the raising of &#163;100,000,000 from 7,000,000 people - from a nation which, according to the former Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Casey),</inline> is fast becoming an aggregation of people living on &#163;1 a week! Does that satisfy honorable senators that <inline font-style="italic">all</inline> is well? &#39;Surely this Government should do something more than it has done in the interests of Australia. </para>
                    <para>One pleasing feature is that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> can see a silver lining to the dark cloud hanging over this country. In recent weeks he has gone to a good deal of trouble to castigate the Labour party for refusing to assist in the formation of a national government. He has said that it is necessary to utilize the best brains in this Parliament, in order to steer the ship of state safely through the troubled seas on which it is now being tossed. He declares that men are to be found on the Opposition side whose services would prove of great value if they were appointed to a national Ministry, and that, if the Opposition does not assist in the formation of such a government, the Administration will fail. That is my interpretation of his flattering invitation to members of the Opposition to join a national cabinet. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> is quite correct. The Opposition, both in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, contains men who are quite capable of governing this country in the present crisis. There are also many representatives of Labour outside of this Parliament who possess similar ability, and who when they are given the opportunity by the people in the near future to enter this Parliament, will provide sufficient numbers to enable us to form a government composed entirely of adherents of Labour. When that time comes, we shall not hesitate to give effect to legislation which will be in the interests of the people of Australia. For the time being, however, this Government cannot chirk its obligation to control the country. Nor can it escape responsibility for its misdeeds.. Despite the quarrelling and bickering which has been apparent in its ranks, and despite its efforts to cloak the sordid scramble among its followers for portfolios, it cannot get away from the fact that it must accept responsibility for the adverse economic conditions existing to-day, the increase of unemployment, and the fact that our war machine is not functioning as it should. It cannot ger away from the fact that largely because of want of unanimity in its own ranks over a long period, it has failed to handle these problems effectively. To-day, we find that the Government party consists almost wholly of ex-generals and no privates. In view of these facts, there is a ray of hope - and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> has seen it - that very soon the people of Australia will put in office a Labour government. We shall then accept the responsibility of government, and give effect to a policy that will do credit to Australia. </para>

                            <para>.- Speeches of the kind just delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> are welcome now and again, because they enable one to realize exactly what the Opposition is aiming at in the present crisis. Assurances have been given by members of the Opposition, both here and in the House of Representatives, that it will co-operate with the Government in every possible way in order to help Australia during the war period. But the whole of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan&#39;s</inline> speech suggested that the Opposition was desirous of displacing the present Government. Is that the Opposition&#39;s way of co-operating with the Government ? Apparently the Opposition&#39;s idea of helping the Government is to condemn everything that the Government has done, is doing, or intends to do. How can the Opposition take up that attitude, and at the same time expect the people to believe that it intends to do its best to help the Government to see Australia through this crisis? The Opposition cannot have it both ways. I suggest that if its objective is to displace the Government, with the object of forming a purely Labour government, it should frankly say so. I should like to know, exactly what is the Opposition&#39;s real attitude to the Government. </para>

During the last war I was a member of the Victorian Parliament and later a member of the House of Representatives, and I know that in respect of defence preparedness Australia is ten times better off to-day than it was in 1914. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> said that at the shortest notice tens of thousands of well-equipped Australian soldiers were sent abroad in the last war. I point out that only a small proportion of those soldiers were trained when they left these shores. The bulk of them wore trained in Egypt. </para>

                                <para>- Really, I do not know why honorable &#39;senators opposite are here. It seems to me that they are here to speak with two voices. I should like to know which is the true voice. I have listened with interest to the lengthy speeches made in this debate by honorable senators opposite - the rather frenzied oratory of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> the more practical plodding of the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition, and the outpourings, in varying degrees of eloquence, of their colleagues. May I say that the supreme self-confidence of the Leader of the Opposition might sometimes be mistaken for arrogance, but when his lesser colleagues endeavour to follow his example they become amusing and even ludicrous. Two themes run through the tales of honorable senators opposite: first, the expansion of credit to meet our war expenditure; and, secondly, what they call social reconstruction. The degrees of credit expansion advocated by honorable senators opposite range from the &#34;whole hog&#34; inflation advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> to the more practical limits supported by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane, Senator Brown</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Courtice.</inline> The three last-mentioned honorable senators apparently entertain grave doubts concerning the vast expansion of credit advocated by some of their colleagues for the purpose of financing the present war. But, invariably, in the end all honorable senators opposite, with the exception of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey,</inline> seemed to hedge a little as to the degree to which our credit should be expanded. They did not know exactly where they were. They said they would stand by the first plank of the Labour party&#39;s platform. That was the only way in which they could reconcile their widely divergent opinions. In that; way only could they reconcile the views of those who advocated unlimited credit with those of their colleagues who would be content with a small expansion of credit. They appeared to lose sight of the failure of their policy wherever it has been tried. They overlooked the ruin of the labouring classes, wage-earners and civil servants in Germany which resulted from the application of just such a policy as they advocate for Australia. Another illustration of the evils associated with the expansion of credit, as advocated by honorable senators opposite, has been provided in the United States of America, where the economic machine was clogged simply because too much money was made available. We saw the anomaly of the richest country in the world having 10,000,000 unemployed, simply because it endeavoured to apply the financial policy advocated by honorable senators opposite. One would gather from the arguments of these honorable senators that no part of Australia&#39;s credit has yet been pledged. As a matter of fact, the credit of this country has been pledged to the amount of &#163;1,300,000,000, whilst, apart from the  debt3  of governments, the liabilities of non-governmental bodies runs into many more millions of pounds. Honorable senators opposite should remember that a security cannot be mortgaged twice. The credit of Australia has already been pledged for the vast sum which I have mentioned. When I hear people talk about profiteering by investors who have lent money to governments, I am reminded that all governments, including Labour governments, have borrowed money. Generally, Labour governments have to pay higher rates of interest than other governments aic called upon to pay. </para>

                                <para>- Social reconstruction in Russia, Germany, Spain and Italy has led to chaos. The attempt to upset the old order and establish a new order has led to another war; and now we must wait until all the diabolical cruelties which would not have been thought of in the Dark Ages are over, before we can hope to make any progress. These crimes are being done in the sacred name of social reconstruction. </para>

                                <para>- Of course not; but I point out that the social reconstruction which has been going on for a number of years has not brought about particularly happy results in Germany, Russia and Spain. Social reconstruction has brought to the world the horrors of war, the violation of all sense of justice , and decency, and the debasement of mankind to a degree unknown in the old world. In an attempt to preserve those elements of decency and fair play which it believes are the right of mankind every where Great Britain went to the limit that any free people could go. It went so far as to deprive itself of adequate means of defence, in the hope that its noble example would be followed by the rest of the world. </para>

Honorable senators opposite had better be careful about advocating social reconstruction. They should remember that the old methods brought to Australia a degree of prosperity and happiness that was the envy of other countries. I, for one, believe that steady progress along the lines that we were following would have led to something worth while, and proved an example to the rest of the world. However, modern movements have ushered in a new era, and we must now arm to the teeth in order to save our lives and our honour. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> sneered because the Treasurer has brought in a &#163; 100,000,000 budget. Does not the honorable senator realize that many millions of pounds will have to be expended if our safety as a people is to be ensured ? In 1931, Australia expended about &#163;3,000,000 on defence. Last year the defence expenditure from revenue was nearly &#163;9,000,000, and, in addition, the expenditure from loan amounted to about &#163;14,000,000. </para>

                        <para>In his criticism of the budget a few days ago, the Leader of the Opposition complained that the proposed increase of the tax on incomes from personal exertion by 10 per cent, would press unfairly on persons having smaller incomes. I believe that the honorable gentleman said that the increase would mean an additional payment of 19s.1d. by men on the basic wage. I think the honorable senator must have been mis-informed, because a man on the basic, wage does, not pay Commonwealth income tax. </para>

                                <para>- The. exemption of &#163;250 enables a person on the basic wage to escape the tax. As I understand the. Government&#39;s proposal, the increased rate of tax on the smaller income is about 2.3d. in the &#163;1, whereas the. increased rate on the higher incomes is approximately 80d. or 6s. 8d. in the &#163;1, so that the proposed increase of 10 per cent, would mean about a farthing in the &#163;1 to persons in the lower income group, and about 8d. or 9d. in the &#163;1 to- persons having higher incomes. This being so, the argument of the Leader of the Opposition was not quite fair. </para>

                                <para>- Quite sound; but I am not worrying about tariff matters at the present time, because something of a very much more serious nature is  engaging our attention. Australia is facing, perhaps, the gravest crisis in its history, and I suggest that the Leader of the Opposition and his colleagues would do well to follow the lea&#39;d of the Labour unions in Great Britain. They seem to have a very much more definite appreciation of their obligations to the Empire. </para>

                                <para>- I read in the cable news two or three days ago that the Labour unions of Great Britain had appointed two or three of their members io visit Canada and the United States nf America for the purpose of placing before Labour organizations in those countries the attitude of the British Labour party to the war in which Britain and the dominions are now involved. They believe that by doing this there will be better understanding between the peoples of the Empire and the workers of English-speaking countries. Instead nf being se critical of the Government, the Australian Labour party might make a similar gesture. </para>

                                <para>- It is hardly worth talking about. Another statement made by honorable senators opposite during the debate related to alleged sweating in the clothing trade in Melbourne. I think that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> mentioned this matter and probably also the Leader  of  the Opposition. </para>

                                <para>- The Government made no such promise. The Government of Victoria was naturally perturbed at statements made some months ago about sweating in the clothing trade in Melbourne, and appointed its most trusted inspector to make a thorough investigation of the charges. This official visited all those small places in Queensbury.street. Carlton, where, it was stated, sweating was being indulged in, and he reported to the Government that he could find no evidence to support the charges. The truth is that the clothing trade unions had just served a new log on the employers and, as has been done on other occasions, they circulated charges  of  sweating purely for propaganda purposes in order to support their claim. </para>

                        <para>Under normal conditions I should have criticized some phases of the Government&#39;s financial proposals, and complained because certain public works, such as the provision of additional postal facilities, ave not to be provided; but as the Government is faced with tremendous responsibilities and the time of every Minister is very fully employed on work of the highest national importance, it would be unreasonable for any honorable senator to adopt such a course. I do not think that some honorable senators opposite realize the tremendous amount  of  work which Ministers have to perform, and the efforts which this Government. is making to preserve our national characteristics and to ensure, so far as is humanly possible, the safety of the nation. It behoves every member of this Parliament to refrain from carping criticism until we are out of danger. It is unreasonable for members of the Opposition to say that Parliament should remain in session when they occupy its time in criticizing almost every ministerial action. That is not the way in which this great conflict, in which our safety and all that we hold dear is involved, can be brought to a successful conclusion. The Government should be allowed to give its undivided attention to the numerous pressing problems confronting it, so that it may function in the interests of not only the Australian people but also of the whole Empire. </para>

                            <para>. -  Honorable senators have taken advantage of the opportunity afforded by this motion to discuss a variety of subjects, many of which are related only indirectly to the Government&#39;s financial proposals, and apart from a few heated exchanges the debate has been conducted in a friendly manner and on a high plane. AVe should, I think, congratulate the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> upon the lucid manner in which Australia&#39;s financial position has been placed before the Parliament. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> said that the members of the Opposition appreciated the difficult position of the Government, and, while reserving to themselves the right to criticize, were willing to do what they could to assist. The  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> also admitted that if a Labour government were in power it, too, would have to raise money to assist in the prosecution of the war, although the Labour party believes that our present economic position could be improved by changing from the orthodox system of finance. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan,</inline> who condemned every action of the Government, said that the Ministry is responsible, and, in effect, that the Opposition should not be expected to shoulder any of the burden. A few days ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan,</inline> and others with whom he is associated, suggested that Parliament should remain in session ; but what would be the use of Parliament sitting continuously if the Opposition does not propose to assume some responsibility? </para>

                                <para>- The Opposition should submit constructive criticism instead of endeavouring tq obstruct the Government in the important work which it has in hand. The budget overs an expenditure of approximately  &#163;102,000,000,  a large portion of which is to be raised by means of taxes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> also stated that as the budget was framed prior to the outbreak of war he was entitled to discuss it from that angle. That was most unfair. When asked in what directions the Government&#39;s policy could be improved, he said that the Government should make legislative provision for a shorter working week in order to increase employment. No honorable senator could prove to me, to the captains of industry, or even to himself, that the adoption of a  40-hour  week throughout Australia would bring about a. well-balanced economy, and not reduce the purchasing power of wages. There is only one honorable senator in this chamber who would be bold enough to support such a contention, and that, is <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey.</inline> It is generally realized that a reduction of the hours of work, coupled with maintenance of the present rates of wages, would inevitably result in an. increase of the costs of production. Is it suggested that the social experiments carried out by the Labour Government of New Zealand have been successful, or have increased the purchasing power of wages, seeing that the cost of living in that dominion has risen by  30  per cent, or  40  per cent.? Labour has not solved the housing problem- in New Zealand, and there are as many unemployed in that country, in proportion to the population, as there arc in any part of Australia. </para>

                        <para>Two of the biggest, industrial organizations in the Commonwealth are the Australian Workers Union and the Waterside Workers Federation. I have never heard one honorable senator contend that a shearer should not work more than 44 hours a week, or that his work should be done by day labour and not at piece-work rates. It is well known by honorable senators generally that a substantial number, if not one-half, of the men admitted to the Waterside Workers Federation cannot be provided with constant employment. When a vessel arrives in port and requires quick unloading, the stevedore picks up the men needed for the job, and, after they have worked for a certain number of hours, they receive time and a half, and sometimes double time. I have seen 100 men waiting to be picked up, and only 40 or 50 of them have been employed. After they have been working for, perhaps, ten hours, do they say to their comrades, &#34; Now it is your turn &#34;? It is sheer cant and humbug for any honorable senator in say that no worker should be employed for more than 40 hours a week. Those who control the members of the Waterside Workers Federation have never had the courage to say to these employees, &#34; You shall work six hours a day, and then we shall call in the others who have not been picked up &#34;. </para>

                        <para>The success of certain companies that employ large numbers of men seems to be anathema to some honorable senators; but there is nothing to prevent them from going to the stock exchanges and buying shares in those companies. The shares are not held entirely by wealthy persons, although wealthy men may be found on the directorates. Thousands of small shareholders have invested their savings in these companies. Tens of thousands of pounds invested in such undertakings as those conducted by the Colonial Sugar Refining Company Limited and certain shipping companies represents trust money. The purchase of . shares in such companies  is  often regarded by trustees. as a safe investment to provide widows and orphans with the means of livelihood - often only a bare living. Why do not the Labour unions use the money subscribed by their members for the establishment of clothing factories, steel works, . or other industrial enterprises? Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited is regarded by most members of the Opposition as a great octopus that is sapping the life-blood of this country. Whilst I hold no brief for companies that take undue profits from the people, it must, be admitted that no country can ever become great unless it has iron and steel industries. Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, which began in a. small way, has developed a basic industry of which the nation may well be proud. Is it  a  crime for this company, which has thousands of employees, to make profits? What do companies of this kind do with their money? Do they bury it in the ground, or do they use it to extend their business or to establish further industries? Can any honorable senator point to an instance in which the companies that are denounced by the Opposition have sent their money out of Australia? Of course not. I do not impute improper motives to honorable senators opposite, but their attitude and speeches remind me of the story of the boy who went to sea and kept a diary which showed that at a certain time daily he said his prayers. When members of the crew told  him that they  knew quite well that he did not say his prayers, the boy replied, &#34; <inline font-style="italic">~8o;</inline> but it will read very well at home &#34;. </para>

                            <para>.. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply -</inline> As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has pointed out, this budget is probably the most important and certainly the most extensive, that has yet been presented in any parliament in Australia.. I appreciate the assurance by honorable- senators opposite that they will support the Government in every possible way in the present crisis, but I am disappointed that they have not done more to honour that promise. They failed, for instance, to offer any constructive criticism of  the Government&#39;s proposals. On the contrary, we have been obliged during, the last two weeks to listen to the same old speeches which Opposition members have been delivering in the Senate for years. The Leader of the Opposition, <inline font-weight="bold">(.Senator Collings)</inline> made a very good speech,, and so he should, because he has made it so often. Honorable senators generally are always glad to listen to him, hut I suggest that it is about time that he put on a new record&#39;. &#34;We have heard from honorable senators opposite all about the misdeeds of this Government and its predecessors. They have related their usual tales about sweating in industry in England in mid-Victorian days, and have told the same old stories about social reforms. But their speeches lacked constructive criticism which might have been of some aid to the Government. I recognize that the debate on the budget affords honorable senators an opportunity to speak on almost any subject. As time goes on, however, I trust that all of us will recognize the magnitude of the responsibilities which we shall be obliged to shoulder in the present crisis. In that task the Government will need the active assistance of every honorable senator, and every section of the community, irrespective of party political divisions, and it confidently anticipates that such assistance will be forthcoming. I deplore the fact that right at the outset of this crisis, certain members in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, in order to obtain a little party advantage, have caused two of the Government&#39;s financial measures, whereby it sought fo obtain an additional &#163;2,000,000 of revenue, to b&#60;? rejected. &#39;The Government is badly in need of that money as a contribution towards the effective prosecution of the war. Without wishing to anticipate a later debate, I say definnitely that the Government accepts full responsibility for its financial programme, and intends to go ahead with it in its own way. But no government can be expected, in a time of national crisis, to tolerate the upsetting of its financial programme, merely for party political gain. </para>

                        <para>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the resumption of land at Wagga for the purpose of establishing an air force station. He suggested that the Government had paid too big a price fer the land. The- resumptions branch of the Department of the- Interior effected this transaction. Since- I have been the ministerial1 head of that department, this is the first occasion on which any complaint has been made that a price paid by the Government was too large, but I can. recall many instances in- which members, both in the Senate and in the other chamber, have made representations to me on behalf of owners whose land ha; been resumed that the price paid1 by the Government was- not high enough. In this particular case, the Government paid &#163;12,000 for land, compulsorily resumed from occupants who were farming it for a livelihood1. The Government picked the eyes out of the properties concerned in order to obtain a level stretch of country suitable for the establishment of an all-weather aerodrome. A local resident stated that he was quite prepared to pay &#163;20 an acre for any of the land taken by the Government. The valuations placed by the owners on the areas resumed were - Brunskill Estate, &#163;23 an acre; Sackville Proprietary Limited, &#163;25 an acre; and Mount Blake, &#163;25 an acre. The prices agreed upon were respectively &#163;14, &#163;17 10s., and &#163;15 an acre. The Leader of the Opposition suggested that this land should have been made available to the Government at what he termed a. peppercorn rental for the period for which it was required for air force purposes. I point out that it is the Government&#39;s intention to establish a permanent air force station on this site, ft  would have been unfair for this, or any other government to take this property in the way suggested by the honorable senator, particularly in view of the fact that the occupants were depending on the land for their living. A similar transaction was effected in respect of resumptions at Amberley, outside Ipswich, Queensland, for a site for an air force station. The majority of the occupants of that land were struggling farmers. It would have been most unfair in that case, as in the case mentioned by the honorable senator, had the Government simply taken that land at a peppercorn rental, and paid no regard whatever to the fact that, as it was driving the occupants off that land, it should allow something for goodwill. </para>

                        <para>The Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> referred to defence expenditure in relation to unemployment. I do not suggest that money expended on defence provides anything like the volume of employment that results from expenditure on developmental work. Honorable senators on this side have contended, however, that expenditure on defence increases employment to some degree, although it will not necessarily relieve unemployment to the same extent as would expenditure of the same amount on developmental works. I agree with honorable senators opposite that the cessation of certain developmental works for which we could not- continue to find money in view of our heavy defence commitments has hit employees in certain trades. I hope that the time will soon come when budgets will propose a much smaller proportion of expenditure on defence and a correspondingly increased allocation in respect of developmental works. No one would be more pleased than I if we could afford to reduce our present defence expenditure, and devote more money towards the development of Canberra, for example. </para>

                                <para>- No. The honorable senator is mistaken if he thinks that the Government intends to adopt the policy advocated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey,</inline> whose arguments <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> very effectively refuted. The Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator. Brown</inline> referred to oversea bondholders. It would appear that whenever honorable senators opposite are at a loss to find something to talk about they resort to criticism of overseas bondholders. The Leader of the Opposition told us how many millions of pounds were paid yearly as interest on borrowed money. He even carried his calculations so far as to show the expenditure each month and each week. Whose fault is it that we are paying interest on money which has been borrowed ? </para>

                                <para>- The holders of these bonds are not money-lending Shylocks. They lend their money at low rates of interest, and we were told earlier to-day that money lenders&#39;&#34; charges are far in excess of the rates on government bonds. The bonds represent the thrift and savings of ordinary people. Tens of thousands of people in this country, who have put aside a little out of their earnings in order to avoid the necessity for receiving a pension in. their old age, have invested their money in government bonds, partly because of the security they offer, and partly in order to obtain an assured income on which they may live. Exactly the same position exists in Great Britain, Although the loans which are floated from time to time may be underwritten by financial houses, they represent largely the savings of people in England with small incomes. Honorable senators opposite smile, but I know something of what I am talking about. On my visits to England I have had the opportunity to ascertain some of the facts. I have found that some of my own relatives have invested a few hundred pounds, as they were able to save the money, in Australian or Canadian bonds or inscribed stock. It is wrong to imagine that there is some sinister influence at work, merely because we are called upon to pay interest, on money that we have borrowed. </para>

                            aud other honorable senators from Tasmania, who, over a. number of years, have a fine record of accomplishment on behalf of the State that you represent. I remind the Senate of the success which attended the efforts of representatives of Tasmania to secure the connexion of that State with the mainland by telephone. The Lyons Government also removed the obnoxious provisions of the Navigation Act, which had operated so harshly against Tasmania. Moreover, this Parliament has made available to Tasmania considerable sums of money for road construction, and for a bounty on apples and pears, in addition to a financial grant to the State each year.

He will realize that the requirements of the Motherland must come first at a time like the present. 1 wish now to refer to what I thought was an unfair attack upon members on this side by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan,</inline> when he said that the Government had neglected all social legislation. I do not claim that the party to which I belong has been entirely responsible for all the social legislation that has been placed on the statute-book. On the contrary, I- give credit to honorable senators opposite who claim to have worked to improve the lot of the workers, but ask them, in turn, to give some credit to the Government and its supporters for the part that they have played in improving the social conditions of the people. I remind them that the original legislation, providing for the payment of invalid and old-age pensions was introduced by a government, whose political outlook generally was similar to that ot the present occupants of the treasury bench, and also that every increase of the pension was the result of action by a similar government. One of the finest pieces of legislation for the protection of workers is the Navigation Act, for which ;&#60; government similar to the present administration was responsible. Amendments of that act, to make it compulsory for vessels to carry wireless plant for the greater safety of men at sea, were introduced by the Lyons Government. Moreover, the Public Service Superannuation Act, which I think may fairly be described as one of the finest pieces of social legislation ever introduced into this Parliament, originated with the same party, which also established arbitration courts and appointed judges in order that the lot of the workers might be improved and harmony exist in industry. The party to which I belong has nothing to apologize for in relation to its social activities. Whilst we give credit to honorable senators opposite for what they have done in this connexion, I&#39; claim that our record in the amelioration of the social conditions of the people compares more than favorably with theirs. Instead of seeking every opportunity to criticize the Government, honorable senators opposite should try to find some good in us. I am always glad of the opportunity to relate what the Government has done to improve the social conditions of the people of Australia. We on this side are truly representative of all sections of the people, and while we occupy the treasury bench, it will be our desire always to assist in improving the lot, of those who need our help. &#91; conclude by expressing my appreciation of the free and full discussion that has taken place, and I hope that when we meet again toward? the end of the year, <inline font-style="italic">we</inline> shall do so under happier circumstances than now exist. In the meantime. 1 assure honorable senators on all sides that thu Government looks forward to receiving their help and support in the difficult times that are ahead. </para>

                            <para>. -  I take this opportunity to say a word or two in reply to some of the remarks that have been made by honorable senators on the other side of the chamber in relation&#39; to what happened last night to the Gold Tax Bill. I do not want any misapprehension, nor will I allow, without protest, any misrepresentation of that occurrence. I definitely announced in this chamber, without any reservation, that the Opposition would not oppose the bill. I announced also that, hs we did not approve the measure, we would criticize it. Therefore, Ministers knew that, so far as wo were concerned, there would be no opposition to the bill. But opposition came from Government supporters. It was -obvious that the Government was unable to secure unanimity among its supporters with regard to the measure. That being the position, we refused to pull the Government out of its difficulty. If Ministers cannot carry their own taxation measures without our help, they are asking too much when they expect us to come to their aid. </para>

                                <para>- I wish as briefly as possible to nail down the misrepresentation that obviously will be made concerning Labour&#39;s attitude to the bill. We are told that the Government needs money to carry on the war. We have never impeded the passage of a bill intended to finance the war, but we have at all times declared that that is the Government&#39;s responsibility. To nsk us to be ready to assist the Government with its tax bills when its own supporters are not prepared to support them i.s to expect too much of the Opposition. We know now what is going to be done. As an Opposition we have thrived on the misrepresentation of our opponents. We have reached where we are now because . we were lied about, slandered and misrepresented on every possible occasion during the last half century; therefore misrepresentation in respct of our attitude to the Gold Tax Bill will be no new experience. I refer to the matter now in order to make sure that the facts will be recorded so that, in the days to come, when statements are made, as they will be made for electioneering purposes, we shall have an accurate record of all that has happened, and of our attitude. </para>

                        <para>I wish also to say a few words about this morning&#39;s happenings in the Senate. We refused to give the Government power to suspend , the standing order which precludes the introduction of new business in the Senate after half-past ten o&#39;clock at night. I was busily engaged at the moment and had no opportunity to explain why we objected to the motion, so we merely called &#34;No &#34;. We took that stand because we know that a rush is being made to get into recess. We believe that the Government is determined to adjourn Parliament to-morrow and we want the world to know - the Australian world, at any rate - that Labour senators are here to do the job which the people expect us to do. We are prepared to sit next week, the week after that, and, indeed, right until Christmas, helping to pass legislation, and criticizing measures which we believe should be criticized. We are willing to stay here until the job is done. To suggest that we have done nothing but block the Government in the conduct of business is to suggest something that is not in accordance with the facts. The Senate is about to adjourn now, at 11.30, and the intention is that, we shall meet again to-morrow morning at 10 o&#39;clock. We are prepared to meet at 9 o&#39;clock, if necessary, and to sit until 11 o&#39;clock to-morrow night; or on Saturday. We know that to-morrow the Government will be forcing measures through this chamber, but if it is within our power to block them, we shall do so, because we do not believe in legislation by exhaustion, nor do we approve of passing legislation without proper scrutiny and criticism. Ministers now know what is ahead of them. </para>

                            <para>.- On the 6th September, on the motion for the adjournment of the Senate, I mentioned the victimization of Leslie O&#39;Neil, a Launceston employee of the Postmaster-General&#39;s Department. Last night I made a further inquiry, and to-day I received from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride,</inline> representing the Postmaster-General, a reply which I regard as unsatisfactory. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Neil,</inline> the postal official in question, some time ago made application for a certain amount of back pay; he received it, but because he had made the application, he was put off and refused further employment. The reply given to me last night was to the effect that the Postmaster-General had made some inquiries following the receipt of a letter from me, and he was unable to find any justification for the impression that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Neil</inline> bad been victimized by the department. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. O&#39;Neil</inline> is a. returned soldier. As 1 have already told the Senate, he was dismissed from his temporary employment whilst others, including non-returned soldiers, were kept on, and another man was engaged on the day . following O&#39;Neil&#39;s dismissal. I am prepared to make a statutory declaration that a man named Weldon saw O&#39;Neil in my presence and requested, a signed declaration to the effect that he was not concerned in O&#39;Neil&#39;s request for back pay. If Weldon had not secured that declaration, he would have been dismissed also. I am satisfied that the Postal Department has not made any effort to inquire into this complaint of victimization, and I appeal to the Minister representing the Postmaster-General to take steps to have the matter cleared up. </para>

                            <para>Referring to the public debt, the Treasurer said that the outstanding operation for the year was the  cash  and conversion loan in December. This loan, which included &#163;67,600,000 conversion and &#163;4,000,000 for defence, was floated at &#163;.3 17s. 6d. at par and constituted the biggest operation conducted by the loan Council on the Australian market since the NationalDebt Conversion of 1931. The holdings converted amounted to &#163;53,000,000, public cash subscriptions, including &#163;5,650,000 provided by the Commonwealth Bank, amounted to &#163;16,000,000 and&#163;2,600,000 was provided from the Sinking Fund. </para>

                        <para class="block">That statement is entirely wrong and misleading. I have on other occasions proved that in connexion with the recent loan of &#163;4,800,000, &#163;3,750,000 was bank-created credit. How could there be a cash conversion loan of &#163;53,000,000 when there is only &#163;57,000,000 worth of cash in Australia? The statement is entirely misleading and I do not think that it should be allowed to pass unchallenged. It should be expunged from the budget papers. </para>
