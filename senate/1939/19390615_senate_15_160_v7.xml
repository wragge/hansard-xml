                <para class="block">This bill has been introduced because it would be quite impossible for the scheme of national health and pensions insurance to commence on the date fixed, by procla mation, namely, the 4th September next. It is generally understood that delays were occasioned by events over which the previous Government had no control, and by differences of opinion the effects of which have already been sufficiently discussed. It had been intended to introduce during the present sittings amending legislation to deal particularly with extensions of medical benefits to the dependants of insured persons. That matter, and questions of insurance for persons not covered by the present act, were postponed last year with the intention that they should be dealt with before the act came into operation. Obviously, the proper course to pursue at this stage is to rescind the proclamations which, if no action were taken, would bring the act into full operation in September. The rescission of the proclamations will leave the acts as passed on the statute-book and will give the Government an opportunity to review the whole position afresh. In view of the Government&#39;s intention to proceed with national insurance as soon as may be possible, the bill does not propose the annulment of the proclamations of those parts of the act which deal with administration and. are now in force. </para>
                <para>The principal provision in the bill - namely clause 4 - may be very shortly explained. It consists of three subclauses. The first annuls the proclamationswhich were to have come into force in September. The parts of the act which are excluded from this annulment are Parts T. and II., which provide for administration, Division 3 of Part VII., which provides for the establishment and administration of approved societies, and section 192 which provides the power to make regulations; that power may be necessary in connexion with administration. Sub-clause 2 annuls the proclamations for the Contributions Acts. Subclause 3 is formal and merely declares that the power to proclaim the commencement of the remaining provisions of the acts is retained. This power is not to be exercised, however, unless a resolution approving the exercise of it has been passed by both Houses of Parliament. </para>
                <para>Later in the year it will be necessary to submit proposals for the appropriation of funds in connexion with administration. In the meantime I can assure honorable senators that the work of both the commission and the approved societies has been reduced to a minimum. </para>
                <para>The Government greatly regrets any disturbance to individuals and to societies by reason of the suspension of the act, and it is anxious that all interests shall receive equitable treatment. The bill itself is merely a machinery measure, but it is one that is absolutely essential in the existing circumstances of national insurance. I ask honorable senators to support the bill. </para>

                        <para>.- Whilst it would be very difficult to throw any new light on this bill, I consider that it is necessary for me at least to state my opposition to this measure. That opposition is based on many reasons. When we see the revolt against the proposals that is occurring outside the chamber we realize their unpopularity. The trade union movement has gone to . the full -limit in its efforts to prevent the bill from becoming law, and the upper classes also are afraid as to the effect of the wealth census. I recently had conversations with some rich persons, and they expressed their fears to me. So we see that the proposed legislation is causing a great deal of hostility and annoyance, and the opposition of members of this party is justified in view of the feelings of all sections of the community. I could allay any suspicions in the minds of the wealthy classes as to anything that might happen to them in consequence of the operations of the bill. My attitude - has been strengthened by two speeches delivered on this subject by. the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> in the House of Representatives. On the first occasion he gave excellent reasons for not accepting the amendment of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nairn,</inline> favouring a wealth census. He said that the adoption of that proposal would have the effect of frightening away capital, but he was not very solicitous about the trade union movement&#39;s fear that industrial conscription would be eventually introduced as a result of the enactment of this measure. He was concerned about those apprehensions of the conscription of wealth, but not about those fearing the conscription of Australia&#39;s manhood. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Nairn</inline> moved his amendment the Government realized that it would be carried, and so the Ministry agreed to it. Then <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Street</inline> advanced just as good reasons for the amendment as he had previously advanced against it. The Government&#39;s altered &#34; view was dictated by political expediency, but I believe that it has no intention to implement that portion of the bill. The introduction of this measure demonstrates once again that the Government is interested only in maintaining its hold on the Treasury for a few more months. After the new Governor-General and the Duchess of Kent have been received in the Commonwealth, Ministers will not be so eager to retain office and they will be prepared to gamble their political future on the hustings. The Government wishes the Governor-General to. meet the right people. No doubt it will be very nice to be introduced to the royal couple, but it will not mean a knighthood for me, as it may do for members of the Government. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The Leader of the Government interjected that he was opposed to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> reading his speech, and threatened to apply the &#34; gag &#34;. I object to that attitude. During my membership of this chamber I have not heard a ministerial speech that was not read. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> made an inquiry as to whether the Ministers purchased their speeches at so much each. It is a compliment to the public servants that the Ministers read their speeches word for word as they are prepared for them. It seems to me that many of the secretaries of the departments should be in  the chamber themselves doing the job instead of through the Ministers. It is extraordinary that such a threat should have been made by the Leader of the Senate who has read every speech that he has delivered in this chamber since he became a Minister. </para>
                    <para>I shall deal with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein&#39;s</inline> wonderful address. Many uncomplimentary remarks have been made concerning this uh amber, but speeches of the type delivered by the honorable senator lower the tone of the Senate. He referred in contemptible terms to the &#34; hangers on &#34; nt the Trades Hall and described union officials as parasites. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> wisely took him to task and reproved him.  I hope that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein&#39;s</inline> future conduct will be on a higher plane.  I do not know why he has such antipathy to trade union officials. I recall his interjection&#39; when he rather sneering&#93; y proposed that a trade union official might be on the Advisory Committee on Industrial Organization. Actually such an appointment would have been very wise. It seems to be regarded as a crime for the Opposition to be associated with the trade union movement, but when the Government seeks men for one of its proposed panels it selects some connected with the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. That is good politics. This country owes a debt to the trade union movement, but when that movement is mentioned <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> regards such a reference as a tragedy. The fourth man selected for the Advisory Committee on Industrial Organization by the Government is <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Kneeshaw,</inline> the United Australia party nominee for the Legislative Council in New South Wales, who is interested in cement. He will be very active when the authorities are building underground shelters and other structures requiring cement. The Minister for Defence has hart more experience than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> and he appreciates the assistance given to him by trade union officials. Already the Metal Trade Unions have pointed out to the Minister for Defence that much of the iron fittings now being imported for use at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard could be manufactured in Australia. I am sure that, unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> who says that no good can come from suggestions made by the Opposition or its friends, the Minister for Defence appreciates that advice. </para>

                            <para>- That also may be said of the friends of honorable senators opposite. During the course of this debate much comment has been made regarding the methods adopted by the Fisher Government in the early days of the world war to render more effective Australia&#39;s participation in the war. Unlike some other honorable senators in this chamber, I have no personal recollection of what happened in those days, but I know from my reading of the political history of this country that the Fisher Government had to withstand the abuse levelled at it by the then Opposition for everything it did. It will be remembered that when the Fisher Government first established the Australian navy its opponents were so ill-informed as to say that the vessels of the &#34;river&#34; class would never dare to go outside the harbours. Actually the vessels of the Australian navy were able to render valuable service in keeping open the trade routes of this country. Every legislative enactment of a Labour &#39; government has&#39; been subjected to hostile criticism by its opponents, but when the opportunity is again presented to Labour to take the helm of State it will carry out its programme, regardless of the criticism of its opponents. We have only to look at the barren legislative record of anti-Labour governments to see how utterly they have failed to face up to the task they were called upon to perform. We have but to remember the failure of this Government and its immediate predecessors to implement the national insurance scheme. Only last night a proposal to set up a committee to investigate that subject was defeated in the House of Representatives by 43 votes to 19. The only social legislation on the statute-book of the Commonwealth has been placed there by a Labour government or at the instigation of a Labour opposition. Only by the utilization of Labour&#39;s legislation is the anti-Labour government in New South Wales able to remain in  office. Honorable senators opposite have asked why we do not trust the Government. They ask: &#34;What is behind this opposition to the taking of a national register? Surely Labour senators do not really believe that there are any undesirable features in this bill. We are men of honour and we shall not be parties to any underhand tactics &#34;. Unfortunately, we have had too much experience of antiLabour governments in the past to trust the Government now in office. We know that the policy of anti-Labour governments has not changed throughout the years. During the troublesome days of the war the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> made the definite promise that there would be no conscription in  Australia </para>

                            <para>- We know that he received &#163;25,000; we do not know what else he got. Our principal objection to this bill is that it has been introduced for the purpose of compulsion. During the last few months I have met quite a number of men and women, not Jews, but people as Aryan by birth as . Hitler himself, who have left the middle European countries to establish new homes for themselves in this country. Many of them left their home-lands because they rebelled against the restrictions imposed upon them by the totalitarian states. I made a persona&#93; friend of a young man who left Germany, merely because he was not able -to turn one way or the other without first advising the local leader of the Storm Troops. He even found it difficult to leave one job for another without first giving reasons why he should do so. These people came to Australia believing that they would be able to live in peace under a democratic system of government. Little did they know that shortly after their arrival in this country a so-called democratic Government would bring down a measure such as this, the purpose of which is to achieve the very undesirable objectives against which they had rebelled in their home-lands. Every Australian is willing and anxious to fight for the preservation of his democratic rights. That is why there is so much opposition to the bill now before us. </para>

                            <para>- This measure of compulsion is repugnant to the ideals of a democratic people. Surely the Government appreciates the splendid manner in which the people responded to the voluntary appeal during the war. Why can they not be trusted to do so again should the need arise? The Government should recast its policy in connexion with this matter- </para>

                            <para>- There is also the compulsion imposed upon honorable senators opposite to obey the dictates of influential concerns such as the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited. When it is considered how  splendidly the nation responded to a voluntary appeal during the Great. &#34;War, how can it be claimed that this bill is necessary? Apparently it is not so much a&#39; matter of putting round pegs into square holes as having no holes in which to put any pegs. What does the Government propose to do for the unemployed of this country? The Deputy Leader of the Opposition has pointed out that no less than 34,000 men are on the employment register of the munitions factories in Victoria alone. That register contains a complete record of a large number of the unemployed in Melbourne. </para>

                            <para>- The introduction of this bill is only part and parcel of the policy of the Government to instil in the minds of the people a fear of possible aggression. The international situation to-day is such as to leave no room for this fear. Great Britain and Germany are trading freely with each other; this Government is purchasing from Germany machinery for the manufacture of motor cars; Great Britain is buying marine motors from Italy for torpedo chasers;&#39; and France and Great Britain are buying war planes from the United States of America. Does this indicate that there is international tension? All countries are anxious to maintain friendly relations. We are frequently told that it is Germany that threatens us. Germany is certainly not buying Australian wool . and wheat, but . we are buying German machinery. Is it likely that machinery would be sold  to Australia for the manufacture of war material which might be used against German soldiers? As the result of the &#34; jitters &#34; of the Government the people of this country are driven half crazy with fear that the next day may bring war upon them. I oppose the policy of creating war hysteria with all the vigour I possess. I do not say that I approve of the proposal by the trade union movement that the questionnaire included in this bill should be burned. As a responsible member of this branch of the legislature I believe in democratic govern ment, and so long as the present Government remains in office&#39; I shall advise the people to obey any laws which it is instrumental in placing upon the statute-book. Nevertheless, I shall use every means in my power to prevent the bill now before the Senate from becoming law. Although I am not in favour of the drastic measures advocated by the trade union movement, I can appreciate the view of the workers in regard to this measure. They are entitled to their beliefs just as I am entitled to mine. I urge upon the Government, however, the desirability of reviewing this legislation in the light of the manifest disapproval of it -voiced by. the people. I do not believe that such concerted opposition has been directed towards any other measure brought before this Parliament for many years. </para>

                            <para>- I know nothing of the meeting in Sydney, but we have been informed that 3,000 unionists attended a meeting at the State Theatre in : Melbourne last Sunday and registered their whole-hearted protest against this bill. But that is not all. The leaders of the trade union movement have declared that they are prepared to support this protest and take the consequences of their action. Therefore, we may be quite sure, that, in their view this legislation will . hit them where it hurts them most - the effectiveness of their organizations. They are determined that if the active objection to this compulsory national register leads to the imprisonment of members of their industrial unions they will endeavour to get all organizations wholeheartedly behind a movement having for its purpose the  tying up of industry until the men are released. </para>

                    <para>We have many forms of compulsion in our democratic system of government. There is, for instance, to mention a few only, compulsory registration of motor cars, of clogs, and other animals, and compulsory registration of births, deaths and marriages. This being so, what possible objection can be raised to this bill which provides for the compulsory registration of certain information necessary to complete a survey of the nation&#39;s resources for defence purposes? In 1915 a Labour government introduced a measure providing for a compulsory and complete census. Honorable senators may say that the Labour party of 1915 was different in its outlook from the Labour party of to-day. In that I should be inclined to agree with them, and I add that the people of Australia in those days were prepared to trust the Labour party because it was determined to defend Australia from external aggression. The Labour party of to-day, apparently, is not prepared to do this. It opposes every measure necessary for the adequate defence of this country. It criticized severely the Government&#39;s defence  expenditure. It opposed the hill introduced last week for the purpose of ensuring the efficient manufacture of munitions and supplies, and for the limiting and control of profits in respect of Government contracts for defence. Now it opposes this bill, which is a preparatory and simple measure designed to obtain necessary statistical information so that, if war unfortunately does come to Australia, the Government will be able to determine what classes of persons should not be engaged in the active service of war because they could be more usefully employed on essential home services. </para>
                    <para>In order to defend Australia, we must have efficient organization, so that each person will play his part in his allotted avocation. The basis of unionism is compulsory sacrifice by the individual for the common good ; similarly the basis of Commonwealth defence is some sacrifice by individual citizens for the security of all the people. </para>
                    <para>The proper preparation for defence of the country must be preceded by a plan for the collection of essential information so that when the time comes, every man may be given duties to perform for which he is best fitted. It would he useless to require an expert&#39; technician, for instance, to undertake the duties of a cook, or to expect a cook to carry out efficiently duties ordinarily discharged by an expert technician. Every individual of the community is qualified to discharge some duty, and under a properly organized system he will be able to play an importantpart in defence. It has been suggested or inferred by honorable senators opposite, quite unfairly in my opinion, that the bill will give the Government power to conscript the man-power of the Commonwealth. There is not one word in it which suggests that the Government shall have power to do other than collect information. </para>

Obviously in a formal matter of that kind, it is necessary to say that the averment shall be prima facie proof.

                            <para>- By getting into the witness-box and saying so. As the honorable senator is so suspicious, I suggest that if he were called upon to furnish a return under this bill, he should take a half a dozen of his colleagues with him in order to prove that he had posted a return and had complied with the law. But in a simple matter such as this, a declaration by any person of repute - and I would regard the Leader of the Opposition as such - that he had posted the return, would be the complete discharge by him of the onus of proof under clause 25. </para>

                            <para>- On the contrary, it will provide very much less work for lawyers than if the onus of proof were on the prosecution. The hill will place no obligation on the individual citizen other than to furnish a return which is not very different in form from other returns that are required under various acts of Parliament. It is necessary for the Government not only to obtain a survey of the man-power, wealth and resources of Australia, but also to see that every body, is trained to defend the people and the property in the country. I have stated from almost every public platform in my own State that I believe in &#39;both compulsory education and compulsory military training, and that I regard the latter as essential for the adequate defence of Australia. I hope that the Government will eventually adopt the policy of compulsory training. When that is done, every honorable senator will have&#39; ample opportunity to express his views regarding it; but, whether that action be taken or not, it is essentia&#93; that Australia should .be in possession of the information indicated by the bill, so thats in a national emergency, each man may be allocated to his proper sphere- of activity for the adequate defence .of the -country.- </para>

                        <para>. -  The Government has no mandate from the people for the introduction of this bill, and I intend to vote against the measure. When the Cabinet met in Hobart some time ago, the Government decided to establish a national register foi&#34; the purpose of ascertaining -the industrial resources of the nation. When a previous national emergency arose, no need was apparent for an industrial register. Every man who then volunteered to defend his country had to give his name, address, age and occupation, and practically all the other information proposed to be obtained under this bill. Therefore, I see no necessity for the measure. The only new feature is that the bill is made applicable to youths between the ages of 18. years and 21 years who will be compelled amongst other things to notify the department of changes of address. It has been said that this measure is complementary to the Supply and Development Bill, which was &#34; gagged &#34; through this chamber. The effect on the Opposition of the application of the &#34; gag &#34; might well be described as similar to that of a kick from a dying mule received by an intelligent person. I doubt whether by the application of the &#34; gag &#34; the Government secured the passage of the bill any sooner than it otherwise would have done. </para>

It says that this measure is necessary to ensure that, in a time of national peril, it will be able to call on the men of Australia to play their part. We are told that the bill would be the means of preventing those desirous of serving their country from taking an active part in military operations when they might be able to render more useful service at home. That would mean that they would be given sheltered positions similar to that filled by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> in the &#39;last war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> remarked that it would be undesirable to. employ a highly-skilled technician as a cook, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> was greatly concerned yesterday that an engineer might be called upon - to peel  potatoes. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> point out, however, that, during the last war, when men and women enlisted voluntarily, they were drafted to the sections to which they wished to go, and in which they were best fitted for service. </para>

                            <para>- The Government had the necessary power, but did not exercise it. The Minister&#39;s remark is a reflection upon the administration of the Defence Department. Under the conditions obtaining at that time, there would have been no danger of <inline font-weight="bold">.Senator Wilson</inline> being asked to peel potatoes. He might have been detailed as an officer&#39;s orderly. </para>

                    <para>The Government has declared that the object of the bill is to have the qualifications of people tabulated, but I do not believe that- it is sincere in that statement. I fear that there is an undisclosed motive behind the bill. If that were not the fear of the people, we should not have mass protest meetings at large &#39;centres, attended by thousands of people. There must be some reason for the mistrust of the Government in regard to the bill, and proof of lack of confidence is furnished by the. results of the by-elections in Wakefield, Griffith and Wilmot. The reason given by the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons)</inline> for a. national register was that it would enable a survey to be made of the supply of various classes of skilled persons to meet the demands of the navy, army and air force, government munitions factories, annexes to private factories, essential industries and other industries. I can place no interpretation on that statement other than that a survey is proposed of the supply of the various classes of skilled labour. Surely the fact that many thousands of people are offering in Victoria for employment in munitions factories shows that there should be no difficulty in drafting men into their proper avenues of employment. In New South Wales, also, many thousands of men are applying for similar work. The ministerial statement suggested the necessity for an individual record of the skilled persons in the schedule of reserve occupations, so as to ensure that the requirements of the army, navy and air force would be provided for by the allotment of persons to technical units. Applicants are .always available for these positions, particularly in the navy and air force, and the Government has a surplus of applicants for employment in the various industrial activities associated with defence. Those applications should be easily classified. The bil&#93; requires all male persons between the ages of IS and 21 years to notify any change of address. It is interesting to note that at last the Government intends to take some notice of the lost legion - the unemployed youths of Australia - but it is significant that no consideration was given to them until there arose the possibility of their being required  to defend the interests of the capitalists. It cannot be said that this clause is designed to ascertain the number of skilled technicians between the ages of 18 and 21 years, for, unfortunately, as the result of the depression, thousands of youths who are now between those ages have never had an opportunity to learn a trade. Even if they obtain jobs, they are sacked when they become 21 years of age, and younger lads take their places. In New South Wales thousands of young men are walking the streets and roads seeking employment. From time to time numbers of them are carted to country centres to work two weeks in eight for the princely sum of less than &#163;9. They are set to work on the roads, under conditions not unlike the- treatment of convicts in the early days of Australian settlement. Men stand over them and hardly allow them to straighten their backs. At the conclusion of a fortnight of such treatment they go back to the cities, where they remain in idleness for another six weeks. Out. of the miserable pittance that they receive, they are expected to maintain themselves, and, in some instances, assist in keeping a home together. These conditions prevail to-day in New South Wales and elsewhere, in Australia. Why is it that special provisions, which do not apply to other males, are to apply to these youths ? </para>

                    <para>A noticeable feature of the colossal expenditure on defence is the intention of the Government to build annexes on property owned by its wealthy friends, and to install machinery in such buildings.  <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan cited figures in order to show that the sacrifices made during the Great War were not one-sided. He referred to the money raised for war loans, but he conveniently forgot to tell  us that those loans were free of income tax and that the money invested in them was, in many cases, the yield of profiteering during the war period.

To-day the people of Australia are paying, and they will continue to pay, interest on loans which were subscribed largely by profiteers at a time when other men were dying on the battlefields of Flanders and elsewhere. </para>

                            <para>- During the last seven years, this Government has made many promises and given many assurances to the people, but they have not been kept. That is why we fear that there is an undisclosed motive behind the introduction of this bill. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> told us that he did not favour compulsion, and after describing us as good fellows, suggested that we were being pushed from behind. I rather think that he is being pushed from behind to support this measure, particularly in view of his disbelief in compulsion, and possibly he may yet support us. The greatest and most convincing argument that can be advanced against proposals involving compulsion is the result of the voluntary enlistment campaign. A Minister who delights to parade under the sobriquet of &#34;The Little Digger &#34; led the campaign and the response was wonderful. The number of volunteers was greater than the most sanguine member of the Government anticipated, and the campaign was an unqualified success. When it was completed, &#34; The Little Digger &#34; began to advise the Defence Department how it should dress the soldiers. He proposed a brighter uniform such as would be popular at Pott&#39;s Point, Sydney, or Toorak, Melbourne. He hinted that the men should wear elastic-side boots and have zip-fasteners in their puttees. What has followed that successful enlistment campaign? No assistance has been given to the men of various ages who volunteered in many centres, particularly in New South Wales. They have not been supplied, with any equipment; they have no rifles, and nothing is being done to  encourage them in their efforts to be of service to the nation. That condition of affairs was admitted in the House of Representatives by the Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> in answer to a question by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin).</inline></para>

I remind the honorable senator that the leaders of industrial organizations are elected to their positions by the members of unions, and that, therefore, his disparaging remarks were applicable, to all the members of the trade unions, It ill becomes any person occupying such an honorable position as that of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> to abuse his privileges by making unwarranted and disparaging remarks of this kind.

                            <para>- In Labour&#39;s bluebook we find that the first Commonwealth Old-age Pension Act was introduced in 1908. . Although Labour was not in power at the time, being only a small party, it held the balance of power between the two other parties. Having such power it forced the Deakin Government to make provision for old-age pensions, agreeing, if it did so, to allow the government to remain in office. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy,</inline> a tory from Tasmania, speaking&#34; in the Senate at that time, left no doubt as to who was actually responsible for bringing into existence the first pensions legislation. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mulcahy</inline> is reported in - the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Debates</inline> on the 3rd June, 1908, as having said - </para>

                    <para class="block">That the people have lost confidence in the Government is shown by recent by-elections for the House of Representatives, and by the failure of the last two  internal loans floated by the Government. It will be seen that the Government has forfeited the confidence, not only of the workers but also, of those persons upon whom it has always relied for support in the past, the moneybags who supply the sinews of war. The recent loan floated in London for defence purposes was also a flop, and a large proportion of it was left with the underwriters. The Government&#39;s appeal to the so-called patriots who, to-day, are still collecting interest on the investment of their ill-gotten gains during the war, fell on deaf ears. </para>

                    <para> I am not responsible for what may be done by people outside this Parliament with the questionnaire. It has been stated that processions will be held and that bonfires will be made of the question papers. One of the questions proposed to be submitted to the people seeks information as to whether the person questioned is blind, deaf, dumb, crippled or otherwise maimed. May I respectfully suggest that a further question should have . been included to ascertain how many of the people between the ages of 18 and 65 years are suffering from malnutrition, chiefly as the result of the mismanagement of the Government now occupying the treasury bench. Another question seeks to ascertain the number of unemployed, including sustenance and relief workers. The information collated as the result of the replies furnished to that question will be very valuable and should be made known in this Senate. No exact information on that subject is at present available. </para>

                            <para>- Surely the honorable senator does not contend that it is the fault of the Labour movement that so many unemployed are not registered members of unions. Even if the prosperity which it is suggested abounds in Australia, to-day, really existed, it would not be possible to arrive at an accurate calculation of the number of unemployed from the returns furnished by the trade unions, because all persons in employ-, ment are not members of unions. I com mend to honorable senators generally the arguments which I have advanced against this bill. I trust that the bill will be rejected, but in any case I promise honorable senators opposite a not very happy-time when it reaches the committee stage. </para>

                        <para>.- I do not think that it is necessary to reply to very many of the statements that were made by honorable senators opposite in this debate, because they obviously have been based not on provisions contained in the bill, but on something which they read into it. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> for instance, said, &#34; We do not view the bill as it exists&#34;. </para>

                            <para>- That is precisely what the honorable gentleman did say. He and his colleagues read into the measure something that is not there, and their attitude generally indicates that they regard this bill and the one which preceded it, with suspicion. They suggest by their arguments that their opposition to this proposal was conceived in- doubt and reared in suspicion. They affect to fear its effects, and generally they appear to be suffering from a nightmare due to unjustified fears. </para>

                            <para>- I should be very much surprised if the few words which I have to say from time to time in this chamber create any mistrust in the minds of honorable senators opposite. They all have spoken of the measure of compulsion in respect of certain things to be done under the bill. One would think that hitherto the people of Australia had never been compulsorily required to do anything. Our friends opposite conveniently forget entirely that the Commonwealth Government has been compelled, to take this action owing to the disturbed condition of international affairs, a matter over which we have no control whatever. World unrest compels the Government to put its house in order without delay. Labour senators declare a belief in adequate defence measures; yet for some undiscovered reason, they are bitterly opposed to these proposals. Do they say that these measures are not adequate? Or do they believe that the measures are more than adequate? </para>

                            <para>- I do not think that the result can he interpreted in that way. It may be regarded as proof that the unlimited profits which manufacturers are supposed to be making out of the people of Australia do not exist. That is more likely the reason for the partial failure of recent Commonwealth loans. The under subscription of the London issue cannot possibly be attributed to any fear by the people of Great Britain about the stability of the Commonwealth It may be due to the fact that London investors are fully occupied with British loans. Why are honorable senators opposite always so pleased whenever anything goes wrong with Australian financial matters? </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite to-day complained that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> last evening cast some reflections upon the secretaries or officials of various trade union organizations who have been active in opposition to this measure. Whatever feeling I may have about that matter, I should say that resentment against <inline font-weight="bold">&#39;Senator Dein</inline> does -not come well from honorable gentlemen who, throughout this debate, have repeatedly impugned the sincerity of the Government and have spoken with the greatest freedom about bloodthirsty racketeering manufacturers. They have also referred in the most disparaging terms to the gentlemen of high repute and wide experience who have been appointed to the Advisory Committee on Industrial Organization. These gentlemen have patriotically undertaken without remuneration to advise the Government on the industrial side of its defence measures. To me it is extraordinary that  they should be held up to scorn and branded almost as traitors. </para>

                            <para>- I should say at least ten out of the sixteen Labour senators in this chamber referred to the personnel of the proposed Advisory Committee on Industrial Organization in most opprobrious terms. Yet, when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> said something about the activities of executive officers of trade union organizations - probably I would not have said what the honorable gentleman did - there was a howl of indignation from honorable senators &#39;opposite, and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> was assailed as a man without decent human feelings. I take the view that what is medicine for one side is medicine for the other. If our friends opposite show reasonable appreciation of men who from a sense of patriotism and public duty offer their service gratuitously to the Government in a national crisis, we shall be content and, for my part, I shall give honorable senators opposite and the members of industrial organizations all credit for sincerity of purpose. </para>

His  speech appeared to be a condensation of all the soapbox orations that the honorable gentleman has delivered during the 50 years of his political career. I have no doubt that he even convinced himself that what he was saying was the last word in political wisdom, for I cannot imagine the honorable gentleman continuing for so long had he not been convinced of his own infallibility. </para>

As I have said, it has been forced on the Commonwealth Government by political developments in other parts of the world. We must put our own house in order and be in a position to defend our people. The fear and suspicion that exist about the bill and the objections taken to the compilation of a national register which would enable the classification of the people, are beyond my comprehension, had not <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> supplied the reason. He said, &#34; We do not look at this bill as it exists &#34;. </para>

I commend the Government for having introduced this bill. If the Opposition advises its adherents to refuse to supply the desired information, the people will know which section thinks that Australia is worth defending. The Government is perfectly justified in providing for &#39; compulsory registration, so that every body in the community shall do his duty. If the bill does no good, it cannot do any harm, and it will be an earnest to nations overseas which may be looked upon as our potential enemies. </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator desires to place me in an awkward position, but I am not likely to be attracted by a bait such as that offered by him. He desires to make political capital out of this debate by inviting me to make a dangerous statement that might create ill-feeling between Australia and some other nations. This is not the first time such a question has been asked. It is not only a cowardly question, but also one that is not in the best interests of Australia. I hope that such a question will not be submitted again. I believe that this legislation is on right lines, and that the suspicions of members of the Opposition are groundless. Whichever political party is in power, it is in office by the will of the majority of the people, and the laws of the land must be obeyed. </para>

                        (South Australia) | 3.4 J . - I have listened with attention to all of the arguments for and against the measure, and the only conclusion that I can reach is that the bill deserves support. The chief objection offered to it is that there is an undisclosed motive &#39;for it. In that regard, however, my conscience is quite clear, and I accept the bill as it stands. If the Labour party were in power to-day, I have no doubt that it would be compelled, by force of circumstances, to do exactly as the present Government proposes to do under this bill. I. base that statement on the following remarks said to have been made by the Leader of the Opposition

The Labour party believes in organization, not disorganization. It would be fatal to have all the best men called up for active service, leaving industry at a standstill. There should be an allotment of man-power and woman-power between services and industry. </para>

The words I used were - 1 assure the Minister that I am saying seriously that we have to-day industrial conscription. I challenge the honorable gentleman to dispute that. Thousands of young men and young women in this country are denied the right to earn a decent livelihood and access to many of the things to which they are entitled. They are industrial conscripts. They have either to submit to that form of conscription, or be treated as the law prescribes they shall be treated.

I express my personal thanks to honorable senators for the consideration they have shown for me in the handling of this measure, which I was called upon to undertake at short notice. I now have half an hour in which to reply to fourteen hours&#39; debate, and, if there are any shortcomings on my part, I hope that similar consideration to that which I have already received will be extended to me. It is said that truth is to be found at the bottom of a well. In this debate the suggestion has been made that truth is masquerading in the form of noise and verbosity, and in that regard let me present to honorable senators an allegory. During mobile warfare, when there is perhaps a temporary halt in operations, certain tactical points are seized, and at each of these is established what is called a strong point. This is an earthwork garrisoned by ten, twenty or even more men. The position of the earthwork is observed by the enemy, and an attempt is made to get possession of it, or, at any rate, to destroy the troops in occupation of it. A bombardment is concentrated on the point, with the result that there is much noise, much mud is flung about, and an unpleasant odour arises. I suggest to the Senate that the Government is the garrison, that the hill is the strong point, and that the Government is still in possession of it. </para>

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane,</inline>
                        who led the debate on behalf of the Opposition, said that the&#39; Government had no man-date to proceed with this measure, or to submit a proposal of this kind ; but I contend that every government elected by the people has a mandate, not only to provide for the welfare of the inhabitants, but also to take effective measures for the defence of our long coastline. In view of our small population and remote geographical position, it is essential, therefore, that the resources of the nation should be completely organized. I remind honorable senators of the sound dictum of
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline>
                        in, I think, his first speech in this chamber in regard to defence, that Australia must be prepared for any emergency. In placing this bill before the Senate I assure honorable senators -and the public that there is no underlying or overt purpose to impose conscription for either the armed forces or industrial operations. I cannot help thinking that the word &#34; conscription &#34; in its sinister meaning has been purposely introduced into the debate for purely political reasons, in order to create that hysteria which the Opposition so rightly deprecates. There is no legislative power to conscript for overseas service, nor is there any relation between the bill and any system of military training. The last census did not provide all of the information now asked for, and for that reason the bill provides for a record of the qualifications of the man-power of the Commonwealth. The object of the national &#39;register is to en- sure that men whose occupations show that they may be required for industries and occupations on the reserve list, shall be reserved for national requirements.
                    </para>
                    <para>Regarding the element of compulsion, I remind the Senate that Part IV. of the Defence Act makes service for home defence compulsory. That has been the law for 36 years. As several honorable senators have pointed out, the element of compulsion exists also in relation to electoral enrolment and voting, taxation, hours of labour, holidays, payment of wages, payment of bills, public health, licences, census, and the closing hours of hotels. The Opposition believes in compulsory unionism, and in Western Australia no man can get work on a government, undertaking unless he is a unionist. In this bill there is nothing to take away the rights of the workers; the rights that they already enjoy are fully conserved. </para>
                    <para>In regard to Labour generally, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> said that when the Labour army marches, it marches as one body. He did not tell us that there are several Labour armies with no common leader. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin,</inline> who for the time being is recognized as the leader of the political Labour movement, made a declaration on defence; but the very first point that he made has since been repudiated by his party. As to that gentleman&#39;s views regarding the purposes which this bill seeks to achieve, I suggest that he be judged by his peers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dwyer-Gray,</inline> who is now the Premier of Tasmania, according to the <inline font-style="italic">Burnie Advocate</inline> of the 9th June, stated recently - </para>

I find that reflected in this Senate; men have the courage to stand in their places and give  expression to their honest opinions. I mixed with over 300,000 picked Australians abroad, and I found them consorting with one another without any reference to politics, or sectarian issues, and without regard to the fact that some were wealthy and others poor. All were Australians, engaged in achieving a common objective, and they behaved decently to one another. In that community of 300,000 men, there was less crime than in any other community of the same size. </para>

                    <para>I desire now to make some general observations regarding what the bill contains or seeks to achieve. The bill has been subjected to a great amount of review and criticism. Its very character invites that. Should it ever- function at the full - we hope it will not - its effects must be marked throughout the manufacturing and industrial interests of Australia. In itself this is one of the major legislative projects necessary to bring the means and machinery for the successful defence of the Commonwealth into more or less perfect alignment. In other words, the more complete our organization the less the risk of war, or, if that tragedy should overtake the people, the better the chance of a successful outcome. More would be involved in a war than a mere question of the utilization of human life. There will of necessity be included human energy and industry, the products and manufactures of the country, and all its financial resources. I emphasize that point. The bill is a corollary to the policy proclaimed and entered upon by the Lyons Government, and that policy has been extended and broadened by the present administration. </para>

                            <para>- Yes ;I used that word purposely. I may add that, whether or not honorable senators opposite know it, the action now proposed through the instrumentality of the bill would be the inevitable outcome of a policy, hints of which have from time to time been dropped by them; indeed, no scheme of defence could possibly be adequate without it. This is an emergency measure, the outcome of a critical period in our history. We devoutly hope that that critical period will pass, and that the operations of the measure will in time be shortened. &#39; My hope is tha t the Australian Labour party will support the legislation in the interests of the nation. I have personal friends among the members of the Opposition. On previous occasions I have voiced my respect for the ideals and legitimate aspirations of the Labour party. That respect is based on a record of worthy achievement. The party of the past justly earned Australia&#39;s gratitude. In the prewar days it had broad comprehensive views on the defence problem. It gave us the Royal Australian Navy, which in 1914 effectively shielded these shores from bombardment and kept open our trade routes. If the navy had not been in existence the eastern shores of the Commonwealth would have been bombarded and the trade routes would have been&#39; closed. The Labour party imposed upon the people the obligation that every suitable person should submit to training under arms for the protection of his  home-land, and that burden has been willingly borne. For a time during the Great War the Labour Government maintained abroad with commendable efficiency that magnificent army, the Australian Imperial Force. If we compare the party&#39;s national ideals, it stood then where, if the press correctly informs us, the British Labour party stands to-day. But what do we find in relation to those who are at present sheltering under the banner of the Australian Labour party? I maintain that for years they have placed themselves in the wrong with the people, because they have refused to explain frankly the details involved in that nebulous slogan, &#34; the adequate defence of Australia&#34;. During the debate we have heard many comments on that subject. In effect, if there be a policy at all it has chameleon-like qualities. This time last year it had an isolationist aspect, but that has been altered. In October the Leader of the Labour party in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> announced changes, the first item of which- a survey of man-power - is being opposed by his followers here. In May the Labour Conference gave matters of policy further consideration, and arrived at conclusions which, inter alia, provide for the admission of the Empire into a kind of partnership in defence measures. That fact should be compared with the party&#39;s previous attitude, which I say bore an isolationist aspect. The party is on the way back to sensibleness. The present parliamentary Labour party has failed to take an active part in the move to better our defence system, it has hindered legislation intended to effect such improvements, and, in spite of its professed belief in democratic government, it has failed to repudiate threats from the ranks of its followers to sabotage what will eventually be the law of the land. By these acts of commission and omission, the party&#39;s members have completely negatived the high traditions left by their forebears. If the party desires again to occupy in the public life of Australia the position that it should, it must first set itself right with the people upon the great issues which are before the nation at the present time. During this debate, the Opposition has gone out of its way to provoke unwarranted suspicion and make baseless charges in respect to all the Government&#39;s defence measures. Nevertheless, when this bill becomes law, as it must, I feel that, as good Australians, they will give the ready help that should be given by them. They may, I think, be relied upon to see that our defence measures secure what we aim- at - adequate protection for the people. </para>

                <para class="block">I know that to honorable senators opposite this word &#34; referendum &#34; has a very  sinister meaning, because it occurs in the Labour party&#39;s policy with respect to foreign wars. We are always told that a referendum cannot be taken in the face of an enemy ; but a government, of which the Menzies Government is .the lineal descendant, succeeded in taking two referendums while the Great War was actually being waged, and while our men were dying in the different theatres of war. No state of war exists at the moment and, therefore, no just reason can bc advanced &#39;.&#39;.gainst granting to the people and to those who are vitally inly res ted in the provisions of this measure - and no section of the community will be called upon to render a greater service under this bill that the section which we on this side of the chamber represent - the opportunity to express their opinion in regard to it before it becomes law. If the Government is of the opinion that this bill is vitally necessary, what reason can it offer for refusing to consult the people before finally placing it upon the statute-book? Either it is afraid to trust the people or it is fearful of their verdict. If the Government objects to the taking of a referendum on this matter it can ascertain whether the electorate is prepared to accept the principles laid down in this bill, by refusing any longer to attempt to carry on the government of this country under th extremely difficult circumstance&#39;s in  which  it finds itself to-day. Hour after hour in the House of Representatives, it has had to eat its words and accept the demands of first one and then the other of the competing parties in the House.  Why  does it submit to the dictates of the Opposition parties? Merely to deny to its masters the right to say once and for all whether or not they are satisfied with the policy of this Government and the legislative means by which it proceeds to implement that policy, one feature of which we are now discussing. </para>

                        <para>- That is so; nevertheless, I ask <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> to bear this in mind: On this side of the chamber all but one of us are secure in our jobs for we have another five years to run, whereas only three honorable senators opposite are secure in their jobs for that period. In these circumstances, why should we fear an election? We have far more reason to view with equanimity an approaching election than have honorable senators opposite. We are prepared to face our masters at any time that the . Government is ready for the contest, and we are fortified in that preparedness by the results of the recent by-elections for the House of Representatives. I am not asking for an election; I am merely suggesting that, if&#39; the Government has an unholy fear of this word &#34; referendum &#34; it can take other action to ascertain the feelings of the people in regard to this bill. I do not wish to traverse the ground so thoroughly covered during the second: reading debate; it would be unfair to attempt to do so during the comparatively short time allowed for the committee debate. The Minister in charge of the bill delivered what I consider is one of the best replies to a second-reading debate delivered by any Minister in this chamber in recent times. It was not of the stereotyped officially-prepared type ; the Minister, breathed into it a little of the soul of his own personality. I am grateful to him for the nice things he said about the Labour party of earlier years, though I knew when he said them that he was only leading up to some unkind remarks regarding the present Opposition. In no part of his reply to the debate, however, did he remove one of the defects which we see in this bill. He spoke of unnecessary fear and unfounded suspicion. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, and on those military tactics lie is a very satisfactory authority for us. We are not so concerned, however, with that phase of the bill as with others. I may perhaps be excused if I repeat that we object to this bill, because it is compulsory, because it has been rightly termed by Government supporters a stock-taking  bill, and because under it men and women of this country will be treated as so much raw .material along with machinery and goods of every description. I was about to say that I hope my amendment would be, carried. I know that it will not be because we cannot move this Government in its desire to stay where it is against all odds. I want it to be put on record that at the eleventh hour the Opposition gave the Government an opportunity through this amendment to retreat from the unworthy position which it had taken. After all, the amendment does . not discuss the merits of the measure; but asks that, before it is put into operation, its proposals be submitted to the people of Australia, who are vitally interested in it. They are more interested than many honorable senators, whose age will prevent them from coming under the operations of the measure. I, myself, would be exempt, but I am giving the Government an opportunity to do the decent thing, the Australian thing, which is to say to the people, openly and with every confidence - if it can work up that confidence - &#34; You are our masters. This is an important measure, and we submit it to you by means of a referendum in order to know, before we bring it into operation, whether you approve of it of not&#34;. &#39; </para>

                    <para>.- In supporting the amendment, I do not propose to discuss the general purpose of the bill. It has been well discussed by the representatives of all parties in this chamber. I point out, however, even at this late hour, that there has been a decided alteration of the position of the Government. In the House of Representatives a few hours ago it was overwhelmingly defeated on a very important matter, which has given the Opposition further reasons for saying that the Government has no mandate, no authority, and no support from the electors for bringing this legislation before Parliament. Its action is in marked contrast to the action of the Scullin Government, which resigned on the very day that a vote was cast against it as the result of an almost innocuous objection raised against the action of a Minister who was being energetic at his own election. The present Government has no warrant to introduce a national registration scheme, because it does not possess the confidence of either the Parliament or the electors.. </para>

                        <para>- The Leader of the Government was referring to methods of compulsory training or any other form of compulsion. This measure proposes compulsory registration, which is viewed with grave fear, not only by honorable senators on this side of the chamber, hut also by a large section of the community outside of the Parliament. I hold the definite opinion that the rural and industrial populations of Australia will resent the national registration scheme, and therefore I claim that the duty of the Government, if it does not want to break the pledge given by its leader, is to submit the proposal to a referendum. </para>

                    <para>. - This amendment contains a little more than at first meets the eye. Clause 2 of the bill provides that the act shall come into operation on the day on which it receives the Royal assent. This provision, as honorable senators will recall, has been inserted because of the requirement in the Acts Interpretation Act that, unless the contrary intention appears in a particular act, the act is to come into operation on the 28th day after it receives the Royal assent. It may be presumed, therefore, that in fixing the date of operation as the day of the Royal assent, the Government was of the opinion that the measure was of an urgent nature, and that its commencement should not be delayed once it had been assented to. </para>

                <para class="block">Starting with this presumption, I now come to the amendment moved by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings).</inline> It suggests that a referendum should be conducted to ascertain whether the people approve of the principles of the bill. The Constitution makes no express provision for a referendum of this description and some doubt exists as to whether the Commonwealth Parliament has power to pass effective legislation for the holding of such a referendum. Even assuming that there is no constitutional objection to the conduct of such  a  referendum, the Government is unable, in present circumstances, to agree to any proposal which would have the effect of postponing the commencement of the operation of the bill. . Of necessity, the submission of the bill to  a  referendum would cause considerable delay in bringing the measure into operation and, as a natural corollary, would delay unduly the carrying out of the Government&#39;s mandate for taking adequate and prompt steps for the defence of this country. The defence programme must, in the opinion of the Government, be implemented with the least possible delay, and the Government is unable to countenance any action that would cause delay. I ask honorable senators to reject the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- Some statements were made by the late Prime Minister with reference to a voluntary register, but I do not recall any member of his Government or any of its supporters referring at the last election to a compulsory register. In minor matters, governments of democracies may, without consulting the electorate, take action to meet certain conditions that arise, but an essential feature of the democratic system is that any party which aspires to govern a country shall place vital principles before the electorate and allow the people to decide whether or not it approves of the action proposed to be taken. Can any honorable senator supporting the Government say that the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons</inline> put this issue before the electorate? If the people had been consulted about a compulsory register of man-power and if it had approved the proposal, the Government would be justified in asking Parliament to pass this bill. But the electorate has not been consulted, and we submit that the Government is now acting in a most undemocratic way in endeavouring to force this bill through&#39; * Parliament. My leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> is endeavouring to put the Government on the right path of democracy by submitting an amendment to make possible the consultation of the electorate on this vital principle. The proposed referendum would not take many weeks. There is no need for a general election, nor do the circumstances warrant such a course. It would be possible, within a few weeks, to get a definite expression of opinion from the people by means of a referendum a definite declaration of whether or not they favour a compulsory registration of the man-power and wealth resources of the Commonwealth. If honorable senators supporting the Government believe in democracy they will vote for the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the amendment. In my speech on the second reading I challenged the right of the Government to introduce a measure of this description which is not in conformity with the wishes of the Australian people. Something has been said about urgency. One would gather, from what some honorable senators have said that it was imperative that the bill be passed within the next few hours, otherwise the safety of the Commonwealth will be jeopardized. During the election campaign in October, 1937, the then Prime Minister, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons,</inline> stressed the defence policy of his Government. To all intents and purposes, this is the same Government, though there has been a rearrangement of certain portfolios. If, during the general elections in 1937, no mention was made of a compulsory register of man-power, this Government now has no warrant for the bill. At the meeting of the Cabinet in Hobart early in the present year, there was general agreement to prepare a voluntary register. Can any Government supporter contend that there has been such a drastic change in the position of Australia since that time as to warrant the introduction of this bill for a compulsory register of man-power and wealth resources? </para>

                        <para>- I am replying to statements made by the Minister. If, as has been suggested, the world position is so desperate as to justify this Government, without having received a mandate from the people, in proposing legislation of this character, why should not this Parliament remain in session in order that the representatives of the people may be consulted with regard to measures that may be brought forward to meet the. situation? But the one idea of Ministers is to get into recess as quickly as possible in order to stave off defeat. They know that if this Parliament be allowed to remain open for a few more days, they will be forced to relinquish their hold of the treasury benches. Their only hope of safety is to close the National Parliament. Although the nation is said to be in dire peril, the people&#39;s representatives are not to be. allowed to express their opinion in respect of this legislation which will give to the Executive, in recess, complete control over Parliament, over property, over goods and even over the lives of citizens of the Commonwealth. </para>

                        <para>- The people should be consulted in connexion with this vital matter. We appeal to the Government to seek a mandate. It has been suggested that we on this side are not sincere in our objection to the bill. My reply is that, the Labour party is always ready to heed the voice of the people. If the Government consults them in this matter by referendum, and if the people approve of the Ministry&#39;s proposals, those in the industrial movement who at present are opposing the measure will accept the decision of the people. The Labour movement believes in trusting the people. I now challenge the Government to refer this matter to a vote of the people. </para>

                        <para>- I am merely replying to what has already been said. Therefore, this bill is not a violation of any undertaking given by the late Prime Minister, or anybody else. In February last, the Lyons Government proposed to provide for a voluntary register, believing that it would be successful; but, in March, the; Government decided that a compulsory register was required, and the present Ministry is. merely carrying out the decision of the Lyons Administration. The Opposition now asks for a referendum, so that the people may decide whether they should be asked to put their names to a paper and answer a few simple questions. If the Opposition wishes to convey to the electors that it has not sufficient ability to govern this country, it is at liberty to do so in that way. It has been said that the late Prime ,  Minister declared that no compulsion of any kind would be applied. I point out that, when the periodical census is taken, compulsion is exercised, and the questionnaire for the purpose of an ordinary census is far more comprehensive than is that proposed in connexion with the national register. </para>

                <para>This amendment has been tabled for the specific purpose of misleading the people into the belief that the bill implies conscription. In drawing that inference, the Opposition is dishonest, because no mention is made in the bill of either conscription or compulsory training. Without consulting this Parliament, the Government could introduce compulsory training, because that power has never been repealed. Therefore, the amendment is an idle one, being designed merely to lead the people to believe that, there is a hidden motive behind the bill,  despite the guarantee given by Ministers in both branches of the legislature that the idea of conscription is not entertained. </para>

The Government has not obtained a mandate from the people to introduce compulsory registration of the. man-power of Australia. As to the proposed register of Wealth, the bill leaves one in doubt regarding the form that it would take. In my opinion, a very small proportion of the people understands what is contained in, or implied by, this measure. Clause 15 provides that a census or censuses of male persons, or classes of persons, between the ages of 18 years and 65 years, and a census of property shall be taken in such States, territories, or parts of the Commonwealth, and on such day or days, or within such period or periods, as the Governor-General, by proclamation, directs; but the schedule of particulars required to be furnished is nullified by sub-clause 2, which states - </para>

                    <para>. - I fail to see why the Government should not accept the amendment. All that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> has said is irrefutable. The Senate has been in session since the 16th May last, prior to which it had been in recess since the 9th December, 1938. This Parliament was closed during a period when we were on the brink of a European catastrophe that would have seriously affected this country. Wo are now told that the necessity for the passage of this legislation is urgent, although the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has stated that the international situation is not so serious as it was in September last. In a national emergency, the persons covered by this bill could foe called up under the provisions of the Defence Act ; but the bill goes further than that, and I am still convinced that there is an undisclosed motive behind it. Industrial conscription will be possible under the terms of the measure, and it would be difficult to say precisely how far it would permit the Government to go. The bill is entitled &#34; A bill for an act to provide for the taking of censuses for the purposes of national registration, -for the establishment of a national-register, and for other purposes &#34;. We fear that the bill will give to the Government the authority to establish, by regulation, while the doors of Parliament are closed, a dictatorship similar to that which exists in some other countries, and that in the event of an emergency that authority may be used harshly. The position would be different if it were a matter of the Defence Act being used in an emergency. When the conscription issue was submitted to the people in 1916, they spoke with no uncertain voice. I submit that legislative power to enforce conscription should not be included in any enactment until the people have expressed their views on the subject. As the result of the efforts of Labour candidates during the last election campaign, the late Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Lyons),</inline> two or three days before polling day, made a pronouncement in which he said that the Government had no intention to introduce conscription. </para>

It has been said that members of the Opposition are unduly suspicious, and are looking for something which the hill does not contain. We are urged to pass the bill in its present form. However, we desire to go further. We do not want this legislation to be ineffective; and, therefore, we ask that the people of Australia shall be permitted to say whether or not they favour it. I wish to make clear that if this bill be passed, whether or not a referendum be taken, we on this side will respect the law.  We stand for majority rule, even though we may not agree with the legislation that is passed. The only excuse offered for not holding a referendum of the people is that it would occupy too much time.

                    <para>. - I shall be brief, because I realize that it is practically useless to endeavour to persuade the Government to submit this bill to a referendum of the people. The present Government is similar to that which in 1916 was opposed to a referendum of the people before the manhood of Australia was conscripted. On that occasion, however, the Senate compelled the Government to agree to a referendum. To-day the position is different, for the Government has a majority in this chamber and can do what it likes. We fear that this measure will be the forerunner of conscription. I am particularly concerned about the hoys between the ages of 18 and 21 years, who will he liable to &#39; be conscripted, but have no votes. Their parents, particularly their mothers, who are anxious that  they shall not become &#34; gun-fodder &#34;, should have a voice in determining the fate of this measure. The mothers of the nation are wondering for what purpose they have raised sons; they have higher hopes for them than that they shall become &#34; cannon-fodder &#34;. It has been said that the purpose of the register is to ensure that men shall be employed where they will be of the greatest use, that the intention is to avoid making a cook of the mechanic, or a batman of the engineer; but the truth is that the Government wants to find secure and safe jobs for its friends. As boys between the ages of  18  .and  21  years cannot be classed as skilled tradesmen, they will be available only to serve as &#34; foot-sloggers &#34;, whilst the sons of wealthy parents, who, in many instances, will be university students or graduates, will be placed in safe positions. Moreover, the index cards of men &#39;and boys who are not wanted by their bosses will probably be specially marked. During the last few weeks, I have attended a number of meetings at which this legislation has been discussed. On each occasion I could sense the fear of the people as to its purpose. I have no doubt that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein&#39;s</inline> mother was very concerned about the referendum submitted to the people in  1916. </para>

It has been said that Australian troops will not again be sent overseas; but I point out that, by the simple addition of the words &#34; and overseas &#34; to the Defence Act, the manhood of Australia could be conscripted and forced to participate in a blood bath at any place that might be selected. I again appeal to the Government to accept the amendment, so that the mothers and fathers of the nation may decide whether or not some men and boys &#39;are to be indexed so that they may be placed in safe jobs, whilst others will be forced into the trenches. </para>

                        <para>- There is plenty of time to give effect to the purpose of the amendment. Time does not enter into the matter to the extent that the Minister would have us believe. If the Government did not possess all the powers necessary to do what it considered should be done in a state of emergency, or if war were declared, the position would be different, but it already has the powers to do what it proposes to do under this bill. I feel that the Minister is not stating the position&#39; as it should be stated. No fewer than 47 members of this Parliament believe that this measure is highly provocative and dangerous, and that its purpose is to enable the Government to employ compulsion in a way that would be injurious to the people. The opinion of the 47 members should weigh with the Government, when a request is made on their behalf. </para>

I do not think that there would be any grave objection to the Government in the meantime taking the necessary preliminary steps to implement the legislation; in fact, it would do so, if it thought that it had the confidence of the people. &#34;We have a vivid recollection of what happened during the Great War. The right honor able member for North Sydney said in the House of Representatives that the Government would not introduce conscription. When later he brought it measure before Parliament to do so, he was asked , why he had changed his mind, and he replied that what he had said yesterday did not matter. What was done by that Minister could be done by this Government also. There is ample time for the Government to take a referendum and to dispel the fears of the people concerning the measure. Surely, no one really believes that the meetings held to protest against the bill are all &#34; hooey &#34; as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> suggested. Demonstrations have been made in centres throughout the country, as well as in the large cities, and they all indicate the people&#39;s apprehension that the Government is actuated by motives which it has not disclosed. The refusal of the Government to accept the amendment justifies that fear. I take it that if the referendum proposal were agreed to, that would mean the postponement of the coming into operation of the act. Now, &#91; should like to refer to clause 22. </para>

                        <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> drew attention to the effect of this clause on youths between the ages of 18 and 21 years, and appealed for an opportunity to be given to the parents to say whether or not they would agree to the conditions laid down in the measure. Clause 22 is really sectional legislation. The Government proposes to impose certain obligations upon a section of the community. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, when it affects working-class people. The clause will compel youths who are between the ages of 18 and 21 years to notify the powers that be whenever they change their addresses. I should like to know how clause 22 will be made applicable to the thousands of youths who are travelling the roads looking for work. What will their addresses be? How can they fill in census forms? I ask the Ministerthese questions. </para>

At present there is in existence a man-.power committee which has done good work in collecting information, especially during the recent recruiting campaign. Is it possible for the  chairman  of the Man-power Committee to be appointed  chairman  of the National Register Board? I am not sure whether or not he is still an officer of the Defence Department. </para>

                    <para>. - Is there any necessity for arepresentative of the Defence Department to be  chairman  of the board and for the Commonwealth Statistician and a representative of the Department of Supply and Development to be members of that body ? Honorable senators supporting the measure have gone to a great deal of trouble to assure us that there is nothing sinister in it and that it will not be used as we fear. They say that it is harmless, that its only purpose is to make a survey of the man-power and resources of Australia, and that the information gathered will not be used to conscript the manhood, wealth, or industrial resources of the community. The Government must realize by now that the objection to this measure is based on the taint , of militarism which permeates it. Our suspicions and fears, as they are termed by honorable senators opposite, are strengthened by the proposed composition and powers of the board. I believe that there is no necessity for such a body, and that the survey could be conducted by the Commonwealth Bureau of Census andStatistics. </para>

                    <para>. -  In general terms the board to be appointed will be responsible for the form and manner in which the national register is made. Its constitution has been planned in order that all departments interested in the compilation and subsequent utilization of the information obtained shall be represented on the controlling body. It is hoped that by this arrangement the registerwill be kept in such a way as to facilitate its use by. all departments concerned. As to its composition, one will be the Commonwealth Statistician who will devise and conduct the collection of data. The other members of the board will represent the Department of Defence and the Department of Supply and Development. The representative of the latter department will take note of those people who, in  time  of war, will be useful to ensure the collection and utilization of raw materials and manufactured articles. The representative of the Department of Defence will note these people who will be useful in making, forwarding or ordering supplies which will be needed. immediately by the services. As about seven men behind the lines are needed to keep one man in the front line, honorable senators will see that the services are very extensive and the demand for expert or skilled artisans will be heavy. </para>

                        <para>- This clause deals with the personnel of the proposed National Register Board which will include the Commonwealth Statistician. I understand that the Government proposes to appoint to this board one member of the Advisory Committee on Industrial Organization. Knowing the personnel of that body and their addresses in Melbourne - they are all located in one building opposite to a building occupied by a firm of financiers from whose directorate the Prime Minister recently resigned - I have no doubt of what will happen. They will be able to consult freely and give advice with regard to industrial mobilization which the Minister mentioned in his second-reading speech. Therefore, I contend that I am justified in viewing this clause with some suspicion. The Minister&#39;s explanation has not removed my doubts. </para>

                            referred specifically to the relation between the Department of Supply and Development and the National Register Board. The first schedule to this bill requires persons to supply information with regard to the value of stock in trade; the value of livestock; the value of plant, including machinery, tools, implements, rolling stock, &#38;c., used for trade purposes, and the value of land owned, including the unimproved value and value of improvements, as well as the value of the interest of a sole owner of property. We believe that this will have something to do with matters that will come under the control of the Department of Supply and Development, and it would appear that the Minister&#39;s explanation is in conflict with his second-reading speech on that bill. To which authority will people requiring to furnish information be responsible? Because of the confusion that exists, I am afraid that a far greater section of the community will refuse to supply information than has already been indicated. The people will not know where they stand.

Lt  seems to me that such an appointment is unnecessary. The only clear thing about the clause is that it provides that the executive officer must not be appointed for a period which will expire after he attains the age of 65 years. In view of. the admission by the Minister&#39; that his duties will be similar to those of a senior officer of the census staff, I submit that a clearer definition of the duties should be given. </para>

These duties may be prescribed by proclamation or by regulations, and the committee is entitled to further light on the matter. Sub-clause 2 states that the officer shall be appointed for a period not exceeding five years, and shall be eligible for re-appointment. The clause further provides that he shall receive such remuneration as the Governor-General determines. The Supply and Development Bill will operate over a period of five years, and, assuming that the measure now under consideration will operate for a similar period, it appears that the expenditure in connexion with the undefined emergency that has been responsible for the introduction of these two measures will be &#163;2,777 15s. for every hour during the next three years, or &#163;46 6s. for every minute in every day of the year for the next three years. The remuneration to be paid to the executive officer should be set out in the bill. </para>

                    <para>. - The official note before me states that the clause provides for the appointment of an executive officer of the board to carry out certain duties in connexion with the utilization of the register. The work of this officer will be chiefly concerned with the administration of the detailed register, after the national register cards have been collected, coded and classified by the Commonwealth Statistician. The officer is to be appointed for a period not exceeding five years, but the term of his appointment must not carry him over the age of 65 years. He is to be exempt from the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. Sub-clause 5 is a usual machinery provision to safeguard the rights of any officer of the Public Service who may be appointed to this position. </para>

Possibly a person well advanced in years will be appointed to the position and will not be prepared to contribute to the superannuation fund, owing to the heavy contributions that the age-rate basis would involve. But what is exercising my mind is the question of the necessity for this appointment. I hope that I understood the Minister, who, I realize, endeavoured to explain the situation by means of information received second-hand. The Minister stated that the executive. &#39;officer will carry out such powers and duties of the board as it directs, or as are prescribed. He said, too, that the Commonwealth Statistician would be responsible for the method of collection. What responsibilities will the other  two  members of the board assume? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett.</inline> - They  will  be re- sponsible for the selection from  the register. </para>

By the time that the gentlemen from the Defence Department have instructed the Statistician and his skilled officers, and the officer from the Department of Supply and Development has had his say, the executive officer will not know where he is.

                <para>The Governor-General  may  at  any  time remove the executive officer  from  office  on  the grounds  of  incapacity  or  misbehaviour. </para>
                <para>The Governor-General means, as we know, the government of the day. In practice, the responsible Minister would make to Cabinet a recommendation which would come before the Governor-General in Executive Council. The Minister in charge of the bill <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collett)</inline> has told us that there is to be a board which will do certain things, and also that there is to be an executive officer, who shall, subject to the control of the board, exercise and perform such powers and duties of the board as it directs, or as are prescribed. The &#39;board, however, will have no power to dismiss the executive officer. Should that official become recalcitrant, or refuse to obey . orders, neither the Minister nor the board will be able to remove him from office. Even if the executive officer does not go so far as to refuse to carry out instructions, it is easily conceivable that there may be conflict between him and the board. This highly paid executive officer will, undoubtedly, have many friends at court, or he will not got the appointment. But the board, whose instructions he is supposed to carry out, will not be able to remove him. Even if the board should recommend his removal from office because of incapacity or misbehaviour, no notice need be taken of its recommendation. One would have thought that power would be given to the board to remove from office an officer over whom it has control. The clause does not even say that the board shall have power to recommend his removal. On the other hand, he may be a most efficient officer, and the board may desire to retain his services, but some Minister, or combination of Ministers, may think differently, and desire his removal from office. One would think that the board would have power to retain the services of an officer in whom it had full confidence. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly, it is. I know that, for many years, honorable senators have not critically examined the legislation that has been introduced into this chamber. They have been pleased to acquiesce in anything submitted to them by the Government. I notice that, as the result of the observant and legal mind of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson,</inline> various amendments appear on the notice-paper. Why is it that, for a long period, the Government has used in its legislation phrases and words that, were thought to be necessary, until <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> came along and showed otherwise? As this clause stands, we shall create a board, and supply it with an executive officer who will be supposed to work under its direction; yet he may be either removed from office or retained in the board&#39;s service against its will. The whole thing is ridiculous, and will lead to confusion. </para>

                    <para>. - Why is paragraph c included in the clause? If the Governor-General did not accept the resignation of the executive officer how would the operations of the department be affected? The executive officer will be appointed for five years, and in that period, three different men may occupy the position of Governor-General. One Governor-General may be partial to tin hares and another to night clubs. He might think that the executive officer was  all  right and, therefore, refuse to accept his resignation. </para>

Senators know of cases where a man for a particular reason has sent in his resignation, and the committee employing him has returned it and asked him to reconsider his decision. That is common. If the notificationof the resignation were automatic it might have unfortunate consequences for the department.

                    <para>. -  Itake it that this clause is similar to the provision placed in every measure appointing officials, and under it, if an officer becomes bankrupt, he must resign. Although there is no&#39; hope of amending the clause, I know from personal experience that a man&#39;s , financial position may become unsatisfactory through no fault of his own. In such circumstances if he is a member of Parliament he must vacate his seat, and if he is an executive officer he is dismissed. Why should that happen ? A man holding a position may not be of the best type morally, and he can get away with almost anything and continue to be an officer employed by the Government, but if he happens to have monetary difficulties and becomes bankrupt he must give up his position. Should not some consideration be shown to persons who can prove that their unfortunate financial position is due to circumstances over which they have had no control? </para>

                        <para>- We know that bribery and corruption occur all the time, but because a man is financially unfortunate he is suspected of being corruptible. That is not right. If he were venal, the odds are that he would not be bankrupt. In some cases it is because a man is honest that he becomes bankrupt or compounds with his creditors. We all know men who have been on the verge of bankruptcy, but have suffered no penalty, it is not right that a man should be forced out of a position because he actually becomes bankrupt. The present social system attaches more significance to a man&#39;s financial obligations than to his moral obligations. He can be immoral and refuse to regard his obligations, and nothing is said, but if he fails to carry out certain financial obligations he must cease to be a member of Parliament or lose his job in the Public Service, as the case may be. It is grossly unfair that such a provision should be included in the bill. There may be extenuating circumstances, and a man dismissed from his post on account of bankruptcy should have an opportunity of appearing before a proper tribunal and explaining his position. </para>

                    <para>. -  This clause provides that if an executive officer of the National Register Board becomes bankrupt he shall be deemed to have vacated his position. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan said that in such circumstances if a man&#39;s character is clean, he can be immediately reappointed ; but I point out that no provision has been made in the clause to enable that to be done. Undue hardship may be inflicted upon an executive officer who, through no fault of his own, finds himself declared bankrupt. Because of the tightening up of bank credit or an unfortunate purchase of shares in a public company, he may become bankrupt and never be able to secure a certificate of discharge. This provision is vastly different from that which applies to the election of members of State parliaments. Not so long ago, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stuart</inline> Robertson,  a  member of the Legislative Council of New South Wales was called upon to vacate his seat after having been declared bankrupt; He subsequently submitted himself for reelection and was successful in regaining his seat. This clause does not confer the right on the executive officer to submit himself for re-appointment after removal from office. It should be amended in such a way as to provide that a man who becomes bankrupt through no fault of his own shall not be dismissed from office. </para>

                        <para>- I assume that responsible officers and beads of departments are covered by the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. It should be laid down definitely in this clause that the question of whether or not the executive officer of the board should vacate his position on becoming a certified bankrupt should be decided on the merits of each individual case. A Commonwealth public servant may be appointed to the position of executive officer. If so, he will come under the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act, and not under this clause. Unsatisfactory discrimination of this sort should be avoided.  I  ask the Minister to agree to the postponement of the clause so that I may have an opportunity to frame an amendment to bring it into line with the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Act- </para>

                    <para>. -  I also record my protest against the clause. I cannot see the necessity for it. I believe that it is just one of those stereotyped clauses which are already set up in the Government Printing Office for inclusion in any bill in which it is thought they might be  appropriate. The time has come when the legislature should disregard some of the precedents that have been followed in the past. </para>

                <para>I have in mind a man who, through no fault of his own, became involved in a motor accident, and as a result of subsequent proceedings lost his home. If he had not possessed a home, a claim would probably have been made against his salary for the recovery of damages and legal costs. We have all heard also of persons occupying high positions becoming involved in domestic troubles and suffering heavy monetary losses. The late Prime Minister, in the policy speech of his Government, featured a proposal to establish a. branch of the Commonwealth Bank for the granting of small loans to public servants who, under present conditions, are forced <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> pay excessive rates of interest on loans from private money lenders, in order to tide them over temporary difficulties. This clause provides that, in the event of the executive officer becoming bankrupt, or being obliged to make an assignment of his salary for the benefit of his creditors, he shall be removed from his position. His re-appointment is doubtful. I shall vote against the clause. </para>

                    <para>. - Under this clause the board or the Commonwealth Statistician may, in relation to any particular matters or class of matters, delegate all or any of its or his powers and duties under the act to any officer in any part of the Commonwealth. This means that several boards could be set up under this legislation. Under a later provision, officers may be appointed by a State. I presume that police officers in each State will be made officers for the purpose of this measure, and men carrying their swags along the roads could be subjected to an inquisitorial examination by police officers. It seems to me that this legislation will involve a great deal of work which will have to be undone when the Labour party is returned to power. </para>

                    <para>. - This clause has to be read in conjunction with clause 4, which relates to powers to be conferred upon the board by regulations. This is a sinister feature of the measure, because it will be possible to give very wide powers to the board, which will be practically part and parcel of the Defence Department. A representative of that department will be chairman of the board, and another member will be a representative of the Department of Supply and Development, which is practically a part of the Defence Department. These powers may be delegated to almost any body, and, knowing the . psychology of the Defence Department, I fear that the powers conferred may be too great. </para>

                    <para>. - I invite honorable senators to give their attention to the definition of &#34; officer &#34; in clause 3. The purpose of the clause now under consideration is quite clear. A similar provision is to he found in the Census Act and in similar acts. This is a usual provision, to make it possible for the Statistician to carry out the duties allotted to him. Such a clause is essential in a country such as Australia, where the distances are so great. Provisions are included to prevent the misuse of these powers, which can be exercised only with the approval of the Minister. </para>

The proviso sets out that the contents of any form relating to property shall not be divulged to the Minister, and the Minister shall not direct that its contents be divulged to any officer other than the Commissioner of Taxation. Does that differentiation mean that the Government thinks that information in respect of property should be treated with greater secrecy than information relating to individuals?

                        <para>- This clause is typical of much of the legislation introduced by this Government. There  is  to be a card relating to life and limb, but by proclamation a different -card may be required. That different card may contain private information which the individual concerned may wish to keep secret. The Minister is to be debarred from directing that the contents of the card relating to property be divulged to any person other than the Commissioner of Taxation ; but there is no such restriction in respect of information relating to individuals. Are we to understand that the information on the cards relating to property will not be known to the board ? </para>

                    <para>. -  We have been accused by Government supporters of being saturated with suspicion. I have already said that the Government will not pay much attention to the census of the wealth of the nation ; it has no intention to ascertain that information. As soon as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> mentioned the matter, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline>  who represents big business, rose and protested indignantly against any senator speaking of wealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> said nothing about the persons referred to in the -first part of the clause- the cannon fodder. A man may be forced out of the Government service, or kept out of private employment by an organization with which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> is connected, but that does not matter. The measure has been sugar-coated in an endeavour to persuade organized labour to accept it. This clause proposes that only, the Taxation Department may learn the contents of the wealth cards, but the department should already possess that knowledge. We know that the details set out on the census cards will correspond to those already supplied to the Taxation Department. On taxation returns, all people do not tell the truth, but dishonest persons will make the two documents agree one with the other. The Government supporters know that this clause is to insist on the supply of information from the poor sections of the community, and not from the wealthy classes. The scream that came from <inline font-weight="bold">Senator .</inline> Leckie was mild in comparison with the opposition that would be fomented by big business if the Government sought to gather real information about the wealth of the nation. In such <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> case slides would be exhibited at the picture shows and large advertisements would appear in the press. If an attempt were made to interfere with the wealthy they would see that the Government was removed. This proposal emanated from a Government that is noted for sham and humbug. </para>

                    <para>. - I regret that the Opposition should view this clause with suspicion, because it is quite clear. Both classes of forms will be sent to the Commonwealth Statistician who will tabulate them, and the figures so obtained will be  Available  for the general planning of the man-power and resources of the country. Particulars of the man-power may be disclosed to the Minister, but the one man in Australia who may see whether the wealth statistics are correct is the Commissioner of Taxation. He already has details of each taxpayer&#39;s income, but this balance-sheet will be of great importance to him, because he wilh be enabled to see whether the taxation returns are correct, or whether the wealth census is correct. The bill provides that the information shall be disclosed to the particular officer to- whom it will be of use in the public interest. There is no need to be suspicious about the clause in relation to its references to the man-power register, because those particulars will be available to the Minister for public purposes. </para>

                    <para>. - Can the Minister tell me in what way the correct tabulation of the general wealth of the community will assist the cause of defence ? We have been told that this measure has been brought in for the purpose of successfully building up the defence of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> has informed us that when the registration cards have been received, they will be shown to the Commissioner of Taxation who will find out whether the declarations of wealth correspond with the taxation returns. In what way will that help defence ? For years there has been a Commonwealth Statistician. Only a little while ago I submitted to bini a few queries about old-age pensioners and general wealth, and if the Minister asked him a number of questions the officer could give him the figures in a few hours. My p01.11 is that there is a purpose behind the compulsory registration of the man-power. When the bill was first brought in it contained only the schedule relating to manpower, but later, as the result of a member -of the United Australia party in- the House of Representatives moving an amendment, the Menzies Government was compelled to insert another schedule relating to wealth. The Government is not sincere, because it has : distinguished between the two schedules in clause 13. If it is necessary for the real defence of Australia that power should be given to divulge to the Minister information concerning -the man-power, is it not only right for the further defence of Australia that the Minister in the public interest should have the right to&#39; know any information dealing with wealth ? Why should one set of details be withheld from the Minister and the other set, docketing, ticketing and cataloguing the worker, made available to the Minister? Why is there that distinction? </para>

                    SHEEHAN  (Victoria) &#91;9.15 1. 1 appreciate that the clause, as drafted, provides a certain amount of protection, but when we consider the schedules in relation to it, we find that a very great distinction is made between the personal information and property information. Individuals will be called upon to state the country of birth of their fathers and mothers. There may be some people, not so fortunate as we honorable senators, who do know the country of origin of our parents, but I have yet to learn that an Australian who does not know where his parents were born is likely to be a less distinguished soldier than those who are placed in a more fortunate position. Under this clause the rights of property shall never be queried. The information collated regarding property is to be kept secret. &#39; This clause provides that the contents of any form relating to property shall not be divulged to the Minister, and that the Minister shall not direct that its contents be divulged to any officer other than the Commissioner of Taxation. It is this discrimination between personal information arid pro perty information to which we object. What does it matter where a man&#39;s father or mother was born? Did we ask the sons of Germans or Austrians who enlisted in the Australian Imperial Force where their parents were born?

                    <para>. -  I join with other honorable senators on this side of the chamber in protesting against the unfair discrimination in this clause. In his second-reading speech, &#39;the Minister set out very clearly that the purpose of the register of man-power is to ensure that, as far as possible in time of emergency, every man shall be allocated to the part for which his training and calling best fit him. To that objective, we have no objection. The honorable senator, however, was strangely silent about the purpose of the wealth register. Apparently, the decision to include a wealth register was an afterthought of the Government after a count of heads had been made. I can appre*ciate the necessity for secrecy in regard to the information collated by the National Register Board regarding the wealth of the community, and I am only concerned about the purpose for which the wealth register is to be compiled. Is it intended to be used for the purpose of imposing a levy upon wealth in time of emergency ? </para>

                    <para>. -  I can see no necessity for the confusion that has arisen, or the heat that has been engendered, during the discussion of this clause. Two schedules have been provided in the bill, the first relating to man-power, the second to wealth. When the information has been collected, no use can be made of either register without legislative sanction. I am one of those who believe that in a state of emergency equal demands should be made upon the wealth and man-power of the country. Having a register of the wealth of this country, it should be very easy for any government, whatever its political colour, to impose, if it thought fit, a levy on wealth in time of emergency. In respect of the register of man-power, certain disclosures have to be made, but the position in regard to the register of wealth is entirely different. </para>

There is no disgrace in that. I cannot imagine any man being afraid to disclose to anybody the country from which his father or mother came. The honorable senator is suspicious of that, but unfortunately, honorable senators opposite are always looking for some ulterior motive. I have made my position clear. I am delighted to know that a register of wealth is to be compiled, and that if the man-power of this country is ever called upon to defend the nation, we shall also have information available regarding the wealth of the community for possible use. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> has expressed astonishment that confusion should exist over the provisions of this clause. There is no confusion among honorable senators on this side of the chamber. Perhaps, I may be permitted to illustrate the difference between the tabulation of manpower and the tabulation of wealth by an analogy. Let us take, for instance, the case of a man who liberates a basketful of tabulated trout fry and allows them to go serenely on their way upstream. The only opportunity to check their  subsequent  movements is when some of them are hooked on a fisherman&#39;s line. And I tell Government supporters that trout are just about as hard to hook as are some of the capitalists, who have been evading the income tax in Australia for so many years. </para>

                        <para>- On the other hand, the tabulation of man-power will enable the Government to place its hand upon the- manhood of this country at any time. What we object to is the distinction that is made between the two forms of registration. Protection is given to the capitalists and the moneyed class: but the unfortunate worker&#39;s name will be in the register, and he may be called upon at any time to make the supreme sacrifice. A later clause of the bill makes a further distinction in respect of youths between the ages of  18  and  21.  They will be required, some of them at frequent intervals, to furnish to the Commonwealth Statistician information of changes of address. I shall vote against the clause. </para>

It is well understood that everything that Australia possesses will be thrown into the scale in a national emergency. All that the Government proposes to do is to conduct a survey of the material, man-power and wealth resources that may be made available in an emergency. All of the data collected will be treated as confidential : the material sources will be handled by the Supply and Development Department, the man-power information by the Defence Department, and the wealth census by the Commissioner of Taxation, to whom the Government will look for advice in an emergency calling for additional financial measures. All taxation information is confidential, yet the Parliaments of the Commonwealth and States are able to levy upon the wealth of the nation through the various taxes. The wealth of the nation will be made available in such manner as Parliament may determine, but information of a private nature will not be divulged. </para>

Also it stipulates that any form relating to property shall not be divulged to the Minister or to any officer other than the Commissioner of Taxation. A later clause provides that this new department will co-operate with State officers of taxation. I warn the Government that when the workers discover that they have been gulled there will probably be a repetition of the experience in New South Wales, following the introduction of what was known as the Taylor card system which was responsible for one of the greatest industrial upheavals in this country. What is required is a balanced scheme for the collection of this information; otherwise there will be active opposition to it, not only by the working classes, but also by people who are in more comfortable circumstances. </para>

                    <para>. -  The Minister&#39;s interpretation of the clause is not reassuring. There is no reference to the Commissioner of Taxation in any other clause of the bill&#34;. We on this side are not quite satisfied that all Commissioners of Taxation are beyond criticism. I have in mind particularly the incidents in connexion with a gentleman named Kidman who at one stage was well behind with his taxation dues. </para>

                    <para>. - The ignorance displayed by honorable senators opposite in the discussion on this provision is appalling. The clause provides that the form relating to property shall not be divulged to the Minister. Clause 17 enacts that every person who owns property of a value not less than is prescribed, shall fill in and furnish to the Commonwealth Statistician, information relation to it. The Commissioner of Taxation will not receive these returns; they will be handled by the Commonwealth Statistician who will do all the tabulating that may be necessary, and without the consent, of the Minister, he will not be permitted to disclose any information to any body. The Minister may authorize the Statistician to disclose information contained in the property census to the Commissioner of Taxation, whose office is in Canberra. The information obtained will be tabulated, and be used in the public interest.  No  unauthorized person will be able to get information for private purposes, or simply because he is inquisitive. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister will know all about that when we appeal to the people. I object to the frequent attempts on the. part of Government supporters to offer explanations which have no application to objections raised by honorable senators on this side. We know perfectly well how the Government will get the information. We know also what will be done with it. This . clause says definitely that information relating to man-power may be divulged by direction of the Minister, but in no circumstances whatever will the Minister be allowed to divulge to any body information relating to wealth. If the Minister in charge of the bill dared to be honest in regard to this matter, he would admit that the wealth census will be a sham from start to finish. The Government does not intend that the information to be obtained by means of it shall be used for the benefit of the people in a national emergency. The very opposite is intended. The Minister for Defence <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Street)</inline> stated in the House of Representatives that a wealth register would not. be provided; but, when the Opposition demanded it, and he found that the fate of the Government was at stake, he said, &#34; If you think that you will get any good out of it, we shall put it in, but it does not matter &#34;. In order that it shall not matter, the Minister is to be instructed that he must not divulge any information contained in the wealth register. It would be useless to waste further time on this clause, because the Government and its supporters are not prepared to satisfy either the Opposition or their masters outside as to the nature of their nefarious designs. Many Government supporters have spoken, but they have not told the committee one honest thing in reply to questions by the Opposition. They continually say what we know to be untrue, merely in order to gull the public. As soon as this measure has been guillotined through the Senate, and the Parliament is in recess, the people will be informed of the facts in regard to this legislation. </para>

                    <para>. -  I had expected that the Minister would give the real reason for the proposed amendment. If the Opposition were prepared to accept statements by the Government at their Face value, this amendment, at first sight, might appear to be reasonable; but we do not trust the Government, because it has no mandate from the people for this legislation. We are naturally suspicious regarding every line of the bill, and every amendment that the Minister in charge of it may propose. Of course, the amendment under consideration appears to be designed to clear up a doubt. The nature of the particulars required to be furnished is already described in the schedules, and, therefore, sub-clause 2, as it stands, appears to be entirely means ingless. If the proposed new sub-clause were accepted, discrimination would be possible between the persons proclaimed as those from whom the information could be required. Up to the present time it has been understood that all male persons between the ages of 18 years and 65 years will be required to furnish particulars under the man-power census, whilst under the wealth census it has been understood that all persons in the possession of property over a certain value will be required to register. The amendment would make it possible for the Governor-General, by proclamation, to limit the number or classes of persons affected by either the man-power census or the property census. What is the motive behind the amendment ? Does the Government now desire to proclaim that replies will he required from only a limited number of people or from only certain classes? This appears to me to be a particularly sinister amendment, because a section of those from whom the wealth census is to be demanded could be proclaimed as outside the scope of the measure. I say definitely now, as I shall say outside this chamber when an opportunity occurs, that the Government is not sincere in regard to this bill, except insofar as it applies to the man-power census. If this amendment, or the clause itself, is to be applied, the Minister should give a definite assurance that the man-power census will include all male persons between the ages of 18 and 65 years, and that the property census will apply to all persons, the value of whose property exceeds the prescribed limit. If that assurance be not forthcoming, we shall have further evidence of how great a sham the bill is so far as the alleged wealth census is concerned. </para>

                    <para>. -  The proposed amendment does not appear to be in line with sub-clause 1. There is to he a census or censuses of male persons, or classes of persons who have attained the age of eighteen years and have not attained the age of 65 years, and a census of property in  such States, territories or parts of the Commonwealth, and on such day or days, or within such period or periods, as the Governor-General by proclamation directs. I should like the Minister to explain what is meant by &#34; parts of the Commonwealth &#34;. To which part of the Commonwealth is it intended that this legislation shall apply? Is it desired, in the interests of harmony in the House of Representatives, to exclude from the census portions of the north coast districts of New South Wales, or is it intended that no census shall he taken in respect of property in Collins-street, Melbourne, or Toorak? The words &#34;as the Governor-General by proclamation directs &#34; suggest a possibility of unfair differentiation. </para>

                        <para>. -I wish to inform the Senate and the people outside of the manner in which this bill has been advanced to the third-reading stage. We finished at clause 15 and there remained for consideration another eleven clauses, two schedules, and a number of government amendments, but we have not had an opportunity to deal with them or to offer constructive criticism on them. I do not intend to delay the proceedings any further, except to enter my emphatic protest against the tactics adopted by the Government in order to force the legislation through. The Opposition by arrangement agreed to work from eleven o&#39;clock in the morning until eleven at night, but that has not been sufficient for the Government, which has availed itself of the guillotine and forced the measure through in this way. The same process will be in operation from now until to-morrow night, and there will be no time to consider anything. </para>

                    <para>This is the  usual  measure submitted to Parliament for the purpose of appropriating an amount from the Consolidated Revenue Fund for payment into a trust  fund  to enable invalid and old-age pensions to be paid at rates already approved by Parliament. The amount to be appropriated is &#163;15,000,000. The total amount appropriated by Parliament to  date  for this purpose is &#163;225,000,000, and the balance of the appropriation now remaining is only sufficient to meet pension payments to the 30th  June, 1939.  Although Parliament is being asked to appropriate &#163;15,000,000, which is the  usual  amount appropriated, the whole sum will not be withdrawn from revenue immediately. Revenue is drawn upon only for payment to the trust account as required to enable pension payments to be made as they become due. I may  add  that this measure has norelation whatsoever to the rates of conditions under which invalid  and&#39;  old-age pensions are paid. The sole object of the  bill  is to provide funds for the purpose of meeting pensions. </para>

                    <para>. - This afternoon by way of personal explanation I endeavoured to reply to a charge made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> that I had made a misstatement last week in regard to employment at the Newnes shale field ; but in doing so I fell foul of the Standing Orders and was compelled to discontinue my remarks. I take this opportunity to set out the facts in relation to the matter. When speaking on the Supply and Development Bill last week, I stated that nearly 600 men were employed on the Newnes field. That was the statement which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley</inline> characterized to-day as deliberately false. This afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> an officer of the Supply and Development Department, officially in-; formed me that on the 24th May, over 400 men were employed on the shale-field alone, and an additional 150 men on the construction of a road from Capertee to Glen Davis, and that the number is daily increasing. Of course it is unnecessary to remind honorable senators that considerable other employment in the Newnes arearesults indirectly from the operations on the shale deposits. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ashley&#39;s</inline> accusations this afternoon, I feel it incumbent on me to correct the statements made by him. I do not charge the honorable senator with deliberate misstatement, but I suggest to him that before accusing another honorable senator of making a misstatement, he should be sure of his facts. I fully realize that Labour senators smart when informed that, in spite of Labour&#39;s most bitter opposition to the Newnes project, in this Parliament and in the Parliament of New South Wales, and because of the sincerity and determination of this Government to assist in its development, increasing numbers of men are placed in employment at Newnes. The employment of every additional man on that field and elsewhere is a source of pleasure to me, for it means an increased degree of comfort for the worker, his wife and family. The remarkable thing is that, when additional men secure work because of the present Government&#39;s policy and the industry and. patriotism of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Davis</inline> - both are frequently misrepresented and traduced by Labour senators both inside and outside Parliament - those honorable gentlemen, instead of sharing our pleasure, writhe and squirm in a manner that leaves no doubt in my mind that while this Government remains in office, their pleasure is more spontaneous when men lose jobs. What does it matter what government, is in power, so long as men get jobs? The men at. Newnes know to whom they owe their jobs, despite the carping criticism by parliamentary representatives of the Labour movement. </para>

                        <para>- I do not make statements in the Senate which I know to be incorrect. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> stated that, 600 men were employed, I knew the figures were incorrect and 1 therefore, contradicted him. I regard it as my duty in this Parliament to prevent any honorable senator from making a misstatement of fact and getting away, with it. I am perfectly cognizant of the position at Newnes, because I have visited that area. I am sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> has never seen the field. When he rose a few minutes ago and made an electioneering speech in preparation for his demise next year, he said that it was very gratifying to him to know that so many men were employed. We all are pleased to know that men are securing employment, but does the honorable senator derive any pleasure from the fact that the number of persons employed at Newnes has been reduced recently from 600 to 450, and that 150 of those employed are relief workers sent down in batches from Sydney every fortnight? These are the young men, to whom I referred to-day - ill-nourished and physically illequipped to undertake hard manual labour. They are granted only two weeks&#39; employment in every eight and have to exist for eight weeks on less than &#163;9. Is that what the honorable senator regards as a degree of comfort? If that be so, I hope that the young men of Australia will seize the opportunity that will shortly be presented to them to return a Labour government which will give to them what they justly deserve. </para>

I wish now to bring to his notice a statement which appeared in the metropolitan newspapers yesterday relating to the intentions of the Government with respect to the proposed scheme for the stabilization of wheat prices. This widely-circulated press report, which I hope is a canard from Canberra, contained the following statement :  - </para>

                <quote>
                    <para>The plan most likely to be adopted is to fix the price at 3s. 4d: a bushel. This would involve the provision of an additional subsidy of nearly &#163;3,500,000 a year while wheat remains at the present level, in addition to the present bounty fund of &#163;3,000,000 a year, which is provided by the federal flour tax. </para>
                    <para>The only practicable means of raising the necessary money appears to be by a loan, for which it would probably be proposed the Commonwealth Government and the governments of the wheat-producing States should be jointly  responsible. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">I shall be glad if the Leader of the Senate will indicate the intentions of the Government with regard to the stabilization of wheat prices, and particularly, whether the wheat-growing States will be expected to bear one-half of the cost of the scheme. I pause for a moment, but as the Minister does not reply, I fear the worst, especially as I looked in vain in the newspapers to-day for a correction of the statement to which I have directed attention. This morning I put a question to the Acting Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll).</inline> and was informed that the subject was under consideration. This enlightening statement put me in full possession of a fact which I knew weeks ago. </para>
                <para>I feel sure that the Minister for Commerce, personally, would not be a party to any scheme under which the wheat-growing States would be expected to bear one-half of the cost. I tell the Government plainly that, as far as &#34;Western Australia is concerned - and I think the same would apply to South Australia - it w.ould be quite impossible for that State to bear &#39; one-half of the cost of any wheatstabilization scheme. Such action, if taken by the Government - I have no reason, other than the statement which appeared in the newspapers, to think that the Government would take such a step - would place on the weaker States a burden out&#39; of all proportion to tha.t imposed on wheat-growing States like Victoria and New South &#34;Wales, which have so many important secondary industries to draw upon. Western Australia and South Australia depend very largely for their prosperity and the employment of their people on good crops and good prices for their production. The wheatstabilization scheme is intended to ensure regular returns to growers who have suffered so much in recent years from drought, low prices, and other troubles. It would be ridiculous to ask the Governments of those States to share the cost of a, scheme which, we contend, is solely the responsibility of the Commonwealth. </para>

That was one reason why I and other honorable senators i of my party opposed that measure. I hope that history, which has an unfortunate habit of repeating itself, . will not do so on this occasion . I trust that the conference, over :which the Minister for . Commerce presided to-day, did not consider a scheme under which Western Australia and South Australia would be expected to provide one-half of the money necessary for what is wholly a Commonwealth responsibility. I hope, also, that the conference evolved a scheme that will ensure to the wheatgrowers of Australia a fair price for their production. </para>

In the circumstances it is desirable that. I should tell the Senate why there is urgent need for the adoption of a wellconsidered and complete federal scheme for the assistance of wheat-growers upon whom, as I have said, the prosperity of the smaller States solargely depends. The necessity for a sound policy for the stabilization of the wheat industry is engaging the attention of all sections of the people in Western Australia. -I have received a letter on this subject signed by a committee representative of the financial, industrial, commercial and manufacturing interests of Western Australia, and addressed to the Prime Minister on the8th June. This letter urges the adoption of a completely federal scheme, and contains no suggestion that the Statu Treasury should be liable for any portion of the costs, because it is held that this is a purely Commonwealth responsibility.

                        <para>I have received information from Sydney that the Farmers and Settlers Association have carried an alternative plan to the WilsonUppill proposals on the following lines: - </para>
                        <para>That the farmers should be guaranteed a price of 4s. per bushel for 6,000 bushels. </para>
                        <para>This alternative plan was carried by the executive of the Farmers and Settlers Association. Of course, the details in connexion with this plan are not available at the present time, but there should be no difficulty in working this out on a satisfactory basis. A  limita-tion  to 0,000 bushels at the price will, undoubtedly, be favorably received by the majority of growers, who are small farmers, while the- large speculative grower of big areasof wheat, though not benefiting to the same extent will receive considerable advantage by the implementation of such a plan in comparison with existing conditions. I would, therefore, be very grateful if you would use all thu activity you possibly can yourself, and also&#39; get the assistance of your confreres to back up this proposal. </para>

                <para>I know that, the Government has other schemes, as well as this one, under review, and I urge the Go;vernment to adopt whichever scheme it. considers will give the greatest measure of, justice to the whole of the. wheat-growers of Australia; but, whichever scheme is accepted, I repeat that it must be an entirely federal one, not dependent upon depleted State Treasuries  for any financial assistance. If the Government should be misled - and I do not think that it will be - into asking the poor State Treasuries to carry half of the financial burden of assisting the industry in these troublous times, I can only say that such action would be incomprehensible to me, and at variance with all that I know of the public, utterances of the Minister for Commerce and the Prime Minister on this subject. Passing the burden on to the States, which action the newspapers say is likely to be taken, would be regarded by the wheat-growers of Australia as a Commonwealth evasion of the whole problem of permanent assistance to the industry. </para>

                        <para>- Certainly before he entered this chamber. The deputation was introduced by the Leader of tire Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin),</inline> and comprised Messrs. Clark, A. Green, McHugh, Pollard and Scully, all of whom are members of the House of Representatives, and Senators Ashley, Cunningham, Clothier, Fraser and myself. The deputation requested the Prime&#39; Minister to devise a plan in co-operation with the States, to establish a wheat pool in order to guarantee to the farmer an assured price for five years. In this connexion, it was recommended that the price should be 3s. 6d. a bushel, plus freight at an average of 4&#163;d., a total of 3s.  10&#163;d.  It was urged that, in order to protect consumers, millers should be obliged to pay a set price for flour - regardless of any increase or decrease of the world wheat price - thus ensuring that the public would obtain bread at a reasonable figure. The plan, as recommended, also contemplated that, should there be an increase of the price of wheat above 3s. 10&#189;d., half of the increase should be set aside to enable the pool to repay advances made to it, or to build up a reserve fund, and the other half should be paid to growers. For &#34;example, should the world wheat price reach 4s. a bushel, there would be fd. to the growers - making 3s. Hid. - and fd. would be retained by the pool for the purposes mentioned. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The deputation urged that the scheme as a whole should be financed by the Commonwealth Bank, and guaranteed by the Commonwealth Government. It would be desirable to peg production, and each State would be guaranteed the price a bushel on a production yield to be decided. Should any State increase its production, then the guaranteed price would diminish according to the quantity by which that State exceeded its quota. </para>
                    <para>The deputation placed before the Prime Minister the fact that, not only were low prices a disability, but also high interest rates would have to be dealt with. Interest arrears were an important factor in the growth of the farmers&#39; debt structure. There should be national control of interest rates. </para>
                    <para>Briefly, the plan placed before the Prime Minister envisaged : - (1) Fixation of interest rates; (2) fixation of a wheat price within Australia. </para>
                    <para>Our representations have gone further than that. In February, 1930, the Scullin Government called a conference of wheat-growers at Canberra, which was attended by State Ministers and representatives of all political parties. As the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. P.</inline> G. Stewart, who was then the Country party member for Wimmera, said - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>The conference adopted proposals which were included in the Wheat Marketing Bill 1930. The object was to regulate the export and interstate trade in wheat and flour through a board to be controlled by wheat producers and known as the Australian Wheat Board. This bill, which was introduced on the 8th April, 1930, also provided a guaranteed price of 4s. a bushel, plus 8d. a bushel for rail freight, and other expenses. The Commonwealth Bank agreed to find the money, subject to the Commonwealth Government&#39;s guarantee. The bill passed through the House of Representatives, but was defeated in the Senate by three votes. Senators Johnston and Carroll, Country party members, voted against the measure. Yet <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> now claims that he has always been in favour of paying 4s. a bushel. </para>
                    <para>Many misleading statements have been made as to whether the Government had the assurance of the Commonwealth Bank Board that the bank would finance the scheme. On the 25th March, 1930, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Scullin)</inline> informed the House - </para>

At the same time, he suggested certain alterations to the schedule, in order that it might coincide with the conditions relating to finance set forth in the bank&#39;s memorandum. Those conditions were adjusted accordingly in the bill which the Government introduced. </para>
                    <para>Another conference was called in November, 1930, in response to urgent representations from members of Parliament and organizations of wheat-growers. A Wheat Advances Bill which was passed in December, 1930, provided for a.  guaranteed price of 3s. a bushel for wheat of f.ni.q., less handling charges. Tie money was to be found by the Commonwealth Bank upon a government guarantee. The bank authorities subsequently informed the Government that it could not constitution-ally advance money within the terms of that legislation. Its legal advisers had informed the bank that appropriation for that purpose would be unconstitutional. That information is contained in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> of the 12th March, 1931, page 264. Immediately upon receipt of the reply from the Commonwealth Bank, the Scullin Government arranged with the bank for art increase of its advances on- wheat from 2s. to 2s. 4d. a bushel f.o.b. That advance was made available to the voluntary pool of all unsold wheat on its hands. </para>
                    <para>In February, 1931, the Government decided to raise a loan of &#163;6,000,000 in order to assist the wheat industry by means .of an export bounty of 6d. a bushel, and to provide loans to the State governments for the help of farmers in necessitous circumstances. The Loan Council and the representatives of the States agreed to the proposals on the 7 th February, 1931. At its next meeting on the 26th February, the Loan Council expressed the view that an approach to the loan market at that time was inadvisable. </para>
                    <para>In March, 1931, the Government introduced a bill providing for a fiduciary notes issue, under which it proposed to raise the sum .of &#163;6,000,000, of which &#163;3,500,000 was for a wheat bounty at the rate of 6d. a bushel on three-fourths of thetotal quantity of wheat of the 1930-31 season sold or delivered for sale, and &#163;2,500,000 was to be allocated as a loan to the States for the assistance of necessitous wheat-growers. This bill was rejected by the Senate- On the 21st October, 1931, the Wheat Bounty Bill was introduced, and an advance of &#163;3,296,000 by way of a bounty of 4-Jd. a bushel, was paid to the growers. </para>
                    <para>It will be seen that the policy of the Labour party has always been to assist the wheat-growers, and I hope in future, that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> will remain: silent, on this subject.

                        - I shall deal first with the remarks of .
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan.-.</inline>
                        I point out that had the Senate passed the- bill providing for a guaranteed price of 4s.  a  bushel for wheat, plus 8d. charges, the. cost to the Commonwealth Government, on to-day&#39;s prices, would .-represent 18f -million pounds for an average crop of 160,000,000 bushels. It is not unfair to say that many of the promises made in- those days could never have been fulfilled. Had the price of wheat been  fixed  at 4s. -8d. a., bushel at ports, the country could not have met the cost. I suggest to those honor-able senators who wish to make- political capital out of the needs of the wheat-growers, that had that bill passed the Senate,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline>
                        would have had to reduce the old age pensions more than  he  was forced to do.
                    </para>
                    <para>No one has fought more consistently on behalf of the wheat-growers of Australia than has <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston.</inline> I assure him, and the Senate generally, that the Government is .very much alive to the seriousness of the problem that confronts&#39; not only the wheat-growers, but also many other persons engaged in rural industries in Australia. On the day following the swearing-in of- the present Ministry, the first problem that it tackled was associated with wheat. Since then <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McBride</inline> and I have considered at least 50 proposals. We.aTe still giving the matter serious consideration.- Perhaps the greatest problem associated with , the industry is the fact that while costs are almost  at  a record peak, prices are lower than ever before. In addition, restrictions on wheat importation have been imposed by overseas countries. -This subject was discussed only to-day at a meeting of the Australian&#39; Agricultural Council. The Government -realizes the importance of the wheat industry and the&#39; seriousness of the problem .confronting it. It knows that when the country&#39;s rural industries are affected, .the workers in the metropolitan districts suffer also. The Government has not yet come to adecision on this subject, and it will not do so until after it confers with the Premiers of the six States on Wednesdaynext. At the moment, I am - not in a position to say what scheme will be adopted, or what price will he fixed. I hope that next week the Premiers will come to a decision which will be acceptable to the people of Australia. In considering this problem, honorable senators should realize the serious financial strain imposed by the- Government&#39;s defence programme, which will cost &#163;78,000,000 in the next three years. The several points raised will receive further consideration by the Assistant Minister for Commerce and myself before a decision is reached. </para>
