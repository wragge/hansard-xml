                            <para>- I looked into this matter very carefully when in Darwin  a  few weeks ago, and I also discussed it with the Minister for Defence. I understand that the Department of the Navy was looking well ahead and had in mind certain land that might be required  for  future use, but it is not intended to make further resumptions in Darwin, as there is ample Crown land available for all purposes. </para>

The rules on the back of the question paper are for the guidance of honorable senators and contain these words, " Questions 'Should not contain inferences or imputations ". </para>

                            <para>. - I am not rising to speak on this motion in response to the challenge made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> last night, who said that it was the responsibility of the supporters of the Government to reply to some of the arguments adduced by the Opposition. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings),</inline> who delivered one of his eloquent speeches,  was must emphatic. As usual he paused for breath at the conclusion of some of his well-formed phrases as much as to say. " That puts the lid on that ". He was followed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey,</inline> who gave us the benefit of his ideas with regard to financial problems, and admitted that we had., heard them previously. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> followed with his customary plea regarding unemployment and other problems, and he even went further afield than usual by referring to industrial conditions in Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> made a eulogistic reference to the remarks of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey;</inline> but, before he concluded his speech, he was unkind enough to fire at <inline font-weight="bold">Senator -Darcey</inline> a question which the advocates of social credit can never answer. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>We are now dealing with the annual budget, and unfortunately we are doing it, under war conditions. It is 21 years since the last wartime budget was presented, and we all hope that a further period of at least similar length will elapse before this Parliament is called upon to discuss another. This preliminary balance-sheet indicates merely what may be expected to be the financial position at the end of the ensuing year. At a meeting of shareholders on one occasion, one  speaker  declared that there were three kinds of untruths - white lies, black lies, and balance-sheets. In the present case, however, I think that it will be agreed that the budget contains an honest forecast by the Government. Under the most favorable circumstances, budgets are liable to serious alterations that cannot be foreseen by the framers, owing to changes in seasonal conditions; but, in this instance, we have no doubt that supplementary provision will have to be made in the near future. The old saying that finance is government and government is finance is as true to-day as ever it. was. For generations, the British Dominions have obtained their finances for governmental purposes by means of taxation or loans, or by both, whilst the taxpayers' financial resources have mainly been derived from services rendered. For the convenience of the public, banks and other financial institutions have been found necessary adjuncts to the life of the community, and 98 per cent, of the charges levelled against them of acting contrary to the public interest are without foundation. Bank profits are not nearly so lucrative as those of many industrial trading companies, such as Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited and the motor body building industry. </para>
                    <para>We have heard some criticism of Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited, although it is the most outstanding industrial organization in the southern hemisphere. It provides a great deal of employment, and its record for the utilization of Australia's natural resources and for the conversion of raw material into finished articles at prices that defy world competition is most commendable. Only a few days ago a striking instance was furnished of the value of this organization to the people of Australia. Our New Zealand neighbours, requiring a great deal of iron and steel, contracted with Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited for the necessary supplies. After one shipment had been forwarded to the dominion, a quibble arose with regard to payment. The New Zealand buyers became indignant, and decided to open negotiations with firms on the other side of the world, but they discovered that the prices overseas were 100 per cent, higher than those charged by the Australian company. That is a great tribute to this comparatively young organization. </para>
                    <para>Much has been heard in this chamber regarding the extension of credit. "We all realize that probably before long it will be almost imperative to avail ourselves of a credit extension in Australia, but it would be unsafe at this juncture to put into operation what is glibly referred to as social credit, a system which I prefer to describe as one involving the getting of something for nothing. A few days ago, and again yesterday, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> took honorable senators on this side of the chamber to task for their apparent levity in having the audacity even to smile when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> addressed the Senate on social credit. </para>

I remind <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> that we had heard all about social credit long before his advent to this chamber. It is not new to us. Honorable senators, generally, have studied the literature on the subject and have passed their private judgment upon it. Should any honorable senator hesitate to resolve this matter for himself he has only to examine the failure of social credit wherever it has been applied. We know of Alberta's experience, for instance. </para>

                                <para>- I agree that Germany's adoption of a scheme of social credit has been to our detriment insofar as it has been the main cause of the present war. That system has brought ruin to Germany, which has resorted to what is international highway robbery. Germany spoke about recovering sections of its people lost to it in the last war, but it is obvious that that has not been the reason for German aggression. We know how Germany has treated the Jews. But Germany took fine care not to allow the. Jews to take their money and valuables with them when they were driven from the country. Undoubtedly, Germany's adoption of social credit has been mainly responsible for the present war. </para>

                        <para>Honorable senators opposite suggest that it would be an easy matter to extend credit along the lines they propose. They say that the Prime Minister need only give a direction to the Commonwealth Bank in order to put their scheme into operation. But the task is not so easy as that. The Prime Minister could not provide for the extension of credit advocated by honorable senators opposite without taking legislative action. </para>

On their own showing, therefore, despite <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey's</inline> interjection, it would appear that the Government has not the power to exercise that control over the Commonwealth Bank which they have advocated. In addition to the verdict of the electors in 1934 that, the Commonwealth Bank should be kept free from political control, we had another potent reminder of the dangers of government intervention in commerce and finance in our experience with the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers.

                        <para class="block">Prime Minister of Australia made up his mind to purchase a shipping line. He did not hesitate or consult any one as to whether he should do so or not. He purchased the ships in London at a cost of £3,000,000, and honorable senators are aware of the history of that venture. Surely we do not want to repeat that disastrous experience. Honorable senators opposite have asked why it is that money is so plentiful in a time of war, whereas in peace we cannot find sufficient for our requirements. The answer to that question is obvious. In private life when we are faced with an emergency in the home, when, perhaps, the health or life of a member of the family is at stake, no one hesitates, even at the risk of beggaring himself, to do everything possible to overcome difficulties. I submit that the position is much the same when the life of a nation is threatened. In a time of crisis the  people  instinctively rise to every sacrifice required of them in order to save their nation. </para>
                        <para>I trust that we shall profit from the lessons of the last war, particularly insofar as they emphasized the value of trade within the Empire. I do not know why we do not consolidate the finances of the Empire. We want, not lip service, but, a permanent agreement of a more comprehensive nature than the Ottawa Agreement. I take my mind back to a time, not long ago, when the Lyons Government was subjected ito a great deal of abuse in connexion with a trade agreement entered into between it and the Government of Japan. People asked why the wool-growers of .this country should be subjected to such treatment. I now ask the people who then complained whether they are glad that Australia is an ally of Great Britain, rather than Japan ? </para>

                                <para>- <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> expressed his opinions on internal and external borrowing. Having studied this subject for a number of years I do not altogether agree with the honorable senator. I am not . certain that a policy of borrowing within the Empire would not be of benefit to Australia. Whenever an internal loan is floated, persons who have money available for investment put it into the loan, and then sit back and do a little gardening. Were i; not for the opportunity to invest in such loan, they would have to put their money into industry. During the last few years the Government has borrowed from the people of Australia many millions of pounds. I am of the opinion that if half of that money had gone into industry or been used for the development of this  country, we should be much better off to-day. </para>

                        <para>I assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> that I am prepared to accept my share of the responsibility for the unemployment that exists in Australia. I sympathize with the honorable senator in <inline font-style="italic">having Jio</inline> represent Victoria in view of the deplorable conditions which he said exist under the present administration. A few weeks ago a conference of Premiers met to discuss the wheat industry. Many of us hoped that that would be the last conference on subject, but the Premiers of Victoria and Tasmania would not . agree to the stabilization proposals submitted by the Commonwealth, and consequently the scheme fell through. In view of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron's</inline> remarks yesterday as to the number of unemployed in Victoria. I cannot follow the reasoning of the Premier of that State, that it is the responsibility of the national Government to find money to assist the wheat industry, and that he could not allow any of the loan money allocated to his State to  be used for that purpose because ii was needed for public works. Under the scheme submitted to the Premiers, Victoria would have had to find about £300,000 to assist the wheat-growers of Australia. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan</inline> said that he wanted money to keep men in employment. Even if he had £300,000 available for a public works programme, approximately one- third of that sum would be expended in the purchase of materials, leaving only about £200,000 to assist, the unemployed. With that amount he could give employment at the basic wage to 1,000 men for twelve months. I suggest, however, that if the Commonwealth Government had made an arrangement to pay Australian farmers 3s. a bushel for their wheat, the wheat-growers of Victoria, instead of employing 1,000 men for twelve months on the basic wage, would have been able to employ  at least 4,000 for the same period. Therefore, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dunstan</inline> '"s reasoning is all wrong. </para>

                            <para>.- Notwithstanding forecasts in the newspapers of a welcome announcement that the Government proposes to call up three times the number of militia forces originally intended, and to double the period of camp training, the concensus of opinion outside governmental and departmental circles is that the numbers and the period should still further be increased. In these strenuous times one hesitates to criticize even mildly those responsible for our home defence preparations. The Cabinet, the Minister 50/ Defence, and the army authorities arc carrying a heavy burden, but the thinking public, not the panicky section, believe that the Government is not. moving fast enough. It is in this Parliament that their anxiety can best be expressed. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                        <para>The reason for the Government's  policy  of treading warily, in the opinion of outsiders, is the danger of economic dislocation. That dislocation has to be faced and overcome sooner or later. What the nation is looking for eventually, is its man-power ready and conversant with its duties, in the three defence services. With 40 years' military service, including two wars, I know what is necessary as far as the Army is concerned. Tn fact, every man who took part in the Great War knows full well what number of trained personnel is required. We arc <inline font-style="italic">n</inline> long  way from that objective. The foundation, upon which an Australian home defence army can be created, has been in existence for many years. Tha Militia is that foundation. Over the yon rs. a nucleus of staffs, regimental officers, non-commissioned officers and  specialists  have been trained for what has now happened - the necessity to defend this Commonwealth. Pacts between nations are made and broken over night. Japan's neutrality is ambiguous. No one can accurately foretell what the new year has in store for us. Only divine intervention or a miracle can restore the world to normality. </para>
                        <para>Nothing would give the people of this country a greater feeling of confidence and composure, than an official announcement that a trained home defence force, equal in numbers to the Australian Imperial Force, is the Government's objective. Honorable senators should not think for one moment that I am visualizing an expeditionary overseas force. I have already said in this chamber that the despatch of such a force, voluntarily enlisted, is a remote possibility. No government would dare denude this country of its virile manhood unless some extraordinary developments warranted such action. No one can foretell what the future has in store for us. I, for one, would not stampede the Government into doing what the Opposition, for political reasons, imagines will be done. Our defence problem is different altogether from that of New Zealand or any other dominion. </para>
                        <para>The Opposition, always so keen on adequate home defence, ought to throw its entire weight behind the building up of the Militia, now numbering 75,000, to a strength of 400,000 as well trained as our economic life permits. The first step is the combing out of this 75,000 all who are below active service medical standard, and all who are engaged in essential industries concerned with the defence of the Commonwealth. That combing out would, I venture to say, reduce the militia strength by one-third. The gaps in the ranks would soon be filled. The time has now arrived for the appointment of a Commander-in-Chief in order to relieve the Military Board of a great measure of its responsibilities in the matter of training and administration. So vast is the board's administrative functions that it cannot carry on effectively. The scheme of command districts recently authorized, but not yet in full operation, is a step in the right direction. In peace times these militia commands can function reasonably well, but when called into ramp for longer war-time periods of training, as is now being done, a coordinating authority is essential. A Commander-in-Chief with a small staff chosen from the many highly trained staff corps officers who, at present, spend too much time in office chairs, should be that authority. One officer stands out as eminently fitted for that position. I refer to Lieutenant-General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Brudenell</inline> White, who was responsible for the Australian Imperial Force's great reputation. He is the man who prepared the plans for evacuating the Australian Imperial Force from Gallipoli in the presence of the enemy, with only one casualty - a sprained ankle. He <inline font-style="italic">is</inline> at present holding a high position in the commercial world. He will shortly be 63 years of age, but it does not matter that he is over the regulation age of 62 years. The Government and the Defence Department are making a huge mistake in substituting youth for experience in these critical days. Such an appointment would allay the fears in the public mind and lighten the burden of the Minister for Defence. Honorable senators must bear in mind that the staffs, regimental officers, non-commissioned officers, and specialists, who have given so much of their leisure hours in past years, at no inconsiderable personal expense, represent only one-twentieth of the numbers needed on a war footing. There are hundreds of ex-service personnel who could, with a fortnight's " brush-up ", supply this deficiency. It does not matter if they are a year or two over the prescribed age, so long as they are medically fit. Their experience will be invaluable. Meanwhile, the services of these men in country centres could be made use of at no expense to impart elementary instruction at convenient centres at week-ends. These veterans of the Great War are straining at the leash to do something for the younger generation who, when called up as they undoubtedly must be, will have, if this opportunity be given to them, some knowledge at any rate of what is required of them before their intensive camp training begins. Possibly the Defence Department has in mind some such plan for the local instruction by war veterans and the skilled members of civilian rifle clubs. I do not know if it has, but it is time that such a plan was put into operation. </para>

                            CUNNINGHAM  (Western Australia; [3-54]. - We should all realize that the budget which we are now discussing has been presented under most unusual conditions. Many issues which will be submitted for our consideration before this financial year closes will need very serious attention, not only by the Government but also by every member of the Federal Parliament. Finance has been a live question for some years past, and it deserves special consideration at this juncture. During the past months the workers' representatives in Australia have been asking the Government for money to provide more employment, requests have been made by primary producers for funds to tide them over the crisis that has prevailed for a considerable time, and numerous other requests how been presented concerning the housing of the Australian people; but on every occasion we have been told that money could not be provided for such purposes. We must face these issues. To-day money is being found and additional sums will also be provided for defence purposes. The public mind is agitated by the fact that when we are faced with a war, finance, whether  Ave  term it money, credit or currency, can be provided, and yet for the purpose of stimulating industry and trade, and establishing those avenues of employment that are so essential to the people, money cannot be provided. A tremendous alteration must take place, not only in Australia, but also throughout the world. For some years past there have been requests throughout the civilized world for monetary reform, and new methods have been adopted in various countries. We were told to-day that Germany, by adapting a system of social credit, has brought its position to such a state of chaos that it is now at war with Britain, France and Poland. In Australia we are confronted with a great crisis, and, whether we like it or not, we shall have to face up to the position and lay our plans accordingly. When the present conflict is over, Australia will have to meet the huge responsibility of placing men beck into industry and plans must now be laid accordingly. But we cannot plan unless we are in a position to know that the- necessary finance will ba available. Every thinking man and woman in Australia knows that enormous war expenditure will be incurred ; but when the war comes to an end, the expenditure on the production of munitions will cease. We cannot allow a condition of stalemate to prevail. Wc should now be considering this problem which is so vital to Australia. We should now be planning to place men in industry when the war

                            over and to carry on the affairs of the nation in the interests of the people. I do not care what system of monetary reform be adopted, provided that it will serve the needs of the nation. The members of the Opposition have attempted to throw some light upon this subject, and honorable senators opposite should give some lead us' to the remedial measures x to be adopted in order to bring about an alteration for the good of the people. I remind honorable senators that when
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Roosevelt</inline>
                            was elected  President  of the United States of America he was faced with a national crisis; there were bankruptcies from one end of the country to the other. No fewer than 13.000 banks had crashed under the financial system then in operation. The credits made available by the banks by way of overdrafts and other orthodox methods of finance had caused the crash, but Roosevelt immediately used the credit of the American nation and started a system whereby people were able to obtain work and industry was able to flourish.  His  methods were criticized, and he was told that in sending huge parcels of " greenbacks " to various centres, to rehabilitate business h« had invoked unorthodox methods of finance, but trade started to flow and the country was resurrected. It was reported in the newspapers that Roosevelt's methods were failing, and that the people throughout the American States were fearful of another crash ; but we were not informed that those in opposition to the new method were those who were responsible for the crash which had previously occurred. Roosevelt is still in control, and the position in the United States of America is much better than when he was elected. We cannot continue to support the .policy which has been in operation for the last ten years. Prior to 1929, there was unprecedented prosperity, following the termination of the last war, but shortly after that there was a general financial collapse throughout the civilized world, which was brought about largely as a result of the credit system that had operated in all countries during the war period. In Western Australia prior to the declaration of war, unemployment was at. least as great as in the first and second years of the depression. Action rather than talk is needed concerning the flow of credit that is necessary if the wealth of Australia is to be utilized to the best advantage.
                        </para>
                        <para>Latent wealth is not being used to-day, because, owing to the control of credits, people are not in a position to carry on industries that would prove beneficial to the country. The majority of businesses, large and small, are carried on with the aid of bank overdrafts. Even some of our largest manufacturing and commercial undertakings are conducted under a system of overdrafts arranged between the banking institutions and the captains of industry. Overdrafts, as agreed to by the banks, must be taken by those who need credits to enable them to carry on their businesses. It may be truly said that this country is governed by overdrafts. Irrespective of what methods of finance governments adopt, they work on overdrafts, because only with the consent of the established banking institutions are credits made available. I believe that at least 50 per cent. of the men representing the people in the various parliaments of Australia are connected with business undertakings that are operated by means of overdrafts. This is a state of affairs that should be altered, because the banks control, not only the functions of all governments, but also the very livelihood of the parliamentary representatives of the people. The banks, therefore, control the Governments of the Commonwealth and of the States. By their control over industries they can force business men to contract their activities, or bring about a reduction of their capital outlay. They can call on the representatives of the people to make adjustments of their overdrafts, because these are at call from time to time. </para>
                        <para>Would it not. be much better to utilize that which the people own, namely, the credit of the nation ? This credit is used by the banks to-day for their own backing, but they pay nothing for it. </para>

This labour ' produces  about  £700,000,000 worth of goods per annum, and that is the basis of the credit of the nation. What brings about faith and confidence in our currency credit is not the mere fact that stone, brick or concrete buildings  are  occupied by banks. The flimsy things called bank-notes are, of themselves, worth nothing. They derive their value from their backing, which is the wealth-producing ability of the people  from  year to year.

                            <para>- Yes, but  even  that bank was not controlled by the people of New South Wales. The savings banks in all of the States, and the  very  premises in which they function, are dove-tailed into the financial system operated by the banking companies in Australia. That is why it was easily possible to strangle the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales when that was deemed necessary because a government of a certain political colour was in office in that State. </para>

We could use the backing of the nation, but, as was pointed out by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> last night, the present Leader of the Federal Country party <inline font-weight="bold">(Sir Earle Page),</inline> when Treasurer in a former government, declared that the banks had taken to themselves the power to use credits belonging to the people. That is an absolute truth, and.  the position must be altered. Every honorable senator knows well that the monetary system  must  be changed, because it has failed. </para>

                                <para>- Included among that number, perhaps, is an army of young men who have been employed on relief work, but, having no security of tenure, were not happy and contented. They lacked an assured outlook. Why do so few young men and young women marry to-day ? The reason is that they regard marriage as too heavy a responsibility for them to undertake, when they have no prospect of earning a reasonable living or of securing a home for themselves. Thousands of them have never had an opportunity to save sumcient money to provide for a home, because they have merely had intermittent employment on relief work. We should be evolving a system under which, when a lad leaves school at the age of fourteen oi- sixteen years, his training would be continued by serving an apprenticeship, or by being placed in some calling or profession so that he could qualify to render service to the community, and secure for himself a decent living. That is our responsibility. It is not sufficient to point to the fact that we have elementary schools, secondary schools and universities, and that the children of the people may enter those institutions and acquire certain educational qualifications. Unless avenues of employment are made available to them, we shall fail in our duty to them. Many young men have taken various courses of study for the purpose of qualifying themselves for occupations better than those they now follow, with the result that there is a surplus of young men trained for various professions. Lads who have passed through the University of Perth have been forced to drift into the mining industry and wield a shovel. We shall not make the best use of our system of education unless the services of the scholars are used to the best advantage of the nation. We can do that only by providing employment. We have been told that a certain sum of money has been made available for the vocational training of youths, but what is the use of doing that when the youths, on completing their course, find themselves unable to secure a job? To solve this problem we must plan employment; we must plan our economy in order to build up our industries. Australia is a rich country. It has huge supplies of raw material, and, in addition, our people are progressive. In this respect their spirit is unrivalled. In our brief history we have accomplished wonderful things. We are a virile race, and our people only need the opportunity to develop this country fully, and to do their share towards raising the world to a higher plane. In order to do that, however, we must alter the present monetary system, which has proved a failure. </para>

I am not concerned whether our token of currency be notes or cheques or anything else. All I wish to do is to loosen the grip which the private banks now have upon the credit resources of the nation. So long as credit, is restricted through the influence of private financial institutions, those institutions will continue to receive their profits, while many of our people will be obliged to remain workless.

                                <para>- It can be clone. This Government should not restrict the activities of the Commonwealth Bank in order to enable private financial institutions to tie up the nation's credit. Are we merely to give way to hopelessness and say that we cannot solve this problem? As representatives of the people must we not endeavour to solve our economic difficulties, and do all we can to build up the nation's assets? That is our business as parliamentarians, and if we are bankrupt of ideas we might just as well not be here. </para>

                        <para>This Government has had ample opportunity to help the wheat industry in its present difficulty. I am aware of the proposal of the British Government to purchase our surplus wheat. But has the Commonwealth Government really done anything to help the industry through its present crisis ? <inline font-weight="bold">Senator J</inline> ames McLachlan referred to the deadlock which arose at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, when Victoria refused to agree to the Commonwealth's plan. The other States accepted that plan in sheer desperation, because they could see no other way out of the difficulty. The stabilization of the price for wheat, in order to enable the industry to survive, is the responsibility of the Commonwealth. Wheat is grown in every State, including Tasmania. Any difficulties which may arise in respect of marketing can be overcome by State action, but naturally the States cannot afford to reduce their proposed loan expenditure on public works for the purpose of financing the wheat crop. I have no doubt that the Commonwealth Government could have secured all of the money required to provide a stabilized price for wheat. </para>

                                <para>- From the Commonwealth Bank. We should willingly have agreed to legislation to enable the Government to indemnify the bank against any loss that might occur. The Prime Minister knew quite well that the money needed could have been provided in that way, but he made no such offer to the States. It cannot be said, therefore, that this Government has fulfilled its promise to the wheat-growers of Australia. When the Prime Minister made his first pronouncement on this problem, he did not say that any financial assistance by the Commonwealth would be contingent upon the States shouldering some portion of that responsibility. </para>

Instead, he asked the States to trim their public works programmes in order that they might be able to divert some of their  loan money for this purpose. This Government, and this Parliament, have a tremendous responsibility to assist the wheat industry. Any legislation introduced for the purpose of doing justice to the wheat-growers will receive the full support of members of the Labour party. We make that promise definitely. </para>

                            <para>. - I congratulate the Government upon the accuracy of its Estimates for the last financial year. The budget papers reveal that the figures of actual expenditure agreed with the Estimates as near as was reasonably possible. The Estimates for last financial year were more accurate than those submitted for several years past. I support the suggestion put forward by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> for the intensification of the training of the man-power of Australia. We do not know what part Australia will be obliged to play in the defence of the Empire, but whatever that part may be, it is essential that we take immediate steps to train our men as fully as possible. I congratulate the Government upon the methods by which it proposes to raise the additional revenue required to meet commitments arising out of the present crisis. By levying an additional tax on beer the Government has taxed a luxury item. All honorable senators will agree that that commodity can stand a proportion of the burden associated with the defence of this country. The same may be said of the other excise duties. Every effort has been made to maintain the principle of ability to pay, and to spread the burden in a manner which will cause the least injury to the community. </para>

                            referred to wheat stabilization. The failure of the stabilization plan was due not so much to financial difficulties as to the problem of control of production. Had the Government of Victoria agreed to take the action necessary to prevent the stabilization scheme from getting out of hand through an increase of production, the financial difficulties could have been overcome; but that Government refused to accept not, only any financial responsibility for the scheme but also any responsibility for the control of production. It would, therefore, have been possible for the farmers of Victoria t« smash any stabilization scheme, by increasing their production, and consequently adding to the financial responsibility of the scheme. However, many of the difficulties which existed at the time of the Premiers Conference have now been removed. At that time, the powers of the Commonwealth Government were definitely limited ; but, following the declaration of war and the passing of the national security legislation, the Commonwealth now has powers which are limited only by Section 92 of the Constitution. It is now within the power of the Commonwealth to implement a stabilization scheme under which it can provide the necessary safeguards against a possible increase of production. As the war continues, it may be found necessary, in the interests of Empire defence, either to increase production or hold production at its present level instead of decreasing it. But whatever is found necessary, the Commonwealth is now vested with complete power to control the situation. In my opinion, a mere increase of price does not absolve the Commonwealth Government from the responsibility of introducing a plan to stabilize the wheat industry, and give to farmers the security that they so urgently need. For years their outlook has been almost hopeless. After a period of record low prices, their hopes were raised by high prices for a year or two, only to have those hopes again dashed to the ground by successive years of low prices. Then the farmers saw governments taking an interest in their problem. Farmers, standing solidly together in their demand for wheat stabilization, saw commerce and  industry urging governments to implement immediately plans for the stabilization of wheat prices. I submit that never before lias there- been such a united demand for any legislation as there has been during ibc last twelve months for action to stabilize the price of wheat. There have been differences of opinion as to price and method, but there has been no difference of opinion as to the need for stabilization. The farmers ask, and other sections of the community agree, that the wheatgrowers are entitled to the same security and the same standard of living as is  enjoyed  by persons who are engaged in other industries. Now that there is a possibility of an increase of wheat prices, 1 ask the Government not to shelve this problem and leave the farmers in a state of insecurity, but to take action now to provide a permanent plan of stabilization. If, as the result of the purchase by Great  Britain  of a large proportion of Australia's crop, wheat reaches a payable price, the Government should not therefore abandon its proposals for wheat stabilization. In that event the financial requirements would be less, and the safeguards which the Commonwealth Government ?;iw fit to propose to the Premiers Conference and which it did not then have the power to impose, could be imposed by the action of the Commonwealth Government alone, so that its task would be easier. Never before has the time been more opportune for the introduction of a plan of wheat stabilization, and never before has the Commonwealth Government had greater power to bring in a scheme.

                                <para>- I think that the figure which the royal commission found was the cost of producing wheat, namely 3s 6d. a bushel at ports, is as nearly a correct price as pan be ascertained. The proposal of the Commonwealth Government, namely, a minimum of 3s. 4d. a  bushel  at ports, was, in my opinion, reasonable. From my discussions with hundreds of farmers in almost every part nf South Australia. T learned that farmers  generally  are prepared to accept a  stabilization  plan based upon a minimum penalization price of 3». 4d. a bushel. </para>

                                <para>- No. The object of a stabilization plan is to give a payable price to producers. Whatever the number of bushels produced by any wheat farmer, the need for a payable price is just as great. It would be a mistaken policy to help only the small growers and to allow the larger growers gradually to become bankrupt, and then, when they, too, became small growers, try to rehabilitate them in the industry. Every person is entitled to a payable price for his product. Stabilization means not charity, but giving to every producer a fair return for his labour. Therefore, I urge the Commonwealth Government to keep wheat stabilization in the forefront of its policy, and to exercise the powers that it undoubtedly now has in order to implement a stabilization scheme, while providing such safeguards against overproduction as it thinks necessary. </para>

It would appear that some honorable senators believe that past governments have not made use of the credit of the nation. There are three ways in which governments can obtain money: first, by imposing taxes; secondly, by borrowing; and, thirdly, by inflation, expansion of the currency, social credit, or community credit - whatever name we like to give to it. </para>

Credit expansion can be free of cost to the Government, but it certainly is not free of cost to the community.

                                <para>- During the last war the then government adopted extensively the three methods that I have mentioned in order to obtain money ; it taxed heavily, it borrowed extensively ; and, through the issue of treasury-bills, it extended credit. Whether a treasury-bill is made subject to interest, or is free of interest, is immaterial; the issue of such a bill by the Government is undoubtedly an expansion of credit. When treasury bills, or notes, are issued, the currency of the people is diluted, but no more wealth is created. All that happens is that the value of the tokens of exchange is depreciated. </para>

                                <para>- I do not know what their position would be. I have told the Senate what happens when treasury-bills are issued. Immediately additional notes are placed in circulation, an indirect tax is imposed upon the holder of every note. Simply because the tax is an indirect one, its effect is not immediately noticeable. Therefore, it is a popular way of raising money.I think, however, that most of us remember what happened after the last war, when the day of reckoning came. The credit expansion which had taken place during the four years of the conflict forced up all prices, and when the crash came this country paid very dearly. </para>

                        <para>I do not wish it to be thought for one moment that I subscribe to the proposition that governments cannot obtain money in this way free of cost to themselves. I entirely agree with the statement in paragraph 504 of the report of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems, that by utilizing the Commonwealth Bank the Government can obtain interest-free money in this way. But I agree also with the further statement in the report that there are limits beyond which it is not safe to go. In other words, there are limits to the height to which prices should be allowed to rise. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> would read and study carefully the paragraphs following paragraph 504, he would realize that the authority which he cites for his proposal also utters a word of warning and suggests a definite limit to the policy of credit expansion. </para>
                        <para>I have not the slightest doubt that during the war which, unfortunately, is now in progress, the Government will be compelled to resort to credit expansion in order to obtain portion of the money which it will require. But I am quite sure that it will take this course with its eyes wide open. </para>

                        <para>I hope that I have made my position clear on this topic of credit expansion. It is not a new theory. It has been practised by governments for hundreds of years.It is immaterial whether a government issues treasury-bills subject to the payment of11/2 per cent. interest, or whether they are issued free of interest. The only object of issuing treasury-bills subject to interest charge is to place some safeguard against using this easy money too freely, vo the detriment of the community. </para>

                                <para>-  The honorable senator said a little while ago that 3s. 4d. a bushel was a fair price for wheat. What does- he think should be done with wheatgrowers who, according to the royal commission which inquired into that industry, are unable to grow wheat profitably at 5s. a bushel? </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator is correct. This Government, through its flour tax legislation, has provided £500,000 a year for the assistance of primary producers in marginal areas. Unfortunately, some farmers working on good land are unable to produce wheat profitably at 5s. a bushel. Those producers must go out of the industry, because we must put this country on an economic basis. </para>

                        <para>In his remarks this afternoon, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> conveyed the impression that the Militia Forces were drawn chiefly from the ranks of the unemployed. The honorable gentleman is wrong. Members of the Militia are composed of average Australian citizens - some young men of independent means, some in lucrative employment, some in poorly  paid  clerical positions, some unemployed and some men on the basic wage. All sections of the community are represented,  and  all have offered to serve their country; so it is quite wrong to suggest  that  the Militia Forces are composed largely of unemployed persons.  Within  the last three weeks, in the  militia  unit of 100 to which I belong, a call  was  made for those who were unemployed to take permanent positions that were being provided by the Defence Department. Only two stepped out from  the  ranks, showing clearly that, with the exception of those two, every member of the unit was engaged in some productive occupation. </para>

                            <para>. - In this debate sufficient has been said already concerning the Government's defence and financial proposals, so I shall refrain from saying anything on those subjects.  The  attitude of the Opposition has been fully stated  by  previous speakers. I have always held the opinion that equipment.  for the Militia Forces in the various States should be provided in those States. In this way, something could be done for the unemployed. The adoption of this policy would help to benefit the State of Western Australia, which I assist to represent in this chamber. The whole of the clothing and boots for the Militia Forces in that State could be manufactured there. The Albany Woollen Mills Limited recently fulfilled a £3,000 contract for the supply of clothing for the Militia, but I believe that no further orders have been placed with that company, the reason no doubt being that the larger manufacturers in the eastern States can manufacture at slightly lower costs, though I feel sure that costs would not be lower if freight from the eastern States to Western Australia were taken into account. Last year a new firm, the Estate Engineering Company, was established in Perth to manufacture conduit piping. It now complains of undercutting by the Western Australia Electrical Dealers Association. It states that when it started manufacturing conduit piping last year, the Western Australia Electrical Dealers Association was distributing conduit piping to the trade at l1s. a 100 feet. To-day it is selling at7s. a 100 feet, with a rebate of 6d. a 100 feet conditional on the buyer purchasing all conduit from members of the association. The product of the Estate Engineering Company is second to none, but its competitors in the eastern States are now trying to drive it off the market. </para>

                        <para>It is gratifying to learn that the Government proposes to appoint price-fixing authorities in the various States. When I was a member of the Western Australian Parliament a majority of the members of the House of Assembly supported a proposal for the appointment of a price-fixing board, but the scheme was rejected by the Legislative Council. As a member of the business community in Western Australia, I found that price-fixing authorities were controlling the sale of commodities to the disadvantage of consumers, and I trust that this Government will give full effect to the policy which it has outlined, and inflict heavy penalties upon those who are endeavouring to exploit the people. The rationing of necessary commodities should also be undertaken by the same authority, so that profiteering, which was carried on so extensively during the last war to the detriment of the Australian people and particularly the workers, may be prevented. All the States should be placed on an equal basis, and under a complete price-fixing scheme no State could enjoy an advantage over other States, as happened during the last war. </para>

                        <para>Should the present war continue it may be necessary to transport troops from New South Wales to Western Australia or vice versa, but it is not difficult to imagine the confusion that would occur in transporting, say, 25,000 men over a railway system in which there are several breaks of gauge. I understand that it would take approximately two months to transport a complete division from New South Wales to Western Australia. The standardization of our railway gauges should be commenced immediately. Work could also be provided by duplicating some of our more important railway lines, and in constructing additional roads and bridges. The Commonwealth and State Governments should co-operate, particularly in the construction of roads, which could serve as feeders to the railways. We have been informed that the volume of cargo carried between Sydney and Melbourne by water is seven times greater than that transported by rail, due probably to the fact that the break of gauge between those two cities causes undue delay and expense. </para>
                        <para>The Government should also assist those engaged in ship construction in Australia. Some small vessels are built in New South Wales and in Victoria, and motor boats which are used in conjunction with seaplanes have been built in Western Australia. As Australian manufacturers are now producing many commodities which were not manufactured in Australia during the last war, the Government should adopt a more definite policy to assist shipbuilding. In May of this year the Government called tenders for the construction of a motor vessel to be used in the New Guinea trade, but the contract has not yet been let and the deposit of £25 paid by one tenderer is still retained. A manufacturer of socks in Subiaco, Western Australia submitted a tender to the Defence Department some time ago, but the department has retained the deposit and has failed to notify him of the acceptance of a tender. It is pleasing to note that our wool and wheat-growers and our manufacturers of foodstuffs will probably experience better times in the near future than they have for a considerable period, but I regret that the favorable prospects are due to war conditions. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> spoke at length regarding the needs of the wheatgrowers.

Twenty five years ago the Australian community found itself faced with disturbance of trade, and industry was dislocated. As the result of the experience of the last war, Australia is now manufacturing the great bulk of the commodities needed by the people. Valuable work is being carried out by the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research. It should investigate the possibility of establishing new industries in Western Australia, such as the production of cotton. I should welcome co-operation on the part of Western Australia, South Australia, Tasmania, and possibly Queensland, with a view to the expansion of secondary industries in those States.

Bearing these three principles in mind, we must try to ensure that industry is kept going, and its claims respected. A nation is created by family life, religion and tradition. It is made up of the hearts of mothers, the wisdom of fathers and the joys of children. In Australia we pride ourselves on our progressiveness and initiative. This is a country in which democratic rule should prove more beneficial than in any other part of the world.

                                <para>- I claim that it is an interpretation which any reasonable person would place upon the honorable senator's remarks. He said that the reason why money could be obtained readily in time of war was that it was required for the defence of the nation. 1 submit that during times of depression, when theusands are homeless and witheut a job, their welfare should be just as important to us as is the property of the wealthy people who should to-day offer their money for the defence of this country. If the wealthy class considers that our democratic rights are at stake, why should not we. uphold the democratic rights of those who suffered during the depression, when funds were not made available to a sufficient extent to help them out of their distress? It is easy to obtain money in time of war for destructive purposes, but hard to get it in time of peace for reproductive work. That is my reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan,  and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson.</inline></para>

The reply given was that at certain stations the keepers were required to perform station duties, and to he in attendance up to 70 hours a week. They are called upon to work seven days a week. I was told that the hours and duties of lighthouse-keepers were under review, with a view to reducing the hours of attendance and watch keeping from the 4th July.

                                <para>- No emergency existed on the 4th July, when the Government promised to redress this grievance. I protest against the Government's policy of abandoning essential public works which could very well be carried out in spite of difficulties arising from the present crisis. Such a policy causes unemployment. If we can find money for defence, we should also be able to find sufficient for reproductive works essential to the development of this country. For some years past residents of New Norfolk have been petitioning for a new post office. The honorable member for Barker <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron)</inline> when he was Postmaster-General, inspected the present post office and, although the department then anticipated repairing the building, he was so disgusted with it that he said it was not worth repairing, and expressed his intention of erecting a new post office as soon as possible. I have no doubt that had the honorable member continued in charge of the Postal Department he would have honoured that promise.  To-day, however, the department has reverted to the attitude it adopted when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan was </para>

                        <para class="block">Postmaster-General, and says that no new postal or telephonic facilities can be provided unless they will be payable from the start. There are other ways of looking at a request of this kind. When a State government constructs a road it does not ask whether the road promises to be a payable proposition immediately. The fact that the road will help to develop a particular district is sufficient to justify its construction. No question of revenue arises in that case. Furthermore, when a farmer takes up a virgin block of land, he does not expect his proposition to be payable at once. If the Postal Department persists in denying postal and telephonic facilities where such services have no prospect of paying right from the start, it will fail to make any contribution to the development of this country. Indeed, such an outlook is in marked contrast to that of the State governments and those pioneers who are opening up our outback country. </para>
                        <para>I also request that a telephone line be constructed between Queenstown and Bronte. This would establish telephonic communication from Queenstown right through to Hobart. This service would help considerably in opening up the west coast district of Tasmania, in which are situated the hydro-electric power station and many important mills, which figure prominently in the industrial life of the State. In the absence of such communication the lives of people who might be snowed in this district for weeks at a time will be endangered. </para>
                        <para>I urge the Postmaster-General to use his influence with Australian National Airways to restore the service between Flinders Island and Tasmania. Recently this service was reduced to a tri-weekly schedule. It was reported in the press that the reason for this restriction was that only one passenger a day was being carried. That report is entirely incorrect. The demand for this service has been increasing since it was inaugurated some years ago. In 3933, it carried 90 passengers compared with 855 passengers for the year ended the 31st December, 1938, whilst for the first five months of 1939 the numbers of passengers carried were: - January, 127; February, 82; March, 129; April, 116; and May, 118; making a total of 572 passengers in five months. Remembering that this Government subsidizes .this company in respect of its mail service, the public has every right to an adequate passenger service. The residents of Flinders Island are also clamouring for a post office, which the department declines to provide because, it says, the population is not sufficient to warrant it. </para>
                        <para>I draw the attention of the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> to the threatened shortage of shipping space for fruit cargoes from Australia. Consignors have been advised by the shipping companies that as from the 4th September space will not be available for fruit. In this connexion, we should bear in mind the difficulties which arose in 1914 owing to the lack of shipping space for the transport of our primary products overseas. Surely we do not want such difficulties to recur in the present war. </para>

Although during recent years, the production of apples and pears has increased by about 100 per cent., only about one-half of the total production is exported. As it may not be possible to provide space for all of the fruit grown in Australia, I asked a question to-day relating to the canning of certain varieties of apples. In its negotiations with the British Government for the sale of produce from Australia, the Government would do well to explore the possibility of selling canned apples. </para>

A man's hat, collar, shirt, singlet, trousers, socks, overcoat and pyjamas - practically ail ' articles of clothing with the exception of boots and shoes - are subject to the tax. The position in regard to the clothing of women and children is much the same. The working man has to buy all of these articles, and when they are taxed at a higher rate than formerly, the effect is to reduce his purchasing power. But that is not all. The retailer who pays the tax in the first instance calculates his profit on his outlay; and as his outlay will be greater because of the tax, so also will his profit be greater, with the result that the purchaser of his goods will pay, not only an increased rate of tax, but also an increased profit to the retailer. I am strongly opposed to the sales tax. There are fairer ways of extracting money than by taxing those who are least able to bear the burden. </para>

                                <para>- I know that. The Scullin Government, which first introduced the sales tax, was faced with a considerable adverse trade balance and had to do something to save the nation from default. The country was almost bankrupt as the result of the extravagance of the Bruce-Page Government. It had to impose higher and in some cases prohibitive tariffs in order to check the adverse trade balance. The country did not then enjoy the huge revenue from customs which the policy of the Bruce-Page Government made possible. Some means had to be found to compensate in some degree for those losses. The tax was imposed as an emergency measure. Unfortunately, the Scullin Government, although in office, was not in <inline font-style="italic">power,</inline> and it did not last long. It was succeeded by the first Lyons Government. </para>

                                <para>- I know the position  in Tasmania. I again  draw  attention to the treatment of Tasmania in the matter of defence expenditure. Some time ago I asked a question relating to the expenditure in  each  State by the Supply and Development Department. The reply which I received corroborates everything that I have said as to  the unfair  treatment of Tasmania. During 193S-39, Few 'South "Wales received  from that  department, £250,000, or 833 times  as  much as  was  paid to Tasmania, notwithstanding that the population of Mew South Wales is only eleven and a half  times  that of Tasmania. Victoria  received  £2,083,000, which  is  6,943 times  as  much as Tasmania  received.  Yet the population of Victoria is only eight times  that  of Tasmania. South Australia,  which  received £2,200,  has a  population which is  only  two and  a  half times that of Tasmania, yet it received seven and a half times as much as was paid to the island State. Queensland, with a population  four  times that of Tasmania,  received  £2,250, or seven and a  half tunes  the amount paid to  my State.  Western Australia, with a  population not  quite double that of Tasmania,  received  £2.700,  nine  times more than  was given  to Tasmania, which received only  £300. </para>

Western Australia and South Australia do not appeal as paupers to the Commonwealth.

On this point I remind the Senate that if war came to Australia, that is to say, if fighting took place on Australian soil, many thousands of Australia's young manhood would freely volunteer to defend this country, and probably many thousands would make the supreme sacrifice. This being so, is it unreasonable to expect that manufacturers who, in normal times, make substantial profits, should, in time of war, manufacture the requirements of the Government without profit to themselves? The great majority of the men who will do the fighting have little to defend apart from their liberty. </para><interjection>

If the Commonwealth wishes to secure the co-operation of State governmens it should make some alteration of the system of paying these grants and fix them over a term of years ahead.

That depression did not commence until 1929, and had there been an outbreak of war in that year instead of this year the additional £50,000,000 required would have been made available. When money or credit is required for war purposes it can always he found. That being so, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson's</inline> argument cannot be substantiated.

The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> has presented a budget which will be followed by additional financial proposals for the current year, and consequently we are unable to estimate at this stage the effect which a complete budget will have upon the Australian people. Provision is made principally for defence expenditure and for the payment of interest on loans and it is to be regretted that nothing is being done to improve the conditions of the masses. Certain newspapers are endeavouring to show that work is plentiful, and that factories, shops and other business establishments are working overtime, but according to an advertisement which appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney</inline><inline font-style="italic">Morning</inline><inline font-style="italic">Herald,</inline> the employees of the New South Wales Traders Association have been warned that their present employment will be available for only one month, and that possibly after that period restrictions will be imposed. Should work be rationed the employees would he in the unfortunate position they occupied in 1931, when many persons had to be satisfied with only part-time work. During the depression the people suffered in consequence of the activities of those controlLing world finance. Overdrafts were called in and other financial restrictions were imposed in order to weaken the masses, who were organizing all over the world, and commercial stagnation was brought about in the United States of America, Great Britain, Australia and other countries. </para>

                                <para>- Low prices ruled because people lost their jobs and consequently did not receive any wages. Many professional men, including doctors, surveyors, dentists, engineers and others had to wait in a queue to receive the dole. Some of them had possessed valuable homes and other assets, their children had been attending colleges, and generally they had enjoyed all the good things that life has to offer; but in the end they' lost all that they possessed. Men became desperate and joined organizations which they thought could assist them. In 1933 a great  villi an,  who has murder and ruthlessness in his make-up, came into power in Germany. The oppressed workers in that country were prepared to do almost anything to secure better conditions, and have since became a part of a great war machine directed by a man intoxicated with power. In Russia and in Italy different forms of government have been adopted by the people in an endeavour to obtain a reasonable standard of comfort. The conditions which we may soon have to encounter will be similar to those which existed in 1931. According to the figures issued by the Commonwealth Statistician, unemployment at the end of the last financial year was 14 per cent, greater than it was in 1929. </para>

In Australia as in other countries, the people will submit to the inevitable, but if they are imposed upon it is difficult to say what they will do. The members of the Australian Imperial Force were regarded as the most kindly men in the world, but if they were oppressed they showed who was master. If during a time of war this Government thinks that it can continue to oppress the people there will be trouble. </para>

                        <para>Immediate steps should be taken by the Government to adopt some of the suggestions offered 'by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey,</inline> who, ever since he has been a member of this chamber, has urged drastic changes in the monetary and banking systems. He speaks as a member of the Australian Labour  party, and his constant and eloquent appeals for monetary reform have won for him many admirers. The Douglas Credit group is a party that will have to be reckoned with in the future. Its members are mostly of the middle class, and are not supporters of the Labour party, but they are disgusted with the party now in power in this Parliament. </para>
                        <para>All of the banking and financial theories that had been adhered to throughout the world prior to the 4th August, 1914, as the only principles upon which banking and finance could be satisfactorily conducted, were thrown overboard immediately after the war commenced. The world finished that war with a burden of debt so great that, if anybody had contemplated it for any other purpose, he would have been branded a sheer lunatic. Nations are defended with manpower, guns, munitions and other material things, and their capacity cannot be limited by the amount of currency that they have, or by any particular measure of credit that any band of experts likes to fix. </para>
                        <para>It is essential that, in the interests of the people generally, a policy of expansion of credit should be adopted. When the Commonwealth Bank was established by a Labour government, its governor, Denison Miller, proved himself a genius. Had his policy for the financial rehabilitation of the nation been put into operation we should not have witnessed the depression in 1931. Those dark days, which were as bad as war, would have been averted, because the Commonwealth Bank could have financed a programme of reproductive public works involving the expenditure of £350,000,000. Instead of the bank carrying  out  that policy, the Government, led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce,</inline> set up a financial oligarchy that has brought ruin to Australia. The chief qualification of a man recently appointed to the Commonwealth Bank Board seems  to be that he is a good polo player. He represents the private banks, to whom he will refer from time to time for instructions; but the Commonwealth Bank was not established to satisfy a coterie of private bankers. It has been suggested, not by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey,</inline> but by honorable senators opposite, that an expansion of credit will be necessary for the purpose of prosecuting the war. If credit could be expanded in <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Denison</inline> Miller's time, there i B no reason why it should not be done to-day. </para>
                        <para>The people have the right to live. If they know ' that they will have sufficient food, clothing and shelter, they will willingly rally to the defence of the country. I was under the impression that those enlisting in the Militia are mainly coming from the ranks of the unemployed, but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> informs us that that is not so. Evidently the unemployed are disgusted with the treatment that they have received. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> remarked that in his company in South Australia only two militiamen have been numbered among the unemployed. <inline font-style="italic">T?he</inline> thousands of men who have 'been unable to obtain work for a long period cannot be expected to have any enthusiasm for fighting in the present war. When <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bruce</inline> was in Australia about six months ago, he told members of this Parliament that never again would troops be asked to leave Australia for service overseas. A similar statement was made by the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies).</inline> I do not accept those assurances. If Australians will not be asked to serve abroad, I suggest that employment should be provided for all who are in need of work. </para>
                        <para>A water main extends from Pott's Hill to Prospect in New South Wales, and it is guarded night and day. If that line, should be blown up, or damaged in an air raid, not only would Sydney's water supply be cut off, but also Granville, Bankstown, and adjacent suburbs, would be inundated and many thousands of people drowned. Surely that is a work which requires immediate attention. </para>

                                <para>- I have heard it said that Lord Kitchener condemned it. The line consists of four pipes which run along the surface. To-day, men are standing guard over it. The placing of that main underground is only one of in any works of an urgent national character which should be undertaken immediately. I feel sure that honorable senators know of similar works of equal urgency in their respective States. Why does not the Government take immediate steps to attend to these matters? It could find the necessary money by expanding credit. By embarking on such works it would provide continuity of work for many thousands of men who are now unemployed, and who would then be more willing to defend this country. I trust that the Government will take every step possible to prevent profiteering in the present crisis. It should be on the alert to prevent, for instance, such action as was taken recently by the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited when that company expanded its credit by allotting 64 bonus shares to every holder of 100 shares. In view of the fact that the shareholders in this company are not numerous, those who benefited under this arrangement received a very fine bonus indeed. The Government should not allow that sort of thing to recur.- That company watered its stock because it knew that the Government proposed to bring in certain legislation which would reduce its margin of dividends. By the watering process a declared dividend of 6 per cent on £100 of share money, becomes 6 per cent, on £164. </para>

                                <para>- If the honorable senator knows something of that kind about the Australian Glass Company, it is his duty to tell this Parliament about it. I trust that he will do so. It is the duty of every honorable senator to turn the spotlight on racketeering of this kind. Last Monday night I attended a meeting at which over 400 people were present. The meeting unanimously resolved to urge the Government to re-acquire the Cockatoo Island. Dockyard, in order to overcome the excessive charges which were being made by the people now in control of that establishment. </para>

                                <para>- It was not his final kick. In any case 1 have not heard the honorable senator say anything about <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens'</inline> recent eclipse. I assure the honorable senator that Jack Lang will be on top when the honorable senator is plain <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Dein.</inline> The Government should watch very closely the activities of these people to whom it made a present of the Cockatoo Island Dockyard. I understand that that concern is now getting contracts from this Government on a percentage basis. It is wrong for any government to let contracts on such terms t hat the contractor's profit is fixed in relation to the expenditure incurred. Under such an arrangement there is no limit to the contractor's outlay. I ask that that system be stopped immediately. The Government should also guard against profiteering by shipping companies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan criticized the Australian Commonwealth Line of Steamers and said that the last vessel constructed for the line at the Cockatoo Island Dockyard had cost £800,000. The fact remains, however, that the Government of the day was forced to acquire that line because the shipping companies determined to raise freights by 25 per cent., and refused to take certain classes of cargo. They wanted to handle only the cream of cargoes. The Government had no desire to purchase ships, but was compelled to do so in order to ensure that our primary products would be carried overseas at reasonable rates,It first acquired a line of wooden steamers. Subsequently the Government purchased what was known as the Bay Line of Steamers, and I am assured by many people who travelled on that line that the service it rendered was equal to, if not better than, that provided by any private shipping company. In passing, I suggest that honorable senators opposite should not condemn the man who was responsible for that transaction, because only quite recently some of them desired to make him Prime Minister again. The purchase of those vessels ensured that the people of this country, particularly our primary producers, would be protected against exploitation. We were thus enabled not only to transport our primary products to markets overseas, but also to ensure that Australian troops abroad would be fed. Those ships did a noble job. However, the Bruce Page Government got rid of them at the first opportunity, and Australia has not yet been paid in full for them. Should the shipping companies attempt to exploit this nation by charging exorbitant freights in the present war, the Government should not hesitate to stop them from doing so. We are told that the British Government proposes to buy our surplus wheat. I do not know whether in that transaction the British Government will be acting for itself, or as agent for certain interests in Great Britain, in much the same way as the Australian Government might secure goods for various industries in this country.I should like to be enlightened on that point. Furthermore, I wish to know whether the freight on primary products exported under this arrangement will be charged to the producers or paid by the purchasing government. I trust that some honorable senator opposite will answer that question. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan said that he was proud of the fact that Britain proposed to purchase our surplus primary products, and added that we must feel very pleased to-day that Australia is not an ally of Japan. My reaction to the bedtime story about the Yellow Peril has always been that whilst I do not want Australia to be an ally of Japan. I do desire Australia to be at least friendly with that country. I recall that the present Chief Justice, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham, when be was Attorney-General, led a goodwill mission to Japan; that mission caused the people of Australia some concern. At. that time it was thought that the Japanese might not be friendly towards the British nation. A few years ago the Government, appointed as Administrator of the Northern Territory a gentleman who, at the time of his appointment, was a member of the House of Representatives. He had not been in his new office long before trouble arose in connexion with some Japanese luggers. Legal proceedings were taken which caused a grave situation at Darwin, but Judge Wells demonstrated British justice to the world. He did a good job when he found in favour of the Japanese, who up to that time had had a " raw deal ". In the face of die facts associated with that case, I cannot understand why <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Abbott</inline> is still Administrator of the Northern Territory.  His  retention in the office has not been in the best interests of Australia. </para>

No doubt, it is cheaper to employ Japanese and Malays. These may be regarded as small matters, but I urge that attention be given to them. I bring them before the Senate in good faith. </para>

If it was wise to make a gesture by sending <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Latham to Japan on a goodwill mission, a continuation of that friendliness would be equally wise. The sending of a similar mission would be a diplomatic move. Mention has been made of the Government's intention to appoint a trade commissioner to Canada.

Unfortunately, some people, when placed in positions of authority, become drunk with power, and do not know what they are doing. Even when they have made serious mistakes, their employment has been continued by the Government. </para>

                            <para>.- On other occasions I have asked certain questions and I now thank the Government for having supplied the information T sought. There has been a good deal of talk lately on the subject of banking, both orthodox and unorthodox. As the present war continues, the Government will be faced with the necessity for finding large sums of money. I shall not make any comment on the subject, of orthodoxy in finance, but I do say that a Labour government would take steps to place the Commonwealth Bank on the same footing as in 1925, when it was a competitor with the private banks. Also we would require all State governments and local governing bodies to trade with the Commonwealth Bank. Beyond that, the Labour party would not go. Australia's financial position at the moment is extraordinary. A few' days ago the Treasurer <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> introduced a budget of £102,000,000. Australia's overseas and internal liabilities amount to £1,295,000,000. Its interest bill is £45,000,000 a year, or £3,800,000 a month, which is equivalent to £128,000 a day. Before the present struggle ends, those figures may be greatly increased, so that it may well happen that the Government will be forced to take unorthodox action in the interests of the finances of this country. I have a vivid recollection of the position of Australia between 1929 and 1931. When the Scullin Government came into office, it inherited from the Bruce-Page Administration grave financial responsibilities. At that time, the London financial market was closed to Australia, not because a Labour government was in office, but because the last two loans which the Bruce-Page Government attempted to float in London were a distinct failure. </para>

                                <para>- For six years the Bruce-Page Government had borrowed at the rate of £38,000,000 per annum. I admit that most of that money was obtained on behalf of the States. The Scullin Government soon found that that source of money was cut off because of the world depression. Many public works had to be suspended, thereby throwing large numbers of men out of employment. Private enterprise also commenced to dismiss employees, and Australia was in a desperate position. </para>

                                <para>- That is true. We won the election on the arbitration issue. But that victory never deluded me. I regarded the industrial plank of the. Bruce-Page Government's election  policy  as one of the smartest political tricks ever perpetrated in this country. The industrial arbitration issue was deliberately raised by the United Australia party government in order to confuse the people and enable the Bruce-Page Government to " get from under ". In my electorate I could not find the man whom I was supposed to be opposing. It was a trap into which the Labour party walked. Nevertheless, I do not agree with those people, even including some members of our party, who say that it is a good thing that Labour is not in office to-day. I do not subscribe to that view now, nor did I then. I contend that, provided Labour has a majority in both Houses, it should take office; the party has the platform, and its members the capacity to govern this country wisely. Whatever the issue which we may be called upon to face, we are at least as competent as are honorable senators opposite, who for so long have had control of the government of this country.. </para>

                        <para class="block"> When the Labour party came into power the price for all primary products was extremely low, and there was an army of unemployed such as this country had never previously known. There was a huge adverse trade balance, to correct which the Scullin Government had to prohibit importations; that action meant an ' annual loss of £5,000,000 of customs revenue. The Government, being faced with' a most desperate situation, introduced proposals to inflate the note issue by £18,000,000. The purpose of the fiduciary issue was to provide £1,000,000 a month for, the workers and £500,000 a month for primary producers. Honorable senators will recall that the bill to amend the Commonwealth Bank Act was passed by the House of Representatives and came before this chamber. Altheugh the Labour Government did not have a majority here, the Senate did not reject the measure, because that might have given the Government an opportunity to force a double dissolution, in which case the people would, in all probability, have stood behind the Government. Labour's opponents in this chamber were not courageous enough to reject the bill ; instead they carried an amendment referring it to a select, committee which, however, did not complete its report. </para>
                        <para class="block">Great Britain has for long had a fiduciary issue of more than £400,000,000, which, under economic pressure, has been increased to over £500,000,000, for purely domestic needs. </para>
                        <para>During the election campaign, which led to the defeat of the Scullin Government, our opponents had but one cry: " Hands off the people's savings ". What earthly connexion the financial relief measures which the Labour Government introduced had to do with the savings of the people I shall never be able to understand. However, the people were in a state of unrest owing to widespread unemployment, which certainly was not the fault of the Labour Government. A. great many people who heard that cry - "Hands off the people's savings" - were stampeded, with the result that we were defeated. Probably the only bank that some of my electors had ever known was the bank of the Bendigo Creek, and the only thing they had ever drawn was their breath ; but they were carried away by that political catch-cry and voted for our opponents, who persuaded them that something terrible would happen if the Scullin Government were allowed to inflate the note issue by £18,000,000. So much for that phase of the political battle. The ink was hardly dry on the commission of the new Prime Minister (the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lyons)</inline> when his government, which had promised to rehabilitate the finances of the Commonwealth, shipped the whole of the gold issue to London, with the result that to-day the Commonwealth note issue of £53,000,000has no gold backing. </para>

                        <para>But let me say a little bit more now about the much-discussed Government led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin,</inline> of which I was a strong supporter. In 1929 - the worst year of the depression - the Scullin Government floated in Australia a loan of £10,000,000 for works. In the following year it successfully negotiated a further loan of £12,440,000, also for works; and later in the same year two internal conversion loans amounting to £78,000,000. The success with which these operations were conducted should be a sufficient answer to those people who contend that Labour cannot be trusted with the financial control of this country. The master-stroke of government policy was in . 1931, when the Government successfully undertook the conversion in Australia of £536,000,000 at an interest rate 221/2 per cent. below the average rate then being paid on that debt. That was the biggest financial undertaking in the history of the world up to that date. Its effect on Australian finance has been most marked, the total savings of interest payments up to June of this year having been £60,000,000. It is not too much to say that this Government could not have remitted £15,000,000 of taxes to its rich friends but for the courageous and statesmanlike action of the Scullin Government in 1931. The succeeding United Australia party Government claimed that it. restored prosperity to Australia. The truth is that the courageous action of the finest Government that Australia has had made recovery possible. </para>

It was defeated by the vote of the United Australia party, the Country party, and certain other people who rebelled against the Labour Government. The same people had been commending <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline> for many months on his skilful handling of a most difficult situation, but at the first opportunity they stabbed him in the back. In addition to floating internal loans amounting to nearly £30,000,000, as well as conversion loans of£78,000,000 and £536,000,000, the Scullin Government negotiated a London loan of £3,750,000, and had commenced negotiations for a maturing loan of £40,000,000 when it had to vacate office. Its financial record was a most distinguished one. </para>

                        <para>The present Government has also attempted some loan operations, but with not very satisfactory results. It attempted to float a loan in London, but obtained only 20 per cent. of the amount it sought. Later it essayed to raise two loans in Australia. Nearly 30 per cent. of the required amount was left in the hands of the Common wealth Bank, which, by underwriting the issue, brought about inflation - something which it declined to do for the Scullin Labour Government. That bank, a creation of the Commonwealth Parliament, represents interests which, I believe, are identical with those of the private banks. If Labour were in power it would do nothing rash, but it would bring the management of the Commonwealth Bank under the control of the Government.It would not interfere with the private banks, but it would make the Commonwealth Bank a competitor, and would insist that State governments, municipalities, and councils should deal only with the Commonwealth Bank. </para>

                            this afternoon once more read some of the findings of the Royal Commission on Banking and Monetary Systems. That commission, which cost this country £17,000, was set up by the Lyons Government. Its members, among whom was
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley,</inline>
                            an ex-Minister of the Labour Government, represented a wide variety of interests. It is worth remembering that in 1929 and 1930
                            <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Scullin</inline>
                            urged that where the Government policy conflicts with that of the Bank Board, the Government policy should prevail. The commission's report fully justified the action taken by the Scullin Government in the crisis of 1929 and 1930. That cannot be truthfully denied by any supporter of the present Government or of private banking interests.
                        </para>
                        <para>I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Darcey</inline> that people do not want to be worried about banking theories. Their concern is that the Government should be able to get all the money that it wants for war purposes. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> and many others in every part of Australia have said during the last five years, some of the money now being expended on defence should have been made available for the relief of the great army of unemployed, to whom this Government offers nothing. </para>
                        <para>Criticism that has been offered from this side of the Senate during the present: crisis has not been destructive. When honorable senators opposite seek by innuendo to throw discredit on the capacity of this party to govern the country they invariably find that there are men on this side who understand the subject just as thoroughly as they do. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> said that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> closed the Government Savings Bank of New South Wales. Evidently the honorable gentleman knows nothing about what happened at that time. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. (now Sir John)</inline> Latham was Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives. He, and also his colleagues in this chamber at that time, continuously bombarded the Scullin Government with reference to the stability of the New South Wales bank. Even members of our own party helped to throw doubts on its stability. As a consequence, a. run occurred on the bank when the Labour Governmentwasin power. The then  chairman  of the board, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Gibson, was not anxious to undertake the rehabilitation of the bank until the Lyons Government came to power. Then the matter was fixed up. I state in all fairness to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang,</inline> or whoever was the political power in New South Wales then, that the bank was closed as much by action in the Federal Parliament as by the policy of any political leader in New South Wales. The catch-phrase - " Return the Labour party and lose your savings " - was merely so much rubbish. Probably that cry will be heard at. the next election. If so. I hope that I am  about when some of our opponents give voice to it. </para>
                        <para>I endorse the opinion expressed by the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> that notwithstanding the proposed expenditure on defence for this year it is possible that before Christmas Parliament will be asked to appropriate an additional. £60,000,000 to £80,000,000. The amount of taxation collected has reached' the amazing figure of £120,000,000 per annum , as according to the published figures £80,000,000 is collected by the Commonwealth and £40,000.000 by the various State governments. Notwithstanding these astounding figures, there are approximately 200,000 persons unemployed in the Commonwealth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein's</inline> old friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Spooner,</inline> who recently had a brawl with <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Stevens</inline> of financial fame, said that there are 60,000 persons out of work in Sydney and suburbs. </para>

I do not know whether any of these men will render military service in some capacity, but while the country is in its present state - I say this without reflecting on the Government's efforts to defend the country - overtime in the munition works should be discontinued, and all the employees should be permitted to work only one shift. Men could then be absorbed at work where they could earn something to maintain themselves and their families. As was stated by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> if a call is made for men - I" believe the Government could get all the men it required - it should not ask them to go into camp without offering them reasonable pay such as they would receive if the nation were not at war. In the matter of youth employment, the Government has made some effort, because large sums have been appropriated to assist t.o train young men and to provide them with work. </para>

                        <para>Some comments have been made concerning ship construction in Australia. The figures cited by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan were, I believe, taken from the <inline font-style="italic">Harbour,</inline> and are evidently official; therefore I do not challenge them. I cannot, however, see why this country cannot build ships of a reasonable tonnage even if it means bringing trained artisans from overseas to instruct our men. The trade union organizations would not raise any objection, because a nucleus staff of trained men could instruct our engineers in the important work of ship building. Too much reliance is placed on the Old Country, and insufficient regard is paid to the mechanical skill of our own workmen. I have seen as much of the mechanical side of industry in Australia as has any honorable senator. I remind the Senate of the quality of the rolling stock used on Australian railways, and particularly the <inline font-style="italic">Spirit, of Progress,</inline> the de luxe passenger train between Melbourne and Albury. Every portion of that train was built by Australian workmen in Australian workshops, and the craftsmanship is of the highest possible character. Ships constructed in Victoria and in New South Wales are still in operation. The cost of construction would perhaps lead us into a long debate. </para>

                        <para>Why cannot honorable senators receive some information concerning the activities of the Australian Broadcasting Commission? Why were not John Brownlow, John Mccormack and Marjorie Lawrence - three leading vocalists who visited Australia - engaged by the commission? This body, although functioning under a separate act of Parliament, is more or less under the control of the Government; yet when honorable senators ask questions concerning the activities of the commission they receive only meaningless replies. There are many aspects of the work of the commission that should be inquired into. I raised one matter during the last period of the session, which was handled most unsatisfactorily by the Government Moreover, while the war is in progress some censorship should be exercised over individuals who broadcast, and whose statements may have an undesirable effect upon excitable persons. Some of the statements broadcast should be rigorously censored. </para>
                        <para>In the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Age,</inline> and I believe in other' journals, it has been reported that arrangements have been made for invalid and old-age pensioners, who so desire, to receive their pensions by post. When I represented the electorate of Bendigo in 1929.I arranged with the then Acting Leader of the Government <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Theodore)</inline> for the system to be introduced in my electorate. The Labour party first introduced this necessary reform. We urged that if it were right for retired judges and government officials to receive their pensions by post, it was equally right that the aged and infirm should receive similar consideration. I am glad to hear that the Government has improved the present system. I mention the matter not in a spirit of egotism, but to remind the Government that the system of paying pensions by post was introduced by a Labour government some years ago. </para>
                        <para>I do not propose to deal at length with sales taxation which was introduced as an emergency measure, but during the eight years this and similar governments have occupied the treasury bench no  attempt  has been made to remove the tax, which seems to have become permanent. Fully 90 per cent. of the exemptions were made at the request of the Labour party. The increase of the tax from 5 per cent. to 6 per cent. will raise to some degree the cost of living. </para>

Excellent recommendations were made by Mr.McEwen and also by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thompson,</inline> the anthropologist, who reported on this subject in December, 1937. It will be news to some honorable senators - it was to me - that we still have in Australia 53,698 full-blooded aboriginals and 23,000 half-castes. It is amazing to realize that their numbers have decreased alarmingly during recent years, while the Sioux Indians in the United States of America, whom I thought to be nearly extinct, number some 348,000 and are actually increasing. According to some of the letters I have received, this is a. <inline font-style="italic">vary</inline> urgent problem. Although we have treated the original owners of this country unfairly, the Government is to be commended for having decided to complete the job and to provide a reserve for these unfortunate people. I understand that approximately 250,000 square miles is to be reserved and I believe that the aborigines could live in comparative comfort if removed from the influence of the white man. When the representatives of an organization in Melbourne interviewed <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> and me on this subject, I said that when the opportunity occurred I would again bring it under the notice of. the Government and urge that something be done. </para>
                        <para>As I stated at the outset of my remarks, the consideration of the budget is overshadowed by the international situation. We are involved in war and we shall have to face colossal commitments. This country will have  to do those things which it has pledged itself to do. We must see that the money appropriated is expended in the most useful way, and that employment is provided for an additional number of men by eliminating overtime in munitions works. Every additional man employed helps to strengthen Australia as a nation. While wc are legislating for the defence of this country we must not forget our own people, all of whom should receive proper consideration by this Parliament and the Government. </para>
