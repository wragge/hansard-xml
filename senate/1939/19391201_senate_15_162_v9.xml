                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave -</inline> The measures that, have been in process of formulation for some time for the control of imports will be embodied in regulations to be promulgated to-day.

                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The chief immediate aim of the licensing measure is to conserve resources in non-sterling exchange, and, in particular, to prevent' the absorption of those resources in the purchase of unessential imports to the detriment of the more vital national needs. The administrative arrangements embody a system of import licences carrying several degrees of priority in the matter of shipping space and supply, and aim to serve a number of complementary purposes, the chief of which are - </para>

                    <para>The large-scale purchases by the British Government of our principal export products will provide supplies of sterling exchange adequate to our current needs. Sterling exchange can be used to purchase imports originating in all countries of the British Empire, with the exception of Canada, Newfoundland and Hong Kong. Sterling may also be used  to purchase imports from British mandated territories, as well as from Egypt and the Sudan. All goods originating in countries of the sterling area will be exempt from the application of the licensing control, and may be imported under the same conditions as apply at the present time. In future, however, no goods may' be imported from countries constituting the non-sterling area, including Canada, Newfoundland and Hong Kong, unless a licence to import the goods has been granted. </para>
                    <para>Goods now in transit to Australia will not be subject to restriction. It is also proposed to admit under licence, goods on order under drafts drawn under letters of credit already established in  Australia. </para>
                    <para>The general scheme of administration contemplates that licences will not be issued for the importation from non-sterling countries of all those goods which have been graded as unimportant goods. A list of such goods is contained in the schedule, circulated for the information of honorable senators, referring to goods in category " D." Calculated on the basis of the imports from non-sterling countries during the year 1938-39, these goods were valued at £3,250.000 sterling. Total imports from non-sterling countries in the same year were valued at £46,500,000 sterling. </para>
                    <para>In the case of all other imports from  non-sterling countries, it is proposed, in general, to base the measures of regulation on the value of imports during the year 1938-39. That should not be taken to mean that licences will be immediately obtainable for amounts equivalent to the importations in that year. </para>
                    <para>During the first licensing period, which will cover a period of two months ending the 31st January, 1940, licences will be granted to individual importers to the extent ofone-sixth of the value of their respective importations of the same goods during the twelve months ended 30th June, 1939. This is a general principle that will apply, and will place licensing officers at the various ports throughout the Commonwealth in a position to deal promptly and uniformly with a large proportion of the more or less regular imports. </para>
                    <para>Departures from the general principle will be unavoidable in the case of certain classes of imports as for instance - </para>

                        <item label="(4)">
                            <para>Essential commodities subject to material price increases since 1938-39, the demand for which in terms of value exceeds the 1938-39 levels. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para>In the interests of sound administration it will be necessary progressively to adjust the basis on which licences are granted in order to meet these cases. Such adjustments as may be necessary may only be determined in the light of the factors affecting the particular commodity or transaction. </para>
                    <para>The measures therefore do. not involve any immediate reduction of the value of imports, except insofar as the goods named in the schedule in the hands of honorable senators are concerned. The limitation of the immediate issue of licences for other goods to one-sixth of the importations in 1938-39 will enable the Government to keep a close watch on the position, should the situation in relation to non-sterling exchange become more difficult at any time. </para>

I point out that the first year of the flour tax collections ends to-day. I cannot give an assurance as to when or whether any of the money collected from flour tax beginning on the  2nd  December,  1939,  will be made available this year; but I shall look into the matter and give to the honorable senator a considered reply as soon as possible. </para>

Since the outbreak of war Jewish migration to this country has practically ceased, due mainly to the fact that a large number of these unfortunate refugees are inenemy countries. About the only kind of migrants coming to this country at the present time are the relatives or parents of those who have already gained admission, and who are in neutral or British countries. </para>

                    <para class="block">When the Prime Minister in September last brought down the budget for  1939-40,  he indicated that it would be subject, to revision during the course of the financial year. Revised estimates of revenue and expenditure are now presented, and they will supersede those which were submitted with the budget. </para>
                    <para>The Government has given much consideration to the financial problem, of which all the difficulties are not yet fully known. We can, however, make plans for the future, as far as it is practicable to do so, and the Government has looked ahead with the object of formulating  a  financial policy which will fit into a coordinated plan and be capable of being adapted to changing circumstances. </para>
                    <para>Just as the United . Kingdom is planning on the assumption that the war will last at least three years, so mustour plans visualize a similar possibility, and this requires a much more intensified defence and economic effort than, this country was called upon to exert in the last war. </para>
                    <para>The problem is one of resources. There is need for the direction of a large proportion of our resources to war purposes and for co-ordination to avoid waste. Only the resources now available can be used both for the war effort and for civil needs, and the real burden must be borne now; it cannot be shifted to the future  by  ingenious financial devices. </para>
                    <para>The general financial policy of the Government aims at a balanced programme of taxation, borrowing from the public., and borrowing from the banking system. The balance between these three methods of finance must change from time to time with changing economic conditions. It is, therefore, necessary that these conditions and the trend of the economic system be kept under constant review. </para>
                    <para>In the period before the war we experienced a prolonged' fall of export prices, and other adverse factors which made for recession in the economic situation, and we had not recovered from this recession when war was declared. There inevitably followed some dislocation of normal economic activity, which showed itself in a greater hesitation in private investment, an increase of the number of unemployed, and in other directions, but there is no reason to believe that this dislocation will be more than temporary. A number of factors is working for improvement, of which I may instance the recent sales of export products to the United Kingdom, the proceeds of which are already coming to hand, and the support given to the banking system by the Commonwealth Bank. Also, defence expenditure is having an increasingly stimulating effect on economy generally. While these factors have not yet been fully reflected in the employment of our resources, their effects will continue to become more evident in the coming months. While the temporary dislocation lasts the Government is desirous of .avoiding action likely to discourage' private activity until resources are more fully employed and national income has been raised. Consequently the Government has decided, in distributing the cost of its war programme between taxation, public borrowing, and borrowing from the bank- ing system, to rely for the time being on borrowing with the aid of the banking system rather than on taxation. </para>
                    <para>In accordance with this decision two private loans have been arranged from the banking system, the first for £10,000,000 for Commonwealth and State works, and the second for £2,000,000 for special defence works low in the order of defence priority, but especially chosen" to relieve the unemployment position until the effects of defence expenditure become fully apparent. In the absence of increased taxation, and with the stimulating influence of increasing export income and rising defence expenditure, it  i3  believed that the employment position will improve substantially and that the national income will be increased accordingly. When these changes occur the Government will review the economic position in order to determine the balance to be struck between the methods of finance 1 have mentioned. </para>
                    <para>Credit expansion is a valuable instrument of financial policy, and the Government has shown itself to be prepared to avail itself of this instrument for appropriate purposes; but it must be used with discretion. It is the intention of the Government to avoid the evils of excessive credit expansion, as was done by most belligerent countries after the last war. It is the policy of the Government to draw for war purposes upon the savings of the whole community. This will mean, unfortunately, diverting moneys which would normally be devoted to the development of the country to the prosecution of the war. An important part of our borrowing plans is the issue of savings certificates in order to afford people of small means the opportunity to play their part. Similar certificates are being issued in the United Kingdom. </para>
                    <para>The Government is confident that its general financial policy will enable it to reduce interest rates below the level now current. Already we have arranged a loan at a substantially lower rate of interest; than any floated for some years. The yield on Government securities in the market is already declining, and it is expected that the Government's policy will ultimately result in interest rates reaching and being maintained at a satisfactory and acceptable level. </para>
                    <para>The Government has decided not to impose new taxes at the present time, except the increases aggregating about £8,000,000 which were embodied in the budget and supplementary taxation measures which have already been placed before Parliament. This does not indicate unwillingness on the part of the Government to use taxation for financing the war effort, but the vital questions are when, and to what extent, taxation should be relied upon at any given time. As economic recovery gets under way, the Government will transfer emphasis from borrowing from the banking system to borrowing from the public, and more particularly to taxation. </para>

                    <para>The amount to be found from Revenue includes £9,066,000 for expenditure which was included in our pre-war plans and £4,714,000 for war expenditure, the greater part of which is for pay and allowances of the army so that the additional charge to Revenue over the previous budget proposals is £1,768,000. An amount of £10,215,000 will bo provided from Loan Fund for General War Services, such as pay, maintenance of troops, ammunition, &amp;c, £15,583,000 from the same source for naval construction, reserves of munitions, aeroplanes. &amp;c, and £20,383.000 to carry on the original prewar programme of capital defence works. The amount of £2,053,000 is available in Trust Fund for Defence purposes as was the case when the budget was tabled in December last. Details of the proposed Defence expenditure will be found in the Estimates. </para>
                    <para>The war situation has affected the Estimates of Revenue, an outstanding example being the anticipated decline of customs revenue. Apart from new duties, designed to yield £150,000, to be introduced shortly, this reduction would have been £2,953,00.0. It will be readily understood that an estimate of customs revenue made in war time is highly speculative; changes in the military and naval situation abroad and changes in economic activity, par.ticularly in the United Kingdom, may falsify the most well-founded estimates. </para>
                    <para>Income tax receipts are now estimated to be £1,040,000 more than was estimated in the budget, whilst the gold excise duty imposed in December is expected to yield £900,000 iti the current year. The estimated total receipts for the year are £101.490,000. A summary and comparison between the estimated total transactions and results of the consolidated revenue fund as anticipated in the budget and under the revised estimates are given in the following figures : - </para>

                    <para>Increases of defence expenditure from Loan include £10,215,000 for pay, maintenance and general up-keep, and £15,583,000 for works, naval construction, reserves of stores, arms, aeroplanes, &amp;c. </para>
                    <para>I have placed before honorable senators a general outline of our financial plans which, of course, must be elastic because our commitments will increase. It is the duty of the Government to distribute the burden with the least disturbance to the economy, and our plans are formulated to ensure a sound economy to meet the tasks of peace. The path ahead is arduous. It would be foolish to delude ourselves into the belief that there is an easy way of bearing this burden. Substantial sacrifices will be required from every section of the community, but the people of Australia have never failed to face difficulties with courage, and I am confident that they will give earnest support to the Government in the tremendous task which lies ahead of it. </para>

                    <para>Clauses 2 and 3 of the bill will render it possible for manufacturers to receive the full amount of bounty payable to them each quarter instead of each financial year, thus conforming with past practice in this industry. The Tariff Board has recommended a bounty on a sliding scale based on the average imported cost for each financial year, but practical considerations not apparently brought before the board's notice render it impossible to pay sulphur manufacturers any bounty at all until after the end of each financial year as the basis for bounty, namely, the average imported cost for that year, could not be ascertained until after the end of the year. This amendment of the principal act will be very acceptable to sulphur producers,, and will render the act similar in its operation to other bounty acts. Section 9 of the principal act provides  for a reduction of bounty where profits exceed 10 per cent, per annum.  In  the absence of the proposed amendment in clause 4 of the bill it is impossible to determine the sales value of sulphur or sulphuric acid used by a manufacturer in the production of his own fertilizers or other commodities. Without a satisfactory means to determine an assumed sales value or price for such sulphur or sulphuric acid, the Minister could not determine the net profit earned from the manufacture and sale of sulphur or sulphuric acid which is the vital purpose of that section of the act. The industrial section was not included in new bounty legislation in 1938, as there was then some doubt as to its validity. The then Attorney-General promised the  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to consider the matter fully, and to insert such a section, if it- were found to be valid, and also advisable in the interest of employees in industries in receipt of Commonwealth bounties. That consideration has been given to the matter, and the Government recommends to the. Senate the present bill, which provides for- </para>

                    <para>The notes exchanged between the High Commissioner in London and the Brazilian Ambassador were signed on the 19th July, 1939. Together, they form a simple kind of most-favoured-nation agreement. No specific tariff concessions are provided for in the agreement, which simply guarantees that Australian goods imported into Brazil, and Brazilian goods imported into Australia, shall receive treatment not less favorable than that granted to goods from any other foreign country. </para>
                    <para>On the part of Australia, the agreement was designed principally to secure the most favorable conditions of entry of Australian wool into Brazil, the trade in which was showing a promising degree of expansion. Honorable senators will appreciate that the events which have taken place since the signing of the agreement may affect the export of wool to Brazil. Nevertheless, I do not consider that that fact should prevent formal approval from being given to it. Therefore, I shall deal as briefly as possible with the reasons which led to the exchange of the notes that constitute the agreement. </para>
                    <para>Brazil has a double-columned tariff providing minimum and maximum rates of duty. The lower tariff rates are applied to imports from countries which have entered into trade agreements with Brazil, under which Brazilian goods receive most favoured nation treatment. At the present time, imports of Brazilian goods into Australia are subject to the general tariff rates of duty, and consequently Brazil applies the maximum tariff rates to Australian goods imported into that country. </para>
                    <para>The agreement now before the Senate will remove any competitive disadvantage to which Australian goods are subject in Brazil. </para>
                    <para>The Brazilian import duty on wool under the maximum tariff is 1.680 milreis per kilogramme gross weight, plus 10 per cent, of that duty, which is equivalent to approximately 3d. per lb. gross weight in Australian currency. The minimum tariff is 1.360 milreis plus 10 per cent., which is equivalent to approximately 2½d. per lb. The wool textile industry in Brazil has been expanding rapidly in recent years. It already supplies the bulk of the domestic demand for the coarser types of fabrics woven from locally spun and grown wool. For the manufacture of finer weaves of textiles, the industry has been dependent to a large extent upon imported yarns, but this trade is gradually being displaced by the increasing output of the Brazilian spinning industry, using imported raw wools of fine counts. Australian exporters have been evincing a keen interest in this development. Brazilian statistics show that imports of wool in 1938, including raw wool and wool in all stages of manufacture up to yarns, were valued at the equivalent hi Australian currency of approximately £664,000. </para>
                    <para>The value of Australian wool exports to Brazil has increased considerably since 1934-35, and as Australian wool is subject to slightly higher duties than wool from competing sources, it was expected that the removal of the differential margin would encourage a more extensive use of Australian staple. A trade has recently developed in the export, of Australian essential oils to Brazil. These goods, by the application of the minimum tariff, will receive the benefit of a reduction of duty of approximately one-fifth. </para>
                    <para>Brazil has a favorable trade balance with Australia, which is due to the fact that.it supplies a number of raw materials for Australian industry such as carnauba wax, edible nuts, cocoa beans and cocoa butter. The goods imported from Brazil are not of a kind on which tariff concessions have been granted by Australia in trade agreements negotiated with other foreign countries. The extension to Brazil of most-favoured-nation treatment will not, therefore, result in any measurable increase of imports from Brazil or any loss of revenue. </para>
                    <para>The agreement contains the usual stipulation by which preferences granted by Australia to British dominions will be maintained. On the other hand, any special advantages granted by Brazil to neighbouring countries for the purpose of facilitating frontier traffic, or the advantages or favours resulting from any customs union to which Brazil may become a party, are exempted from most favoured nation treatment. Honorable senators will observe that the agreement us to come into operation on a date to be fixed by mutual arrangement. This provision was incorporated in order that the agreement would not become effective until after approval by Parliament. I submit the bill to this chamber with every confidence that it will meet with the approval of honorable senators. </para>

                    <para>Honorable senators will observe that under the agreement Newfoundland grants exclusive tariff preferences of 1 cent per lb. on Australian butter and 10 per cent, ad valorem on Australian canned fruits, whilst Australia accords admission under the British Preferential Tariff of Newfoundland newsprint. It is hoped that the exclusive preferences granted to Australia may have a beneficial effect on our trade with Newfoundland, which, at present, is negligible. On the other hand, the establishment of alternative sources of supply of newsprint  for  Australia's requirements will undoubtedly be advantageous to Australia, which  at  present obtains the bulk of its supplies from Canada and the United Kingdom. It is not proposed to substitute indiscriminately Newfoundland newsprint for  that  manufactured in the United Kingdom; but difficulties have already  been  experienced ' by Australian newspaper interests in obtaining an assurance  of  future supplies from the United Kingdom. The agreement has the support of the Government of the United Kingdom, which is at present administering Newfoundland under a commission  of  government. </para>

                    <para>This bill is designed for the purpose  of  continuing the assistance by way  of  bounty which is given on fortified wine exported from the Commonwealth. The existing Wine Export Bounty Act, which has been in operation since the 1st March, 1.935, expires on the 28th February, 1940, and unless provision be made for the continuance of the assistance given in the past, no bounty can be paid on wine  exported  after that date. </para>
                    <para>The wine industry of Australia has had a chequered career, and it might be  as  well if, at this stage, I were briefly  to  outline the history of the Commonwealth Government's part in its development. </para>
                    <para>Prior to 1924 the industry had been able to dispose  of  its production  on the  Australian market, but at that stage it  became evident that unless some assistance were given, wine grape-growers who had been placed on their holdings under the repatriation schemes of the Commonwealth and State Governments after the war, would very soon be in a hazardous position owing to over-production. </para>
                    <para>The only outlet for the wine appeared to be on the overseas market, and after exhaustive inquiries it was decided, in 19.24, to assist the industry by the payment of a bounty on wine exported, the object being to enable wine-makers to sell their wine and thus be in a position to pay growers a reasonable price for their grapes. </para>
                    <para>The amount of bounty decided upon was 4s. a gallon. This did not mean that exporters actually received a bonus of 4s. on every gallon of wine exported, as the bounty included an amount of ls. 3d. which exporters paid as excise duty on spirit used in the fortification of the wine. The effective bounty was 2s. 9d. a gallon. Since 1924 the Commonwealth Government has continued to pay a bounty on wine exported, but the rate of bounty has varied considerably, as will be seen from the following table.- - </para>
                    <para>The Wine Export Bounty Act of 1934 provided for payment on a sliding scale. During the first two years the rate, paid was ls. 3d. a gallon and during the succeeding three years a reduction of Id. a gallon was provided for. The present rate of bounty is ls. a gallon. It is p ro.posed in this bill that this rate shall continue for a further period of five years. </para>
                    <para>There is little doubt that the payment of a bounty on wine exported from the Commonwealth has been of material assistance to wine grape-growers and wine-makers throughout the Commonwealth. The development of the export trade in wine has been considerable. </para>
                    <para class="block">During the period 1924 to 1934 exports rose from 142,0S5 gallons in 1924 to 2,628,294 gallons in 1934, and during the last five years a further increase has taken place as follows: - </para>

                    <para>In June, 1939, there was approximately 18,500,000 gallons of fortified wine in bond in Australia. , The quantity of fortified wine consumed on the domestic market annually is estimated to be approximately 3,500,000 gallons, and unless the State governments are prepared to provide better and more facilities for the sale of wine in Australia there does not appear to be much prospect of increasing local consumption in the immediate future. If the bounty were discontinued, export would practically cease, and the huge quantities of wine which at present are disposed of overseas would be thrown on to the local market with disastrous results to all concerned. The Australian wine trade is experiencing very severe competition in the United Kingdom market from British wines, the sale of which has increased very rapidly during recent years. Sales of this type of wine have increased from 3,500,000 gallons in 1934 to 6,000,000 gallons in 1938. </para>
                    <para>It should also be remembered that the Governments of South Australia, New South Wales and Victoria have large sums of money invested in the irrigation settlements in which wine-grape growing is a very important factor. The withdrawal of the bounty would undoubtedly result in the ruin of hundreds of returned soldier grape-growers, and the interested State Governments would suffer heavy financial losses. </para>
                    <para>The export of fortified wine from Australia has added considerably to Australian credits overseas. The value of exports during ' the last five years has been as follows: - </para>

                    <para>In addition the industry represents a large capital investment. It employs 732 persons in wineries, and the growers of grapes, and also provides each year seasonal occupation for a large number of grape-pickers, carters and labourers during the vintage period. </para>
                    <para>The Federal Vitieultural Council, which represents the majority of winemakers in Australia, has requested that the rate of bounty be stabilized at1s. a gallon. This is the present rate of bounty payable under the existing act, and it is proposed in this bill to continue the payment of bounty at the same rate for a period of five years from the 1st March, 1940. </para>
                    <para>From 1924 to 1930 the bounty paid on wine exported was financed solely from Consolidated Revenue, but in the latter year the burden of financing the industry was placed on the wine itself. This was achieved by increasing the excise duty on fortifying spirit by 5s. a proof gallon, making the duties payable 10s. and lis. a gallon, and providing, in the 1930 Wine Bounty Act, for the extra amount thus collected to be paid into a trust fund from which the bounty was to be paid. Provision was also made that, if the amount received from the extra excise collections was at any time insufficient to pay the bounty in full, the deficiency was to be made up from Consolidated Revenue. </para>
                    <para>The provisions of the Financial Emergency Act 1932 limited the sum that could be drawn from Consolidated Revenue in any one financial year to £96,000. The Wine Bounty Act was also amended to provide that the money available for distribution as bounty should be distributed <inline font-style="italic">pro rata</inline> amongst exporters. </para>
                    <para>In 1933 the rate of duty on fortifying spirit had been reduced to a flat rate of 6s. 6d. a gallon. This reduction of duty did not. in any way reduce the amount of money available to pay the bounty on wine exported, as the amount of 5s. out of the lower excise duty on fortifying spirit was still transferable to the trust fund under the bounty act. The rate of duty on -fortifying spirit still remains at 6s. 6d. a gallon, and this bill provides that 5s. of that amount shall be transferred to the trust fund under the proposed act. </para>
                    <para>During the last two years the money received from that portion of the excise duty on fortifying spirit transferred to the Wine Bounty Trust Fund, plus a small amount received from the excise duty on concentrated grape must, a commodity used to a limited extent in the manufacture of wine, has been more than sufficient to meet all claims for bounty at the rate of1s. a gallon. The amount received into the trust fund during last financial year was £193,196, and the amount paid as bounty was £167,872, showing a surplus of £25,324. </para>
                    <para>In this bill provision is made for a contribution from Consolidated Revenue of any amount up to £50,000 in any financial year, should the money received into the trust fund be not sufficient to meet all claims for bounty. This maximum contribution is considered to be quite adequate, as the indications are that the amount received into the trust fund from the extra' excise collections will meet all demands that are likely to be made. </para>

                    <para>It is unnecessary for me to traverse the history arid trials associated with the fixation of grape prices. Suffice it to say that, generally speaking, such procedure has been of inestimable value to grapegrowers. It has resulted in the generality of grape-growers receiving a reasonable price for all grapes produced, despite the fact that the Commonwealth Government has no authority to fix the price of grapes used in the production of wine sold on the domestic market. </para>
                    <para>Wine-makers, generally speaking, have paid prices for grapes fixed by the Minister for Customs under the various wine bounty acts since 1927 for all grapes processed, irrespective of whether such grapes were to be used for wine to be sold on the domestic market or exported overseas. </para>
                    <para>There is, however, a feeling of instability in such an arrangement, and numerous conferences have been called with a view to co-ordinating Commonwealth and </para>
                    <para class="block">State powers in order to achieve stability in this direction. It is understood that the Premier of South Australia has recently prepared draft legislation for submission to the Premiers of the other wineproducing States in the Commonwealth in an endeavour to achieve uniformity in this matter. It is also understood that the draft legislation is designed to control further planting of wine grapes. This control is a corollary of price fixation, when the industry affected by such price fixation is firmly established, for, if production as well as prices be not controlled, there is always a possibility of overproduction, owing to the security afforded by a controlled price. </para>
                    <para>There has always been a reluctance on the part of State governments to restrict production in any primary industry, but there is little doubt that the wine industry in Australia should be controlled in this respect, particularly if action be taken by the States to control the price of grapes used for the production of wine sold on the domestic market. The control of the price of all grapes produced in Australia would not be of benefit only to grape growers. Such action would be of immense value to wine-makers as it would, no doubt, protect the value of the present huge stocks on hand, which, in the main, have been produced from grapes paid for at the Minister's prices fixed under past wine bounty acts. </para>
                    <para>There are not many new provisions in this bill, but I shall refer briefly to the following new features: - </para>

                        </item>

                            <para>The time for payment for grapes has also been altered in the growers' interests. </para>
                        </item>
                    </list>
                    <para class="block">In the 1934 act definite provision was made requiring grapes purchased for bounty purposes to be paid for within a period of twelve months, and, if cash was paid by a prescribed time, a discount was allowed off the minimum price. This provision has been incorporated in this bill, but, whereas the first payment, for grapes under the 1934 act was due not later than the31st July next succeeding the date of delivery of the grapes, it is proposed in this bill to make the first payment due on the 30th June. </para>
                    <para>The harvesting payment has been fixed at £2 a ton, and it is considered that such a requirement is reasonable. Grape growers are put to considerable expense to provide wages for grape-pickers, carters, &amp;c, during vintage operations, which commence in February in most districts, and, as previous legislation has not required that a payment be made for grapes prior to the 31st July, the resources of many growers who, generally speaking, are not financially strong, have been severely strained. The harvesting payment provided for in this bill should afford some relief in this direction. </para>
                    <para>I have dealt with this measure on general lines. There may be points which will require explanation when the bill is in committee, but I am sure that honorable senators representing wine-producing States will appreciate the bill, and agree that during past years the Government has done much to assist the wine industry. </para>

                    <para>I shall traverse briefly the action which has been taken in the past with respect to shipbuilding, and the result of that action. Tariff protection on vessels up to 500 tons gross register was the method adopted as a means to encourage the construction of ships within a limited range. Vessels in excess of that tonnage were admitted free of duty. It is quite obvious that tariff protection has not succeeded in establishing the shipbuilding industry in Australia. Very few vessels within the protective duty range have been made in Australia in recent years, and a considerable time has elapsed since any commercial vessels exceeding 500 tons gross register have been built here. </para>

                    <para>Since the Government's proposals were announced early in August, criticism has been levelled at the scheme on the ground that it will not provide sufficient stimulus to the industry. The Government is quite frank in admitting that the scheme will not result in the construction in our shipyards of every vessel that may be required by Australian shipowners. Such a rapid development could not be expected. The real intention of this measure is to permit of the industry being built up gradually. This view is exemplified in the decision to limit, bounty payments at the outset to vessels of up to 1,500 tons gross register. If the industry concentrates on vessels up to that tonnage, the question of the construction of still larger vessels can then be determined in the light of experience. A very important consideration at the present time is that of finance. The Government's heavy war-time programme places a definite limit on the amount of assistance that can be granted to any individual industry. In these circumstances the provision of a sum of £50,000 per annum for ship-building is, I claim, commendable. Briefly, the position is that, the duties have not achieved the purpose for which they were imposed. The alternative approach is by bounty, and the Government's proposals provide for assistance over a much wider tonnage range than was covered by duties. Within the limited funds at the Government's command, the bounty proposals should give a stimulus to the ship-building industry. </para>
                    <para>Another point upon which the Government has been criticized is in respect of the proposal to admit free machinery, boilers and auxiliaries required in the construction of vessels on which bounty will be paid. Criticism is levelled on the grounds that free admission of such equipment will not result in additional employment being given in the appropriate industries'. Both the Government and the Tariff Board are fully seised of this fact in principle, but one cannot avoid the important consideration that if shipowners are to be induced to purchase vessels of local construction and freight rates are to be kept within reasonable limits, then costs must be kept as low as possible. The decision to admit this equipment free of duty cannot result in loss of employment in the boiler-making and engineering industries, because vessels required by Australian shipowners are at present purchased overseas, whereas some additional employment in the engineering industries must result from a building construction programme. 1 may mention that the United Kingdom Government admits duty free machinery and equipment for the construction of ships should shipbuilders in that country desire to avail themselves of the concession. </para>

                    <para>. - This subject, which is similar to others which the Senate has discussed during the strenuous times through which we have recently been passing, should, as far as that is possible, be approached with an absence of party feeling. On a previous occasion I said that we on this side of the chamber believe in our party, its platform and its policy, just as sincerely and determinedly as honorable senators opposite believe in theirs; but there are subjects which should very definitely be discussed without any exhibition of party political feeling. I say that earnestly because on occasions there have been regrettable exhibitions of party political feeling. In fact, not many hours ago there was a display of that nature which I consider disclosed very bad taste. In dealing with subjects of national importance it may be that I shall say certain things, in order to make the position of the Opposition clear, which may not be accepted in the right spirit. It is quite possible that my remarks could readily, but untruthfully and unfairly, be misrepresented. I firmly believe that any' political party which in a time of national emergency is not prepared, because of the fear of misrepresentation, to state definitely and unequivocally where it stands, is not worth its salt. I do not propose to display any timidity in making the position of the </para>

                <para class="block">Opposition clear on this subject. Let me say at the outset that the Opposition does not approve of the proposal to send a 2nd Australian Imperial Force of 20,000 men overseas to participate in the European war during the coming spring. The members of the Opposition realize the tremendous responsibility which the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> is carrying at the moment. We have already shown that we do not underestimate the great strain which must necessarily fall upon the gentleman who occupies so high and responsible a position in time, of war. 1 have read the right honorable gentleman's speech on this subject, and it appears that the decision to send this force overseas is based on what is contained in the following statement: - </para>

                    <para>What I have said will,I hope, afford the most eloquent answer to that broadcast German propaganda which keeps on hoping day by day that the British dominions are not at one with Great Britain itself. Once more,, an answer to that foolish hope will be made by Australian soldiers in Europe, by thousands of Australian airmen, and by the Australian Navy, which has, since the outbreak of war, co-operated fully with the British navy in the work of keeping the seas as clear as possible of the enemy. </para>

                <para class="block">That reason does not in itself justify us overlooking the danger which Australia, as an integral part of the British Commonwealth of Nations, is facing at the moment, and in no way justifies sending men beyond Australia, for military service. I ask honorable senators to visualize what may happen. Every day we have been hoping that the worst will not happen, but pious hopes will not prevent the situation from becoming worse. No one can claim to-day that the position in Europe has not worsened during the last few days, and has become decidedly worse during the last few hours. If there is one thing more than another that I should like to avoid, it is fanning the flames of pessimism or of war hysteria but in considering this subject we have to face actualities. I believe that the European situation is becoming worse. A few weeks ago we felt fairly certain that we knew who were our actual and potential enemies; but to-day no one can with any degree of certainty say what Britain is up against. If the worst should happen, how shall we fare in Australia if 20,000 men have left our shores? The men who are going are not weaklings, but have been specially selected because they possess the qualities necessary to perform the work for which they have volunteered. These 20,000 men have been very critically examined, including X-ray examination, to ensure that they are in the best possible physical condition. We know also that these men possess personal courage and a spirit of adventure; but does the Government realize that it is sending overseas shock troops which should be used for the defence of Australia? If, the worst should happen, what will be the moral effect on the people of this country when they realize that these men have embarked? By the time they have left our shores another 20,000 may be preparing to leave. What will be the morale of these 20,000 men who will be operating in a theatre of war next spring should they hear that Australian cities are being bombed? Surely they are not being sent overseas merely because German propaganda contends that there is no unity in the British Commonwealth of Nations ! That is not a reason why the man-power of Australia, should be depleted. </para>

                        <para>- Possibly, but. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain</inline> and other authorities said that, our best part in this war would be to protect, this portion of the Empire, and to leave Britain free to look after itself. When such statements were made not, one responsible person in Australia suggested that an expeditionary force should be sent overseas. If it were possible for Australia to send 1,000,000 men overseas we could not stop the German propaganda machine which is piling up lie upon lie. The Labour party is pledged to a policy. I know that it has been said that that is a disadvantage. Some honorable senators opposite are proud of the fact that they do not come into this chamber pledged. They are not nearly so proud as we are of the fact that we come here not as individuals, but . as members of a great party - the strongest party numerically  in  this Parliament, especially in the House of Representatives  -  to express not  our  own personal views, but the considered policy of the working class. We represent that section of the community which has incurred tremendous expense  and made terrific sacrifices during the last 50 years in order to send men to this Parliament, and to other parliaments, not to stand, fight and argue in supporting their own beliefs, but to give effect to the policy laid down by the Australian Labour party. </para>

He knows perfectly well that the policy to which the Labour party is pledged to-day has evolved out of our experience in the last war. Therefore, I ask the Assistant Minister not to hark back to events that occurred 25 years ago, because to-day we are living in a vastly different world. During the last quarter of a century, wonderful progress has been made, particularly in wireless broadcasting and aviation. </para>

Because the Labour party, of all political parties, has brought its policy up to date as the result of experience gained 25 years ago, am I being unreasonable when I ask Government supporters to bring their policy up to date, instead of sleeping in the past? They should not be political Rip Van Winkles. </para>

                        <para>- Surveying our history during the last quarter of a century. I am astounded at, and proud of, the fact that the men and women who laid down the policy to which we are adhering to-day, in spite of everything, were so far-seeing. Since September, 1938, the Labour party has again been reviewing its policy, and, as I stated in this chamber only a few days ago, our old policy, which has been made new by being brought up to date,has been submitted for ratification or rejection to every branch, both industrial and political, of the Labour movement in the Commonwealth. Those branches unanimously endorsed that policy without altering one syllable of the text. </para>

                        <para>- It is not; I ask the Assistant Minister to be fair. We submitted our declaration, which the Leader of the Opposition in the House of Representatives <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Curtin)</inline> repeated in the Sydney Town Hall only a few nights ago, to all component parts of the Labour movement. Not one branch was ignored; and the federation of those organizations was also asked to endorse or reject the policy. Each body unanimously accepted it. Whilst that fact alone is no valid reason for Government supporters to be impressed with our policy, I ask them to believe that we have every justification for adhering to it. We need not import into this debate any references to compulsion or. conscription, because the forces which we are discussing are wholly composed of volunteers. As that matter does not enter into the discussion, the only subject which is left for us to consider is the wisdom' of the policy of sending troops abroad. The Labour party claims that it is inconsistent with the real defence requirements of Australia. If, at the conclusion  of my remarks, Government supporters can show that the despatch of the expeditionary force abroad will increase the adequate defence of Australia, then my contentions must fail. The population of the Commonwealth totals approximately 7,000,000 men, women and children. From that number we must deduct the women, children, invalids and aged persons, because they cannot be called upon to defend the country. Admittedly, some women have worthily undertaken voluntary responsibilities in defence work, and I have no fault to find with them. Every credit is due to them. But the fact remains that the number of fit males who are not too old to accept the responsibility of service is not large. If the Government can convince me after that analysis that the remaining physically fit fighting men are in such numbers that we can afford to send them abroad, again my contention must be silenced. </para>

                        <para>- Some weeks ago thousands of volunteers entered militia training camps in various parts of the Commonwealth. Again, I have no occasion to refer critically to conscription or compulsion, because those men were volunteers. Since then, literally hundreds of recruits have come to us in tears because the Government found it necessary to reject them as unfit for military service. Can the Assistant Minister say whether they are included in the 400,000 men capable of bearing arms? I remind him that they all were of military age, and until they were submitted to two critical medical examinations, the Government honestly believed that they were fit to be members of the fighting forces. </para>

Admittedly, at the outset, only 20,000 men will be sent abroad ; but <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper,</inline> a soldier whom we honour for his participation in the struggle of 1914-18, knows that, so soon as we send 20,000 men from Australia to fight in the theatre of war next spring, we immediately assume the responsibility of supplying them with reinforcements in order to maintain their effective fighting strength. Even if the Government is right in sending this force abroad, what can be its value? If it does not answer the lying Nazi propaganda, what difference can 20,000 men from Australia make in view of the fact that tens of thousands of men are massed on the Western Front ? </para>

                        <para>- I am doing my best not to cast reflections upon anybody. Those 20,000 men, imbued with a spirit of adventure and the natural courage of a soldier, and both physically and mentally fit, are the flower of Australian manhood. Why, then, be cruel, unkind and untruthful by suggesting that I am saying anything which, by any stretch of the imagination, could be twisted to mean that I am slandering the men who have volunteered to serve abroad in the spring in a theatre of war ? It would ill become me to do so. I am over military age. If the safety of the nation depends upon the sending of those men to a theatre of war  next spring, I should go down on my bended knees and offer up a prayer of gratitude to' them . for having volunteered to fight. But because I honestly believe that the Government is depleting the manhood of Australia, to the detriment of the adequate defence of this wonderful counttry which has been so good to all of us, I should go down on my knees this afternoon, if it would do any good, and beg the men to stay with us, because we so ' sadly need them. If honorable senators who, like myself, are over the military age, do not believe that these men are required to defend Australia and that the women and children do not need them, send them abroad by all means, but do not attempt to shift the responsibility after they leave ! Send the reinforcements that will be necessary and leave this country naked to any potential aggressor! </para>

                        <para>- During the last war, 4.10,000 men enlisted in Australia, and 320,000 were accepted and sent abroad. Of that vast army, 60,000 men never returned and about as many have been inmates of military hospitals ever since. The coastline of Australia measures 12,000 miles. But the Assistant Minister claims that the despatch of 20,000 Australian troops abroad will not deplete our manhood. Although there are many vulnerable points at strategic positions, not only on the coast but also in ' the interior, the Assistant Minister asserts that I am wrong to suggest that the nien should be kept here. </para>

                        <para>- I did not. If in this matter I were expressing my own personal opinion, some of my friends opposite might claim that I had an ulterior motive. They might say that I hate war to such an extent that I am not prepared to stand for the policy of my party, which, as every one knows, is the adequate defence of Australia. But the position is otherwise. My views on this subject are widely held. Although I was not born in Australia. I love this land. I was bom in the Mother Country, of which we all are so proud, but I have lived in Australia so long that T do not know much about the land of my birth. My father and mother were born there and reared me here, and, if I may say it, they made a pretty good job of the business - physically I am sure, and mentally I hope. </para>

                        <para>- They taught me to hate war and to love peace. I have not obtruded my personal feelings in this debate this afternoon, but I repeat that I hate war and I love peace; also I love this country, which I consider has no equal on God's earth. In no other do the people enjoy to a greater degree that freedom of thought and speech which we value so highly. At the moment we are, as a component part of the British Empire, engaged in a conflict with Germany whose rulers do not believe in liberty and freedom and the employment of democratic institutions to which we have for so long been accustomed. Compared with many countries, and compared also with the possibilities of the Motherland, Australia is blessed of God. It is a wonderful land in which to live. We all ought to be proud to be citizens of the Commonwealth, and we should be jealous of the privileges which we enjoy. So I say that we should consider this issue, first and last, from the standpoint of the citizens of Australia. This country, 1 repeat, is worth defending. We should be willing to go to any lengths to make sure that we retain control of it. I believe that the Government of Great Britain would approve of what I am saying this afternoon if we were able to appeal to it. I believe that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chamberlain)</inline> - I would not negotiate with that scoundrel Churchill- </para>

                        <para>- I regard <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Churchill</inline> as a mad dog let loose for the purpose of spreading hatred where previously none existed. If I were authorized to speak on behalf of Australia, and if I said to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain:</inline> "Do you want us to help the British Empire to the extent of our capacity out there in Europe, or do you believe that we would better be employed and would better serve the interests of the Empire by making safe the country in which we  live and which is fo well worth retaining?", I honestly believe that he would say: " Months and months ago I told your  people  that one of the greatest contributions which von could make towards the security of the Empire was to make your own position safe, because when the testing time comes it is almost certain that we shall not be able to do very much in that direction ". 1 emphasize that we can make a far greater contribution to the security of the United Kingdom Government and the British Commonwealth of Nations by providing, to our maximum capacity, continuous supplies of food products and other necessaries. May I here add that the Minister for Commerce <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has, 1 believe, done a wonderful work during the last few weeks in arranging for the sale of so many kinds of Australian commodities to the United Kingdom Government, and I repeat that we can make a far better C011tribution to Empire security by developing our own industries, primary and secondary, and by doing all that is humanly possible to make Australia a self-contained nation. These are the lines along which our policy should be directed, instead of a futile demonstration, such as is contemplated, of sending overseas a force of 20,000 men. </para>

                <para>I.f, as 1 have said, these were my own " thoughts I could imagine that Ministers and their supporters would dismiss them with a wave of their hand. That would be unkind, but they would do it. But I have other and high authority for what I am saying. The first authority I shall quote is the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hawker,</inline> a captain of the old Australian Imperial Force, and an acclaimed hero in war and peace, but. particularly in peace. No man ever suffered more intensely than he did, yet he was never seen without a smile on his face. He and I were Australian delegates to an Empire conference at Lapstone, New South Wales, in September of lastyear just before <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chamberlain,</inline> the Prime Minister of Great Britain, made his famous trip to Munich. We sat side by side at that conference which comprised delegates from every part, of the British Empire, including Eire and India. Although politically we were opposed to each other, we sat together at that conference and whenever questions of Australian national importance were under review there was very little differ- once  between the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Hawker</inline> and myself. This is what he said on the 28th April, 1938- </para>

                        <para>- For that omission I apologize. We all have the greatest respect for the Minister, and we understand the onerous nature of the ministerial work that he has undertaken. He is a distinguished soldier, and has rendered great service to his country. Whether he thinks that I am right or wrong, I believe that deep down in his heart he knows that I am doing my best this afternoon to state Australia's case as an Australian who wishes to do his best for this wonderful country. The international situation has not improved ; on the contrary, it has become definitely worse, owing to the line-up of the various nations, and the economic blockade carried out by the Allies. We have brought into almsmen* a series of neutral countries from which we previously had nothing to fear. Countries like Italy and Japan were definitely holding off. While, perhaps, they did not declare themselves on the side of Great  Britain  and France, they distinctly said that they were not in the scrap ; therefore, they made it clear that they were not standing with Germany. </para>

                <para>Those who are conducting the campaign in Great Britain doubtless know what they are doing, but we should ask in what way Australia is affected by the latest .developments. To-day we do not know the real extent to which we shall be involved in defensive operations. We nave Sweden, Denmark; Belgium, Holland, Italy  and Japan to consider, and now we have the terrible news that Russia has marched into Finland. Can I be blamed if, on behalf of the Opposition, I ask the Government to accept the grave responsibility of considering what will be the final effect on Australia of this new lineup of the forces opposed to the Allies. I should be afraid to let Australia lose, not 20,000, but even 1,000 of its men. If we sent 20,000 troops overseas, it would soon be necessary to despatch another 20,000 to reinforce them, and then a further division, and 60 on, until we should perhaps have to send six divisions overseas, as happened in the last war. Atn I to be chided and jeered at as insincere, am I to be branded a traitor to Australia, and recreant to my trust as a member of this Parliament, because I plead with, all earnestness that the Government should not rob the women and children of this country of those splendid fellows whom it proposes to send overseas ? </para>

When I came here six years ago, I was a political youth, but I have acquired much wisdom through listening. I remember being impressed by three remarks by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings..</inline> One of them was that he regretted that it was a part of his duty as a member of Parliament to have to preach class hatred.

I do nor. propose to cover all of the ground that he has traversed, but I wish to place, perhaps in more correct perspective, some factors that have to be reckoned with in forming an estimate of the action taken by the 'Government at this time of great national crisis. I have referred to the fact that the Leader of the Opposition did not mention certain remarks made by me about twelve months ago on the subject of defence, when I expressed the opinion that it would not be necessary for Australia again to send troops overseas, except- </para>

                        <para>- Exactly. I did not think that the forces which are being called to life in the world to-day would be needed to cope with the situation that now confronts us. Australia has to take ite, own measures in defence, and to see that they fit in with those of the Empire. In sending this force overseas Australia is not only conforming to what is expected of it as a part of the Empire, but is also stiffening those forces to which we look for our protection and- safety. In this way we are backing up the people of the Old Country and helping £hem to realize that the battle which they are fighting is the battle of the Empire, and that the Empire is behind them. </para>

                        <para>- I have served overseas beside men of the British Army, and I have seen the Navy and the Air Force in action; and I know the comfort which the sight of comrades from the Dominions gives to them. In lending the use of its navy and in its attempt, to organize this tremendous air force, Australia is rendering a service to the Empire. Dealing with the question of man-power, the Leader of the Opposition treated with due importance the fact that 20.000 of the best of our young men are to be sent overseas. However, in the last war, 420,000 Australians volunteered, and of that number 330,000 went overseas. The wastage of over 20 per cent, as between the number who enlisted and the number who were sent abroad was due partly to faulty medical examination in Australia; the re3t was the normal wastage resulting from death, accident and disease. Dealing with the rejection of men after enlistment, I recall that in 1917 1 saw a draft of 500 men who had just arrived from Australia. At one glance, I, myself, rejected 75 of that number, and within the next three days the medical board rejected another 75 of them. The rejections were not due altogether to' the fact that the men were of a low type, hut mainly to faulty medical examination at this end. Figures I took out some months ago would suggest that at the present time we have in Australia about 2,000,000 male3 between the ages of 19 and 59, of whom over 9aU,000 are under the age of 35, and about 500,000 between the ages of 35 and 44. These are official statistics. When I said previously that we could count on putting 200.000 men in the field, I was underestimating the position, because we could find 500,000 men, and if hard driven as many as 800.000. </para>

                        <para>- It is more than we need. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition that the international position is worsening. It is useless to deny that fact. The daily news from overseas makes it clear that we shall be obliged to put forward increasingly greater efforts economically, and also as regards our man-power and output of material. In that work we must proceed according to a common plan, not only in association with the other dominions, but also in respect of whatever strategy Great Britain decides upon in fighting the battles of the Empire as a whole. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collings</inline> made a general statement regarding the policy of the Labour party, and, for the first time, I think, he made use of a statement which suggested to me, at any rate, that his party does revise its policy from time to time. </para>

If he were a bold leader of the movement, instead of merely its Federal mouthpiece, his speech on Monday night might have been made a rallying call to the nation and not have appeared as a tepid, hesitant reflection of the indifferently reconciled views of the political and union chiefs. What some nf those chiefs think in private <inline font-weight="bold">-Mr. Lang</inline> has not scrupled to say in public. Others are for a stronger line against Nazi aggression- </para>
                </quote><para>There was displayed at that time a lack of that unity, the value of which the Leader of the Opposition has stressed so much. I know that disunity is endemic; it flares up ' occasionally in the Labour party- </para><quote>
                    <para>The compromise between their opinions was apparent in <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin's</inline> address, though in fact the war policy he enunciated did not differ in substance from that which <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> had insisted on proclaiming at Pyrmont a week earlier. Neither <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Lang</inline> nor <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> believes that an expeditionary force, volunteer or conscript, should be sent from Australia, and both are opposed to compulsion for home defence. They differ about the nature of the war, but the contribution which they would make to its active prosecution is approximately the same. </para>
                    <para>That contribution is no more than the effective defence of Australia - a function which every threatened neutral is discharging in relation to its own protection. The Australian Labour party professes its readiness to continue to struggle for victory, but the struggling is to be done at a distance - on the side, hut not' by the side, of Britain; behind Britain, but 12,000 miles behind. This is surely an ignoble conception of the role that Australia should play in the war. It is one thing to say that no troops shall be sent abroad while they may be needed at home; it is quite another to affirm that in no circumstances shall we share the sacrifices which Britain and France will have to make if Australia is not to become one of the prizes of defeat. " There are no pretences about the Labour movement," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> says; "it stands for the victory of its own side and its  own country ". But the victory is to be won by others; Australia is simply to take the best possible care of itself. </para>

The Australian brand of democracy is not superior to theirs; the difference is merely that, while their troops hold the Maginot Line, our Labour leaders are free to prattle about the iniquity of obliging young men to train for the defence of their country. Here again they misinterpret the feelings of the Australian people. There is no real opposition to compulsory training, and there is a real desire that Australia should play its full part in the war for freedom and survival.

                    <para>.- On two or three occasions since I took my seat in this chamber, I expressed the opinion that, taking into consideration world conditions, it would be unwise to despatch a force overseas in the event of a world war, for the good and sufficient reason that the international situation would be quite different from that in 1914. I conveyed the impression that until sides were picked, or until we knew definitely what countries which were then sitting on the rail would do, Australia must he careful not to be stampeded into any extensive overseas land operations. The British Government, at the outset of the war and, indeed, before hostilities commenced on the 4th September last, informed our Government that Australia's best contribution to Empire defence was to be able to defend itself, provide its own. war equipment, and contribute as far as possible to the Empire's munition requirements. In coming to a decision to despatch a division overseas for service where required, the nation, I venture to think, will accept the Prime Minister's statement that he had received, a few days ago, specific and concrete assurances from the British Government that the international situation in this part _ of the world is less obscure. In the opinion of those responsible for the successful, prosecution of the war, the position has. been clarified. Their view of this unusual conflict is that propaganda fortified by action is preferable to the headlong sacrifice of millions of lives. The despatch of a voluntary Australian Imperial Force division from these shores will tend to combat the propaganda circulated amongst the German people, that the British Empire is not as united and determined as it was in 1914. For that reason, if for no other, I support the action of the Government, which should help the Empire to shorten hostilities. All this "shadow-sparring" on the western front for the past three months may be a. preliminary to a gigantic " allin " fight, or it may be an indication of reluctance on the part of both sides to reduce their man-power. "Who cannot say whether the enemies of to-day may be the allies of to-morrow, opposing the spread of communism. The climatic conditions in Europe to-day are not worse  than those of the winter of 1916-17, the severest winter in Europe for over 30 years; yet we fought through it. The impregnability of both the Maginot and Siegfried lines has caused a stalemate. Spring next year will no doubt bring developments of vital importance. </para>

                <para>Herr Hitler's nerve-wracking strategy is directed at neutral countries. The Allies, particularly the British Empire, are countering that strategy by a resolute determination to rid Europe of the Nazi menace with the minimum of bloodshed. A mighty empire air fleet can have only one impression on Hitler, and in turn on neutral countries. One Australian division is to be despatched as an empire gesture on moral grounds. That gesture will serve its purpose. I trust that honorable senators opposite will view the Government's decisions from that angle. They should not regard senators on this side of the chamber as jingoists, anxious to throw our young manhood into a furnace. On the other hand, my colleagues here must not mark the Opposition down as disloyal to the Empire. Both allegations are wrong. </para>
                <para>This vital question of Australia's defence and the paramount importance of the Empire's gigantic effort to bring the world back to normal are too serious for party quibbles or scare-raising bogies. </para>

                <para>Reference has been made this afternoon to domination ; but the policy which Great Britain and its allies have adopted covers a much wider field. It concerns the freedom and liberty of the peoples of every civilized nation. Honorable senators opposite should also remember that the Government which is controlling the affairs of this nation has decided to send a force overseas, but the members of that force have volunteered to serve in the interests of freedom and liberty. Australia in common with the other dominions is endeavouring to buttress in every way the efforts of those who are fighting that menace to the freedom of the civilized world. As the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> -said a few days ago, " The Government's primary consideration is the defence of Australia ". He then proceeded to tell the Senate that although the British Navy is actually our first line of defence, we as an integral part of the British Empire, should do our part- by sending overseas those of our valiant sons who are willing to fight for the freedom which we hold so dear. Surely the contribution which the Commonwealth Government is making should have the support of all political parties in this chamber. We are merely upholding those traditions which Britain has always upheld. We may be more radical and more liberal in our outlook than we were some years ago ; but we have to remember that in helping to defend Britain we are assisting a nation which has done more than any other to advance science, learning and culture. It is for the privileges that we possess that we are fighting to-day.I am not so much concerned with the despatch of an expeditionary force as I am with the broader outlook of Australian defence generally. In comparison with the activities displayed and , contributions made by other countries, our effort is not great. To-day, armed forces can be counted in millions. For instance, Japan has landed over 1,500,000 fighting men in another country. Surely we must see that our shores are protected, and that we have the utmost measure of security. Why is Australia not following the example of New Zealand, that valiant little country with a population of only 1,500,000, which is sending her sons overseas to strengthen the Empire? </para>

                        <para>- I do not care whether the war activities of this or any other British dominion are controlled by a Liberal or by a Labour government; we must consider this subject from a broader outlook. The great democracies of the world are realizing that if the Empire be defeated civilization will be doomed. The German people believe that if Britain falls it will be the end of British supremacy and Germany's path to world domination will be clear. Regardless of our political beliefs we must stand shoulder to shoulder with Britain, not only in our own interests but also for the sake of posterity. There are no political divisions in Great Britain today. There is no cavilling, and the leaders of all parties are standing behind the British Government. </para>

Honorable senators opposite are opposed to sending overseas men who are willing to risk their lives and their all in the security of the Empire. Do we realize that our security depends on the assistance afforded to Britain? The men who have volunteered for service overseas are willing to fight for that which they know to be right. I am as keen a pacifist as any honorable senator opposite. I would have supported the League of Nations in an attempt to prevent the invasion of Abyssinia; but it is useless to recall past controversies.

Eventually starvation may be threatening the people of Britain, the people of Germany - people of practically the same race as our own. The peoples of Central Europe are already suffering the pain and misery of war. If these brave lads are willing to share the burden that is. being borne by the Motherland and its great democratic sister, France, against the powers of aggression, no dissentient voice should be raised in an endeavour to prevent the despatch of the expeditionary force. Every encouragement should be given to the men in their determination to strike a blow for freedom.

                    J. McLACHLAN.And the Labour party was responsible in. 1929 for the disorganization of the whole of our defence forces. Now; when a few thousand gallant men offer to serve in a theatre of war, the Leader of the Opposition attempts to frustrate their loyal intentions by moving an amendment to the motion that " the paper be printed ", to the effect that the Senate is of opinion that Australia's man-power is required for the defence and the safety of the Commonwealth and is opposed to the despatch of expeditionary forces. Presumably if the Leader of the Opposition were given his way, Great Britain would receive no assistance from Australia, although it is guarding our shores against potential invaders. If enemy forces in Europe should pierce the Maginot line and triumph, the British Navy will be the last bulwark between them and ourselves. Let us pull together in this crisis. Do not . let dissension rend our ranks. I am not in accord with everything that the Government has done with regard to defence. In some of the higher reaches, I am entirely opposed to its policy, butat such a time, when our all is at stake and our freedom hangs in the balance, surely we should not quibble at the proposal to send 20,000 men, or even 100,000 men, to the assistance of those countries that are fighting for the preservation of democracy.

                    <para>. - This morning the contents of a letter from the Richmond branch of the Central Unemployment Committee were telephoned to me from Melbourne. They are to the effect that arrangements have been made by the Postmaster-General's Department to grant preference to university students for employment during the period of the Christinas rush. In previous years the department has granted that preference to unemployed returned soldiers. A returned soldier named Holt, who has been employed in the past by the department, made the usual application for engagement this year, but was informed, it is alleged, that preference would be granted to university students over returned soldiers. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Holt,</inline> I am informed, is also a member of the Militia. I should like the Assistant Minister to say whether it is the policy of the department to grant such preference to university students this year. If not, will he take steps to ensure that the previous policy of the department is adhered to? </para>
