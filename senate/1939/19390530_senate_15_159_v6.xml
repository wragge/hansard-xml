                        <para> I ask the Leader of .the Senate if ho will take steps to make available more readily to honorable senators, replies to those questions which may require some preparation in the departments. In many instances, the Minister states that the information is not available but that it will be supplied as soon as possible. In the event of the Senate rising for a week or ten days, as it.did on the 18th May, would it not be possible for Ministers to have answers to outstanding questions forwarded to honorable senators, instead of holding them back until the Senate re-assembles ?</para>

                    <para><inline font-style="italic"> by leave - </inline> Having rgard to various representationsthat have been made to it, the Government has given consideration to the proposal of the Australian Broadcasting Commission to establish a weekly journal. It desires to point out that it is improper for the Executive to attempt to overrule the will of Parliament as expressed in an act of Parliament. In the present case the law relating to the Australian Broadcasting Commission is contained in the Australian Broadcasting Commission act 1932. Section 5 of that act says - </para>

                    <para>For the purposes of tbia aot, there shall be a commission, to be known as the Australian Broadcasting Commission, which shall be charged with the general administration of this act. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>It is true that some other provisions of the act reserve control to the Minister in relation to certain payments by the commission, the issue of debentures by the commission, the appointment of certain officers and the like; but the fact remains that, speaking broadly, the administration by the commission within the terms of the statute is not made subject to political direction. Section 17 provides— </para>
                <quote>
                    <para>For the purpose of tlie exercise of its powers and functions under this act the commission may compile, prepare, issue, circulate and distribute, whether gratis or otherwise, in such milliner us it thinks fit, such papers, magazines, periodicals, hooks, pamphlets, circulars and other literary matter as it thinks fit (including the programmes of national broadcasting stations and other stations): Provided that, prior to the publication of any programme in pursuance of this section, a copy of the programme shall be made available at an office of the commission on equal terms to the publishers of any newspaper, magazine or journal published in the Commonwealth. </para>
                </quote>
                <para>This provision was debated and approved by Parliament; it could not be abrogated by the Government except under an amending act. It follows that what the Government is being asked to do is either to make the Australian Broadcasting Commission subject to political direction in the exercise of its power to publish a journal or to eliminate the publishing power altogether. The Government is not at present prepared to adopt aeither course. It believes tha control by a commission will be most conducive to the proper development of broadcasting, and it sees no reason for denying to the commmission the right to publish a weekly journal of a special broadcasting kind, since that right has practiaclly all over the world been treated as properly ancillary to broadcasting itself.  The Government has been informed by the commission that the proposed journal, which will combine the best features of the two publicationsof the British Broadcasting Corporation - <inline font-style="italic"> Radio Times</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Listener</inline> will contain a very full statement of coming programmes, reprints or talks given over the national stations, and articles of a special technical or cultural interest. In these circumstances, the Governemnt is of the opinion that the proposed journal is of a kind which the commission may properly determine to publish, and it is not prepared to ask Parliament to prevent such publication.</para>

Is it also a fact that these keepers are on duty for as many as 70 hours a week, and that they sometimes work from 6.30 a.m. to 11 p.m. without overtime pay ? If this be correct, does the Minister consider that they can render proper service when called upon to remain on duty for such long hours? </para>

                    <para> that the Senate, at its rising adjourn till 10:30 a.m. to-morrow.</para>
                    <para>I have submitted this motion because I deem the matter with which I shall deal to be of very great importance, involving as it does the expenditure of £1,000,000 of public money. Half of that sum has already been disbursed in connexion with the purchase of a building site, and the balance is proposed to be used for the erection of a new building to form a part of the Sydney General Post Office. This expenditure at the present juncture seems rather remarkable, in view of the fact that every other kind of public expenditure, however vitally necessary in the interests of the people, and particularly if it refers to any sort of social service, is being avoided, the only explanation offered being that the defence needs of the country are paramount and must have priority. It is also remarkable, in view of the fact that for a quarter of a century there has been a strong demand for a new general post office in Brisbane. That necessary work has been struck off the list because of alleged defence needs. I should like to make it clear that I a in not raising any objection to the construction of new postal buildings. It would delight me if two new post offices were constructed iu Sydney, provided they were necessary, and a new geueral post office were built in Brisbane, and wherever buildings a.i-e required for the efficient carrying on of the public service of this country, because of such undertakings a large amount of money is placed in circulation, and there is greater prosperity for those in tho community whom honorable senators on this side of the chamber represent. I do not wish it to be said that I am objecting to the expenditure of public money, because I am not, particularly when such expenditure provides the country with a national asset for many years to come. But the honour of this Parliament is now involved, and the negotiations leading up to this contract are of vital interest. We are informed almost continually that democracy is on its trial; but oneofthe surest ways in which to destroy the faith of the people of tho Commonwealth in our democratic institutions is to allow the honour of Parliament to be assailed without thoroughly inquiring iuto every charge made. I do not think that I can be regarded as a scandal-monger. I hold that we should not believe too readily those things which ought not to he true. Questions have been asked in this chamber, and in the House of Representatives, as to the position which Ministers of the Crown occupy in connexion with public companies and their shareholdings in such companies. I have before me a very instructive document— I do not propose to read from it this afternoon, because I have not the time—entitled Who owns Australia. I find, however, that prominent Ministers of the Crown in this National Parliament hold a pretty considerable slice of .Australia, but I shall have more to say on that point on some other occasion. Certain facts are in the public mind, and the negotiations associated with this contract must be probed to the bottom, regardless of those who may suffer. I shall Fie overjoyed if no one suffers; if it can be shown that nothing dishonorable has been done, and that no member of the Government has placed himself in a position where there is a conflict of interests. I am anxious only to elicit the facts. Iu connexion with the erection of additions to the Sydney General Post OfKee, alternative tenders were called for a building with a granite facing on the lower portion, and terra-cotta facing on the upper floors, and for gra.nite facing on the lower portion and sandstone facing on the upper floors. We all know what, granite and sandstone facings are, but I am not sure that all honorable senators know what terra cotta actually is. It is not the ordinary product, of the brickyard. It is an exclusive production of one Australian firm which is,definitely, a dangerous monopoly. I am bound to say, in justice to the ex-Minister for Works (Mr Thorby) that he did his job in this connexion thoroughly. I do not agree with all that that gentleman has done, but I a certain that at least he never errs on the side of lack of thoroughness in anything that he undertakes, and he did not err oh this occasion. He consulted .the Director-General of Works and carefully examined all the tenders, of which I 'believe there were about a dozen. A. sub-committee of Cabinet was then formed, consisting of the then Postmaster-General (Mr. Archie Cameron), the then Assistant Minister, now the Postmaster-General (Mr. Harrison), and the then Minister for Works (Mr. Thorby). That sub-committee studied the tenders very carefully, and Mr. Thorby, as Minister for Works, recommended the acceptance of the tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for £409,325. The present Minister for the Interior (Senator Foil) later arrived on the scene. Meanwhile, certain things had happened—certain changes had occurred—whic h had nothing to do with the tenders, but which have a great deal to do with the political raanoeuvrings which had been going on in the interim. </para>

                    <para>.- No doubt <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson,</inline> who has had some experience as Postmaster-General, would like to tell my story, but I propose to tell it in my own way. I am merely stating the facts. The approval given by the then Minister for Works has since been overridden or overlooked, and another tender of . £410,776, submitted by H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited, in which provision is made for terra-cotta facings, has been accepted. The story is a long one, and,if necessary, others can follow from where I leave off. There is a difference of only £1,451 between the two tenders, which in itself is somewhat sinister. Moreover, at least one contractor - I am not in a position to say whether there were more - complained that certain influences have been at work outside the jurisdiction of the departmental officers, which, in the language of the street, suggests wire-pulling or underground engineering. These charges are always made against those who accept the responsibility of government, and the surest way in which to prevent such charges, which have been made quite seriously by a member of the Government party in the House of Representatives, is to probe them to their foundations. That is all that I wish to do. Tenders were called in the Government <inline font-style="italic">Gazette,</inline> and by advertisement in the public press; that, I understand, is the usual procedure in order to save time. I want to know definitely whether the department responsible for any given work negotiates direct with private employers in order to ensure a reasonable number of tenders being lodged, or whether they leave this matter to private employers in the hope that they may see an invitation for tenders in the columns of the public press to the effect that certain Commonwealth public works are to be put in hand. If it is the practice of the heads of the departments concerned to interview certain contractors I want the names of the departmental officers and also the names of the firms interviewed. They may not have done this, but I cannot believe that a Commonwealthcontract costing approximately £500,000 is merely advertised in the public press and that the department interested simply depends on private contractors to see the advertisement in some obscure corner of a more or less prominent newspaper. I want to know exactly what the department does in order to call attention to these jobs? </para>

                    <para>. - While the debate was proceeding in the House of Representatives, a prominent Minister - and this I suggest is the sinister aspect of the whole business - told the House that it had been discovered that terra cotta could be produced more cheaply than had been anticipated, and that the Government had been assured by the contractor in question that it would get the benefit of any reduction of the price for that material. If that is true, all I can say is that it is an entirely new phase of contract practice. I am by no means a suspicious person, but I suggest that it is the easiest thing in the world for a contractor to submit a tender with the proviso that if, later, he can discover some way by which he can reduce his price, the department will get the benefit of the reduction. But has the Government never heard of extras in connexion with large buildings? It is safe to say that in a contract involving the expenditure of £400,000, the amount charged for extras will be stupendous. And does the Minister for the Interior believe that if under the conditions mentioned, a successful tenderer gives with one hand, he will not with the other hand, take back, with considerable addition? I have never been a contractor and have not had practical experence, but I would not be so silly as to be caught with that kind of chaff, nor do I believe that, up to the present, the department has been caught. However, I do know that these were the excuses - they could not by any stretch of the imagination be termed the reasons - for the rejection, by the present Minister for the Interior, of a contract formally accepted by his predecessor, in favour of the tenderer whose terms, we understand, have nowbeen accepted. </para>

                <para>We cannot afford to treat this matter lightly; it will be to our everlasting discredit if we do. Nor must this unsavoury business be glossed over by silence, or a hush-hush attitude on the part of the departments concerned. Thehonour of this chamber and of every indi- vidual member of it is involved. This is particularly true at the present stage in Australian affairs. Practically every newspaper is demanding publication of the reason why this thing should not be thoroughly investigated. No member of this Parliament, regardless of party affiliations, should allow this matter to rest until he is quite satisfied that nothing dishonourable has been done in connexion with it. Whatever means may have to be taken, however far we may have to go, and whatever delay may be involved in the carrying out of the work, nothing should be allowed to stand in the way until we have put in their proper position the men who have had the handling of this contract from the commencement of the negotiations.

It records that the State Government which, so far from being sympathetic with Labour ideals, is the supporter of combines and all the trickery which private enterprise knows so well how to put over the consuming public, is divided on the question of taking legal proceedings against the brick manufacturers' combine in order to prevent further exploitation of the people of New South Wales. </para>

                    <para>. - I cannot credit the Assistant Minister with being so ingenuous as he would like to appear. He has said that apparently the New South Wales Government is not a supporter of the combine. Does not the honorable gentleman know that the State Government would not have moved hand or foot but for the pressure of public opinion in New South Wales, due to the agitation by Labour members of this and the State Parliament against the excessively high price charged for bricks ? He must know that that Government has never been brought to heel except by pressure exerted from outside its ranks and for which the Australian Labour party has been responsible. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> which helps to keep this Government and State Ministers in their jobs, and represents the financial interests  which  provide their election funds, reports that the master builders have admitted that the whole position is serious. </para>

                <para>The Minister for the Interior, to whom this matter was referred last night in Sydney, said that the Government had no knowledge of the prices quoted by sub-contractors to contractors in connexion with the work. The Minister knows as well as I do -that in the case of a contract costing £400,000, contractors and sub-contractors get together and decide the prices for each section of the work. These people are complaining. One firm alleged that Lt had not received quotations from sub-contractors for the supply of sandstone until 40 minutes before the closing time for tenders. Of  course  it did not, because Wunderlich Proprietary Limited and the terra cotta combine were on the job. </para>

Additional allegations were made by the same and other speakers, to the effect that the prices of many essential articles were higher than they should be, the consumer suffering from the unprincipled methods of firms concerned only with the making of excessive profits. </para>

                <para class="block">We must know the truth about this business. If what I suggest is true, there exists an unholy combination which is preventing public works and private building operations from being done in the most economical way. That is why I want to know all about it. If some one by nefarious means is getting a rake-off - I go further and say that if some one is getting a rake-off within the law - I want to know, in order that action may be taken to stop it once and for all. We all know that more homes for the .people are urgently needed everywhere. Even in this capital city of Canberra, there is a waiting list of over 400 people. Most of these homeless citizens are in good jobs and are willing to rent houses in order to play their part in the development of this city. They cannot do this because home-building schemes are being delayed or held up owing to the cruel depredations of private contracting firms. But there is a greater evil; I refer to the existence of slum conditions in Canberra and elsewhere. We cannot expect to eliminate these slums by adopting a comprehensive building scheme, owing to the operations of thieving private enterprise companies and racketeers. My final appeal is that the Senate should insist on probing this unsavoury business to the bottom. If we do not act now, if the contract is finalized, we may, after the building is finished, he charged with being accessories after the crime. </para>

After the Postmaster-General had decided on a newbuilding, and the Government had approved of its erection, the Works Department was asked to prepare plans and specifications. In due course they were submitted to the Postmaster-General's Department for approval. The subsequent letting of the contract was largely a formal matter. As there has been a good deal of misunderstanding in regard to the contract for extensions to the General Post Office, Sydney, I propose to make a full statement in relation to the letting of that contract to H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited. The building was originally designed on the assumption that terra co'tta would be used for the upper portion of the Pittstreet frontage. </para>

                    <para>. - As some doubt existed as to the relative cost of terra, cotta and stone facings, it was decided to invite alternative tenders. Had the price of terra cotta been considered too high, the acceptance of a tender providing for stone could then have been recommended. It turned out, however, that the difference between the cost of terra cotta and the cost of sandstone was small, and consequently a building to be faced with terra cotta was recommended by the Director-General of Works. Tenders were also invited for a building without any facing at all, but the tenders for such a building were relatively so high as to be not worthy of serious consideration. This proposed work was first brought under my notice by the Director-General of Works a few days after I was appointed Minister for the Interior. He referred to a protest by the present Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison)</inline> against the decision of my predecessor, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby,</inline> to adopt a stone facing for the upper storeys of the building instead of the terra-cotta finish recommended by the Director-General of Works. </para>

                <para>I looked into the matter, and advised the Postmaster-General that I agreed with the view of my predecessor that stone should be used. This brought, further strong representations from my colleague, the Postmaster-General. On the receipt of these representations I discussed the . matter again with the Director-General of Works, and examined all phases of the problem carefully. Subsequently, I wrote the following decision to the Director-General : - </para>

                    <para>Confirming our interview  to-day  - when you asked me for an opinion on the J st May as to whether sandstone or terra cotta should be used in the facing of the new General Post Office in Sydney," I was not then fully acquainted of the" strong representations made by the Postmaster-General's Department and experts that terra cotta should be used, and not sandstone. </para>
                    <para>After representations being made to me by the Postmaster-General - by whose department the building will be occupied - and in view ot the fact that you, as Director-General of Works definitely recommended on the 20th March, 1039. that the tender of H. G. Whittle &amp; Sons Proprietary Limited for £410,776 for the building with a granite and terra-cotta face be accepted, I now approve of the lowest tender being accepted on the basis of your recommendation. </para>
                </quote>
                <para class="block">During my consideration of the problem as to whether terra cotta or sandstone should be U3ed, I had not been approached by any contractor or by any one on behalf of any contractor. I made my decision after I had read again the original recommendation of the Director-General of Works, and, in the light of it, I considered the further strong representations of the Postmaster-General as well as the fact that the difference, in cost was only £1,451 on a contract amounting to £410,000, where the sum allowed by the department for contingencies and unforeseen costs amounted to £15,000. One cleaning of astone-faced building would cost as much as the difference. I emphasize that in all my discussions of this work with the Director-General of Works; I did not know the name of any of the contractors or the prices submitted. When I subsequently looked into the amounts submitted by the tenderers I found that the lowest tender for terra cotta was that of H. G. Whittle &amp; Sons Proprietary Limited, and for stone, that" of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited. For the sandstone finish the tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited was lower than that of H. G. Whittle &amp; Sons Proprietary Limited by only £111. In respect of a terra-cotta finish the quotation of H. G. Whittle&amp; Sons Proprietary Limited is the lower by £755: The tenders of these two firms are very close indeed. All of the other tenders were much higher. </para>
                <para>On considering the matter subsequently, 1 was glad that when I made my decision in favour of terra cotta, I did so without any knowledge of its effect on any contractor, but purely in the light of the information placed before me. After all, it does not matter to me which contractor gets the work, provided he is qualified in every way to be entrusted with a work of such magnitude. In this case, both the tenderers mentioned, and indeed all the other tenderers, are well qualified. </para>
                <para>Unless the basic principle of contracts by public tender is to be departed from, the Government must give the contract to the tenderer who quotes the lowest amount for the work described in the plans, specifications and quantities, provided only that the lowest tenderer is satisfactory and competent to do the work. </para>

                    <para>. - In this case the tender of H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited is the lowest received by the department for a building faced with terra cotta, and to that company the contract must be given following the decision to use terra cotta. Accordingly, the company has been advised that its tender has been accepted. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In discussions in the House of Representatives there have been suggestions that a contractor has been allowed to alter his tender. That is not so ; no alteration of any tenderhas been made. It has also been suggested that fresh tenders should be called. There is no need to call for fresh tenders, and indeed it would be unfair to do so, now that the amounts tendered by some contractors have been published. </para>
                <para>I remarked that I had not been approached by any tenderer or on behalf of any tenderer, but it has come under my notice since I made my decision that, both H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited and John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited have complained to Ministers that they were not satisfied that they had been equitably treated by suppliers on whom they depended for quotations to enable them to complete their tenders. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grant</inline> complained that he was not equitably treated by the suppliers of terra cotta, whilst <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Whittle</inline> stated that he was not satisfied that the stone suppliers gave to him a fair deal. From information supplied to me it appears that John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited, one of the tenderers, has virtually a monopoly of sandstone in the Sydney district, and that that company placed other tenderers at a disadvantage through not supplying them with quotations for sandstone until a few hours before tenders closed. Tenders were called on a lump sum price basis, and the lowest tender was accepted on that basis. The fact that individual subcontractors may have quoted varying prices to different contractors is no concern of the Government. It may be that the suppliers of girders,plumbing work, electrical wiring and many other materials varied their prices, but the Government is interested only in the total sum submitted by thecontractor. Any dispute between tenderers as to relative prices quoted to them by sub-contractors is a matter for the tenderers themselves. </para>
                <para>Even if these complaints could be shown to be justified, it would still not be established that loaded quotations had been used by those who received them, in making up their tenders. In any case, the department is concerned only with the lump sum tendered. </para>
                <para>I have touched on these matters only because they have been mentioned in discussion. They had no influence whatever on my decision to use terra cotta, which, as stated before,was made as the result of the original recommendation of the department and the subsequent representations of the Postmaster-General's Department. I am satisfied that I acted on just grounds and in a proper way in approving of the acceptance of the lowest tender for a terra-cotta faced building. </para>

                    <para>. - Yes, but alternative tenders were invited for a building faced with sandstone, the reason being, as I have already stated, that it was thought well to have prices for an alternative material in case terra cotta should prove to be very much more expensive. Further alternative tenders were invited for a building with no facing at all. The two tenders for such a building were so high that they were not considered when the final decision was being made. ' That decision lay between terra cotta and sandstone, the difference between the lowest tenders being only £1,451. I have all along felt justified in accepting the recommendation of the Director-General of Works for a building faced with terra cotta. </para>

                    <para>I support the request of the Leader of the Opposition (Senator Collings) for an'investigation of this matter. The desire of the Opposition in the House of Representatives to have this matter thoroughly discussed was evaded bv the Government placing a motion relevant to the contract well down on the business paper. Therefore, some action in this chamber has become absolutely imperative. An inquiry would clear the air. Whatever comes out of this motion in this Senate or a similar one in the House of Representatives, a stigma will rest on some members of the Government. I agree with my leader that we should be careful to prevent a repetition of such a happening as that which we are now discussing. After all, we look to responsible members to do things in a proper way. It may be that some misunderstanding has taken place, or some wrong direction has been given, but it is due to the electors of the Commonwealth that the whole matter shall be cleared up. I see no reason why the Government did not agree to the reference of this matter to the Parliamentiary Standing Committee on Public Woi-ks. I su.irsrest that the inquiry should go further than has been suggested by my leader. It is not onlv a case of settling the dispute between John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited and H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited. I want to know why the Government did not know that an individual connected with H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited is a. well-known breaker of industrial conditions in the Australian Capital Territory, and that his operations here have been the subject of complaint bv four of the leading unions in Canberra, and have been brought prominently under notice by the Trades Hall Council. I wish it to be known that this man is one of those who undercut other contractors by reason of the fact that he is the sort of man who prevents his employees from getting their holidays and enjoying the leave conditions granted by the award. I have no desire to say anything which may injure him. I merely wish to draw attention to the fact that his methods have been brought under notice. He has been granted large contracts by the Government, one of the biggest being the construction of the Canberra High School. The departmental officials should know—i f they do not they are not worthy of their jobs— that this contractor is accused of seeking in every despicable way to evade the awards which operate in this Territory. If the inquiry suggested by the Leader of the Opposition be undertaken, these activities of H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited should be considered. This Government stands, as does the party to which I belong, for arbitration and the observance of the award conditions. If this -contract for the extension of the' General Post Office buildings in Sydney is given to this man, the industrial conditions will be easier to police there; but I do not believe that even there he can be prevented from doing the sort of things he has been able to get away with in Canberra.</para>

                    <para>.- This debate has afforded me an excellent opportunity at least to deal with one individual who, up to the present, has had a very fair run. I am not suggesting dishonesty against any Minister in connexion with this matter. It is only fair to recognize that with any change of government some muddling and misunderstandings may occur between Ministers and permanent heads. I am prepared to say that some misunderstanding may have occurred in this case. But doubts have arisen, and I suggest an inquiry into the matter would not be a very long job. I feel sure that such an investigation would result in general satisfaction not only to members of the Parliament, but also to the people outside. I repeat that this motion has become necessary, particularly as in the House of Representatives the Government acted unwisely in placing a motion on the subject at the bottom of the notice-paper. I believe that doubts have been cast on some of our officers or Ministers, and these doubts should be cleared up. I trust that the Government will consider the matter further. </para>

                        <para>- Throughout the honorable senator's speech nasty implications were made by using the words " if " and " but ". Vague references were made to outside influences. The honorable senator drew inferences without any knowledge of the subject. To me it was a case of putting the cart before the horse. The honorable senator had no information other than that gathered from what are perhaps doubtful sources. By the use of the words " if " and " but " he cast many nasty aspersions on the manner in which tenders had been handled by various Ministers and departmental officers. I suggest that the honour of Parliament would best be preserved by honorable senators making sure of their facts before making any allegations in this chamber. </para>

                <para>Let us examine the position as it was. I admit that my opportunity of knowing the facts is no greater than that of other honorable senators, including those opposite. We were not supplied with <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> reports in Sydney of the questions relating to this matter asked in the House of Representatives last week. The Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> has made a statement which clearly sets out the facts in relation to this matter. From that statement, I gathered that specifications were prepared by the departmental officers in accordance with the requirements of the Postmaster-General's Department, which will pay for, and occupy, the premises when completed. The departmental officers who prepared the specification preferred a building with terra-cotta facing. </para>

                    <para>. - The then Minister for Works approved of the tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited. I admit that he conferred with the Postmaster-General. When the matter went to the then. Minister for Works in March, he decided, on his own initiative, and, in my opinion, quite wrongly, that the tenders had been wrongly dealt with by the authorities handling them, and that sandstone should be used for the facing of the building. </para>

The departmental officers then brought under the notice of the present Postmaster-General the recommendation of its experts in favour of terra cotta, and he, rightly or wrongly, approved of their recommendation. I take it that the Minister responsible for the work - the Minister for the Interior - agreed with the Postmaster-General, with the result, that there was unanimity of opinion on the part of the Ministers and the experts. </para>

The whole of the handling of the tenders shows that terra cotta was favoured because the extra cost was negligible. The tender submitted by John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for a building with a terra-cotta facing was £750 in excess of a similar tender by H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited. </para>

                    <para>. - But the Government did not know that. No doubt either firm could have carried out the contract satisfactorily, but, as the tender of H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited was £750 lower, it was rightly accepted. I see nothing improper in the action taken by either the Postmaster-General or the present Minister for the Interior. The Postal Department should, in the main, decide the kind of building to be erected, and the facing to be used. Without being unkind to any former Minister or to the present Ministers concerned, I venture the opinion that they are not competent to say which type of building is most suitable for the requirements of the Sydney General Post Office. The experts in the department - the officers who prepared the specifications - are those who should have the deciding voice. Both the Postmaster-General and the Minister for the Interior should have been guided by their advice. I regard it as wrong for a Minister, however good his intentions may be, to approve of work not recommended by his departmental experts. </para>

                        <para>- I shall tell my story in my own way. It was suggested to me that all was not quite as it should be. I was asked by a certain person to make inquiries into the matter, and I remarked that it would be best to enlist the services of a Sydney member for the purpose. I approached a member of the House of Representatives, and asked him to make certain inquiries. He informed me later that he had been unable to find out much about .the matter, but that the tender for a building with terra-cotta facing had been accepted. In these circumstances it seems to me that an inquiry would be justified. I make no charge against H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited or any other firm. What has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> has been reported to me also. Viewing the position in the light of all the circumstances as I know them, either the former Minister for Works or the Minister for the Interior is in the wrong. When there is a doubt in the public mind, and when private persons are making statements which reflect adversely upon a public department, an inquiry should be held. A large expenditure of public money is involved, and these charges should not remain unanswered. If they were brought forward by irresponsible persons we could afford to ignore them, but, since they are made by men occupying responsible positions in the House of Representatives and outside this Parliament, they are worthy of notice. I suggest that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> himself would have everything to gain and nothing to lose by an inquiry. </para>

                    <para>ON. - I am amazed to find that the expenditure of such huge sums is governed by ministerial responsibility or prerogative, because in most of the States tenders of the magnitude of this one are submitted to tender boards consisting of responsible officers. When a State Minister signifies formal acceptance of a tender, it is usually on the recommendation of expert advisers, and the Government would probably have knowledge of whether, as in this case, a facing of terra cotta or sandstone was the more desirable. The Government, or a tender board, should have decided the nature of the construction before inviting tenders. There is no reason why a Commonwealth Government should call for alternative tenders. A house builder whose financial resources are not unlimited may call for alternative tenders in order to enable him to determine what type of construction he can afford, but a Commonwealth Government need not quibble over a mere £1,400. The department should make up its mind asto the form of construction before tenders are invited. </para>

Apparently this it not so. From what has happened lately, it would seem that much depends upon who happens to be the responsible Minister, or what government is in power. In this case, if the Lyons Government had. lasted a little longer, the contract for the erection of the Sydney General Post Office would, no doubt, have been finalized by the Postmaster-General immediately preceding the present holder of that portfolio. To my mind, there is something wrong with the system under which a contract for work involving the expenditure of over £400,000 depends upon who is the responsible Minister at the time. </para>

                    <para>ON.-I do not think that it is. In all British communities continuity of government policy in respect of some matters is expected, notwithstanding changes that may take place in the personnel of the ministry. There has not been this continuity ofpolicy in connexion with the Sydney building, although ten members of the Lyon3 Ministry are in the present Government. I believe that it would be in the interests of the Government, of contractors, and of the public generally if the procedure outlined by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. McLachlan were applied to all requirements of the Commonwealth departments, including postal buildings. It is not fair to expect a Minister of his own knowledge to be able to determine whether a building should be faced with terra cotta or sandstone. I admit that if the decision had rested with me, a layman possessing ordinary knowledge of everyday affairs, my choice would have  been for sandstone in order to ensure conformity with the existing building. I would emphasize that after the closing date for tenders <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby,</inline> who was then Minister for Works, definitely approved of the acceptance of a tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for a building faced with sandstone at a cost of £409,325, that tender being the lowest received. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> argued that if the department preferred terra-cotta facing for the building, terra cotta it should be. Clearly the trouble is not about the amount involved, because the difference between the prices is, I understand, only £1,451. The fact is that the department wanted terra cotta,' but <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> preferred sandstone. With the change of government, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Harrison</inline> became Postmaster-General and said " terra cotta ". I do not know whether that honorable gentleman is using terracotta facing for the new and beautiful home which he is building on a site overlooking Sydney Harbour. I understand that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Foll</inline> declared for sandstone, but, being an impartial gentleman, he responded to pressure which was brought to bear upon him in the way of representations with regard to the respective merits of sandstone and terra cotta, and finally he declared in favour of the United Australia party and terra cotta as opposed to the Country party and sandstone. Thus we have had all this storm because the Country party broke with the United Australia party. This dispute and the disclosure of details in connexion with the contract show the length to which profitmongers among private contractors will go to secure their ends. If the workers did what these contractors do almost every day of the week, they would probably be arraigned before a court and charged with some misdemeanour. Perhaps they would be made subject to the " dog-collar " act. But the contractors and their friends can do all .those things with impunity. </para>

                <para class="block">This dog fight between the contractors is interesting to the workers. It has brought out the fact that one contractor has a monopoly of certain materials. We have been told - I believe by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> - that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Grant, the principal of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited, one of the tenderers, has a monopoly of sandstone and can make it extremely difficult for other tenderers to compete with him. Other tenderers were thousands of pounds above the offer of this firm. The disclosures arising from the quarrel between the contractors provide the workers with evidence of what goes on. Apparently, terra cotta is a monopoly of Wunderlich Limited. According to the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> the organ of what <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. King</inline> O'Malley once described as the "guilt spurred roosters ", the makers of terra cotta showed a certain amount of favoritism. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Grant</inline> is reported to have said -  " The terra cotta,"he said, " can be supplied only by Wunderlich Limited, and is the monopoly of that firm. The price quoted by that firm to John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for the supply of the terra cotta was £13,150, whilst for the same quality and quantity of material the price to H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited was £10,522, a difference of £2,632 against John Grant and Sons." </para>

                    <para>.- The answer of Wunderlich Limited to that charge is most interesting and enlightening. The manager of that highly moral firm stated that the firm made a discrimination in quotations to building contractors who were sandstone merchants and those who were not -  " The price quoted to the firms of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited, and Beat Brothers Limited, both of whom have controlling interests in sandstone quarries, was £13,150," <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Taylor</inline> said, "the price quoted to ten other contractors, who are not interested in stone quarries, including H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited, was identical at £10,522. The difference in these quotations was admittedly to secure the contract for terra cotta instead of sandstone." </para>

                <para class="block">In that statement we have evidence of a struggle between monopolists in order to obtain a certain contract. I do not know whether the Commonwealth Government supports monopolies, but my leader has pointed out that the present government in New South Wales does. We have here an example of the way in which monopolies work. There is a deliberate discrimination by one monopoly against certain contractors who erect buildings of sandstone, and similar discrimination by a competitor against the users of terra cotta. This most interesting situation should be studied by every worker in Australia. </para>

It cannot be said that candidates in Senate elections attempt to under-cut one another, for all who are elected are paid at the samerate. I hope that we all earn whatwe receive, although when I look at some honorable senators opposite I have some doubt on that point. It is true, however, that we do not submit tenders,or offer to do the work for less than the recognized amount. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays has a keen sense of humour, but I shall not be side-tracked by it, although I appreciate it. It is indeedwell that in this august assembly there are some honorable senators gifted with a sense of humour. On this occasion, however, the honorable senator's humour is misplaced. I shall not say more to-day. because another motion will be before the Senate to-morrow, when, possibly, I shall avail myself of the opportunity to express myself at greater length. </para>

                    <para>. - I have not had an opportunity to peruse it. My remarks are directed to the explanation given by the Minister to-day, which conflicts with that given in the House of Representatives by the former Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby.</inline> Which am I to accept as correct? I have heard itsaid that contracts were altered. That has been denied by the Minister this afternoon. Like his colleague, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> I have no doubt that, if he held ministerial office, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> would acquiesce in everything submitted to him by departmental heads. I feel sure that if <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> ever reaches the exalted office of Minister of the Crown, the departmental heads will welcome him. The Parliamentary Standing Committee was established to inquire into matters such as this. Why was not this alteration of the proposed plans for the facing of the building referred to that body? Honorable senators are not able to decide what are the facts. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, who says that no member of this chamber is competent to give a decision as to whether the building should be faced with terra cotta or sandstone, does not know which side he stands on. We know that the former Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> made a certain decision in regard to it after considering the representations made by departmental officials. I have no doubt that he took fully into consideration the extra cost of maintenancethat the use of sandstone would entail. I make no insinuation against the present Minister for the Interior when I say that, in my opinion, the question of the cost of maintenance was an afterthought, and that the real conflict of opinion was in regard to the tenders submitted. My only interest in this matter is to preserve the honour of this Parliament. I believe that if SenatorWilson's criticism of the Leader of the Opposition was inspired by motives of fairness, he should vote for this motion in order that the whole facts might be disclosed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein</inline> stated his views very emphatically, and I am just as much entitled to accept them as those of the Minister. He said that if he were a Minister of the Crown he would approve of the recommendations of his expert officers. On the contrary, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald says that no honorable senator is competent to express an opinion regarding the relative merits of sandstone and terra cotta. When such conflict of opinion exists among honorable senators opposite, what reason is there for opposition to the proposal that the whole matter be referred to the Public Works Committee, a body composed of members of both Houses of Parliament, for inquiry and report? I admit that I am not conversant with what actually took place when <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby</inline> madehis decision, nor am I conversant with the recommendations of the expert officers; but I should like to know the real reason for altering a decision already arrived at. The Minister for the Interior has said that the original decision was reversed because of the excessive cost of maintenance of a sandstone facing. </para>

                    referred to the desirability of policing public contracts, and drew attention to the way in which some contractors avoid their obligation to observe award conditions. I regret that that matter has been introduced into this debate. In my opinion it is the duty of the Government to police all Government contracts, particularly for the supply of defence materials, and not to leave it entirely to the unions concerned to see that award conditions are observed.

                    <para>.- I have had occasion to discuss this aspect of public contracts with the Works Director in Perth. At present certain contract work is being carried out for the Government at Carnarvon by an Afghan who was formerly on the dole. The fulfilment of even a small contract requires a certain amount of capital. The Government should inquire how this man, who was formerly on the dole, was able to finance his contract. There are many ways of evading the law. On occasions I have had to impress upon the Works Director in Perth that, as a responsible officer of the Commonwealth, he has an obligation to see that the clauses of contracts relating to the observance of award conditions are complied with. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> is so concerned about the reputation of this Parliament, what possible objection can he have to the holding of an inquiry into this matter? </para>

This expenditure at the present juncture seems rather remarkable, in view of the fact that every other kind of public expenditure, however vitally necessary in the interests of the people, and particularly if it refers to any sort of social service, is being avoided, the only explanation offered being that the defence needs of the country are paramount and must have priority. It is also remarkable, in view of the fact that for a quarter of a century there has been a strong demand for a new general post office in Brisbane. That necessary work has been struck off the list because of alleged defence needs. T should like to make it clear that I a in not raising any objection to the construction of new postal buildings. It would delight me if two new post offices were constructed in Sydney, provided they were necessary, and a new  general  post office were built iti Brisbane, and wherever buildings are required for the efficient carrying on of the public service of this country, because of such undertakings a large amount of money is placed in circulation, and there is greater prosperity for those in the community whom honorable senators on this side of the. chamber represent. I do not wish it to be said that I am objecting to the expenditure of public money, because I am not, particularly when such expenditure provides the country with a national asset for many years to come. But the honour of this Parliament is now involved, and the negotiations leading up to this contract are qf vital interest. We are informed almost continually that democracy is on its trial; but one of the surest ways in which to destroy the faith of the people of the Commonwealth in om1 democratic institutions is to allow the honour of Parliament to be assailed without thoroughly inquiring into every charge made. I do not. think that I can be regarded as a  scandaImonger.  I hold that we should not belie  to  too readily those things which ought not to be true. Questions have been asked in this chamber, and in the House of Representatives, as to the position which Ministers of the Crown occupy in connexion with public companies and their shareholdings in such companies. I have before me a very instructive document - I do not propose to read from it this afternoon, because I have not the time - - entitled <inline font-style="italic">Who owns Australia.</inline> I find, however, that prominent Ministers of the Crown in this National Parliament hold a pretty considerable slice of Australia, but I shall have more to say on that point on some other occasion. Certain facts are in the public mind, and the negotiations associated with this contract must be probed to the bottom, regardless of those who may suffer. I shall Fie overjoyed if no one suffers; if it can be shown that nothing dishonorable has been done, and that no member of the Government has placed himself in a position where there is a conflict of interests. I am anxious only to elicit the facts. In connexion with the erection of additions to the Sydney General Post Office, alternative tenders were called for a building with a. granite facing on the lower portion, and  terra-cotta  facing on the upper floors, and for granite facing on the lower portion and sandstone facing on the upper floors. We all know what granite and sandstone facings are, but I arn not sure that all honorable senators know what terra, cotta actually is. lt is not the ordinary product, of the brickyard. It is an exclusive production of one Australian firm which is, definitely, a dangerous monopoly. "I am bound to say, in justice to the ex-Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby)</inline> that he did his joi) in this connexion thoroughly. I do not agree with all that that gentleman has done, but I am certain that at least he never errs on the side of lack of thoroughness in anything that he undertakes, and he did not err oh this occasion. He consulted the Director-General of Works and carefully examined all the tenders, of which I believe there were about a dozen. A sub-committee of Cabinet was then formed, consisting of the then Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Archie Cameron),</inline> the then Assistant Minister, now the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Harrison),</inline> and the then Minister for Works <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Thorby).</inline> That sub-committee studied the tenders very carefully, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Thorby,</inline> as Minister for Works, recommended the acceptance of the tender of John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited for £409,325. The present Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> later arrived on the scene. Meanwhile, certain things had happened - certain changes had occurred - which had nothing to do with the tenders, but which have a great deal to do with the politicalmanoeuvrings which had been going on in the interim. </para>

                    <para>.- I support the request of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> for an "investigation of this matter. The desire of the Opposition in the House of Representatives to have this matter thoroughly discussed was evaded bv the Government placing a motion relevant to the contract well down on the business paper. Therefore, some action in this chamber has become absolutely imperative. An inquiry would clear the air. Whatever comes out of this motion in this Senate or a similar one in the House of Representatives, a stigma will rest on some members of the Government. I agree with my leader that we should be careful to prevent a repetition of such a happening as that which we are now discussing. After all, we look to responsible members to do things in a proper way. It may be that some misunderstanding has taken place, or some wrong direction has been given, but it is due to the electors of the Commonwealth that the whole matter shall be cleared up. I see no reason why the Government did not agree to the reference of this matter to the Parliamentiary Standing Committee on Public Works. I suggest that the inquiry should go further than has been suggested by my leader. It is not only a case of settling the dispute between John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited and H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited. I want to know why the Government did not know that an individual connected with H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited is a well-known breaker of industrial conditions in the Australian Capital Terri tory, and that his operations here have been the subject of complaint bv four of the leading unions in Canberra, and have been brought prominently under notice by the Trades Hall Council. I wish it to be known that this man is one of those who undercut other contractors by reason of the fact that he is the sort of man who prevents his employees from getting their holidays and enjoying the leave conditions granted by the award. I have no desire to say anything which may injure him. I merely wish to draw attention to the fact that his methods have been brought under notice. He has been granted large contracts by the Government, one of the biggest being the construction of the Canberra High School. The departmental officials should know - if they do not they are not worthy of their jobs - that this contractor is accused of seeking in every despicable way to evade the awards which operate in this Territory. If the inquiry suggested by the Leader of the Opposition be undertaken, these activities of H. G. Whittle and Sons Proprietary Limited should be considered. This Government stands, as does the party to which I belong, for arbitration and the observance of the award conditions. If this contract for the extension of the' General Post Office buildings in Sydney is given to this man, the industrial conditions will be easier to police there; but I do not believe that even there he can be prevented from doing the sort of things he has been able to get away with in Canberra. </para>

In his opening remarks he mentioned that the honour of the Parliament was involved as the result of the way in which tenders had been handled. He went on to say that, if departmental officers gave certain tips by way of information to contractors that was entirely wrong. With that we all agree; but the honorable senator did not even say that suggestions of that kind had been made.  His  whole speech was punctuated by " ifs " and " buts ". </para>

                <para>SenatorDEIN.- The fact that the Leader of the Opposition denies that statement does not necessarily prove its inaccuracy. However, as the cost of terracotta facing might have proved prohibitive, alternative tenders were called for a similar building with sandstone facing on the Pitt-street frontage. When tenders were received, the difference amounted to £1,451, and, when the departmental officers saw such a slight difference, they were, I presume, pleased, and immediately decided in favour of a building faced with terra cotta. Unfortunately, the then Minister for Works, on his own initiative, decided that the departmental officers were wrong, and that their recommendation should not be accepted. Accordingly, he approved of a sandstone facing. </para>

                    <para>. - Before debating this matter further I suggest that we should hesitate and do a little clear thinking. How many members of this chamber are in a position to know exactly which would be the better contract to sign - that forsandstone or that for terra-cotta facing? The point that has been exercising my mind is the suspicion that has been created in the minds of the public by the fact that the first decision in favour of one tenderer was later reversed in favour of another tenderer. The position should be clarified. There is no reason why the Government should not accept the proposal of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> and allow the matter to be fully investigated by the Public Works Committee. I have not the slightest doubt that there is no justification for any suspicion against Ministers or heads of departments. If, as I believe, everything is perfectly clear and above board, why should there be any disinclination on the part of the Government to permit that committee to investigate the tenders and report to Parliament? </para>

The suggestion has been made, due largely to what I believe was a mis-statement by a former Minister in the House of Representatives, that there has been an alteration of one of the tenders. It would be easy for the Public Works Committee to peruse the tenders and to note the dates on which they were submitted.

                    <para>. - In following the debate on this motion I have been struck most forcibly with the light and easy manner in which over ?400,000 can be obtained to make additions to the Sydney General Post Office, when, for ten years, . the erection of post offices in country districts has been deferred owing to an alleged shortage of funds. Apparently, there is no difficulty in acquiring an expensive site to increase the accommodation at the Sydney General Post Office, and to make available over ?400,000 for a new building. There is no difficulty whatever in accepting tenders involving huge amounts, or even in changing the contractor, when there is a change of ministry. The action of the Government amazes me, particularly when I recall the brokendown, ant-eaten wooden buildings serving as post offices in many of the important out-back centres. Hardly a newpost office has been built in any country district in Western Australia for the last <inline font-style="italic">ten</inline> years. When we ask for a new building we are told that money is needed for defence purposes, but it is easy for the Government to provide a huge sum of money to increase the accommodation in a general post office in the capital city of an eastern State. Tenders are even approved by the Minister before the Government has received the authority of the Treasury. </para>

                    <para>. - The debate this afternoon has been extremely entertaining, and I feel sure that the remarks of honorable senators will be read with interest by a large number of people who support the Labour movement. I refer, of course, to the workers. According to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Dein,</inline> all this trouble in connexion with the proposed additions to the General Post Office in Sydney would have been averted if a certain Cabinet Minister had been a rubber stamp. On the other hand, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Johnston</inline> has told us that the trouble would not have occurred if there had not been a split in the Tory parties supporting the Government; that is to say, if the Country party had continued itsassociation with the Ministry the proposed building would have been faced with sandstone and not terra cotta. Because of this split in the - parties supporting the Government, sandstone went by the board and terra cotta has been accepted. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am glad that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has  brought" this matter before the House. He has stated that the honour of the Parliament is involved. I think that any accusation, or suggestion, of impropriety on the part of a Minister, is a matter which properly should be brought before Parliament. I agree with the honorable gentleman' that this matter must not be glossed over. Obviously, Parliament is the proper place in which to ventilate a matter of this kind." I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> that the charges which have been made should not remain unanswered. However, the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> has not only given a complete explanation of the facts in relation to this transaction, but also has offered to every honorable senator an opportunity to inspect the documents relating to it. He could not have been more open that he has been. There is no necessity to appoint a select committee. Any honorable senator who thinks that there is something wrong in connexion with this undertaking has a duty and responsibility to himself and to the people; he should investigate personally anything which, in his opinion, might affect the honour of Parliament or of any Minister of the Crown. I very much regret, however, that the Leader of the Opposition, and particularly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> should have made accusations under the cloak of privilege, without one tittle of evidence to support them. </para>

I made it quite clear that the Postmaster-General's Department was insistent that the building should be faced with terra cotta, and that the Works Department conceded to the Postmaster-General's Department the right to decide which type offacing should be used, provided that the difference in cost between the two facings was not too great. </para>

                    <para>- Although that had some effect on the decision made, the principal reason why terra-cotta facing was preferred, was that the building was originally intended to be faced with terra cotta. After, all, the cost of facing is only small in comparison with the total cost of a building. </para>

                    <para>. - I join with other honorable senators in complimenting the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> upon having brought this matter before the chamber, because I feel that, if there is a doubt in the minds of members of the Parliament or of the public with regard to departmental tenders, the fullest publicity is desirable. But the Leader of the Opposition, in submitting his motion, did not long continue on that high plane. He could not resist the opportunity to introduce matters quite irrelevant to that for the discussion of which this motion was submitted. Almost at the outset he referred to social services, which have nothing whatever to do with the letting of tenders for public works. From the subject of social services he went on to that of the Brisbane General Post Office, which can hardly be linked up with the letting of tenders for additions to the Sydney General Post Office. In his speeches the honorable gentleman cleverly contrives to cover a good deal more ground than should be traversed under the terms of the motion before the Chair, but we may expect these little digressions by the Leader of the Opposition, who, no doubt, feels called upon to oppose the majority of the actions of the present Government. It seems to me that the real object of the Opposition in not confining its remarks to the particular matter under discussion was shown by the speech of the  Deputy  Leader <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane),</inline> who immediately went on to speak of the wages and other industrial conditions likely to prevail in connexion with the contract. He expressed fear that the successful tenderer would not observe the award conditions. I point out that clause 21 of the form upon which all such contracts  are let contains all necessary provision for the protection of the workmen employed. I give to the industrial officers of the various organizations credit for their work in policing the awards of the courts. At least one inspector was appointed by a government of the same political colour as that now in office to police the awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court, and I suggest, with great regret, that breaches of the industrial laws are not confined to any one section. </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>In the discussion of the tenders for the additions to the Sydney General Post Office, it was stated that Wunderlich's Limited had a monopoly of the terra cotta industry. This is quite true. It was also stated that John Grant and Sons Proprietary Limited has a monopoly of sandstone, which is also correct. We then heard a statement that had been published in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald,</inline> read by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown,</inline> who set out to expose the nefarious operations of monopolies. Prior to that, a most astounding accusation was made by the Leader of the Opposition, who charged this Government, and ministries of a similar political colour, with being the supporters of monopolies and the exploiters of the public. When, by interjection, it was pointed out that action against mono.polies had been taken in New South Wales by a government of the same political shade as that in office in the Commonwealth, the Leader of the Opposition had the temerity to say that that Government's action was due entirely to the pressure of public opinion. It would be difficult to show that the opposition party had made any substantial contribution to the control of monopolies. I direct " attention to the fact  that on three successive occasions when the people have expressed -their opinion through the ballot box, they have shown in no uncertain manner that they have confidence in the ability of the parties now in office to protect their interests. The Opposition has no cause for exultation over the result of the two latest by-elections. </para>
                <para>The suggestion has been made that the decision in regard to the contract for the additions to the Sydney General Post Office was reversed because  of certain ulterior influences. Honorable senators opposite have said that the accusations are not directed against anybody on the Government side of the chamber; yet the Minister for the Interior <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Foll)</inline> was responsible for the reversal of the decision of an earlier Minister for Works. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Wilson</inline> that the desire of honorable senators opposite to elicit information is entirely praiseworthy, but it seems to me that they are also anxious to indulge in party propaganda. They want an inquiry to be held, so that they may be able to pose before the electors as the upholders of the rights of the people. My party is just as sincere as that of honorable senators opposite in its desire to preserve the rights of the public in connexion with contracts for public works and all other administrative acts. </para>

                    <para>. - The real issue is not whether the new building should be faced with terra cotta or sandstone, but whether there has 'been any irregularity in connexion with the letting of the contract. Suspicion has been aroused because newlyappointed Ministers interfered with and vetoed the decision of their immediate predecessors. In consequence of statements published in the press, justifiable doubt has been engendered in the minds of the people's representatives in this Parliament and of the public throughout Australia. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> has proposed a way in which to remove all suspicion. We arc not concerned with the wranglings between past and present Ministers. </para>

This document is the latest and worst insult that could be offered to this Parliament. I ask the Leader of the Senate to convey to the Prime Minister what I have said about it to-night. Surely the Commonwealth Government printing office in Canberra can carry out this class of work. There was ho need to send it to Melbourne to be done. </para>

                    <para>.- A fortnight ago I asked "upon notice a question concerning unemployment. I wished to direct the attention of the Government to the increase in Victoria since 1st January last, notwithstanding that hundreds of men had been absorbed under the Defence programme. I desired to know if the Government had any long-range plan, corresponding to that of the British Government, for coping, in co-operation with State Governments, with the undoubted increase of the unemployed when its defence programme was finished. The answer to my question was not satisfactory. I expected the Minister to say that the Government <inline font-style="italic">was aware</inline> of the increase of unemployment, and that the Prime Minister, in spite of the Government's limited powers under the Commonwealth Constitution, would meet State Premiers in conference, in order to come to some workable arrangement for dealing successfully with this vital problem. Instead, I was supplied with statistical percentages over a period of given quarters. The figure, 9.8 per cent., for the last quarter, was slightly higher than that for any quarter in 1938. No doubt that increase was due to the severe drought which Victoria had recently experienced, and the low overseas price for wheat. These official figures are certainly a guide, but not a true indication, of the number of unemployed. They record only the number of trade unionists registered for employment; they do not take into account the number of trade unionists who have drifted into other avenues of temporary or seasonal employment, the thousands of young fellows who never had the opportunity to qualify for admission to a trade union, and hundreds of returned soldiers not on pension who are capable of doing a good day's work. If, to the official figures, be added, roughly, 38,000, a truer picture will be presented. If that number be reduced by, say, 7,000 persons who are unemployable, due to physical disability or " work-shyness ", it would still be far -too high. What will the position be three or four years hence, when the defence programme is completed, and hundreds are thrown back on to the skilled and unskilled labour market ? </para>

                <para>During the last recess I had brought forcefully home to me the great number of men who are out of work. Over 400, the majority of whom are returned soldiers, sought my assistance in getting employment at the munitions establishments at Footscray and Maribyrnong. I did what I could for them. How many were placed I have no means of knowing. No doubt other Victorian senators were similarly approached, and probably had to listen, as I did, to men in desperate straits, wives pleading for t e husbands, and young men asking for a chance to earn their keep. What is to be done about this problem? Senators opposite claim with all sincerity that a 40-hour week or less is the remedy. Senators of this side, equally sincere and capable of expressing an opinion, hold the view that a shorter all-round working week would only intensify the trouble, and lead the country into greater difficulty. </para>
                <para>Successive federal governments since the depression eight years ago are to be commended for having placed the nation on a sound footing. Tariffs and world prices of wool and lesser export commodities have, of course, contributed to the country's stability. The official percentages of registered trade unionists out of employment have gradually dropped since 1931 from 32 per cent, to 9 per cent. Numbers of new factories have been established and many big employing enterprises launched. The value of production has increased year by year, yet the latest figures show that in Victoria - a great secondary industry State - about 38,000 men are out of work. The majority are on sustenance. The dole it is termed, but "dope" is a more correct word. Young men are losing the will to work. This Government is doing its part by helping State governments with grants of money to train youths in technical colleges, but the unskilled hundreds - heads of families - are the people about whom I am. concerned. The Commonwealth Government, unlike the British and other Dominion Governments, has not full constitutional powers to tackle this problem single-handed. The finding of employment is primarily the concern of the State governments, yet, in the broad sense, it is a national responsibility. Surely, there is some way of getting round the Constitution, if technicalities bar the way ! There are some big national works which could be undertaken, thereby giving a few months' continuous employment at award rates. The reply will be "no money; all wanted for defence". Two million or three million pounds off the Defence Vote might easily be allocated for defence against drought and floods. Water conservation and afforestation would absorb the majority of the unskilled unemployed. Somewhere in departmental pigeon holes in Melbourne or Canberra is the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir John</inline> Monash's scheme, prepared in 1920, for the conservation of water in the eastern States. Another national work of a semi-defence nature that might be undertaken is the renovation and extension of the Williamstown dock, which is 70 years old, and is the only dock on the southern coastline of Australia. In time of war, when enemy submarines are active, such a modern dock would be invaluable to any coastal vessel limping into port. Sydney is too far .away for a merchant ship disabled by a hostile submarine in southern waters. </para>
                <para>I have dealt with this problem of unemployment because it is a national question, not merely a State matter. It certainly is not a party matter. The Senate is less of a party House than is the House of Representatives. We should demand that the Commonwealth Government and State governments cooperate to do something big to stem the tide of increasing unemployment. I hope that Ministers in this chamber will induce their colleagues in the Cabinet to take some action. </para>

                    <para>.- I wish to refer to the Continued absence of business from the notice-paper of the Senate. Although honorable senators were called together again to-day, after an adjournment extending over a period of nearly two weeks, had it not been for the action of the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> in moving the adjournment of the Senate to discuss a matter of urgent public importance, it is probable that this chamber would have adjourned within a very short time of its assembling. The Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> has an excellent opportunity to rehabilitate the Senate as the senior House of the federal legislature by insisting that more legislation be initiated in this chamber. I have here a list of Orders of the Day for the House of Representatives. Will any honorable senator suggest that it would be impossible to initiate in this chamber the discussion of electoral law and procedure in relation to the election of senators, or of the long awaited Commonwealth Bank Bill, or of the policy to be pursued in connexion with the development of Northern Australia, or of the annual report of the Tariff Board ? Another outstanding item relates to unemployment insurance and a 40-hour working week. Those subjects could be dealt with, in this chamber. As mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald, the attitude of some honorable members of the House of Representatives towards the Senate was indicated a few days ago when a Minister said that he regretted that the Minister holding a certain portfolio was not in that chamber. Surely the Government has sufficient organizing ability so to arrange the business of the Parliament that one chamber is not congested with business while the other has practically nothing to do. Every honorable senator wishes to get on with the job which he was elected to perform, and I, for one, am annoyed when I find that we in this place have constantly to await the arrival from the other branch of the legislature of measures which could as easily be dealt with first in this chamber. I realize that it is difficult for the Leader of the Senate to say when certain measures will reach this chamber from the House of Representatives. I sympathize  with him in his difficulty, but I suggest that he could improve conditions generally by initiating more business in this chamber. I go so far as to say that honorable senators are more Qualified than are most members of another place to deal with some of these subjects. The position into which we have drifted is deplorable. Apart from the motion of which the Leader of the Opposition has given notice, I do not know what business there will be before the Senate tomorrow. I do not say that the Leader of the Senate is incompetent, but I think that he is too soft in dealing with his colleagues in the Cabinet. He should <inline font-style="italic">in?sist</inline> that the rights of the Senate shall not be ignored. After all, the Senate is the senior chamber of the federal legislature. Certain persons have had their way for such a long period in this chamber that honorable senators generally have become accustomed to accepting whatever is done. We on this side wish to see the business of the country attended to properly. We claim that since our numbers have been augmented, we have assisted in the transaction of the business placed before us. Our complaint is that we are not getting sufficient business to get our teeth into. In order to help the Government members have asked numerous questions, <inline font-style="italic">without notice,</inline> or have moved the adjournment of the Senate. We have done our best to let the electors know that the Senate exists. The way in which the business is conducted is such that it is not to be wondered at that members become somewhat disgruntled and critical at times. I am not disgruntled, nor am I unduly critical, but I am concerned for the dignity of this chamber. I suggest that the Leader of the Senate should see the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> with a view to making it possible to have a roster of work for the Senate along the lines followed in the other branch of the legislature. </para>

                    <para>. - I direct attention to the answer which I received to a question asked by me to-day regarding the reported nonpayment of wages to five carpenters employed on the construction of a building for officers' barracks near Victoria Barracks, Sydney, by Cody and Willis and their sub-contractor, S. Banbury. The answer supplied to me was that it had been ascertained that Banbury was employed by Cody and Willis as a subcontractor, and left the work owing the wages mentioned.

If the Department of Defence lets work to contractors who engage sub-contractors who cannot- be found, it is most unsatisfactory to be told that the union is endeavouring to find a defaulting subcontractor. If an unfortunate person owed the Government 10s. for income tax, the investigation branch would think nothing of spending several pounds in stamps in an effort to bring him to book. I suggest that Cody  and  Willis should be forbidden from participating in any further Commonwealth Government contracts. A contractor, who engages as a subcontractor a person who will not pay the wages earned by his men, - should be indicted as a scheming rogue and thief. I hope that the Minister will do all in his power to see that these men receive the wages due to them.. </para>

I congratulate the Leader of the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> on the f actthat during his leadership the prestige of this chamber has been considerably restored. Unlike his predecessor, he has never asked this Senate to pass 21 bills without notice in one day.

During the short time I have been a member of this chamber, I have been amazed at the pitiful stories told to me by 'returned soldiers. I do not say that everything I am told is true, but as I knew many of the men before they went to the war and since their return, I feel assured that most of the information given cannot be successfully challenged. As many who are unable to work cannot get a war 'pension, their wives are compelled to work to keepthemselves and to help to maintain their husbands and their children. </para>

But I have some knowledge of the administration of the Repatriation Act, and I assure the honorable gentleman that the cases mentioned by him are covered by that, and alleviation is possible. The honorable senator may have in mind a small minority of hard cases which it may be difficult to cover in the general policy. It is not even fair on his part to mention particular cases which he has not properly investigated. He stated, for instance, that the commissioners had taken up a critical attitude when approached by wives of ex-soldiers seeking a repatriation benefit. Obviously,, the honorable gentleman could have had in mind only one  deputy  commissioner - the official in his State; yet he recklessly  made a wholesale charge against the commissioners, entrustedwith the administration of the act. If the honorable senator will bring the caseshe has in mind to the notice of the Minister for Repatriation or myself, they will be examined closely and justice will be doneIt is not right for the honorable senator to assume that he is speaking here on behalf of ex-soldiers as a whole, because he is not. He does not know them. </para>

I also agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> that, notwithstanding what it has done directly and indirectly to get tens of thousands of Australians back into employment, the Commonwealth Government will still not have done enough until all who are willing and able to work are in employment. No effort should be spared by either the Common wealth or State governments to see that these men are again employed. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> went on to say that honorable senators opposite thought that the solution for unemployment was to be found in a reduction of the working week to 40 hours, and that Government supporters were of the opinion that a shorter working week would intensify unemployment difficulties. I differ from the honorable gentleman. I expressed my views on this subject when I was a member of the House of Representatives and have reiterated them on several occasions since I entered this chamber. I believe that a reduction of hours will partially help solve the unemployment problem. </para>

                    <para>. - Probably more time has been devoted in this chamber to the discussion of unemployment than of any other subject. Having listened carefully to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron,</inline> I formed the opinion that the honorable senator believes that the sole responsibility for caring for the unemployed throughout Australia rests on the Commonwealth Government. He also gave the impression that, in his opinion, honorable senators on this side are callous and indifferent to the plight of men who are unable to find work. He even went so far as to suggest that we on this side enjoy seeing the unemployed suffer. I do not say that this Parliament has no responsibility in relation to this national problem, but no honorable senator is justified in exploiting the sufferings of the unemployed for party political purposes. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cameron</inline> comes from Victoria, a State in which the Government is kept in office by the Labour party. The honorable senator knows that, although the responsibility for dealing with unemployment rests primarily on the State governments, the Commonwealth Government has always been willing to co-operate with, the States in finding a solution of the problem. I remind honorable senators that in Queensland, Tasmania and Western Australia, Labour governments are in office, and that in Victoria the Government is controlled by the Labour party. </para>

I shall bring to the notice of the Minister for Defence the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition in regard to the advisability of having documents such as this printed in Canberra. I think that in this case the printing was done hurriedly in the Government Printing Office, Melbourne, and that the contract was small. </para>

                    has raised the matter of wages due to' carpenters employed by sub-contractors. I recognize that it is unfair that the money should be withheld, and shall give instructions to theWorks Branch to expedite the collection of the wages for these men.

                <para>Several honorable senators have mentioned the matter of unemployment. About a fortnight ago, a deputation was introduced to me in Sydney by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr.. Beasley,</inline> composed of representatives of ironworkers, moulders and various other people engaged in the heavy industries. The members of the deputation complained that because urgent defence works received priority, ordinary works were being held up. As the Minister responsible for the administration of the Works Branch,I was urged to speed up as far as possible the various works which the Government has in hand or in prospect. I conferred with the Director-General of Works immediately after my return to Canberra, and urged a general speeding up of the letting of contracts and the calling of tenders, not only in relation to defence, but also in respect of other works for which money had been voted, in order that the unemployment situation might be relieved. The letting of a big contract in Sydney was hurried along, because I recognized that thatjob and others would provide a large amount of work for unemployed men. I also discussed the matter with the Acting Director of Works in Melbourne two or three days ago, and I was informed that all works in Victoria are being hurried along, including the new building for the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the aeronautical laboratory. The department is engaging the services of additional draftsmen so that all approved works may be speeded up as much as possible in order to provide work for the unemployed. I have concentrated my efforts very largely on the works section of my department, because I realize the degree to which public works assist in the solution of the unemployment problem. We know that, unfortunately, owing to slackness in certain trades, unemployment has been growing in some industries. </para>

Unfortunately, circumstances over which we have no control, such as have been brought about by drought conditions, have increased unemployment, and the position has been made more acute, particularly in rural industries, by the low prices which we have received for our export commodities. I assure honorable senators that the Government is pushing on with development and defence as quickly as possible. When the Statistician's figures are made available at the end of June it will bc seen that the new industries established, and the number of persons employed in factories, will constitute a record for Australia. Nevertheless, the unemployment problem is still a serious one, and I assure honorable senators' opposite that the Government is just as anxious as they are to overcome it. </para>
