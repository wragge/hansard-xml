                            <para>- My attention has been drawn to a report that the Shipping Control Board had been unable to provide substitute vessels  for two coalcarrying ships the departure of winch had been cancelled, and that the earliest dato on which a collier could sail, for South. Australia, providing conditions were favorable, would be next Saturday. The position is that two vessels, namely, the <inline font-style="italic">Ocean Pride</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Empire Cowdray,</inline> were scheduled to load coal at Newcastle between the 22nd and the 27th July.  The <inline font-style="italic">Ocean Pride</inline> will commence to load coal to-night, and should sail to-morrow afternoon, Friday, the 26th July, with a full cargo of coal for Adelaide - namely 8,500 tons. It should reach Fort Adelaide on Wednesday or Thursday next. The <inline font-style="italic">Empire Cowdray</inline> has experienced some delay in getting under the cranes because of one 'day's delay in obtaining dry 'dock accommodation. This ship should leave on Monday or Tuesday, next. Special steps are being taken by the shipping authority to ensure that shipping is provided to move whatever coal is available for South Australia, and the needs of that State, is conjunction with those of' other States, will continue to be given' the closest attention from the shipping stand-point. </para>

                            <para>- Is the Minister for Supply and Shipping aware that there is a great shortage of electricity meters and that the electricity supply authorities, being unable to secure them, are making a fiat rate charge on the consumers? Is he also aware that the fiat rate-charge may operate against the lower paid members of the community? If this position is well known to the Minister, will he take immediate action to have the manufacture of electricity meters stepped up in order that the supply authorities may meet the demand caused by the great building programme that is in operation? </para>

                                <para>- The honorable senator brought this matter to my notice yesterday. I now wish to advise him that the control previously exercised by the Department of Munitions was lifted early this year. I understand, however, that the Department of Works and Housing maintains close contact with manufacturers of electricity meters from whom regular reports of production and distribution are received. I am informed that no complaints of shortages have as yet been received from any of the State housing authorities, or from the manufacturing companies, and that a general review of the position made some time ago showed that manufacturing capacity in Australia is adequate to meet requirements. The honorable senator will appreciate that this industry is dependent to a certain extent on female labour, of which there is at present a general shortage. No doubt any immediate difficulties being experienced are due to this cause. I shall refer the matter to the Minister for Works and Housing, for investigation, and I shall furnish a further report when these inquiries have en completed. </para>

Did he see the further statement that, it was probable that petrol rationing would be discontinued in September? If so, will he make a statement to the Senate clarifying the position as regards the rationing of tyres and petrol? </para>

                        <para>- During the past twelve months there has been considerable press speculation regarding the relaxation, or abolition, of petrol rationing and tyre control. I advise the public not to pay any heed to such forecasts. Immediately it is possible to remove the restrictions on the sale of petrol and the control on tyres, the public will be advised officially. I assure the honorable senator, and the people of Australia generally, that these restrictions and controls will not be retained any longer than is necessary. The control of tyres is still necessary because production is not equal to the demand, due to a shortage of manpower. When production reaches the limit of safety, the controls on tyres will bc removed, but at present I am not in a position to indicate when that will be. </para>

                            <para>- At least once a week a question is asked in this chamber regarding this matter. I have said on several occasions that the shipping tonnage allocated to the run between Tasmania and the mainland is in conformity with that allocated for services between the other States. Only last week I pointed out that Tasmania's shipping needs were greater than they were in prewar days. The Government has not lost sight of the fact that increased production in Tasmania is making greater demands upon available shipping; but the basis of the present allocation of available tonnage is regarded as fair. </para>

                            <para>- I presume that the honorable member refers to <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba</inline> and other ships which operated on the coast. Last week, in reply to a similar question, I pointed out that <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba's</inline> navigation certificate expired in February when lengthy survey repairs would have been necessary. Further, it is the responsibility of the Navy Department to re-condition the. ship and place it in "on-survey" commission. The cost to the Navy Department in respect of those survey repairs would have been £60,000, the re-conditioning costs would have approximated from £40,000 to £30,000; and, on the assumption that reconditioning could have been completed in six months, which is very doubtful, an expenditure of £36,000 for charter money would have been incurred. The Navy. Department's liability has been discharged for £55,000. Therefore, the Commonwealth has saved over £100,000, and will receive a considerable sum in tax on the sale price of <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba</inline> and on the amount paid by the Navy Department to the owners in settlement. Much the same conditions apply in respect of the other ships which the honorable senator has in mind. </para>

                            <para>- Owing to the irregularity of shipping movements between Sydney and the north-west coast of Tasmania, will the Minister for Supply and Shipping consider establishing a regular service, either weekly or fortnightly, with a cargo ship of about 2,000 tons capacity to improve the general service to traders and facilitate the handling of perishable goods? Will the Minister also investigate the constitution of the Priorities Boardte ascertain whether it is possible to effect some alteration? At present it is most noticeable that, because the board includes in its membership persons who have a financial interest in some of the shipping combines, some small traders receive unfavorable treatment in the granting of priorities for the shipment of goods. </para>

Recently, the proprietors of the spastic centre in New South Wales requested the Government, through me, to give such assistance. I have referred those who are conducting that institution, which is doing very valuable work, to the National Health and Medical Research Council, which has at its disposal funds for research. I am hopeful that some funds at the disposal of that body will be made available. I assure the honorable senator of ray interest in that work. </para>

What I said was that I had no knowledge of any special duty being imposed on penicillin. The Minister for Health will bear out that statement. There is a duty on penicillin as there is on any other drug, but it is a blanket duty. A special duty has not been imposed on penicillin. </para>

Is he aware that such recommendations for reduction have not been implemented, but, on the contrary, the margin has actually been increased? Is he further aware that the effects of the import licensing regulations administered by his department are aggravating the disadvantage to the industry of the high margins of import duty which were condemned by the Tariff Board? Is he aware that because the report has not been adopted and because licensing control is being strictly enforced in regard to imported valves, his department is furthering the machinations of a combine largely owned and controlled by foreign interests who have been successful by the methods pointed out in the Tariff Board report in putting out of business a large number of small Australian manufacturers and thereby substantially obtained the whole market for radio receivers of their own manufacture? </para>

If not, why is a system retained in Tasmania which prevents a return to the practice of meat deliveries?

The quota system has been abolished on the mainland. In Tasmania it has been retained at the request of the industry. There is no constitutional problem, because the National Security Act and regulations made under it will be effective until the end of this year. </para>

                        <para>- I am not in a position to state what quantities of tinned plate are available in Australia at present. However, I can tell the honorable senator that supplies are not so plentiful as the Government would like them to be. There is a world shortage of tinned plate. I realized this about seven months ago, and a mission was sent to Great Britain and the United States of America in an endeavour to obtain greater supplies for Australia. The mission found that restrictions on the use of tinned plate were in force in the United States of America. Therefore, with a view to securingconsideration for Australia's requests, it was essential that the Government should place controls upon  the use of tinned plate in Australia. The American authorities would have given little consideration to our request while the use of tinned plate in Australia was unrestricted. </para>

                            <para>Yes. The natural corollary to full employment is a greatly increased mass spending power, which of course, means a greatly increased demand for consumer goods and services. This, added to the stored up demand for all kinds of goods and services which could not be met during the six years of war, has created the position we have to-day - a demand greater than the supply both as regards raw materials and manufactured goods. There is no proof that production is lower than for many years past. Coal, which is so important and which is quite unable to meet the full demands, in spite of all the stoppages, is above the average production of the last five or ten years. </para>

                            <para>Whilst every one agrees that taxation is high, if it were not so the excess of demand over supply would be much greater than at present. I have a much higher opinion of the loyalty and national outlook of all sections of our people than to believe they are undermining the economic stability of their own country by consciously going slow. Now that the 800.000 or 900,000 of our young and vigorous manhood are returning to the peace-time economic field there is every hope of soon reaching a proper balance between supply and demand. </para>

                            <para>The duties of the bureau are broadly to cany out all the functions of a geological and geophysical survey in Commonwealth territories and to do such work in the States as is beyond the resources of the States, or as may be required in co-operation with the States for a balanced appraisal of the mineral resources of the Commonwealth. For example, it is considered that resources of radio-active minerals require investigation on a Commonwealthwide basis under Commonwealth direction. A major function of the bureau is to carry on geological surveys in the search for oil throughout the Commonwealth and its territories. In this connexion work is being initiated on an extensive scale under a cooperative agreement with the Government of Western Australia and it is hoped to conclude similar agreements with other States. The bureau also has an experienced petroleum technologist on its staff to ensure that drilling activities are carried on in a proper manner and that the national interest in regard to conservation of petroleum is safeguarded. This officer's advice is available to the States, none of which has such an officer in its employ. </para>
                    <para>With regard to geophysical surveys the  bureau  has the responsibility for the basic gravimetric and magnetic surveys of the Commonwealth, and all States have agreed to rely upon the bureau forany geophysical surveys they may require. In this regard I may say that the Premier of Queensland has  Tecently  written to the Prime Minister asking that the bureau should carry out surveys in the Roma district. </para>

                            <para>It is the Government's policy that everything possible be done to provide adequate amenities and facilities for the men of the Australian fighting services serving in Japan or elsewhere. Buildings have been selected at Kyoto and Kobe for holiday leave hostels. These will provide for 250 personnel, who will spend their leave there without cost on a similar basis to what is being provided for American troops. Another centre which will provide accommodation for 400 personnel is being established on Kyushu Island. Lieutenant-General Northcott, when Commander-in-Chief of the British Commonwealth Occupation Forces in January last, asked the Australian Comforts Fund for £20,000 for additional amenities for the troops, and the Army authorities provided facilities for Mr. C. R. McKerihan,  chairman.  Australian Comforts Fund, to proceed to Japan to make a personal inspection. Since his return he has arranged for £45,000 to be made available for leave centre amenities. Up to date the Australian Army Amenities Service has provided goods to the value of £160,000. Another 200 tons are at present in transit. A signal was despatched to Lieutenant-General H. C. H. Robertson, Commander-in-Chief, British Commonwealth Occupation Forces, Japan, asking him for immediate advice as to what additional amenities are required for Australian troops in Japan. </para>

                            <para>No. I have been unable to trace any specific complaints of the nature referred to by the honorable senator. I have no doubt that, on occasions, endeavours are made by dealers to secure favorable prices at auction sales, but the Commonwealth Disposals Commission is fully knowledgeable as to the likelihood of these attempts and a most careful watch is made at all auction sales with the object of preventing any organized group obtaining control. </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="2.">
                            <para>I have carefully investigated the complaint referred to in this part of the question and can find no evidence to support it. The sale at Rocklea was conducted by a reputable firm of auctioneers in strict conformity with the procedure prescribed by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission, and in accordance with this procedure items of which there were large quantities to be disposed of were offered singly or in small lots before being offered in bulk. This procedure, which is followed at all auction sales conducted by the Disposals Commission, is designed to ensure that small buyers have full and fair opportunities of securing their requirements. Naturally, with individual buyers  operating  for single items or small quantities, competition is keener and higher prices are often realized than for large lots which are only of interest to limited numbers of wholesale purchasers. No reason can, however, be found for supposing that the bidding for small lots at the recent sale at Rocklea was run up by dealers who then bought bulk lots cheaply. If every item sold by the Commission was sold singly it would virtually mean putting the auction sales on a retail basis and this would cause a tremendous waste of time and would break up one of the most effective means of ensuring the surplus goods are widely and expeditiously  reticulated  to the public through normal trading channels. These statements are all fully borne out by detailed examination of the figures for the Rocklea sale, where although there were differences between the prices realized for individual items and prices for the same items sold in bulk, the differences were not in general, out of consonance with normal trading margins. </para>

                        <item label="3.">
                            <para>Yes. </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="4.">
                            <para>The auction sale to be held on the 31st July will be  conducted  in accordance with the procedure explained above, under which, as I have already emphasized, individual buyers wishing to obtain small quantities are afforded opportunities of securing their requirements. </para>
                        </item>
                        <item label="5.">
                            <para>I am satisfied that on the basis on which auction sales are conducted they are a very valuable means of ensuring both that the requirements of small buyers are met and that items which are held in large quantitiesare released at satisfactory prices for distribution through trading channels. In this connexion I may add that the items disposed of at auction sales consist in general of used or obsolete equipment and materials for  which  there is no established commercial market. New materials and items in merchantable condition are practically all disposed of by tender. In their special field auction sales are an important part ot the machinery for the disposal of surplus goods arid it would not, in my view, be in the best interests either of the buying public or of the Government to abolish them or to replace them wholly by the method of sale by tender. Returns from auction sales conducted by the Commonwealth Disposals Commission during the month of June, alone, exceeded £1300,000. </para>

                        <para>.- I congratulate the Government on the introduction of this important legislation, which is a part of its postwar programme. The feature that I appreciate most in connexion with this proposal is that it concentrates our thoughts on matters of construction. During the past six years when the efforts of Australia and its allies were  concentrated on the attainment of victory over our enemies, we became accustomed to reading about the destruction of life and property associated with war. During that period the amount expended for war purposes totalled many hundreds of millions of pounds and, unhappily, many hundreds of thousands of valuable lives were lost. It is refreshing, therefore, to be able to concentrate on something which will add to our cultural development. The bill provides for the establishment in the Australian Capital Territory of an Australian National University. As the Minister said in his second-reading speech, this is indeed a forward step. I do not think that any logical argument can be advanced against the establishment of a university in the National Capital. The functions of the university are set out in clauses 6, 7 and 8. It has been said that the proposed university will deal only with matters of research, but its functions go further than that. Paragraph <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> of clause 6 provides that one of the functions of the university shall be - </para>

                    </quote>
                    <para>That paragraph provides for the broader scope to which I have referred. It appears to me that this bill envisages ultimately the accomplishment of everything that pertains to university education generally. Clause 7 provides that the university may establish such research schools as are deemed desirable. I am pleased to note that mention is made in that clause of a school of medical research to be known as " The John Curtin School of Medical Research". Knowing the late Prime Minister's interest in all that pertains to human welfare, I do not think that any better tribute could be paid to his memory than to associate his name with the proposed school of medical research. In this field of research Australia has much to learn. One of the greatdisadvantages of the University of Western Australia has been that it has never had a chair of medicine. Efforts to remedy that state ofaffairs have been made, and it may be that the disability to which I have referred no longer exists. I hope that as the result of the establishment of this school of medical research Australia will keep pace with other countries in this field. I approve also the establishment of aresearch school of physical sciences, and am particularly pleased  that  provision is to be made for  a  research school of social sciences and  a  research school of Pacific studies. The latter two subjects are of paramount importance, because, after all, individuals who seek the suffrage of electors, " and assume responsible positions in the parliaments of Australia, are faced with many social problems. Despite all that has been accomplished by the Government over the last two or three years in the improvement of the- social welfare of the people of this country, we have' not yet been able to get to the root of many of our social disabilities. We provide benefits to compensate for certain disabilities, but we must get down to the basic cause of the suffering of the people, because unless our problems can be tackled at the root, we shall continue to be faced with the necessity to provide .large sums of money annually for social service payments in respect of disabilities resulting probably from malnutrition, and other adverse living conditions that should not be tolerated. </para>
                    <para>The proposed school of Pacific studies is of particular importance because now, more than ever before, the people of this country, as well as the peoples of other nations, have to study international problems. I can remember the days when Australian citizens were concerned largely with the future of Australia. The only other country in which they were interested, was Great Britain. When I went to school, I read all about Australia, and "Great Britain, and the accomplishments of the British people- over the ages. I became very proud, and I still am proud, to be British ; but unfortunately, in those days we were taught very little about other countries, which, with the passing years have played an increasingly important part" in the complex machine of world affairs. The last war has taught us that we must adopt, not only an Australian point of view, but also that we must endeavour to understand the point of view of other peoples .and particularly those who are our. immediate neighbours. There is an urgent necessity for us to know something about China, India, and the islands adjacent to this country, because in the Pacific area there will always be a potential threat to our security. In view of the fact that recently more than 50 nations assembled in San Francisco and formed a world organization to prevent aggression, to maintain economic- stability J-and security, and to ensure freedom from want and fear, the fullest consideration must be given to making available to students- in this country an opportunity to obtain at least a fundamental knowledge of the trials and tribulations, not only of their own land, but also of the countries that are our near neighbours. To the best of our ability we must cultivate our friendship with other nations which to-day may not have a true conception of this country. In the  schoolof  Pacific studies every opportunity will be given' to Australians to acquire a thorough knowledge of the economic, military, and social characteristics of other Pacific countries. Another important feature of this legislation is the proposal that the Australian National University shall provide specialist training for public servants." One hears a great deal of criticism of public servants. I have heard such obnoxious "terms as " bureaucrats " applied to them in this chamber. I wish to pay a tribute to the public servants of this country. Because of the ramifications of the work on which they are engaged, they require a high sense of public duty. They are entrusted with confidential documents and knowledge. <inline font-style="italic">In</inline> negotiations between Australia and other countries, high ranking  public servants  advise our representatives on what attitude should be adopted or what course should be pursued. Under the present system, our public servants commence their careers as youngsters- and work up through the ranks to responsible positions, but they are at a disadvantage in' that the responsibility for acquiring knowledge -rests upon themselves. The Australian National University will give to young public servants an opportunity to do what may be regarded " as a primary course of study in public administration, which eventually will be to the great advantage, not only of the parliaments of this , country, but also of the people generally. Therefore, despite all that may be said to the contrary, I consider that this legislation will be of great benefit to the nation. </para>
                    <para>I visualize Canberra as a city of the future. When I was privileged to visit Washington some months ago, the first thought that occurred to me was that some day Canberra must become a second Washington. One frequently hears people say that Canberra should be abandoned and (hat the country that it occupies is not even good enough for sheep. Canberra is the cultural capital and the political centre of Australia. We must build here' a city that will compare favorably with the best cities overseas. It will be argued, of course, that the population of this country is very small compared with that of the United States of America, or of the United Kingdom ; but our  population  of 7,250,000 people is not very much less than that of Canada which has 12,000,000 people. In Ottawa and 'Winnipeg I found that the most outstanding public buildings were those of the parliaments- - the provincial parliament in Winnipeg and the Federal Parliament at Ottawa. British Columbia too, which has not a large population, has a splendid parliamentary institution. The Department of Agriculture in Winnipeg is another impressive - structure. That department has spent many millions of dollars on research into agricultural problems, and to enable that work to be carried .on efficiently, the people have erected a building that simply astounded me and made me feel, when I thought of the unsightly structure that has been raised in this city to house the Prices Branch, that it was time we awakened to our. responsibilities. We must look forward to better things, not merely in the distant future, but also in the immediate future. Washington appealed to me because of its great institutions and magnificent statuary. In the minds of American citizens it represents a national aspiration and a national ideal. All Americans are anxious to visit Washington some day. How many Australian  citizens  say, " Some day, I should like to visit Canberra ". It is the  duty of this Parliament to ensure that  the' building of this city shall be carried out in such a manner that all Australian citizens will desire to see it." One of. the finest buildings in Canberra is the National War Memorial. In my opinion the large sum of money spent on that structure was fully justified. Whilst 1 do not believe in the glorification of war, I consider that our National War Memorial ranks  with the best in the world, and that the lesson it teaches is so realistic that the States would be well advised to organize annual visits to Canberra by parties of children. The museum section contains thousands of interesting relics of the war of 1914-18, and I assume that additional accommodation will be provided for exhibits relating to the war just concluded. This magnificent building and its exhibits are worthy of inspection, but few people visit Canberra to appreciate them. In addition, the Institute of Anatomy, which I presume is performing a very useful educational function, is a credit to -the National Capital. A National University is an equally important unit in the National Capital. In addition, the first section of the National Library has been completed, and is rendering an essential service in our political capital. During the last six years Australia, with other countries, expended huge sums of money for purposes of war. ' Bearing in mind that expenditure for purposes of destruction, the taxpayers of Australia, under this measure, are being asked to contribute merely a " flea bite " for the establishment of a seat of learning which will further  the cause of peace. Under the Constitution, the Commonwealth cannot control education. We have established a Department of Education, but it is primarily concerned with collaboration with the States with a view to rendering financial assistance to the States in their educational programmes. The establishment of a national university at Canberra will be one step further towards the control of education on a national basis. That reform is necessary. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney,</inline> 1 realize the necessity to cultivate Australian art, music and " literature. To-day, a preponderance of literature obtainable at bookstalls and of the material broadcast in this country is of American origin. I am not prejudiced against Americans; but I believe that Australia should develop a literature and art of its own. The establishment of a national university will help us to achieve that objective. I suggest that once the Australian National </para>
                    <para class="block">University is established the Government should make available scholarships to one student from each of the States and the territories under the control of the Com.monwealth. Such scholarships would provide a strong incentive to the more brilliant of our rising generation to enter the Australian National University. That would be one of the highest scholastic prizes that  could be offered to young Australians. . I congratulate the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> upon his excellent speech. I was greatly impressed by' his" emphasis that, whilst the necessity to educate adults was not so great because, they were too conservative, nevertheless we had an urgent duty to provide the very best education for the youth of the nation. We must ensure that the youth of this country become thoroughly Australian in outlook and ideals, and that they shall not become impregnated with foreign ideas. We must enable the growing child to realize the privilege of being not only an Australian but also a member of the  British race. I notice that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has entered the chamber. I take him to task because during his speech he said that  this proposal represented " the gravest waste of public money I have seen for a long time ". He disparaged the measure. The key note of his speech was that the present was an inopportune time to provide for the establishment of a national university. The present is always inopportune to people like the honorable senator whenever pro,gressive proposals are placed before them. T direct the honorable senator's attention to the King George V. Memorial in front of Parliament House at Canberra. That structure is an atrocity;- but it cost £32,000, and that expenditure was incurred at a time when hundreds of thousands of our people were looking for employment and, despite their plight, were denied sustenance by the government of the day. Under this measure it is intended to expend £325,000 annually as from 1951-52 and subsequently that expenditure will be reviewed every five years. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> said that £50,000 should ' be made available annually to the States for the purpose of assisting university education, hut the </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Government is already rendering valuable assistance in that respect. As. the. Government proposes to expend £872,500 on the . construction of the Australian National University, I urge it to get on with the job as quickly as possible. I agree with the Vice-President of the Executive Council who said that, despite his advanced age, he hoped to see the new university completed. I hope that the commencement of the construction of the building will not be delayed for five years. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty's</inline> contention that we need to establish reciprocity between all universities in Australia. It is useless for a student to win a diploma in one State which is not recognized in other States. The Commonwealth, of course, has not power to remedy that position unless the Constitution be amended to enable the Commonwealth to deal with education generally. The Minister" in charge of the bill concluded his second-reading speech with the following sentence: - </para>

                        <para>.- When the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> resumed his seat after delivering a very eloquent speech, I was reminded of the story of the midshipman who was obliged to submit to his captain for perusal all letters he had written. On one occasion, he wrote a letter which commenced, " Dear Mum and Dad ", and, after describing his activities, concluded with the words, " I say my prayers every night and pray for yow and Mum. " When the captain remarked, " That is . not right Jack ", the midshipman replied, "No, sir, it is not right, but it reads well. " All I can say is that the Minister's speech sounded very we1! He dealt with the. subject of education very freely. He told  fis of h'is ambition in  respect  'of  education,  and wh'at could, and  would,  be done through 'education, fie said that education would prevent wars, and Would make all men brothers. He also said that i't would 'stop people fro'm spitting on the footpath's in the capital cities. I disagree with hi's view that education will prevent wars. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> took our minds back some  centuries ago. Let me remind honorable senators that when Rome and Athens were at their zenith and their peoples the most highly educated in the world the Romans set out to conquer "the world". I do not believe that education will prevent wars. The view that education will make all men brothers is merely a wonderful ideal. The man who spits on th'e footpath is not of the type to Care very much whether a national university is established at Canberra. However, I agree with the Minister that we must encourage the highest standards of education. He said that this proposal was being opposed by honorable senators on this side of the chamber because it was an innovation. This is not an innovation. To-day, a university exists in each of our capital cities, and we should be "well advised to help those institutions in every possible way.' Probably, the time will come when we shall see a national university . at Canberra, and I sincerely hope that when that day arrives that institution will be a monument worthy of this nation. I maintain that the time is not ripe for the establishment of a national university at Canberra. </para>

What about the salaries of teachers and the housing of teachers? The expenditure proposed for the national university wOuld be far better used foi* the improvement of the primary educational systems of the States. We have heard a great deal about communism in Australia in the last few years; We lire encouraging communism by the way in which we treat our'  existing  educational institutions.- Men and women are working "for salaries 'that -are far, too low for persons 'charged with 'the .great responsibility of educating young Australians. We provide them with disgraceful living, quarters in many  instances,  and school buildings are often dilapidated and inadequate. -I know that the Government "will say that the improvement 'of primary and Secondary education facilities is the responsibility of State governments. But the money  proposed  to be "used for the establishment of a national university will come from the people of the States. Everything that we have in our national capital belongs to the people of Australia. Therefore, the proposed expenditure should be evenly distributed amongst the States. The Government might also say that it has not the p'ower to assist the States in this respect. </para>

                        <para>. - I congratulate the Government upon the introduction of this bill to establish a national university at Canberra. The thought predominant in my mind at the moment is that this provides a great opportunity for the people of Australia to perpetuate the memory of our late Prime Minister. It is contemplated that one section of the university shall be known as " The John Curtin School of Medical Research ". That is a good proposal, but it is not good enough. The university should be named "The John Curtin Memorial University". No Australian has done more to deserve a memorial than John Curtin, and no memorial would he more appropriate than a national university at Canberra, where he did so much for the nation in the last years of his life. .The Minister should ask the Government to amend the bill to provide that the university be named " The John Curtin Memorial  University " instead of " The Australian National University Such a decision would be acclaimed throughout Australia. It would be a worthy, tribute to a great man who died while leading his country out of the dark shadow of war into the clear light of a victorious peace. I listened with interest to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan and others <inline font-style="italic">who</inline> opposed the establishment of a national university at this time. I consider that the plan is magnificent and is long overdue. Any man who claims that the State universities are doing a satisfactory job shows ignorance of the problems which beset those institutions. More  than  600 students are at present engaged in the first year of their medical course at the University of Sydney. It is impossible to cope properly with such numbers with the facilities- available at that University. We all know that many hundreds of ex-servicemen were unable to enter universities this year because there was not sufficient accommodation for them. For the last twenty years the State universities have not been able to cope with the growing urge of the people to undertake higher education. This bill represents a great step forward. Decentralization of education, like decentralization of industry, deserves the highest praise. The establishment of a university in this, country town - for Canberra is only a provincial centre - will do much to encourage decentralization of education. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para class="block">The new university will be able to" concentrate particularly on certain avenues of education which are neglected by the State universities. For instance, Australia is playing an increasingly important part in world affairs. We have diplomatic representation in many countries, and this is only the beginning of a movement towards increased and more effective representation throughout the world. At present, our diplomats are selected almost haphazardly from amongst public servants, members of Parliament  and members of the general public. A man does not become a good diplomat merely by changing into a dark coat and striped" trousers, as many people seem to believe. . A diplomat i3 a highly trained official. A national university at Canberra would be the logical place to educate men for such important work. There will be a great, increase of population in Canberra in the future, and a large Public Service community will grow up around the diplomatic community. Young men and women are brought here from all parts of Australia and many of them are anxious to fit themselves for important positions. At present they have little chance of securing the education that they require, except by correspondence, which is unsatisfactory. The population and importance of Australia are growing and we must realize that what is sufficient to-day will be inadequate to-morrow. There are too many members of this Parliament who, like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator McLachlan,</inline> say that the time is not ripe for us to progress. They pretend that they are in favour of innovations, but they always append the qualification that ".the time is inopportune". There are no monuments to .people who have said that "the time is inopportune". But. there are monuments to men who, having decided that a thing should be done, have said, "Let us do it now". Those who say that a national university in Canberra would 'be a grand thing but that it should not be established now, would say the same thing 50 years hence, even on their death beds. Unfortunately, this state of mind is inherent in the conservative and reactionary sections of .our community. When argument fails they  fall hack on their old catch-cry. I appeal to the Senate to give its blessing to this bill. A university will do more than anything else to make Canberra the national and cultural centre of Australia. I repeat my appeal to the Government to consider naming the university, " The John Curtin Memorial University ". Such an act would meet with the approval of every good Australian. </para>

The educational accomplishments of the members of the judiciary afford ample testimony to the fact that Australia has nothing for which to reproach itself with regard to the educational facilities provided for the- citizens. In reply to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> I maintain that the question to be decided is not whether the time is ripe to give effect to this proposal. We should consider the necessity for doing first things first. It is intended that nearly £1,000,000 shall be expended on the proposed university buildings, and that £325,000 a year shall be provided for the working expenses of the institution. Those figures are merely estimates, and it is safe to venture the opinion that in all probability the actual cost of the buildings will not be far short  of £1,250,000. </para>
                    <para>It has been said that more money should be expended on primary and secondary education. It seems to me that the money proposed to be expended under this measure could be used to better advantage in giving financial assistance to the State university authorities. Can any honorable senator deny that the provision of houses for the people is a more urgent matter than the adoption of the present proposal, which would divert large sums of money into a channel where it is not urgently required, and slow up the work of constructing houses for the people? A great deal of labour and material would be absorbed in the construction of the proposed university buildings, and nobody would suffer if the project were postponed. If a decision had to be made as to whether the money proposed to be expended should be used in building a national university or in providing homes for the people, all honorable senators would probably decide in favour of house construction. I know that there is a shortage of public buildings, and the proposed university is doubtless desirable, but priority should be given to the housing problem. If the Government considers that we have been remiss in our duty to the citizens in not having given sufficient thought to the claims of higher education, let us assist the States, which are now struggling to maintain their university activities at a proper levelSimilar help could be given to the authorities- responsible for primary and secondary education. The State education authorities could be given financial assistance by the Commonwealth in the provision of scholarships for students in secondary schools. I shall never place  obstacles in the way of improvements of the educational facilities of the people. </para>
                    <para>The Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> waxed eloquent about the bill, and would have us believe that the whole outlook of the people would be changed if the measure became law. He suggested that a great brotherhood of man would prevail throughout the countryside. No other inference could have been drawn from his remarks. All wrongs were to be righted, and the principles of good citizenship, which had been sadly neglected, would be fostered. There is no .justification for that prognostication. Whilst the proposed university would serve ft useful purpose, it is idle to say that the whole outlook and characteristics of the people would be changed by it. This Parliament controls the major financial policy of the country and the State authorities could turn to the Loan Council for financial assistance in the promotion of education. The great problem confronting this Parliament and the State authorities at present is that of providing homes for the people, and until it has been solved the construction of the proposed university should be postponed: If we diverted the money proposed to be expended as outlined in the bill to the building of homes for the people, the subsidizing of primary and secondary schools and universities, the provision of scholarships for bright young students who are not in a position to pay for university courses, the people of Australia would commend our action. I disagree with those who say that the States have neglected their duty to the people in the matter of education, and that Australia has suffered through not having a national university. Australian citizens who have been trained in our schools, colleges and universities occupy many high positions not only in this country but also in other countries. Whatever may be said to the contrary, they are living evidence of the success' of our education system. </para>

                        <para>. - I see a good deal of merit in the bill before the Senate. After our spiritual welfare and the health of the nation, few matters are of greater importance than the education' of the. people. I judge this measure more on the basis of our future development than on present- day values. I have sufficient- confidence hi Australia to believe that before long it will have a greatly increased  population.  Not only will we be able to attract many of our kinsfolk from Great Britain to this country, but I believe that, in addition, many people who have suffered as the result of their residence in the less peaceful states of Europe will come to Australia, not as Dutchmen or Norwegians, but as potential Australian citizens who, within a few years, will become naturalized and will take an active part in the development of the Commonwealth. I believe, too, that because of changing conditions throughout the world, Australia will, in future, be re-" quired to play a greater part in matters affecting the welfare of the British Commonwealth of Nations, and in international affairs generally, than in the past. Therefore, I consider that the time is opportune for consideration to be given to the fulfilment of the vision of those who planned Canberra and made provision for a national university in the National Capital.- I am not unmindful of the needs of primary education, but, as has already been pointed out, that is a matter for the States. It is fair to say that during recent years there have been clear indications that the States are alive to their responsibility in this matter. That is particularly true of Tasmania and Victoria, in which States there is growing evidence of interest in higher, education. Higher elementary schools, high schools and area schools have been established at suitable centres, and in Victoria free transport is now provided to enable children living in outback districts to take advantage of the better educational facilities available in the larger centres of population. In Victoria, and, I believe, in most of the other States also, the applications from students to enter upon university courses cannot bc coped with. That problem has compelled the University of Melbourne to establish a university college at Mildura. It is clear that, with our natural development and a big increase of population, additional university facilities will have to be provided. I prefer that the money that will be expended in that direction should be expended in establishing a  national university at Canberra rather than that it should be used to assist existing universities which are already overcrowded. The establishment of a university at Canberra will assist in solving the problem of providing accommodation for students. That difficulty lias forced many university students in Victoria whose homes are in the country centres to pursue their studies in 'Adelaide, where the accommodation problem is not so acute. As pointed out by the Minister in his second-reading speech, the proposed Australian National University will provide for post-graduate courses in fields of research which are likely to be of benefit to Australia in the future. Such investigations must be undertaken, and it seems appropriate that the National Capital should, provide the necessary facilities. I am not unmindful of the fact that economics and finance are important matters. If, as I predict, it will be necessary to establish priorities in respect of various undertakings, I should like to see the Australian National University high on such a priority list. As the measure has my blessing I shall not further occupy the time of the Senate in discussing it, but in committee I shall take the opportunity lo make some further observations. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">in reply -</inline> Before reviewing briefly the interesting debate that followed my second-reading speech on this bill, I wish to pay a tribute to the Minister for Post-war Reconstruction <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Dedman)</inline> for his interest in education generally, and in particular; the higher forms of education. That interest has been demonstrated in many ways during recent years. The measure which he has sponsored and which is now before the Senate, is, in my opinion, the high-water mark of his endeavours in that field. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The provision of an Australian National University in the Australian  Capital  Territory is, happily, a matter  c  oncerning which no constitutional difficulties arise. The position is entirely  different when we come to consider benefit: to students, family allowances, and other matters which will be included in the forthcoming referendum. The Commonwealth lacks constitutional power to operate in those fields-. It has no power to enter the field of education, except in the way that has been suggested during this debate, namely, by making grants under section  96  of the Constitution, either with or without conditions. That, I submit, is not a satisfactory way for the Commonwealth to participate in matters affecting the education of the people'; it should not have to use its superior financial power to force standards and conditions on others. Accordingly, with the Constitution as it is, plenary powers in respect of e'ducation must remain with the States. </para>
                    <para>In reviewing the comments of honorable, senators during the debate I naturally have in mind the remarks of my very good friend, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline> On Wednesday last the honorable senator made the most extraordinary of his many extraordinary speeches. He commenced by congratulating me upon the introduction of the first measure of which I have been in charge in this chamber. For that kindly courtesy I thank him sincerely. He next expressed the hope that all the measures that I might introduce would have as speedy a passage as he hoped would be given to this one. The honorable senator went on to, say that he approached the bill sympathetically; but all I can. say regarding his approach is that the sympathy very speedily evaporated, and the approach itself was quickly converted into a retreat from everything that this bill is to provide. There was a complete change of face and pf heart in the honorable senator's approach. In fact, if it could be regarded as an approach at all, I can only say that it was the briefest one on record. The honorable senator then embarked upon trenchant' criticism of myself for introducing a measure that he had prepared me to believe would have his approbation and assistance in speeding it  On  its way through this chamber, and proceeded to present a completely false view of the purpose of this legislation to the people of Australia. Either the honorable senator had not resolved his thoughts on this bill when he began to speak or,  in  common with the rest of us,  he suffered some degree of nervous tension on the occasion of our first public broadcast to the people of Australia. Perhaps he was altogether too air-minded and, although believing that the measure had merit, was not prepared to concede to the Government the credit that is due to it for taking this, very progressive national step. Whatever inspired, or failed to inspire, the honorable senator, apparently repenting of his sins, he came before us yesterday and made an explanation regarding a term that he had used in his second-reading speech. He had  said  that the measure was full of crudities. Yesterday, a week later, he felt obliged to withdraw that remark. That was all to the good; but I am afraid that the honorable senator failed to make his position very much better, because he has still allowed other statements infinitely worse than that to remain unaltered. For instance, he has not withdrawn his statement that the bill is " pretentious and unreal ".  He is in the position of a man who has called somebody a "confirmed thief, liar and "murderer " and then, when his charge has been objected to, has withdrawn the word " confirmed ". In support of his argument that the bill was pretentious and unreal, the honorable senator pointed as an example to the -name that had been chosen for the university. I would say the mountain had laboured and brought forth a mouse. </para>

                            <para>- Exactly. I agree that the name is important, and . I am prepared to concede to the Senate that there is room for a difference of opinion as to whether this institution should be called the " Canberra University ", the " University of the Australian Capital Territory ", or the Australian National University, the name that finally has been assigned to it. Whilst de*aling with this minor point, I draw attention to the fact that the practice throughout Australia in regard to the naming of universities varies. There are three universities named after the capital cities in which they are situated, and three others, namely, those of Western Australia, Tasmania and Queensland, that bear the name of their respec tive States. I believe that a happy choice has been made in this instance. lu any case, some difference of opinion on that point certainly did not justify the terms that the honorable senator applied to the whole bill. </para>

                        also complained of the expenditure of £872,500 upon the erection of a national university. This, he said, was shocking at a . time when ' housing was so badly needed throughout Australia. The honorable senator must have realized that he was not putting the position in its proper light when making that statement. Every one knows that finance is not a difficulty in connexion with the. erection of homes. Unlimited finance is available for this purpose. The only difficulties are those associated with the supply of materials and skilled labour. .Moreover,
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline>
                        spoke as though this money were to be expended forthwith ; then, in the next breath, he complained that the bill itself provided that a start was not to
                        <inline font-style="italic">bc</inline>
                        made until 1951 or 1952. Both statements are incorrect. There is no intention to expend this large sura of money immediately. The method of procedure has been determined by "an  interdepartmental  committee, which was guided by other committees of experts .and scientists. The money is to be apportioned under three headings, namely, buildings, furniture and equipment, and, finally, the library. It will take the council, when it i.-: appointed, considerable time to go through the preliminaries, establish the convocation, select administrative officers, prepare plans, select a research staff, send members of it abroad to be trained in research work, and do all the other spade work  required.  Considerable time will . elapse before any capital expenditure is required: As I said in my second-reading speech, the total sum required will not he sought in any one  budget,  hut will be spread over a  number  of  budgets  and this Parliament will have an  opportunity  to  consider  the allocation of -that money. I refer again to the suggestion by
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline>
                        that there would be some retarding of housing activity if this money were allocated. That is quite  untrue.

                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline>
                        also objected to . Canberra as a suitable site for medical research. In that respect, all I can say is that his opinion is at variance with that of an expert committee, comprised of some of the most highly qualified men in Australia. When there was some slight difference of opinion amongst members of that committee they were confirmed in their outlook by no less a person than
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Howard</inline>
                        Florey, the eminent scientist. There is a strong body of medical and expert opinion that there is no more suitable place for research than Canberra itself. Oxford University, for instance, is in a better position for research than Sydney Uni1 versity. In Sydney and Melbourne where there are vast numbers of students there can be no personal relations between teachers and students, very little team  work, and I venture to say very little association between the students themselves. My own experience, going back to the early 1920's, when I went through various law schools in Victoria, was that I Spent four years without even reaching a nodding acquaintanceship with many of my fellow students. When one comes to research - and the emphasis is to be on research in this institution - residential accommodation or quarters will be required, so that Australians may live together, team together and think together, I can imagine no more suitable place than the Australian National Capital for work of that nature.
                    </para>
                    <para>There is, I regret to say, an unfortunate tendency on the part of some Australians to decry everything Australian whether it be our mode of life, our products, or our institutions. I believe quite frankly that most Australians are proud of all those things, and I deplore the fashion of decrying everything that is Australian. There is an unexampled opportunity for the Senate to be unanimous in supporting this measure, free of party considerations. If. the measure does not deal specifically with primary education, at least it is the medium, through which we may expect rapid progress, rapid development, and the efficient handling of problems peculiar to Australia. In considering this project, one must bear in mind its fruits. It will be the teacher of our most intellectual, and the centre of our post-graduate courses. It. will prepare the teachers for our other universities and colleges. . It will prepare teachers for medical colleges. Its ramifications will extend to every school of education, even into primary schools. It will constitute a standard for other universities. It may perhaps coordinate their activities in the manner suggested by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty,</inline> who spoke of the varying standards of instruction in Australian universities and the lack of reciprocity between them. A university such as we envisage in this measure will help to foster Australian' national sentiment, pride, and ideas. It will bring to fruition the visions of the fathers of federation when they decided that there should be such a place as a National Capital. 1' a in certain that they envisaged the National Capital as the cradle of the Australian national sentiment that they hoped would be born in this country. I have said before, and I make no apology for repeating - i.t now, that true Australian national sentiment was not born but only conceived with the advent of federation. It was born in the travail and adversity of the war of 1914-18, and now it. is reaching adolescence. Every, honorable senator should regard it as his primary duty to foster and- encourage that spirit, and to bring it to maturity. In preparing the way for the establishment of a national university, a truly Australian conception dealing not only with the needs of its locality,' but expanding to meet the needs of the whole community, we have an unexampled opportunity to speed the development of that national spirit. </para>

I make it clear that the Government is not seeking to lay down the lines along which" the university shall develop. That will be left entirely to .the council which, as honorable  senators will . notice, will be very representative. The Government has, no intention of directing the council at all. The council may set up all these research schools, or any one of them, or abandon all of them and proceed along different lines. After all, the proper function of a university - and I think every university in the world was established and proceeded along these lines - is to start slowly and to gather momentum in meeting the needs of-, the- community in which ir finds itself. It may be that those who constitute the council, which will include two honorable senators, will in their wisdom be able to steer this uni-' versity in accordance with the needs of the times. I believe that the university will develop upon lines which will make us proud to have been associated with it in its initial stage.. It will be for the council to determine whether a school of literature should be instituted. I join with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> in hoping that that will be done. </para>

                        referred to the lack of reciprocity between certain universities i.n respect of various subjects. To my  knowledge a high degree of reciprocity has already been established between the universities; but in certain cases the courses prescribed for students vary greatly between two universities although the- subjects are given the same designation. That leads to the difficulty to which the senator has drawn attention. I believe that an Australian National University, generating and holding the prestige which I hope this university will enjoy, will he one which can deal with the universities of Australia on at least an equal basis, . and be in the very happyposition to co-ordinate their activities and obviate the various, difficulties which O'Flaherty has indicated.

In Canberra we already have research for ' forestry, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research, the School of Astra-physics at Mount Stromlo Observatory; and now we hope to add to those institutions in the fullness of time this Australian National' University.

But it is very necessary to prepare our plans carefully and to provide for a sufficient lapse of time. 1 assure the Senate that the Government will pay due regard to the primary claims of the housing needs of the people. There is so much planning to be done, however, that it is necessary to make a start and get the project under way in the near future. An additional reason for urgency is this: The Government hopes that the council of the university will be in a position to attract toits professorial staff certain eminent scientists who are now abroad, and some of whom reflect great lustre on the teaching of this country. It is necessary that some approach be made to them by somebody authorized to speak for the university in the near future. Otherwise^, their services and the services of other outstanding scientists and men may be lost to this country.. That is an additional reason why we should not allow from four to six years to elapse, as certain senators have suggested, before we do anything at all. </para>

The Government has paid fees and allowances in&gt; respect of 9,000 men attending the universities in Australia. It has provided! subsidies direct to each of the six universities. It has already advanced tothose universities £1,500,000 to enable accommodation to be extended and furtherplant and equipment to be provided. The money which will be expended in 1946-47 on buildings alone at the six State universities will amount to approximately £800,000. In addition the payment of fees and subsidies direct to those universities will  account for another £2,000,000. Accordingly <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner'ssuggestion</inline> that we should reduce, the proposed annual grant to the new university by £50,000 and distribute that sum annually for research to the various universities, falls far short of what we are already doing and what we have already planned. ' Apart from what T have told the Senate, the Commonwealth now provides £52,000 per annum for research alone at the six existing universities in the fields of physical science and social. science. Therefore, I may claim that this Government has shown full appreciation of the needs of higher education, and of the need to extend the universities in the States as well as to build its own university in the Australian Capital Territory. Altogether, it has made a most generous contribution to thecause of higher education. </para>
                    <para>
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline>
                        raised a very interesting point when he spoke of the need to establish scholarships. The tragedy in Australia in the past, and the greatest barrier to research, has been the absence of' assistance in that form for post-graduate work. The sum of £325,000, whichit is proposed under the measure to make available annually, will be very largely expended in the provision of scholarships and fellowships, and allowances to graduates who will be attending the new university. That will prevent those men, as has been happening in the past, from obtaining scholarships which necessarily take them abroad, and thereafter, not returning to give the benefit of their knowledge and experience to this country. I assure the honorable senator that that phase of the matter has been fully considered by the sponsors of this proposal, and I trust that a very generous proportion of the £325,000 to be made available annually will be apportioned for that purpose.
                        <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline>
                        suggested that the university might be named the " John Curtin Memorial University". That is a worthy suggestion which, even at this late stage, I shall convey to the Government, but 1 believe that something of that nature has already been considered. However, 1 point out that the name of Australia's late Prime Minister will be perpetuated in one of the very important research schools to be established.
                    </para>
                    <para>To-day our universities are overcrowded with students, and professorial staffs and their assistants are overworked. Consequently, there is a very grave neglect of' a very important field, that of research. This university, if it develops, as we hope, will rectifythat deficiency. It will be for the council to determine whether under-graduate facilities should be provided at the new university. I think that such facilities, inevitably, will be provided because the Canberra University College, which is already functioning, provides a nucleus for that purpose. That body is affiliated . with the University of Melbourne, at which its studentstake their degrees. The Council of the University "College is most enthusiastic about this project, and I anticipate that that college will be the first of many which will group themselves around the parent university with each college developing its own spirit and approach to the university and its problems and the community in which they are established. </para>

However, I am at least able to say that not all members of the Cabinet favoured the name that was chosen. There was a difference even in the Cabinet.

I believe that the name is distinctive and bears the advantages which I mentioned in the course of my second-reading speech.

                        <para>.- I have indicated that, accepting the principle that a university at Canberra is necessary and that now is the appropriate time for its establishment, the bill shows signs of careful preparation and considerable knowledge of other universities. However, some honorable senators apparently have a misconception of the meaning of paragrapha, which states that one of the functions of the university shall be to encourage and provide facilities for post-graduate research and study. The burden ofmany speeches has been that the youth of Australia will be educated at the university. I cannot agree that post-graduate training involves the training of youths. One honorable senator' also said that education at the university should be Australian in outlook. If we set out to make education national in outlook, we shall confine it to very narrow limits. Education has no boundaries; it is international. Furthermore, if we decide that all post-graduate work must be done at the new university, thus preventing our most brilliant students from working with the students of other nations, the establishment of the institution will be little short of atragedy. I hope that the government has no such intention-. In spite of what the Minister has said, I am still gravely doubtful as to whether certain phases of the post-graduate research work proposed to be done at the university can be done in Canberra. Considering medical research, three great scourges of the human race immediately come to mind, namely, cancer, tuberculosis and infantile paralysis. Students will not be able to carry out research into these diseases unless they have patients to study and examine. Canberra is known to be one of the healthiest communities of its size in Australia. Therefore, in order to carry out research into many diseases it would be necessary to bring patients to Canberra and to pro-x vide accommodation for them here. I do not agree with the Minister that the objects set down in the bill will be achieved. Australia has not neglected higher education, except in a few respects, but it has neglected primary education. One honorable senator said that 600 students were engaged in their first year  of  study in the medical course at' the University of Sydney. He implied that the establishment of a university at Canberra would relieve  Congestion  in Sydney. That is not so. The first essential -of a medical course is the presence nearby of a large metropolitan hospital to provide plenty of practical examples for students. I fear that many honorable senators who expect great things of the new university will be gravely disappointed. If the Minister returns to Canberra 25 years hence and reads the report of the speech which he made to-day,  he  will be astounded to realize how greatly his opinions have changed in -the meantime. He will be disappointed that many things which he had expected to happen have not occurred, although, no' doubt, he will be gratified that some of his prophecies have been fulfilled. I repeat that it would be a grave mistake to attempt to carry out post-graduate research work here without keeping in touch with developments in other countries. Although it is a deplorable fact that competent men who have been trained in Australia have left the country and have not returned, I consider that it would be advantageous for brilliant students to go to Vienna, for instance, to study research in eye diseases, or to other European centres of learning. There should be an interchange of views between our research workers and those of other nations.  1  am sorry that some honorable senators consider that" I am opposed to the advancement pf higher education. That is not true. I had the advantage of attending a university, and, therefore,'! have some knowledge of this subject, and do not approach it in the same frame of mind as certain honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber. I hope that the expectations of honorable senators opposite- will be realized, but I warn them not to expect too much. Australians must not be led to believe that the establishment of a national university at Canberra will be the ultimate achievement in educational progress in this country. </para>

                        that I bad every intention to reply to his remarks, but my attention was attracted by an attendant when the honorable senator 'resumed his seat. He formed the impression that the Government proposed to concentrate oh the development of the particular type of education that might be styled Australian education. Tt is unfortunate that that impression has been created. I thought that emphasis was placed on the development of an Australian national spirit, but that had nothing to do with the form of education to be undertaken at the proposed university. I pointed out that there would be a liaison with research workers overseas in certain respects, and that we proposed to send our research workers abroad in order to obtain, first-hand knowledge of the progress being made in scientific research. I- then said that the Government desired to obtain the services of eminent scientists from abroad. That would establish another liaison. The .council of the university will adopt a continuous process in that regard, as it will be necessary to keep abreast of the latest developments in research .throughout the world. That is an aspect of education in which Australia has been sadly deficient up to the present and that, gap will be bridged by the proposed university.
                    </para>
                    <para>It is only reasonable that we in Australia, in our .research work, should concentrate, particularly in the early stages, upon problems peculiar to this country. In our medical research I think we should place less emphasis on diseases like smallpox, which is not prevalent in Australia, although it rages in countries adjacent to our shores, and place more emphasis on the maladies mentioned by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> such as tuberculosis, infantile paralysis and cancer. The honorable senator raised doubts whether adequate research could be conducted in Canberra on subjects of that nature. I confess that I .am not competent to express an opinion on the* matter. I accept the view of the experts' who have advised the Government regarding it, and that view has been supported by no less eminent an authority than <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Howard</inline> Florey. The doubts of the honorable senator on that point could be dismissed, in view of the fact tha.t the Government has not proceeded hastily, but has had the benefit of- that expert advice. The Government will not take any part in influencing the development of the proposed university. It will be for an expert council to determine which fields of research shall be entered on, and in which order the various elements of research shall be undertaken. </para>
                    <para>Another point raised by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> related to the congestion which is apparent in other universities throughout Australia. It will be for the council to determine whether the Australian National University shall develop on undergraduate lines, either wholly or partially, and whether quickly or at a slow pace. No influence will be exerted by the Government on this body other than such influence as may be brought to bear by the two members of the council from the Senate and the two from the House of Representatives. It may be that in the fullness of time the undergraduate aspect now founded in the Canberra University College will achieve such prominence that it will attract students from other States. I hope that it will . achieve such fame throughout Australia and the world that we may even attract students from overseas. That would be a very desirable development. I gather from what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has said that he now feels disposed to support the bill. I value that support, if I have interpreted his intention correctly. I now find that he has retreated from his retreat, and accordingly he has established an interesting position in a double negative. I take it that he is now advancing with the supporters of the bill, in order to pass it through its remaining stages. I welcome the honorable senator's support, and congratulate him upon his conversion. </para>

                            <para>- No. I have been interested in the school ever since its establishment. At first it was impossible to get students for love or money, whilst the forestry schools in the various States,, particularly that at Creswick, Victoria^ are flourishing. I hope sincerely that the expectations with regard to the university to be established under this measure will be realized, but I do not think it will undertake post-graduate courses in my time.. Canberra should have educational facilities similar to those in the capital cities of the States, but we shall have to proceed slowly.  The bill provides for a step in a right direction. I am not a pessimist, but, having regard to the record of the Australian Forestry School, we will do extremely well if half the expectations regarding the proposed new university are realized. </para>

                        <para>. -  I hope that the hopes expressed by honorable senators regarding what may be expected of this proposal are based on sounder premises than those on which he offered his remarks oh the Australian Forestry School. A great measure of success has been accomplished in the Australian Capital Territory with regard to afforestation. As the result of both practical and theoretical work carried out, large pine forests have been established, and forestry work has been done here equal to that accomplished in any of the States. The flooring timber in all the houses now being built in Canberra consists of pine grown in the local "forests. For four and a half years I was ministerial head of the Australian Forestry School, and I know what I am talking about. The school has produced some exceptionally good foresters and, if it has not been overwhelmed with students, it should be remembered that for six years there was a world war. "We had a fine assembly of students prior to the war, but they sought permission to enlist in the fighting services and were allowed to do so. That in itself shows that a fine spirit was developed at the school, and holds hope for the future as to the kind of spirit that will be infused into the educational life of Australia by the proposed university. No honorable senator who loves culture and higher education should fail to reply to base charges such as those made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie's</inline> conclusions with regard to research students are based on false, premises. He seemed to think it imperative that every State university should be able to send its students to the Australian National University for the purpose of research, but all of the universities throughout the Commonwealth will still have the right to award scholarships for research in overseas universities. We hope to see schools of research established at Canberra which will compete with schools overseas, and at the same time will derive benefit from research carried out abroad. In the course of time, this will prove of greater value to the community than some of the research work undertaken abroad, because the investigations made in Australia will have a more direct bearing on local conditions. As to the suggestion that the establishment of a national university will not relieve the congestion of medical students in their first year at the University of Sydney, it must be remembered that that university has practically a century of tradition behind it, whereas the Australian National University cannot be developed overnight. When a school of medicine is established at Canberra which can compete on the same footing, as the University of Sydney, we shall find that students will come to Canberra.. We cannot expect immediate alleviation of the congested conditions in the State universities. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> said that students did not return to Australia, after having undertaken research abroad, but I contend that it would be to our advantage if.they returned in order to give to us the benefit of their research. We shall induce students to return to Australia and so enable the country to benefit from their riper experience and increased knowledge only if we offer to them conditions equal to those offered in other countries. I am convinced that if conditions were made sufficiently attractive many students who have made their mark abroad would be only too pleased to return to the Australian National University to give of their best to their country. </para>

He has set an example which might well be followed by other Ministers. I feel, however, that his suavity was not exceeded by his sense of fair play. I cannot allow  to pass without protest his repeated remark that I had retreated from, and apologized for,_the attitude I had adopted towards this bill. I said that, as the Parliament had decided to establish an Australian National University my only desire was that it should justify the Minister's highest hopes. My fears still remain, however; I am puzzled to know where <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> got the impression that I had said that the universities in the several States would be debarred from undertaking research and carrying out post-graduate work once the proposed university was established. I cannot imagine how any words of mine could have been construed in that way. I now assure <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> that my understanding and common sense would not allow me to fall into an error of that kind. The honorable senator is labouring under a misapprehension. So that there shall be no misunderstanding regarding my attitude towards this hill, I repeat that, as the second reading  has been agreed to, and, as I have no objection to its machinery provisions, I wish the university success. I hope that those who will control it will take notice of the things to which I have directed attention, and that the highest hope of the Minister will be realized. I point out, however, that those hopes have been based mainly on the success of <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Howard</inline> Morey. </para>

                        <para>. - This ' clause provides for the establishment of various research schools. [ should like to have seen an additional paragraph intimating that a research school of international affairs was in the mind of the Government. The Minister will probably say that there is nothing in the measure to prevent such a research school from being established, particularly in view of the provisions of Clause 8, but realizing that in the years to come this country will be called upon to play a greater part in international affairs, I am of the opinion that provision should be made for the proper -study of international problems. The need for such training is emphasized by the fact that Australia has appointed trade commissioners, Resident Ministers and ambassadors to various countries, and will probably make further appointments of that nature. The persons appointed to such position, or at least, the members of their staffs, would he the better qualified for their important duties if they were to undergo a period or training in international problems. Having in mind the importance of such studies, I regret that there is not specific mention of a research school of international affairs in this clause. </para>

As Australia is playing an increasingly important part in world affairs, it certainly is desirable to focus attention on that aspect of our activities. I again point out that the -setting up of' any of these schools will be a matter entirely for the council of the proposed university. I pointed out earlier that a university grows in accordance with the needs of the moment and the needs of the people; its growth is gradual.

Senate, and two shall be members of the House of Representatives elected by that House, lt would appear that a mistake has been made, for surely equal representation of the two Houses of the Parliament i§ inconsistent with legislation which was passed recently. It would appear that, in this instance, the opinion of people outside the Parliament has been accepted. Naturally, they would agree that the Senate is at least equal in importance to the House of Representatives. 1 am glad that by accepting that outside advice the Minister has shown his high opinion of this branch of the legislature. I draw his attention to this matter so that if a slip has been made in granting equal representation to the two Houses, he may have the clause amended. </para>

                            <para>- Sub-clause 8 provides that three members of the .council shall be appointed or elected to represent the professorial and teaching staff of the university. As the total membership of ' the council may be 30 members, three members does not appear a sufficient number to represent the professorial and teaching staff. I know the danger of having too many professors associated with the control ' of a university, because, however eminent they may be in their professions, they are not always practical men. I say that  without meaning any offence. My first impression was that there was danger of too much influence by the staff of the university, but that does not appear to be the case on further examination of the clause, although, as convocation may elect .to the council not more than nine members, the way is open for more than three members of the teaching staff to be elected. I want to guard against having too much university influence on the council and also against having too little such influence. If under sub-clause 5 it is intended that additional professors or members of the teaching staff' shall be appointed to the council I think that their number should not exceed five. That is a fair proportion of the 30; but there is a danger both ways, and I should like to know if the Minister has any information about that matter. Probably all universities at times have had the experience, of being rather over-influenced by the .lecturers or professors. In this case, I should like a clear course to be steered between too many representatives of the lecturing staff, and too few. . I am drawing attention to this matter in the hope that we shall be able to do something to avert dangers that are inherent. </para>

                        <para>. -  I welcome the approbation of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> regarding the provisions of sub-clauses 2 and 3. Provision is made in sub-clause 8 for three representatives of the professorial and teaching staff. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has said, membership of the council may be as high as 27, to which number there may be added a further three. The council will determine whether these three shall be drawn from the professorial staff. I am confident that we can safely leave that to the discretion of the council. I point out that in a council of 26 at the Sydney University there are five members of the university staff, and at the Melbourne University, where the council numbers 32, there are also five. So far as the Australian National University is concerned, it is proposed, after conferring with the authorities of the other universities, to limit the number for the time being to three, with the possibility that the council itself may determine to add to the number. I believe that there is sufficient safeguard  there to meet the two possible difficulties that are visualized by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie.</inline></para>

                        <para>. - In my remarks prior to -the . adjournment of this debate some weeks ago, I mentioned the assistance that had been given to Great Britain by the Dominion of Canada in the way of food gifts and facilities for finance to purchase food. I had hoped that before the resumption of this debate my request for a statement- by the Treasury as to what assistance had been given to the Motherland by Australia would have been met, so that I could have compared that with the effort that has been made by the Dominion of Canada. Unfortunately, I arn not able to make that comparison, as there is no record of any statement being, made by the Treasury on the lines I have  suggested, and I can only hope that more will be done by this country for such a well-deserved cause so that we as a people may claim an honoured place equal to that occupied by citizens of the Dominion of Canada. </para>

                    <para>The difficulties caused by the fact that many foodstuffs, such as Australian wheat, are not being sent to the United Kingdom at all, because of the method of distribution adopted could be surmounted to a. degree by making an outright  gift  of foodstuffs to the Mother Country. The citizens of Australia have given a lead by making a voluntary effort to alleviate the desperate food position in the United </para>
                    <para class="block">Kingdom. Individuals have been sending parcels to relatives and friends, and the collection pf funds for the purchase of foodstuffs has been efficiently organized on a purely voluntary basis. However, in addition to that voluntary effort, I believe that it is highly desirable that the Commonwealth Government should make a gesture to the people of Great. Britain by making an outright gift of, say, £5,000,000 or £10,000,000 worth of foodstuffs. I am sure that the people of this country would wholeheartedly support any such action by the Commonwealth Government. We would then have the feeling that not only were we playing our part individually, but also that Australia as a member , of the British" Commonwealth of Nations was doing its best to augment the scant ration at present available to the British people - so scant, in fact, that a person arriving from another world might well be excused for asking whether Britain actually had won the war. After six  years df trials and tribulations, the British people now have to face a new rationing horror that we in Australia were never called upon to face, namely, the rationing of bread. I assure honorable senators that even "during the war the bread eaten by the people in the Mother Country was of the worst type that it has ever been my lot to eat. It looked and tasted horrible. The inclusion of a high content of potato, rye and barley flour and God knows how many admixtures under the guise of flour, made a loaf which we in Australia would hesitate to give to a dog. But, after their long years of privation, the people of Great Britain must now face the fact that this extremely repugnant loaf is to be rationed. I do not believe that any other country has succeeded in extracting a higher content of flour from wheat than was achieved in Great Britain during the war. Prior to the landing at Gallipoli, the dark rye bread we had to eat in the Grecian Islands was the worst we had ever tasted, but  even that bread was more palatable than some of the bread we had to eat when I visited Great Britain during the war. In those circumstances, a gift of foodstuffs from Australia, including a substantial quantity .of our nutritious Australian wheat, would hearten the British^ housewife .more than any other article of  food. Therefore, I urge the Government to do something along the lines I have suggested. </para>
                    <para>Australia could also make a substantial gift of meat to the people of Great Britain. I am still not convinced, as&gt; I have seen no evidence to the contrary, of the truth of the astounding statement made by the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator .J. M. Fraser),</inline> and apparently culled from a report of the Nutritional Committee in London, that the people of Great Britain are now enjoying 78 per cent, of their pre-war ration of meat. Such a statement is too ludicrous to gain credence in this chamber. I. am afraid that one of the assistants who helped to compile that report must have been an official of Australia House, whose previous job had been to take stock of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Beasley's</inline> own private supply of provisions. I cannot imagine that that committee could make such a statement, in view of my personal experience in Great Britain during the war; and the position, if anything, has since deteriorated. </para>

                    <para>Ostensibly, the motion is submitted for the purpose of directing attention to the need to send as much food as possible to Great Britain ; but to any honorable senator who followed the remarks of the Leader of the Opposition as closely and as critically as he should, it was obvious that the Leader of the Opposition was not so much concerned about increasing food supplies to Great Britain as he was to attack Australian workers and indulge in superficial theatricalism with the object of discrediting the workers of this country who did such good work during the wa.r. About 3,000,000 food parcels have been sent by individuals in Australia to Great Britain since the cessaton of hostilities. Had additional facilities been available, that quantity would have been considerably greater. There can be no doubt about the desire of the Australian people to do all they possibly can to send additional food supplies to Great Britain, but the people of this country cannot be blamed for the fact that adequate facilities' were not available for that purpose. They cannot be blamed for the fact that, for the best of reasons from the viewpoint of the British Government, more liberal conditions cannot be made to enable, them to do so. </para>

                            <para>- Bigger parcels could be sent at cheaper rates, but the British authorities have limited the weight of parcels and fixed the charges. Apparently, the real problem is one of distribution of the parcels in Great Britain. The point I wish to emphasize more than any other is that the motion would imply that the people of Australia lack proper appreciation of the position in Great Britain. </para>

                    <para>I: is obvious that what is intended by the motion is not so much to direct attention to the scarcity of food in Great Britain and the need for Australia to send more food to the Old Country as it is to attribute to place the blame upon the workers who have, gone on strike in this  country. There is a good deal of loose thinking as well as loose talking about strikes. In my judgment, strikes are caused mostly by provocative and incompetent management, just as wars originate as the result of actions of provocative or incompetent governments. </para>

                            <para>- In that instance, had the employers exercised tact and been sympathetic and genuinely anxious to prevent a strike they  could easily .have done so. Strikes are not peculiar to Australia. They are a common occurrence in almost every country, more particularly in those countries which are highly industrialized. Where ji few employers have dictatorial powei-3 and are prepared to use them against the interests of the workers, strikes will inevitably occur; they are the inevitable outcome of provocative or incompetent management. I ask honorable senators to compare the working conditions in coal mines in New South Wales with those enjoyed by the miners in the mines of the Zinc Corporation Limited at Broken Hill. At the latter mine,, The men work under comparatively ideal conditions. I visited that mine in May last and spent half a day underground. I have had considerable experience in gold mining, although very little experience in coal mining. In the mines of the Zinc Corporation Limited at Broken Hill conditions underground are almost as safe and as clean as those in underground railways. At one time that mine was notorious for the dangerous conditions under which the miners worked, but today there has been a complete change. One can enjoy a meal 2,800 feet below the surface in just as much comfort as on the surface because the air below is pure, and there is no dust. The Leader of the Opposition endeavoured to attribute our failure to send more food to Great Britain to the occurrence of strikes. </para>

It was merely so much theatricalism for propaganda purposes. It was a wholesale condemnation of men without a proper inquiry and without any effort being made by the honorable. gentleman to establish the relationship between cause and effect. At Broken Hill, men work in the mines at contract rates which are arrived at by conference and- agreement; In addition to the contract rates, the men were being paid a bonus of 15s. 6d. a day when I was there in May. Their conditions of work were ideal in comparison with the conditions under which coal-miners work. In my judgment, the conditions in coal mines could be made just as good as those at Broken Hill. </para>

                            <para>- That is so. Those conditions could have been avoided. Had the. men gone on strike, as they were entitled to do in the circumstances, 1 can imagine that honorable senators opposite would have condemned them without giving a thought to the cause of the trouble or without suggesting that the conditions should be improved. I consider that it is more than ' a coincidence that strikes should occur just prior to the general elections. It will be recalled, that strikes also occurred in Great Britain immediately after a Labour government had come into office. Strikes cannot be avoided unless managements are sympathetic and, above all, competent. Where there is provocative or incompetent management, as there is in the New South Wales coal mines, on the waterfront, and in other places, there will always be strikes. </para>

                            <para>- No, but in nine out of ten mines where strikes do not occur, the management 'is found to be more sympathetic and competent than in mines where strikes do occur. Primarily strikes have their origin in inefficient management. I emphasize, that fact in order to combat the arguments advanced by the Leader of the » Opposition, who claims <inline font-style="italic">ipso facto</inline> that men who go on strike are entirely to blame. I point out that the coal-miners in New South Wales are under the obligation not only to earn their own livelihood but also to provide royalties and dividends for a large number of persons who contribute nothing towards the mining of coal. Strikes' are inevitable in such circumstances. I believe that, if the Leader of the Opposition and his supporters were in the same position as the coalminers, waterside-workers, _ or meatworkers in Queensland, they would do exactly what those men have done. Employers have far too much power to hire and " fire " at their own sweet will. That is one reason why strikes occur. The average employee working for the average employer has no voice 1at all in deciding the conditions under , which he shall work. An employer may please himself whether hie allows a man to work or discharges him. This gives rise to considerable irritation. The trouble in Queensland arose, according to press reports, because four men were discharged on the ground that their work was not satisfactory. The men considered that their work was satisfactory. The employers were adamant and so were the workers. A trial of strength took place, and resulted in incalculable loss and inconvenience to the general public. Had proper machinery to control this sort of thing existed in Queensland, the strikes would not have occurred. . </para>

                    <para>Consider the dispute that  was  reported in New Zealand on the day that the motion now before the Senate was submitted by the Leader of the Opposition. According to the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> of the 5th July, New Zealand wharflabourers refused to load butter for America. They claimed that the butter should be sent to Great Britain instead of to America. They could obtain no satisfaction, and so they decided to hold up the shipment. Had I been one of [ill] those workers I would have taken a similar stand. </para>

No explanation was forthcoming. The men were entitled to be informed of the reason. They are men just as we are, and should not be ignored, either as workers or as citizens. They are entitled to be considered in the same way as employers. They should not be expected to .act on the assumption that the employers can do no wrong.

                            <para>- Yes, The answer was that America was making available to Great Britain an equivalent quantity of fats. &lt; _ Then -the workers asked : " Why should not America use its- own fats ? ". That was a pertinent question. My point is that it is unreasonable to expect thousands of men to carry' out the will of employers against their own views without friction or delay occurring. The report in the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Argus</inline> went on to say that. the Prime Minister of New Zealand, speaking on behalf of the Government, had stated that the price to be paid by America for the first consignment of 10,000,000 lb. of butter was 2s. 9d. per lb., New Zealand currency, compared with the price of ls. 8d. per lb. paid by Great Britain. It appears that, notwithstanding the desperate need' of the British people, for butter, the owners were sending it to America because they could obtain a higher price from that country than from Great Britain. </para>

The position is that a government, by the laws which it makes, delegates certain powers to employers who, for all practical purposes, act dictatorially in their dealings with employees. In this case, the butter was owned privately, not by the New Zealand Government. Because the owners were able to secure a high price in America they decided, without consultation with the Government- - </para>

                            <para>- It may be erroneous in the honorable senator's opinion, but it. is not erroneous in my opinion. I am dealing with the position as I know it.. It will not be denied that the men protested against the butter being sent to America when, in their judgment, it should have been sent to Great Britain. The honorable senator may ask: "What right had the employees to interfere and dictate to the employers? ". I say to him that he is destined to be disillusioned if he thinks that the workers of New Zealand, or of any other country, can be controlled along such lines. </para>

                    <para>Take another  example  of the causes of industrial disruption. In the United States of America, prices controls were removed recently with the result that the purchasing power of wages was considerably reduced. This act represented an interference with the workers' right of access to the means by which they live. </para>
                    <para class="block">What remedy do they have against such an act? Similar acts have been committed, in many countries, including Australia before the Labour party came into power. The only remedy is to go on strike. The workers are not able to appeal to a court to prevent inflation. They may appeal to their government, but if the Government refuses to act and allows them to be fooled, ruled and robbed from the cradle to the grave, what can they do ? What would the honorable senator do in similar circumstances? He would take some action. </para>

                            <para>- Exposing people like the members' of the Opposition. That is why I am a member of this chamber, and why honorable senators opposite will be defeated at the next elections. It may seem that my remarks are irrelevant, but this motion was made for an alleged altruistic purpose. The Leader of the Opposition professed to be concerned about the interests of the people of Great Britain, but his whole speech was an unprovoked' attack on those engaged in production who have given of their best during the war years. The workers of Australia have more than held their own with the people of other countries in both primary and secondary industry. Although- our  working personnel' was- reduced to the- absolute minimum during tHe&gt; war, the value of secondary production increased by 69 per. cent. That gives some- idea of the way in- which the workers whom the Leader, of the Opposition condemned' responded" to the call at a time of great nationalstress. If the employees on- the waterfront, and those w.ho man- the ships and mine the coaL received fair, treatment,, which they will ultimately get; there would be no. strikes. So long as there is divided and conflicting, control in the coalmining industry, inflated overheadcharges and enormous wastage- of manpower, the ' friction that results ' in loss of coal, production will continue. Only when we treat men as. we should like to be treated ourselves shall we remove the causes of strikes. </para>

                    <para>If strikes .are to become things, of the past, we must have more democratic control than, at present, of primary and secondary production. As long as the coal-mining industry is controlled by a few men who act in a dictatorial manner there will be strikes, and' they will occur when it suits the convenience of the few  men who cause strikes for the purpose of discrediting a Labour government, or for other political purposes. It is much' more than a mere coincidence that strikes occur either immediately before or after the elections: In almost every instance where I have been closely associated with negotiations in connexion with industrial disputes, it has been- disclosed that disputes have their origin in the way in which industries have been managed. Only after negotiations, and possibly' appeals to the Arbitration- Court, do the management relax and industrial peace for the time being prevail. If there is . any more talk about strikes by honorable senators opposite, I hope they will- speak more intelligently than previously. The Leader of the Opposition contributes nothing of value in saying that the Government should take its courage in both hands. What does he imply that the Government should do? Does he mean that workers who go on strike should be bludgeoned, shot or imprisoned, as in the past? We have had men thrown into prison, but strikes still occur. In view of our experience, particularly during the  recent war, a much more intelligent approach should be made to this problem. We should try to imagine ourselves in the position of  coal-miners,  waterside workers or seamen, particularly during the war years. If I am a reasonably good judge of human nature, exactly what those men have done is what honorable senators opposite would have done in similar circumstances. . </para>

If honorable senators opposite, who condemn the men on strike, really  understood human nature, or were prepared to treat men as they treat their machines, there would be very little friction in industry, and few strikes would occur. More food for Britain can be obtained only by providing better conditions for workers in primary and secondary industries, including men on the waterfront and those who go down to the sea in ships. Better conditions must be provided for them, not only in Australia, but also in other countries. Unless something be . done in that direction, , conditions will become . worse ; but if action along those lines be taken,' there will be a progressive ' improvement of conditions in industry, and strikes of which we have heard so much will become things of the past. </para>

                        <para>. I had hoped that the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> would tell us what the Government has done, and intends to do, to provide more food for Britain, but there has been almost a conspiracy of silence  regarding this matter. About a month ago, I asked a question  which  had as its foundation the proposal to ration bread in Britain. I asked what the Government proposed to do to increase food supplies -to Britain, and .1 received the stereotyped reply that the Government was giving consideration to the export of food to the United Kingdom.. It is significant that Ministers have refrained from supplying figures showing the quantities of food sent to Britain, and I am reluctantly compelled to conclude that they show almost a complete indifference te the plight of the British people. Had the Government so chosen, it could have supported what nature has done, and what Australians are willing to do, in. the way of providing large quantities of foodstuffs for our kinsmen overseas. This is a matter that is exercising the minds of. many people in this country. The motion has drawn from the. Postmaster-General a series of piffling statements regarding strikes. He evaded the real issue.  At one time I thought that he would suggest that the people of .Britain should have a feed of zinc: As soon as the war was over, and the people of this country learned what Britain had faced, and was still facing, because' of a shortage of food, the generous Australian spirit manifested itself in a great wave of sympathy. It did not stop there, but was expressed in action. We have been told of the millions of parcels that have been sent to Britain by private citizens of the Commonwealth who  were determined that they would make some contribution to ease the situation. Decent citizens of all classes rose to the occasion, and " Food for Britain " appeals sprang up throughout the Commonwealth almost overnight. But did the Chifley Government assume leadership, and call for a vast production drive,  oi do any of the things that any Australian Government worthy of the name would have done? It did not. On the contrary, it caused a statement to be broadcast in -which opposition to the appeals for parcels of food for Britain was expressed. I heard the broadcast. The official spokesman was supported by a Minister of the present Government. That happened about seven months ago. Excepting for blather by some Minister <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> the subject of food for the underfed people -of Britain, and an appeal from the Minister for the Army <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Forde)</inline> to  " the workers " to "co-operate in despatching food " when there were meat, shipping and coal strikes, the Government has not lifted a finger. Its record in this matter is' black. Compared with that of the New Zealand Government it is feeble indeed. In meat exports to Britain alone since January of this year, New Zealand has a record of 500,000 tons. Last February, the Prime Minister of- New Zealand set up a national committee for " voluntary saving pf food for Britain and other overseas countries ". . By May of this year, after the campaign, had been in operation five weeks, 1,651,000 citizens of New Zealand had surrendered 1,0S5,537 meat and butter coupons. That represented a week's ration for 250,000 people. Coupons are still being received in increasing numbers. The efforts of the people of New Zealand are backed by the Prime Minister  of that dominion and his Government. He promised that the Government would stand behind any worth-while scheme to  send more food to. Britain, and he has kept his promise. There is, in New Zealand, a national drive to save fat, so that Britain may have more tallow. The sister dominion is aiming at impressive increases of - all essential- foodstuffs. A comparison of New Zealand's efforts in this direction with our efforts in Australia is humiliating. Australia has about 13,000,000 cattle compared with about 4,500,000 in New Zealand, and there are 1.22,000,000 sheep in Australia whereas New Zealand has only about 32,000,000 sheep. Yet since January of this year New Zealand has ' shipped to Britain about 500,000 tons of meat. All that the Commonwealth Government has done is to blather about a target of 300,000 tons by the end of this year. If the efforts of the two dominions are compared it will be seen Australia has made a poor effort/ All decent Australians are filled with a sense of shame. The Australian people have sufficient imagination to understand what Britain is going through. There are many in this country who know what Britain did for Australia and the rest of the world in 1940 and subsequent years. If given a chance, the Australian people would throw themselves into a Food for Britain" drive- that would be astonishing. But they have not been encouraged by the Government to do so. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> visited the United Kingdom a few months ago, and although he was there for only a short time he must have seen the sad plight of its people.- Yet when he returned all he could say was, " Things in Britain are pretty tough ". He let it go at that. Such a state of affairs is not good enough; we must do better. If the Prime Minister had had ,any vision or imagination, he could have done great things; the people were only waiting for him to give them a lead. He failed to initiate a movement to send a worth-while gift of food to the people of Britain. By God, they deserve it. </para>

                        <para>. -  This is one of the most extraordinary debates to which I have ever listened, in this chamber. Never previously have I heard so much hypocrisy presented so blatantly to the Senate. After six years of war, members of the Opposition now make impassioned appeals of the kind that we have heard to-night, but one has only to look at the speakers to see that those appeals come from their heads, not from their hearts. We must remember that the parties now in opposition were in power during the period to which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> has referred to-night. A nonLabour government was in office at the time of Dunkirk, and after. </para>

Despite the public demand for rationing, the then government would not introduce it because, in its own words, rationing would be "politically dangerous ". It feared the loss of seats at the next elections. Then what happened ? The Labour Government led by its late Prime Minister, John Curtin, appointed the Rationing Commission, consisting of three men, to set up an' organization for the rationing of foodstuffs and clothing in this country. He asked <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. A.</inline> W. Coles, then the independent member for Henty in the House of Representatives, to be  chairman  of the commission, and ex-Senator J. A. Spicer and myself .to be members. Ex-Senator Spicer actually attended the inaugural meetings of the commission which carried out the preliminary planning of the rationing organization; but he made it clear that he was not sure at that time whether he would continue to be a member of the commission because that matter would have to be determined by his party. </para>

                            <para>- Yes. The party met, and ex-Senator Spicer informed his colleagues that he had provisionally accepted an appointment to the Rationing Commission in view of the fact that the Labour party was anxious that the commission should be a non-party body. The party meeting decided that ex-Senator Spicer would have to decline appointment to the commission because of the political danger of rationing; yet members of that same party, deep-dyed in hypocrisy, are proclaiming in this chamber tonight that Australia is not doing sufficient to ease the food shortage in Great  Gritain.  To complete the story, ex-Senator Spicer did not attend any further meetings of the Rationing Commission. However, the Government, anxious to retain the non-party character of the Rationing Commission,' because it believed that the task of imposing rationing upon the people of this country should be divorced entirely from party politics, then approached another member of the United Australia party, the former member for Martin in the House of Representatives, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. W.</inline> V. McCall, with a request that 'he . accept membership of the commission. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCall</inline> stated publicly that the ' Labour ' Government was giving him an opportunity to. do a war job, and he was thankful for that opportunity and would be pleased to become a member of the commission. When he appeared before his party caucus, a determined effort was made to force him to resign from the commission, but he said that he would not do so. He felt that it was one way in which he could serve his country. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McCall</inline> remained on the commission, which has been a non-party body ever since. We all remember those days - that is, all of us who care to, and have the political honesty, to think back. There are .others, of course, who were afraid to face the necessity of rationing, and choose now not to remember. What is the true story of the Australian Government's efforts to assist the people of the Old Country? Every citizen of the United Kingdom with whom a visitor may converse - members of the Opposition as well as Government supporters  have had an opportunity fo visit Great Britain in war-time- is thankful for the great efforts that the Australian people have made to send to that country all the foodstuffs that could be spared. Of course, everything we send overseas does not go to Great Britain itself. In fact, a great ileal of what we save in certain lines goes to our sister dominion of New Zealand. One particular item that we export to Vew Zealand is rationed in this country but not in New Zealand. . </para>

                            <para>- Sugar. One result of this is that in New Zealand hotels are open all day. Honorable senators from Western Australia have been making great efforts to' secure a greater allocation of sugar to the breweries of that State so that more beer may be produced ; but from the point of view of beer consumption, Western Australia is better off than any other State. </para>

                            <para>- I do - not know what it is now, but up to three years ago it was greater than that of Australian beer. The more sugar that is used in the process the greater is the strength of the beer produced because sugar is the fermenting and fertilizing agent. I have no doubt that New Zealand is doing its best to send foodstuffs overseas, and I do not wish to detract one iota, of the credit that is due to that nation. Before the war New Zealand was a great meat exporting country, and probably its only market was Great Britain. New Zealand has continued to supply that market to the 'best of its ability. The name Canterbury lamb has become a symbol of high-grade lamb throughout the world. That was the back-bone of the New Zealand export trade. Throughout the war, New Zealand has continued to send large .quantities of meat to Great Britain, but meat rationing in that Dominion is not so severe as it is in this country. Severe rationing of meat, butter, sugar, and tea has been imposed in this country. Recently the former Director-General of Unrra said that only two nations in the world had maintained war-time restrictions in order to send food to starving Europe. These were Australia and the United Kingdom. In the case of Australia, war-time, restrictions on butter have even been increased so that every possible ounce may be exported. In addition, of course, many thousands of pounds worth of foodstuffs have been sent from the people of this country to relatives and friends in Great Britain as individual gifts. Air carriers have, left our shores loaded with parcels for the people of the Homeland. There cannot be any doubt about the suffering of the British people to-day, and, I have no doubt, it is the. wish of every Australian citizen to relieve that suffering to the greatest possible degree, but to charge this Government with having -failed to do everything possible over the years to improve Britain's food position is blatant  political  hypocrisy. As I have said, the United Australia party - now the Liberal party - deliberately withdrew its representative from the Rationing Commission because it regarded rationing as a' political danger. The  anti-Labour  administrations in office in the early months of the war were not courageous enough to introduce rationing. Even after the war had been in progress for two years, nothing had been done ; but when the Labour Government which has been so bitterly attacked in the course of this debate purely for political propaganda, endeavoured to face the position, little or no assistance was given by the then Opposition. The state of this country at the time of the introduction of rationing  was such that the first job of- the commission was to ensure that there was adequate food and clothing for the civilian community, so sadly had the stocks of these goods been depleted. Had rationing been held off for another three months, the position would have been desperate. There had been set up by a previous administration the Department of Supply, the function of which was to ensure that the requirements of the services were met. It did that job well; but it was an easy job, because the civilian pool of commodities could be raided. When Labour assumed office, and appointed the Rationing Commission, one of its responsibilities was to throw the responsibility on the Department of Supply to make certain that adequate supplies were available not only  for the armed services, but also for our civilian population. </para>

                    <para>I have no wish to speak at length on this matter, but I felt that I should tell the true story, including the manner in which the Opposition tried to sabotage the inauguration of rationing, which was urgently required in the national interest. The civilian community in this country has done an excellent job. In the ration of foodstuffs allowed to the Australian people there is nothing to spare. It is true that Australia is in a better position than many other countries, but one has only to read the many thousands .of letters received by the Rationing Commission to realize the great difficulty that is being experienced under the present rationing scale. Thousands of civilians are suffering hardship. Some members of the community are fortunate in that they are able to have meals away from home, but others, mainly working-class families, members of which have most of their meals at home or take meals from their homes to their place of employment, are enduring extraordinary hardship. I repeat that the people of the United Kingdom are loud in their praises of the efforts of the Australian people to send to Great Britain all the foodstuffs that they can reasonably spare in order that they may show their appreciation of the great fight put up by the British people during the war. We hope that it will not belong before the fruits of victory that have been so well earned by the British people will be theirs to enjoy. The dark days that we all thought would end with the fall of Rome, Berlin and Tokio, have not yet passed. We cannot but admire the spirit of the British people who have voluntarily reduced even their meagre war-time rations .in order that pestilence shall not arise from famine in Europe, as was the' case after the last war. They realize that their own safety lies in preventing starvation in Europe, thus avoiding an epidemic which would sweep across their own country as it did after the war of  1914-18.  They have done that voluntarily for the good of the world and for their own good ; and I have heard from thousands of British people - it is a shame that we cannot hear it echoed by some honorable senators opposite - their sincere thanks to the people of Australia for what they have done for the people of Great Britain. </para>

                        <para>. - I did not intend to speak on this subject. I assumed that the matters under consideration were matters concerned with present-day affairs, and that our discussion would not deal with events of years ago. I' am astonished at the speeches made by two honorable senators opposite. ' The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> sought to justify the Government's failure to send food to Great Britain by supporting the action of strikers in this country. He spent half an hour attempting to justify every strike which has occurred in Australia. What his remarks had to do with the subject under discussion, I do not know. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> dealt with events which took place nearly five years ago. I am sorry that his recollection of those events is not a little nearer to the facts. Honorable senators will recall that before the Labour party assumed office - that is, before Japan entered the last war - abundant supplies of foodstuffs existed in Australia. We had plentiful supplies of food and textiles. At that time the tea-growing countries had not been overrun ; and plenty of sugar was available, because Fiji, J ava and other sugar-producing countries had not been overrun. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> says' that preceding governments should have introduced' rationing years bel ore it was introduced and at a time when we had abundance of food which we could not ship overseas because of the hazard of submarines, does he expect the people to forget the conditions which existed at that time? Rationing in Australia has nothing to do with the subject of the motion before the Chair. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> endeavoured to justify our failure to send, more food to Great Britain oh the ground that Great Britain was sending food to other countries. He praised Britain's generosity in that respect, and that praise was well deserved; but it is absurd to say that we should not send more food to Great Britain because Britain is sending food .to other countries. The fact of the matter is that at present we have an abundance of foodstuffs. For this time of the year, meat supplies are unprecedented in the history of this country. We have an over-abundance of meat at present. If a campaign were launched to gave animal fats in this country, we could send thousands of tons of fats to Great Britain. We' could spare large quantities of food of all kinds. The Government takes credit to itself for the fact that private citizens in Australia are sending food parcels to the people of Great Britain. The fact that they were able to purchase such food proves that the food is available here. However, the Government has left to private citizens the job which it should have done, and which it could do much more graciously to help the hungry people of Great Britain.  Honorable  senators opposite are condemned out of their own mouths when they claim credit for the efforts made by private citizens in sending food parcels to Great Britain. Honorable senators opposite claim that no food was available to be sent to Britain, and that had it been available sufficient ships could not be obtained to transport it overseas. When ships were made available the Government took no action to see that they were fully loaded with foodstuffs. I had hoped that the motion would have been debated on the basis of Australian sentiment towards the Old Country, recognizing that our  people can, and desire, to spare all food not essential to their well being in order to help the people of the 'Old Land. The#  motion  has not. been debated from that" point of view. The motion, .which speaks for itself, implies that if more severe rationing is necessary in Australia to enable more food to be sent to  Great  Britain, the people of this country are willing to submit to it. At the same time, our people want- to be assured that when they submit to rationing, the . food thus  made available will be sent to Great Britain. But it is not being sent to Britain. Whilst- recognizing the achievements of the present Government - and it is not to be condemned for all its actions - there is in its inaction in this respect something which is not Australan in sentiment or fair to the people of the Old Land. Although <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> would naturally hear private people in Great Britain thank private citizens in Australia for the dole they were sending overseas, the people of Australia know that, in this matter, the Government, unfortunately, has failed because it "has not been wholeheartedly behind their efforts to send food to Britain. </para>

He said that we were concerned with what the Government was doing now, not with what it had done in the past.

                    <para class="block">On tie food front. But he . will not mention that Victoria has done those things under a Labour administration. The honorable senator said that when ships were available we could not, or would not, load them with foodstuffs. That is a remarkable statement in view of our heavy loss of shipping during the war. The honorable senator did not tell us what vessels were allowed to leave this country without being loaded fully with foodstuffs. He ignores the fact that all food ships are under the direction of the British Ministry of Food. He did not name any ships which he said the Government had not  loaded  with foodstuffs. He knows as well as any other honorable senator that,: despite delays, the food eventually was shipped to Great Britain. The shortage of shipping is still our greatest difficulty . in this matter. Indeed, we feel that shortage ' very severely on the Australian coast, particularly in respect of the transport of coal which is required for the production of many classes of foodstuffs. Neither the present Government, nor its predecessors, can be blamed for that shortage. It has been caused solely by losses sustained during the war.  That is why the British Ministry of Food has taken over the direction of all ships for the transport of foodstuffs from Australia. It arranges to load consignments in Australia and sends them to the nearest importing countries in order to save time and secure a quicker " turn-round " of ships. That is. what is happening, but the Opposition will not tell that to the people. Honorable senators opposite referred to the quantities of foodstuffs produced in Victoria, for instance, but they did not give any credit to the Government for. having directed the production of those commodities. </para>

For instance, the production of butter and cheese has been subsidized by the Government so that the yield in low production areas has increased considerably. More butter and cheese is being produced in South Australia now than at any previous time. </para>

                            <para>- It is being  sent overseas. I shall cite the figures later. The honorable senator knows the facts as well as I do. He is trying to make us believe that the Government is at fault because we are not allowed to send more individual parcels to people in Great Britain. Every honorable senator opposite who has spoken in this debate has raised that point. That is the honorable senator's argument, is it not? </para>

                            <para>- Honorable senators opposite argue that insufficient food is being sent overseas and they complain because the Government will not allow greater numbers of private parcels to be ' sent to individuals .in Great Britain. This matter involves the problem of shipping space. The Postmaster-General has stated that over 3,000,000 parcels have1 been sent to Great Britain from Australia since the cessation of hostilities. That proves that facilities have been provided for the sending of private parcels. However, the British Ministry of Food has discovered that more food can be sent in bulk than in private parcels. </para>

                            <para>- Well, the Government is doing that. The Opposition has " squealed " because the permissible weight of private parcels has been reduced from. 11 lb. to 7 lb. of food. This has made no difference to the total quantity of food shipped to the United Kingdom. The quantity that cannot be sen,t by parcels will be exported just the same, because most foodstuffs, particularly fats, are rationed here, and the surplus will be available for export. No honorable senator is opposed to supplying as much food as possible to Great Britain.. </para>

                    <para>I take exception to the terms of the motion submitted by the Leader of the Opposition, which states that the Government should take immediate action to increase the production of foods of all kinds and that, to this end, the primary producers should be encouraged and. assisted to the fullest extent. It is ridiculous to tell the Government to .take immediate action, because it has taken action already. I remind honorable senators again that shipments nf food from Australia are controlled by the British Ministry of Food, which so organizes transport that. it. r;m  make  use of shipping space to the fullest degree. </para>
                    <para class="block">For instance, if the Ministry has an opportunity to secure 1,000 tons of wheat from Australia and another consignment of 1,000 tons from Canada, it arranges for the Canadian wheat to be shipped to the . United Kingdom and for the Australian wheat to be shipped to some nearer country that is in need of food. For instance, by sending the Australian consignment to India it is possible to assist that country's starving population and at the same time make the fullest possible use of such shipping space as is available. Two trips can be made between Australia and India while one is being made between Australia and Great Britain. Also the journey from Canada to Great Britain is shorter than that from Australia to Great Britain. I now direct the attention of honorable senators opposite to the quantities of foodstuffs being produced in Australia for export. During 1945-46 we exported 1,500,000 tons, of wheat and flour. Admittedly a large proportion of this has been distributed by Unrra, but that was arranged by the British Ministry of Food. Honorable senators opposite referred to the meat strike in Queensland, hut they did not say that any ships had left for Great Britain without meat as the result of that strike. In fairness- we must consider the quantities of meat that have been exported to Great Britain. During 194-H, 300,000 tons of meat, carcass weight, will be exported under contract, as compared .with an average annual export of 237,000 tons for the three years immediately preceding the war. </para>

                            <para>- Yes: Eggs have been scarce in Great Britain for a considerable' time, but that is not the fault of this Government.' This year, we shall send to Great Britain eggs in shell and in powdered form equivalent to a total of 1,500,000 cases of eggs in shell. The average annual total for the three years preceding the war was 400,000 cases. The present rate of export has never been equalled in the history of Australia. The Government has taken special trouble to carry out the organization necessary for this effort. It has installed machinery for the pulping of eggs,' again at the behest of the British Ministry of Food. There is no point in the requests made by honorable senators opposite for immediate action. The necessary action has been taken. The only difficulties remaining are those caused by shortages of man-power and of shipping space. Honorable senators will recall that, when the Prime Minister returned from his recent visit overseas, he announced that he had offered a quantity of surplus sugar to Great Britain, but that the British Government could not accept it because of shipping difficulties. The British Ministry of Food secured supplies from other countries, and advised this Government to send its surplus sugar elsewhere. That is why sugar is being exported to New Zealand and other places. Apart from' exports controlled by the British Ministry of Food, the Government has shipped overseas 200,000 tons of sugar and 52,000 tons of dried fruits. </para>

                            <para>-- Yes, they hy ve been rationed severely in Australia. I: has been almost impossible to secure dried fruits here, and local consumption hp= decreased by 5,000 tons a year, thus increasing the surplus available for export. In spite of all these magnificent achievements, the Opposition claims that the Government' should take immediate action to assist Great Britain. The Government has been acting all the time, and it will continue to do so. Australia is not a great rice-producing country, -but the Government has curtailed the distribution of rice in Australia in order to provide supplies for countries in the Pacific area. That has been done at the request of the Allied nations, through the British Ministry of Food, and about 15,000 tons of rice has been exported. Who made provision for the extensionof rice-growing in Australia, despite State opposition, and curtailed supplies for home consumption, so that more rice might be made available to the British Ministry of Food ? It .was the Commonwealth Labour Government. It has done the very things which the Opposition professes to' be indignant about. It is not surprising that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong</inline> has referred to the hypocrisy of honorable senators opposite. To-morrow, perhaps, they will tell us that the price of wheat for home consumption should be increased, because of the shortage of' food in Great Britain, and the higher price paid in the United States of America. We should not exploit the difficulties of Great Britain that were born of war. </para>

                    <para class="block">I could point to the number of millions of pounds worth of food which the Commonwealth Government has provided through theUnrra organization for the peoples of countries stricken by famine because of the ravages of war. This has beenpossible because the Labour Government set to work some years ago for the purpose of restricting the local consumption of certain commodities' to enable them to be exported. One of the bills now before the Senate' deals with wheat production, and meat bills have been introduced to ensure an increased exportable surplus of meat. In the past, work of this kind has always been left to private enterprise. Honorable senators opposite will tell us that we should not have introduced plans for stabilization, so that the producers could get a fair and equalized price in Australia for their products, and so that the surplus might be exported to Great Britain on the most favorable terms. I hope that we shall not hear any more about this belated appeal by the Opposition to the Government to take immediate action in the interests of the people of Great Britain. The Government can be relied upon to stand behind the Mother Country, because Australia is a member of the British Com- ' monwealth of Nations. The primary industries of this country will be organized so that there will be systematic production of foodstuffs for distribution locally and overseas, without taking advantage of GreatBritain in its dire extremity. </para>
