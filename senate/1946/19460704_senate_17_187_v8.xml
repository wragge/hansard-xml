                        <para>It is not a fact that an ex-serviceman who has made an application for vocational training under the provisions of the Reestablishment and Employment Act cannot be accepted for such unless the industry which he seeks to enter is covered by an Arbitration Court award. </para>
                        <para>There are only three limitations on an ex-serviceman's choice of skilled occupation when he applies for training. First, he must be eligible under one or other of the categories defining those who may apply for training. Second, he must be considered suitable for the training desired, taking into account his qualifications, aptitudes and health. Third, the trade he proposes to enter must be a skilled trade which offers a reasonable prospect of secure employment. </para>
                        <para>The Central Reconstruction Training Committee has ruled that a skilled trade or occupation is one which normally requires the completion of a definite course of systematic training and industrial experience for the efficient performance of the operations entailed. In those trades which are covered by industrial awards or determinations, the "margin for skill" allotted in the award or determination must beat least £1 a week. </para>
                        <para>Where no award or determination exists, but a trade or calling is obviously skilled, a proposal to train in that occupation is submitted to the Regional Reconstruction Training Committee in the State concerned. On this committee the training authority and employers' and employees' organizations are represented. Regional committees are responsible for approving all selections for training and also conditions of subsidized employment where no award applies to wages. </para>

                        <para>- All of us gave the Minister full marks for standing up for the rights of the Senate. I believe that in constituting this important committee we should follow the procedure observed for many years with respect to the Joint House Committee and .the Library Committee by providing for equal representation of both chambers. Are we now to conclude that because the caucus dogs have barked the Minister and his colleagues in this chamber must submit like dumb driven cattle? Is there no alternative? If that is the position, I can only say that I am surprised. </para>

The Government is now acting in conformity with the usual practice. The honorable senator omitted to say that all parties did not have equal representation on all committees. He implied that other committees were constituted on the basis of equal representation of all parties. The precedent to which the honorable senator is opposed was established many years ago by governments with which he has been associated, and is one which honorable members in the House of Representatives desire to maintain.  </para>

                    <para>.- We had a fairly long discussion on this matter when the bill was before us. We agreed almost unanimously that this issue affects the 'status of the Senate, and that we should insist upon equal representation with the House of Representatives on the proposed committee. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> agreed with our proposal, and accepted an amendment from this side of the chamber providing for equal representation for the House of Representatives and the Senate. But now he says he is bowing' to majority rule, and he asks us to do the same. Does that mean that because there are 75 members of the House of Representatives and only 36 senators, this chamber should give way to the House of Representatives at all times? If that is the view of the Postmaster-General, he is putting the . Senate into a cleft stick. Surely he does not imagine for a moment that all honorable senators, even all those on the Government side of the chamber, will agree, to that interpretation of majority rule. Since the beginning of federation, the two chambers of this legislature have been regarded as equal in status, with the exception, of course, that money bills may not be originated or amended in the Senate. This is not a money bill, and I believe that the Senate should stick to its original views, even to the, extent of seeking a conference of representatives of the House of Representatives and of this chamber. We should not give way meekly on this matter. </para>

                        <para>- No. The Senate has agreed to the bill in principle. In my second-reading speech I expressed approval of the proposal with the reservation that I would seek some minor amendments when the bill reached the committee stage. Amongst those amendments was the one now under discussion. The" Postmaster-General accepted it, but now he has reversed his view, and in doing so has put the. Senate in a rather invidious position. I am sure that no member of  the Senate believes that this chamber should be subordinate to the House of Representatives simply because the majority of members of this Parliament are in the House of Representatives. I shall insist, so far as I am able, upon the Senate having equal rights with the House of Representatives in this matter at least. If the Postmaster-General had denied us this right in the first place, it would have been a different matter, but he was overborne by the arguments advanced from this side of the chamber and by some honorable senators opposite. </para>

                        <para>- "Well, that is how it appears to me. The Postmaster-General now asks us to accept majority rule, but this proposal is carrying majority rule to absurdity. The Senate has certain rights that do not depend upon numbers. Those rights are laid down in the Constitution, and  Ave  should be loath indeed to surrender even a tittle of them. The Constitution lays down that the Senate and the House of Representatives shall be equal in status, with the exception of the reservation in regard to money bills that I have mentioned. The Minister has surrendered meekly to the House of Representatives, against his better judgment and against the adviceof many honorable senators opposite, because I presume he desires to have the bill passed. I would prefer to prevent the passage of the bill rather than have this chamber surrender, now and for ever, any of its undoubted rights. Acceptance of the argument that the majority should rule . in this matter would permanently dispose of any claim the Senate has as a deliberative assembly in the government of the country. This is a time when a firm stand should be made against the House of Representatives. We should not give way to the establishment of a precedent in a measure which is not of great consequence to the economic life of Australia. We ought to be agreed that both branches of the legislature should have equal rights with regard to the broadcasting of parliamentary debates. We should not allow the status of this chamber to be reduced. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am greatly surprised, and no doubt many honorable senators opposite are equally astonished, at the attitude of the Government to this bill. The amendment of the House of Representatives affects the absolute right of this chamber to express its views through the medium of broadcasting on the same basis as members of the House of Representatives. We upheld the rights of this chamber, as embodied in the Constitution, in no uncertain way when this bill was under consideration by the Senate a few days ago. If we accept this amendment we shall agree to the House of Representatives dominating the Senate, but the Constitution states that this chamber has co-equal rights with the House of Representatives. We should not be false to principles in the Constitution which we have sworn to uphold. Are we to be at the beck and call of a committee, the majority of whose members will be members of the House of Representatives, and are we to be told by it when the proceedings in the Senate shall be broadcast? Is the committee to say that debates on bills in the House of Representatives shall be broadcast, and that when those measures reach this chamber, which is a house of review, and also the States' House, our speeches shall not be dealt with similarly.. </para>

The members of this chamber are elected by the same people as those who elect the members of the House of Representatives, and we. should have the same rights as members of that chamber. All measures, must be passed by the Senate before they can become law. If this amendment is indicative of the estimate of the House of Representatives of the importance of the Senate, I can come to no other conclusion than that a majority of honorable members of the House of Representatives consider that the 'Senate should be abolished. Let the consequences be what they may, honorable senators should stand firm for the rights of this chamber. We believe in the bi-cameral system. . of government. When the budget is received from ' the other branch of the legislature, .are honorable senators to be silent?

                    <para>. - The argument of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays would have carried more weight had this been the first occasion on which it had been suggested that the House of Representatives should have a majority of members on a committee representative of both Houses. The honorable senator is a member of the Broadcasting Committee as are also <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> and myself, making a total of three senators'. There are, however, six members of the House of Representatives on that committee. The Public Works Committee is similarly constituted. I have not heard any honorable <inline font-weight="bold">Senator complain</inline> that the unequal representation of the two Houses on those committees has led to any injustice. </para>

                <para>I believe that the real reason for the objection to the amendment of the House of Representatives is that some honorable senators opposite do not desire the proceedings of the Parliament to be broadcast at all, but instead of asking that the bill be withdrawn, -they seize on the constitution of the proposed committee to attack the. measure. I listened to the debate on this bill in the House of Representatives," and I gathered that many speakers there desired that the whole of the proceedings of the Parliament should be broadcast. That was what the Broadcasting Committee recommended; its members did not overlook the fact that the legislature has two branches. But they were also mindful that the existing facilities for broadcasting made it impracticable to broadcast the proceedings of the two Houses simultaneously. The outcome was the inclusion in the bill of a provision for the setting up of a committee to control the broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings. Various views as to the procedure which should be adopted have been voiced. For instance, it has been suggested that in the event of a bill being introduced first in the Senate, the whole of the debate on it - the first and second reading stages, the committee stage and the third reading stage - should be broadcast, . so that listeners would know just what was said regarding the measure in this chamber. A similar procedure would be followed when the bill reached the other chamber. That procedure would, of course, be reversed in respect of a bill which was introduced in the House of Representatives. Another suggestion is that proceedings in this chamber should be broadcast from  3  p.m. till  6  p.m., and that there should be a switchover to the House of Representatives from  8  p.m. till  11  p.m. That suggestion is open to the objection that it would be possible for a member on one side to attack a member on the other side of the chamber at, say, five minutes to six, thus leaving, the person attacked without an opportunity to reply. That difficulty could be overcome by not making the switchover, thus enabling the reply of the member attacked to be broadcast. </para>

It will be remembered that when the bill was before us previously I proposed that the number of members should be increased to ten. I shall move an amendment to that effect as that would provide, an opportunity for the two Houses to be equally represented. When the bill as originally drafted was amended in this chamber to give equal representation to the two House3 no . honorable senator opposed the amendment, and therefore I cannot understand why the Government ha3 backed down. , A committee of ten members would make possible the representation of each House by four members in addition to its presiding officer. If we accept the amendment of the House' of Representatives, I foresee a committee consisting of six members of one party and three representing Opposition parties. If provision is to be made for the rebroadcasting of speeches delivered in the Parliament, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> suggested, that would mean that every speech would have to be recorded. In that event, I should like to know who would control the re-broadcasting of those speeches, and whether it would be possible to prevent only portions of speeches from being, rebroadcast. The bill, in its present form, will give control of the broadcasts to the House of Representatives. I am sorry that the Minister has backed down. I move - </para>

                    <para>. - The Minister has told us that this bill is one of the most important that has come before the Parliament for some time. I believe that the future development of broadcasting will prove that contention to be correct. The broadcasting of parliamentary - debates is only in its infancy; therefore we should give this matter very serious consideration. I was pleased at the stand taken by the Senate, when the bil] was first discussed in this chamber, in insisting upon equal representation with" the House of Representatives on the proposed committee. I am still firmly in agreement with that attitude. I believe that in the near future we shall have to broadcast the whole of the proceedings of the Senate and of the House of Representatives. This is not feasible at present, but, having the possibility in mind, the extreme importance of the constitution of the committee must be apparent. The Senate should have equal representation upon it. This ' house is in a peculiar situation. It does not represent a privileged few, it represents exactly the same number of electors as does the House of Representatives. Therefore, its rights in relation to the broadcasting of debates should be equal to those of the House of Representatives. The mere fact that there are 75 members of the House of Representatives and 36 senators does not affect the electors' rights. If we are democratic, the Senate must be given equal prominence with the House of Representatives in the broadcasting of debates </para>

                    <para>, -  I am amazed at the warmth with which honorable senators opposite are debating this issue. I would agree with them if the status of the Senate were being treated lightly by the House of Representatives. However, that is not the case. The Parliament is making an experiment by proposing to broadcast its debates for the first time. The experiment may not achieve the purpose* that we have in mind of letting the electors know what their representatives in this Parliament are saying and doing. There are certain difficulties which prevent us from broadcasting the whole of the proceedings of both houses. Therefore, we have to compromise and establish some body whose task will be to decide what proceedings shall be broadcast and at what times the broadcasts shall be made. The problem then is to decide how the committee shall be composed. There are  36  senators and  75  members of the House of Representatives. We must select intelligent men who want lo make the experiment a success. We should appoint the greatest number of members of the committee from the House of Representatives, because that chamber has a bigger membership. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> has said that the Senate is elected by the same electors as the House of Representatives. That is true. He is one of six members representing South Australia. In the House of Representatives also there are only six representatives of South Australia. However, although there are six representatives of New South Wales in the Senate, there are  2S  representatives of that State in the House of Representatives. Were the Senate to be allotted the same length of time for broadcasting as the House of Representatives,. I should have four times as much opportunity to make myself heard over the air as my colleagues from New South Wales in the House of. Representatives. In order that each member of the House of Representatives should have as much time to speak during broadcasting hours as each member of the Senate, the House of Representatives must be allotted a majority of the time available for broadcasting. </para>

However, I deplore their lack of confidence in their colleagues in the House of Representatives. I have risen to correct statements made by some honorable senators opposite which made very good propaganda hut which were, in fact, a long way from the truth. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays claimed that, in this bill, we are legislating entirely for the House of Representatives and that the Senate will not be allotted any broadcasting time at all. What confidence can the honorable senator have in the House of Representatives? Does he think that, after a great deal of expeji.se has been incurred in installing broadcasting apparatus in this chamber, his colleagues will " wipe off" the Senate? Both <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> said that the Senate should be allotted as much broadcasting time as the House of Representatives. They were definite on that point in their second-reading speeches. They said that the Senate must claim an equal share of broadcasting time. It is true that the membership of the Senate is less than half of that of the House of Representatives; but, in addition, when we compare the number and duration of sittings of both Houses, it is clear that it would be impossible to divide the broadcasts equally between the two chambers. As very often happens, the House of Representatives would" be considering important legislation while the Senate was waiting for business. One need hardly point out. also that in the House of Representatives a greater ' proportion of members speak, and that individually they speak at greater length than honorable senators. It may be said that proceedings in the House of Representatives are more entertaining, whilst those in this chamber are more educational. The point we must bear in mind is that all parties in the </para>

I suggest to honorable senators opposite that should they fail to show a greater measure of co-operation with their colleagues in the House of Representatives in this matter, the people can hardly expect them to co-operate effectively with the Government in solving the major problems confronting this country. Ti, is clear that their obstruction on this occasion is designed to kill the measure,  because should we now amend  the House of Representatives' amendment and members of the other chamber maintain their present stand the bill will lapse. I appeal to honorable senators opposite to accept the House of Representatives' amendment, if only on the ground that failure to do  so may mean the abandonment of the measure. One honorable senator opposite said that it would not matter much if that happened. He may be right. It may be of advantage to him not to be heard over the air. At the same time, it will be of benefit to the people to hear the speeches of other members of the Parliament broadcast. I support the House of Representatives' amendment because I have sufficient confidence in my colleagues to know that they will do the right thing by honorable senators generally, and because I believe that the Senate as a whole is prepared to do the right thing by the other chamber. </para>

Since 1938, when I was privileged to take my seat in the Senate, governments supported by honorable senators opposite have had ample opportunity to apply the principle they now uphold in respect of statutory committees such as. the Public Works Committee and the Broadcasting Committee; but to my knowledge they did not attempt to provide for equal representation of both chambers on those important committees. Members of the .other House, for reasons best known to themselves, are not disposed to agree with the view expressed by honorable senators opposite; but rather than see the measure held up for that reason I support the House of Representatives' amendment. </para>

                    <para>. - Some misapprehension exists upon the point at issue in this matter. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> mentioned certain statutory committees. &gt; Equal representation of both chambers on those committees has never arisen as an issue in the past; but in respect of other committees which have to do with the privileges of members of the Parliament, that principle has clearly been observed during the last twenty years. I mention, for instance, the House Committee, the Library Committee and the Printing' Committee, each of which deals with matters affecting the privileges of all members of the Parliament. On each of those committees both chambers are equally represented, and I can see no objection to the Senate having equal representation with the House of Representatives upon the joint committee proposed to be set up under this measure. The issue before -us is not the allotment" of broadcasting time between the two chambers, or whether consideration of such a matter by the proposed committee will arouse acrimony. It is obvious that the House of Representatives will require much longer time on the air than the Senate. For instance, the House of Representatives is often busily consider- * ing important legislation while we are marking time waiting for business. But, as I say, that is not the point. No honorable senator would be so stupid as to demand that the Senate should have the same time on the air as the House of Representatives. But we maintain that the two chambers should have equal representation on a committee of this kind. I am surprised and shocked at the House of Representatives proposal. I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson's</inline> amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The fact that honorable senators on this side of the chamber disagree with the House of Representatives amendment does not indicate a desire on our part to hold up the bill, or to wreck it. I am astonished that the ' Postmaster-General  <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator'</inline></para>
                </talk.start>
                <para class="block">Cameron) lias adopted a defeatist attitude in this matter. The fact that we disagree with the House of Representatives amendment would not wreck the bill. Should we refuse to accept that amendment the bill would be returned to the House of Representatives; and honorable members in their generosity might agree to accept our suggestion that both chambers be equally represented on the proposed committee. It appears to me that whenever a difference of this kind arises, it is the Senate that has to give way. 1 forecast this position . last year when the suggestion that proceedings in Parliament should be broadcast was first made. Honorable senators opposite were inclined to sneer at my contention on that occasion, but the position I forecast has now arisen. We are to be in a minority, and the only reason given by the Minister for accepting the House of Representatives' amendment is that he desires to observe the principle that  the majority should rule. In such circumstances, if proceedings in the House of Representatives are to be broadcast for six hours, the time allotted for broadcasting the proceeding in this chamber may be only three hours, or even less. However, the. vital point is that this matter affects the domestic affairs of the Senate. The Senate should have equal representation with the House of Representatives on any committee dealing with the domestic arrangements of either chamber. With respect to the broadcasts, the basic consideration is the actual listening time. Honorable members may ramble on till  2  a.m., but the fact remains that the disillusioned public will not be listening to them at that hour, but will be comfortably in bed. Therefore, inevitably there will be jockeying for positions from  8  p.m. to  10.30  p.m., which is the effective broadcasting time. I am' afraid that in that regard if the Senate be not given equal representation with the. House of Representatives on this committee, this chamber will be the loser in the deal. Honorable senators opposite, apparently, rely too much upon the force of character of the  President  to uphold the rights of the Senate on the proposed committee. I am afraid that the  President  will be forced to bow to the majority view of the House of Representatives. </para>

It is interesting to note that during the many years in which governments formed by the. parties now in opposition held office in this legislature, no effort was made to alter the representation on statutory parliamentary committees.

                    <para>. - I am rather amused at the attempt to draw a red herring across the trail, and also by the lack of logic in the arguments advanced by honorable senators opposite. I expected the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)"</inline> to explain to us why, after agreeing to the principle of equal representation, he had changed his tune. The Postmaster-General himself, after listening to speeches made by honorable senators on both sides of the chamber, moved the amendment altering the constitution of the committee. Now apparently he has changed his mind. What lever was used to force the Postmaster-General to alter his view completely? If he can give sound and logical reasons for the action he is now taking, perhaps we on this side of the chamber shall be prepared to accept them, although it is quite possible that reasons that appeal to the mind of the Postmaster-General will not appeal to us. Not only the Postmaster-General but also his supporters agreed with the principle of equal representation when' the matter was debated last week; but to-day we find <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Aylett</inline> supporting the Postmaster-General's changed opinion. The honorable senator apparently fears that the measure may be scrapped entirely if the Senate insists on its rights. He believes also, by some curious process of reasoning, that if the bill were scrapped it would be the fault of the Senate. Put if the House of Representatives were obdurate, and would not take a reasonable view of this matter, would it be our fault if the measure had to be abandoned? Honorable senators opposite cannot have it both ways. If we insist upon our rights and the bill is withdrawn, the fault will not lie with us but with the House of Representatives. Had the Postmaster-Gcneral insisted upon the passage of the measure in its. original form, and called upon his cohorts to support him, the present position would not have arisen. But it was  the Postmaster-General himself who moved the amendment providing for equal representation. The. measure left this chamber with the blessing of all honorable senators, but because the House of Representatives insists on greater representation on the committee, the Postmaster-General has calmly agreed to let this chamber down, and has meekly brought back to us something dictated to him by the House of Representatives. </para>

                <para class="block">House of Representatives. That is completely fallacious. Not one member of the Opposition in this chamber has claimed that the Senate should have equal broadcasting time with the other chamber. All we seek is fair play, and we can well imagine the tricks that may be played if the House of Representatives has double the Senate representation, on this committee. Even at this late stage I ask the Postmaster-General to give to the Senate tie vital, cogent, reasons that caused him to change his mind. ' </para>

                    <para>.- This is an amendment to the vital clause  of the bill, which originally provided that, in addition to the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, there should be four members ci the committee, of whom two should be members of the House of Representatives and two members of the Senate. The Minister now desires that there shall be seven members, in addition to the  President  of the Senate and the  Speaker  of the House of Representatives, of whom two shall be from the Senate and five from the House of Representatives. Considering that the committee "will have to adjudicate, not only on the broadcasting time allotted to both branches of the legislature, but also regarding the apportionment of the matter that is to be rebroadcast, we realize how important it is that the committee shall be unbiased. A committee composed of a preponderating proportion of members from one House, and on which there is a greatly preponderating proportion of members of one political party, should be above all party considerations; but how could it be impartial if six members of the committee were members of the House of Representatives and only three members of the Senate? Such a committee could not function fairly and equitably. This measure affects the privileges of honorable senators, but what will the people think when they discover that the committee is to be composed of twice as many members of the House of Representatives as members of the Senate, and that the number of members of one political party will be double the representation of the other parties? </para>

                        <para>- Members of the House of Representatives who are appointed to this committee will gaze earnestly into a crystal and see only members, of that chamber availing themselves of the broadcasting facilities. I know that the numbers in this chamber are against me, but the proposed committee will be regarded by the people as unfairly constituted, simply because a majority of the members in both Houses have chosen to change their minds. It is impertinent of honorable senators opposite to say that if this measure be lost it will be the fault of the Senate. We thought that the bill provided for a committee which would act fairly as between the two Houses, but the House of Repre.sentatives altered the measure. That being so, whose fault would it be if the bill were lost ? It is evident that Government supporters in this, chamber have neither the courage nor the public spirit to stand up for what they really believe, or to insist on the rights and privileges of the Senate being preserved. I shall record my vote against the Senate abdicating its rights in such a disgraceful way. </para>

It is considered desirable to permit the re-broadcasting of speeches, subject to the control of the joint committee, in order that the Australian Broadcasting Commission may be in a position to re-broadcast a debate on a matter of outstanding importance. Such debate may take place when the majority of listeners are at work, and the commission may well consider that, in the public interests, it should be re-broadcast at a later hour when there would be a peak listening audience. The difference in time between the eastern States and Western Australia . may also render a rebroadcast desirable on some occasions. The new sub-clause will prohibit the rebroadcasting of any portion of the proceedings of either House of the Parliament except in accordance with conditions determined by the joint committee. </para></speech>

                    <para>. - I agree with all that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has said. When the' bill was before this chamber previously there was a lot of discussion on clause 14, which provides for immunity from criminal or civil proceedings in respect of broadcasts or rebroadcasts of any speech made in the Parliament. The proposed new clause imposes certain restrictions, in that the  committee will have to arrange the details of the broadcast or re-broadcast, so that in that respect the bill is better than when it left this chamber some time ago. Neverrtheless, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has raised a most interesting point. I should like to know whether the position as set out by him is likely to be the real procedure. Is it intended to make a record of every speech in each House, or will a decision be made beforehand as to which speeches will be worth recording? In the latter event, who will decide which speeches will be recorded? I assume that the committee will be entrusted with that, task. In other words, it will have to decide in advance that a speech to be made by, say, the Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator J. M. Fraser)</inline> must be recorded, whilst a speech to be made by me will not be worth recording. It is only necessary for me to point to that possibility to show the danger implicit in this provision. If, however, the whole of the proceedings are to be recorded, I should like the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> to give an estimate of the cost which would be involved. I know- that to get a speech recorded by some of the recording agencies is a costly business, and I suppose that the making of records for the purpose of rebroadcasting speeches made in the Parliament would also be expensive. As I have said, the only alternative to recording every speech is that some authority will have to decide beforehand what speeches are to be recorded. Such a committee would be working in the dark, as it would not know in advance what any member of the Parliament intended to say. The expense will be very great. Then the committee will have to decide which speeches, or. which portions of speeches, shall be re-broadcast. Nevertheless, I realize that this amendment will improve the bill by permitting some control to be exercised over re-broadcasting. ' Somebody will have to decide what may be re-broadcast, and that is a step in the right direction. It is what the Opposition advocated when the bill first came before the Senate, although at the time the Postmaster-General opposed our suggestions with all the power at his command. I am glad to say that the . decision of the House of Representatives has made him change hismind. We may blame him for giving way to the House of Representatives in relation to the composition- of the committee, but, in this instance, we must concede that his weakness of mind and his yielding of ground is all to the good. This amendment, although not completely satisfactory to me, will make the bill a thousand times more acceptable than it was in its original form. </para>

" <inline font-weight="bold">Senator GIBSON.-</inline> That is very unsatisfactory. Will the committee have the power to direct speeches to be recorded? If so, it will have very great power, indeed. Such power should not be left Government should at least express its opinion and lay down a policy regarding the recording of speeches. The recordings will cost a tremendous sum of money, entirely in the hands of a committee. The and speeches must be recorded if they are to be re-broadcast. Standard time in Western Australia is two hours behind eastern standard time, and if speeches are to be re-broadcast to that State at appropriate hours they must be recorded. The Minister should state the exact intention behind the proposed amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -  I am in a quandary. I am inclined to agree with the statements made by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson.</inline> I understood in the first place' that we were legislating for the broadcasting of the proceedings of this Parliament, which would not involve the re-broadcasting of speeches. Broadcasts can be made while the Parliament is sitting ' and can be relayed at those times to the commercial stations. There should be no need to make recordings. The practice should be to broadcast the proceedings of the Parliament only when the Parliament is sitting, not at other times. I realize that this bill involves an experiment and that, like all experiments, it can be dangerous. Because of this, and knowing that the Senate will have some control over the committee through the appointment of members from time to time, I am sure that we shall be able to give certain directions to the committee. I do not believe that the committee will abuse its powers, particularly in the experimental stages. However, should abuses occur, the Senate will be sufficiently alive to the situation to remedy them. Any adjustments found to be necessary can be made by it. Senators who may be appointed to the committee should take particular notice of what has been said here this afternoon in connexion with the rebroadcasting of debates. However, I contend that re-broadcasting should not be permitted. Broadcasts should be made only while Parliament is sitting. </para>

                    <para>. -  The proposed new clause will greatly improve the bill. When the measure was . under discussion . in the Senate reference was made to rebroadcasting and the fear was expressed that the bill would be passed in such a form as " to permit portions of speeches' to be re-broadcast to the disadvantage of the senators or members of the House of Representatives concerned. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has said that the proposal will add to the value of the bill; that is its purpose. This experiment of broadcasting is intended to make the public better informed as to the work of the National Parliament. From time to time, the Prime Minister and senior Ministers will make important statements with which the public ought to be acquainted as quickly as possible. An important statement might be made in the Senate while the broadcast was being made from the other chamber. The Prime Minister might make a speech in the House of Representatives at an hour when most of .the people of Western Australia, where the time is two hours behind eastern standard time, were at work. This might prevent 6.0 per cent, or 70 per cent, of Western Australians from hearing the broadcast. In such an event, the committee could direct recordings to be made for the purpose of rebroadcasting at a time when a majority of the Western Australian listening public would hear them. It is .claimed that difficulties would be involved in re-broadcast* ing, but there would be little difficulty in doing that. In any case, we must solve the problems as they arise. The committee should be able to overcome difficulties, and the proposed new clause will invest it with power to do so. </para>

                        <para>- Yes, for the original re-broadcast. When we discussed this matter previously we assumed that what would go out from the Parliament would be a broadcast of the exact proceedings in each chamber, and that that broadcast would be relayed through various stations. But we did' not have in mind "a recording or re-broadcast of such broadcasts. The Minister said that the committee might decide that statements made by the Prime Minister and the Leader of the Opposition prior to general elections should be re-broadcast; but he did not say that a committee, loaded in favour of the Government, might decide that only the Prime Minister's statement was to be recorded and re-broadcast.' Therefore, this proposal is limitless. Under this clause immunity, is provided in respect of broadcasts and re-broadcasts without limitation of time. The Parliament should hot agree to that.- By so doing it gives immunity in respect of statements which might be made in malice and cause irreparable damage to individuals, parties, or sections of the community. Previously, we were given to understand that speeches would be broadcast only when they were being made in' either chamber, and would not be re-broadcast at all. If stations were not available to relay broadcasts to outlying areas, people residing in such areas and wishing to listen were simply out of luck until the Government fulfilled its duty to make available facilities as soon as possible to relay the broadcasts to those areas. We understood that that would be the end of any broadcast, and that .only the member whose speech was broadcast and the person making the broadcast would enjoy immunity in respect of civil, or criminal, proceedings. Now, however, that provision  i3  being fundamentally altered by enabling the committee to agree to re-broadcasts and by extending immunity from civil, or criminal, proceedings to persons- making such re-broadcasts. Such rebroadcasts ma:y be repeated during periods extending over many months. </para>

                        <para>- Will it always ensure that only one re-broadcast will be made? I cannot imagine that the committee would authorize a re-broadcast from any A class station. The only rebroadcasts to which it should agree would be from stations which were not able to pick up the original broadcast; and even in that case only one re-broadcast should be .allowed. </para>

                        <para>- The whole idea cf this proposal was to enable people, who found it convenient to do so, to listen in to proceedings in the Parliament as they occurred. Now, it is proposed that such broadcasts be recorded and rebroadcast over and over again by any A . class station. The dangers of such a provision are unlimited. It may turn our broadcasting system into a propaganda machine.. I cannot conceive of any reason why a re-broadcast should be  made by an A class station. From what was said previously, I imagined that where a re-broadcast was necessary in order to serve outlying areas which are not capable of picking up A class stations only one such re-broadcast was to be permitted. Otherwise, we shall open the gates to propaganda of the worst possible type. .Should the committee be biased, the re-broadcasts will not be controlled as they should be. I know that the Minister will say that this is the responsibility of the committee, and that he washes his hands of it. This is the responsibility of the Parliament, which should not place the onus on a committee. I am not prepared to hand over to any committee such a fundamental responsibility. </para>

                    <para>. - The amendment is consequential. We have already decided to permit re-broadcasts, and it is necessary to make this consequential adjustment. It is absolutely unfair of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> or anybody else, to assume that the committee will act unjustly. Not a scintilla of evidence exists to support the honorable senator's statement that the committee will be biased. I ask honorable senators to accept in good faith the committee for the time being, and to apply remedies in the light of experience. </para>

                        <para>.  - The report of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> upon his recent hurried visit to Great Britain is an important document and of great interest to all honorable senators who care to read it. </para>

                    <para class="block">The quotations freely made by the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> yesterday are a good indication of the worth of the report. One regrets that the Prime Minister was not able to make a longer stay than he did; yet, the few days' of his sojourn seem to have imbued him with a high evaluation of Great Britain's share in the winning of the war. The Prime Minister refers to the " heavy burden of military commitments being borne by the people of the United Kingdom who poured out blood and treasure to save the world ". I am sure we are all deeply sensible of what we all owed during the recent great conflict to our membership of the British Empire and to the close and loyal co-operation between the units of which it is composed. The Prime Minister's report contains arguments for an even closer federation of the free nations comprising the Empire, for the extension of the federal spirit, and for that freedom in dealing with local problems that our own statesmen envisaged when they drafted the Commonwealth of Australia Constitution Act. In regard to the future, the Prime Minister states - </para>

                        <para>The fundamental basis of the foreign policy of the British Commonwealth is enthusiastic and sustained report of the United Nations. This is in accordance with the declaration of the conference of Prime Ministers in 1944, which was fully reaffirmed on this occasion. </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para class="block">That quotation might remind us of the existence of the Atlantic Charter, which w asso welcome by all of us during the stress of war but which now seems to have ' receded far into the background of international relations. So, quite wisely in the circumstances, the main feature of the report we are now dealing with is an allround acceptance of the necessity for adequate defence and the regulation of our economic life more or less upon that basis. In view of our bitter experience, we must acknowledge- this outlook and make our plans accordingly. To indulge in retrospection for a moment, I remind honorable senators that prior to 1901 the defence policy of the Australian colonies was reoriented from time to time in accordance with changes in the . internationalsituation, brought about by the exercise of British diplomacy. In 1901, Australia acquired the status of a nation. Later, General <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Edward</inline> Hutton came to Australia to direct our defence preparations.  His  work brought about, amongst other things, that reserve of Citizen Force members that supplied so many valuable leaders during the war of 1914-1S ; but it did not, under a voluntary  service system, supply the requisite personnel to man our defences fully. It is well known, and generally accepted, that Australia never contemplated an offensive war. Our policy was one of defence against aggression. In the first decade of this century Europe was restless, and nations were rearming. That made us' look to our own needs in the matter of protection, and an enlightened Labour party in those days heeded the advice given by Lord Kitchener, who said - </para>

                    <para class="block">As one result of the acceptance of that advice, an obligation to serve in the defence of Australia was imposed on all adult males and readily accepted by the great bulk of them. When war broke out in 1914 the scheme that had been adopted as the result of Lord Kitchener's report was only half developed. Unfortunately, it had been believed on the advice tendered that a war was not likely to break out until 1920. However, we emerged successfully from that war, and, in 1929, another Labour government suspended the compulsory military training clauses of the Defence Act. The year 1939 found us badly unprepared iri several respects -the result of the policy of previous governments. Shortly before the right honorable member for Kooyong <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Menzies)</inline> became Prime Minister in April, 1939, I heard him discuss our interests, responsibilities, duties and dangers in relation to the Pacific area. He advocated the formulation of a policy which would be discussable with friendly neighbours. He was not unaware of the trend of events.  His  later actions were in keeping with the possession of that knowledge, and a proper conception of the strategy of Empire defence. When he became Prime Minister, the right honorable gentleman revived the system of compulsory military training for homo defence.  His  other actions as head of a government in connexion with war-time administration, direction, and control, have been grossly misrepresented fre- quently  for party-political purposes.. Here is a case in point. I am reluctant to mention this, but I believe that somereference should be made to it.

                            <para>- These forces were actually engaged in battle. They were being used where and when they were needed. The Prime Minister has protested against raking over the dead ashes of the past. That is all very well, but when I hear people bleating  about such matters as " the  Brisbane line " I am reminded of an experience I had in Belgium some time in 1917. Things were rather unpleasant, and the body of a horse was lying not far from our position. It had been a good horse. It had hauled guns, and carried munitions and rations; but it was dead, and every time a heavy shell burst in the vicinity the carcass was thrown into the air. Each time this occurred there was less of the horse and more of the stench. That I believe is a good analogy. A fair representation of the true position is given by one whose services to the Labour party have been so extolled.

There were now ominous portents on the Pacific horizon which threatened to bring the conflict to our very doors. The arch-aggressor was making a desperate attempt to strike down the gallant Russians and to extend the conflict to the Pacific region. If Soviet Russia could be liquidated, Germany would be free to turn to South -Western Asia and Northern Africa in the coming northern winter, and probably to Britain in the spring. </para>
                        <para>If the conflict spread to the Pacific, the Australian people will take an entirely realistic view regarding the defence of their vital interests. Australia wanted peace in the Pacific. She is not a party to any policy of encircle ment, and never has been, nor would she be guilty of any act of aggression that might lead to a breach of that peace. Nevertheless, if need be, she was fully resolved to defend herself to the utmost of her capacity. </para>
                        <para>Through their membership of the Advisory War Council, most Ministers of the War Cabinet were familiar with Australia's war effort, and, since assuming office, the Government had made a broad review of the situation with the Chiefs of Staff and the Commander in Chief, Far East. The Navy was at the highest pitch of efficiency, as demonstrated by the notable exploits of some of its ships overseas. The Home Defence Army was welltrained, and its equipment had been greatly improved. The strength of the Air Force had. been largely increased, both in respect of home defence  squadrons  and the training resources for the Empire Air Scheme. The equipment of .the Air Force had also been much improved. Finally, munitions production and the development of production capacity over a wide range of classes, including aircraft, was growing weekly. </para>

                    <para>I return to the Prime Minister's report and to Lord Kitchener's reference to the value of diplomacy. Here is where we should take stock of ourselves. Although for no apparent reason we seem to be appointing diplomatic, not commercial, representatives all over the world, we do not seem to be proceeding in negotiations abroad with that smoothness that is desirable. We are rather prone to meddle, and we have seriously offended an ally whose fleet was  sacrified  largely in our immediate defence. But with direct reference to the Pacific area, our dealings with the United States of America have to be conducted on a basis, and with some regard to the stirrings of 1,000,000,000 people, in our proximity, who do not understand, let alone follow, our philosophy of life. Herein is our responsibility, and it is an immediate one. </para>

                    <para>For ourselves at home, we must profit by our vast and costly experience. Our Council of Defence is the constituted body charged with primary policy. It. has met of late, but only once. . Yet we have had a recent visit from the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, and from a senior Royal Air Force officer, both of whom have probably sown ideas capable of bearing fruit. I commend the Government upon its decision that Australia shall be represented at the conference to be held at Camberley. Generals Rowell, Berryman and Clowes are well qualified as our delegates. I take it that this conference is to be held for the purpose of formulating a plan by which, as a result of a close examination and analysis of the latest factors, and future likely developments, in warfare, our system of defence can be effectively arranged.  In this we are sure to be met by the problems of supply, manufacture, man-power, and communications, in that order of importance. No doubt consideration will be given also to our relations with the sister dominions, the development of additional naval bases, and an appreciation of Singapore and the islands to our north. Ample air power is, of course, implied. Honorable senators should understand that this is a means to an end and not the end itself. To appreciate this fact one has only to study the 1944-45 campaign in western. Europe. </para>
                    <para>If we undertake these obligations, great as they are, it must be with a realization of the vital issues at stake. A primary and important measure is to secure substantial increases of our population. Having . done that there, should be no further controversy as to the liability of every person to serve in some capacity in the defence of our land. Nor will there be, if we observe the principles of a true partnership in the Empire, any limitation set upon the employment and deployment of our forces such as was imposed by the Curtin Government. The* existence of two armies - Australian, armies - with varying conditions of service, has unfortunately created' in the community impressions that will endure with us for some time. For myself, I confess that I cannot, clearly foresee the future form of our defence forces. Mechanical developments and recent scientific discoveries have so widely extended the bounds of possibilities that, whilst strategical principles remain unchangeable it is conceivable that entire new factors regarding.  men and materials will govern the conduct of future wars. </para>
                    <para>We should not underestimate the value of the Prime Minister's visit to Great Britain and elsewhere.

They also provide for bilateral or multilateral planning according to the region and the governments concerned. They should lead to a notable advance in Empire co-operation and in British Commonwealth security. </para>

                        <para>.- During the visit of the Prime  Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> to London a momentous decision was made by the British Cabinet when it decided to withdraw British, troops from Egypt. For more than a century that ancient country, together with the Suez Canal, has been the keystone of Empire defence. Without knowing all the facts which led to that decision we might, at first glance, have regarded it as a tragic blunder. Conflicting statements have been made as to whether or not the Dominions were consulted previously, but it is doubtful whether any protest that they might have made would have been heeded. The terms of the Anglo-Egyptian Treaty, which expires this year, had an important bearing on the subject. It is inconceivable that the British Cabinet did not previously seek the views of its Chiefs of Staffs of the Navy, the Army, and the Air Force. Reports indicate that, in the light of the experience gained in the war of 1939-45, particularly the developments of the air service, they saw no great obstacle to the proposal. There is some comfort to  be  derived from th'e stand taken by the British Foreign Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Bevin,</inline> whenever Russia showed any signs of its designs for getting a footing on the Mediterranean sea-board. It may be that Alexandria is to remain a naval base, as Field Marshal Lord Montgomery, the Chief of the Imperial General Staff, is now investigating alternative plans for the defence of the Suez Canal. Let us hope that developments in the near future will remove any cause for anxiety, because any weakening of the Empire's prestige and strength would be a menace to the peace of the world. </para>

                    <para>In  some respects South Africa and Egypt cannot be compared. When the Union Jack was run up to the masthead in the market squares of Bloemfontein and Pretoria in 1900. two Dutch Republics, namely, Transvaal and Orange Free State, joined the existing British colonies of Cape Colony and Natal. Eventually they came under the British Crown.  Later,  when dominion status was granted to the union, British troops were withdrawn, but Simonstown remained a naval base. ' In both  world  wars South Africa took its place with the rest of the Empire with great credit to itself. Egypt proper is not British territory; it has not been conquered, and therefore the withdrawal of British troops sooner or later  was  inevitable'. The questions now to be decided are whether Egypt will sell itself to the highest bidder and whether the Egyptian Student Youth National Movement will pave the way for aggression and, .later, occupation by Soviet Russia. So long as the British Empire and the United States of America stand together within the United Nations, the better the chance of keeping Russia in check. No nation must  be  allowed to absorb Egypt and the Suez Canal. Time alone will tell whether the British Government has taken a wise step. Much will depend upon whether the United Nations can be more effective than the defunct League of Nations. </para>
                    <para>Coming nearer home,' I shall now refer to the defence  of  the Commonwealth. As was shown in the war which ended less than a year ago, Australia's safety in the future will depend upon the same Allied co-operation that brought about the defeat of Japan. Four of our most experienced generals from that war will proceed to London ..shortly to state the case for Australia at a Pacific Defence conference. They can do so better than can any Cabinet Minister or other politician. The Government is to be commended for making that arrangement. When Australia's contribution to Pacific defence is decided at a later conference between Britain, the United States of America and the Commonwealth, it is hoped that, in order to maintain our contribution at full strength, the government of the day, whatever its political outlook generally, will take a firm stand ' against any outside bodies which might, as in the past, be inclined to leave Australia's defence to a few patriotic citizens. The war with Japan has taught us that the nation which is unprepared pays dearly in 151lood and treasure in war-time for apathy and selfishness in times of peace. </para>
                    <para>Some of the interjections made by honorable senators during the debate today lead me to relate some matters of history. For seven years I was an associate member of the Military Board, and for the last two years before I ic-tired in 1933, because I had reached the age limit, I had full membership and was quartermaster-general. During the whole of those seven years it was the practice of the Minister for Defence for the time being to send for the heads of the three services and to say to them, "Here is £7,000,000 for you to divide" or "There is £5,000,000 available. Arrange your own allotments". Before the depression years I had to work out with my staff what amount of equipment, particularly munitions, would be required.. If we decided that, say, £4,500,000 was required, and submitted estimates to the Minister accordingly, we generally found that a blue pencil was struck through the estimate and we were" instructed to reduce it to, say, £1,500,000. It is of little avail for honorable senators of any political party to blame other parties. It may be said that non-Labour governments were responsible for deciding what the defence vote should be, but it can as truly be said that the Labour party did not object to the curtailment of defence expenditure. At least two honorable senators here tonight will remember that when I first entered this chamber I urged the then Government to increase the defence vote,, only te be asked, " Whom are "we going to fight ? " I repeat, therefore, that it ill becomes any honorable senators to throw bricks at any political opponent. </para>

It is a most interesting document, and parts of it cheer me greatly. Other portions of it, however, make we wonder whether the mistakes made during the twenty years between the two world wars are not to be repeated. We talk a lot about preparation against aggression, and at the same time much is said about improved social conditions. We cannot have both, because they are mutually exclusive. If we decide to spend large sums of money in preparing for ' this country's defence we cannot at the same time do what we would like to do to provide social justice for the people. The Prime Minister's statement deals with the burden of armaments in the following terms: - </para>

                        <para>If we are to promote the social progress and better standards of life to which the United Nations are pledged, there must be a reduction of the burden of military expenditure. But this cannot be achieved, nor can the optimum conditions for economic and social welfare be created, except in an atmosphere of confidence, trust and security. Therefore, it is a challenge to all, with disastrous consequences if it is ignored or evaded, to make the United Nations an effective organization, and the principles of its Charter a predominant influence in national policies. </para>

In the years between the two wars we said that the League of Nations was the cornerstone of our security and defence. We repeated our faith right up to the time when it was obvious that trouble was coming - when Hitler had militarized Germany, re-entered the Rhineland, and was prepared to go to war if his bluffing did not result in appeasement. I pray that we shall not place all our faith in the United Nations ; I hope that we have learned something from the past.

The proposal of the United Kingdom was that each member of the British Commonwealth should maintain service missions in London. These missions would receive their instructions from the appropriate body in their respective governments. The United Kingdom would maintain similar missions in each dominion and these missions would, in their particular case, receive their instructions from the United Kingdom Chiefs of Staff after consultation as necessary with the United Kingdom ' Government. There would be an inter-dominion exchange of missions as required. The system would be based on the national defence organizations to be maintained in the United Kingdom and in each dominion. </para>

                    <para class="block">Years ago, that was the aim of all men who had any knowledge of military matters. It was the hobby of some of us through the years to study with a view to perfecting ourselves in military lore so that, should the nation be attacked, we could be of service to it. The Prime Ministers, in their decision to link the whole of the forces of the Empire, each dominion being responsible for the defence of its own region, went back to the policy that was laid down in black and white by that great soldier and administrator, Lord Kitchener, of Khartoum, when he came to Australia in 1909. After surveying the position in Australia, he furnished a memorandum to the Australian Government in February, 1910. The idea underlying his plan was set out in these words - </para>

                    <para class="block">In other words, he contended that we should have sufficient forces in Australia to be able to hold an invader until such time as the British Navy could cut the communications of the aggressor. It must be remembered that, in those days, there was no air power, and sea power was paramount. Then we had in our minds . - and we made no secret of it - that the potential enemy was Japan. We introduced the system of compulsory military training of all citizens for national defence and we established the Royal Military. College with a great flourish of trumpets, but we starved it in the most shocking manner in the years between the two world wars. We also established a cordite factory, a small arms factory and a clothing factory. We did start on the right lines. During the years following World War I., we neglected essential preparations' for national defence in favour of otherneeds. All governments were guilty. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brand</inline> has said, Treasurers " blue-pencilled " defence plans. I have many fears that the bloody and dreadful lesson recently taught to us trill be forgotten as the years roll by, and that we shall be caught unprepared again. We have overthrown our enemies of today, but 20, 30 or 40 years are but a day in the life of a nation. It is absolutely certain that an aggressor will arise again to the north of Australia and that our sons, or their sons, will have to face an attacker once more. The Kitchener scheme, which was emasculated as the years passed, was absolutely democratic. We were working on the right lines, and we had a democratic army. We can have such an army again. There are four essential requirements for a democratic citizen army. The first is to have the best possible officers who, like myself and others in this chamber, have been promoted from the ranks on their merits. Secondly, there must be a democratic spirit and a system of education in the army. Thirdly, there must be an efficient means of handling suggestions and complaints.  We started such a scheme at Gallipoli, where we had a suggestion box on the beach. Many valuable suggestions came from the men in the trenches. Honorable senators may have heard of the periscope rifle invented by a young .Australian and made out of pieces of wire, some mirrors from a ship, and a piece of box. This andmany other valuable inventions were developed from our system of handling suggestions. They come from men in every walk of life - miners from Western Australia, prospectors, hunters, and others. These men had a fund of knowledge, and it was used to the best advantage. The fourth requirement is good pay and good conditions. </para>
                    <para>The Prime Minister's speech ' was intensely interesting, and I shall keep a copy of it for future reference. It has some very good " meat " 'in it. If this Parliament can only live up to the principles embodied in that speech and carry out its spirit, the nation will be very much better off in future than it is to-day. In studying the events of the years between the two world wars, it is amazing to see how generally throughout the Empire and certain European countries governments were lulled. They dreamed and talked a lot, but let themselves gradually drift into a state of unpreparedness, in which they were caught. .Never again must we succumb to the idea that, in the work of securing peace, power -and compulsion can be replaced. That was how the League of Nations failed. When it had to deal with a recalcitrant nation, it talked but did not use power. If we repeat this mistake, we shall "get it in the neck", because power and compulsion cannot be replaced by any economic or social magic. That is' why I draw particular attention to the Prime Minister's statement regarding the burden of armaments and the fact that an armament programme will not work, in with our social plans. Great social and economic progress was made between the two world Avars, but that contributed nothing to' the preservation of peace. Germany went to war in 1914, when it was one of the richest countries in the world. Never before had it been so prosperous. It was on the high-road to gain the lion's share of the trade and commerce of the world. It was a "have" nation, but it went to war. In 1939, when it. was allegedly a "have not" nation,, it went to war again. The preservation of peace consists in making our house secure against external attacks. Social progress, of course, consists of improving our internal organization. We have done a great deal in this direction in Australia, and we shall do a great deal- more. However, there is no relation between .the two tasks. We can perform the second task as we see fit, but we must never fall into the delusion tha-t thereby- we are providing for the defence of the nation. We must never again believe that any new form of magic can achieve what we ourselves must achieve by skill, hard work, and forethought in tackling the problem outlined by the Prime Minister. Mankind changes its nature in  the course of a thousand years or so as little as does a wolf separated from its pack or a sheep separated from its flock. That has been proved throu'gh the centuries. No measure of social prosperity and justice is capable of checking the lust for power that arises in the Asiatic and white races alike. Nothing but lust for power drove Germany on to war in 1914, and the same lust forced it on again in 1939. Probably the same lust, 50, 60 pr 100 years hence, will again force that nation into a war of aggression. The same thing will happen in Japan. Today we are pinning our faith, in the main, on the United Nations. When we come down to fundamental facts, we must realize that the success of that organization depends upon three great powers - the United States of America, the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics and the </para>
                    <para class="block">British Empire. The events of the twenty years between "World War I. and World War II. proved that, in enforcing peace, there can be no real substitute for our own will and our own power. Never again must we believe that the unpleasantness, the sacrifice and the responsibility involved in the use of our will and our power are too heavy a burden to be borne. We can bear them; and I believe" that we will. We must not shirk them. They are heavy burdens. It will be neither easy nor inexpensive to place our country into, a state of defence and readiness. I hope that in the future we shall not have a reccurrence of what occurred at the Royal Military College at Duntroon and the Royal Naval College at Jervis Bay. When we were up against it financially those were the first institutions to be affected. It is a thousand times easier and less expensive to continue such colleges than any alternative. It is more pleasant than the consequences of hesitation and appeasement, and belief in a Utopian experiment. It is practical. The Empire has had to pay in blood for its years of dreams and chatter in the past. That must never happen again. Any one who studies the paper now under consideration will be convinced that it outlines the only course for us to pursue. We cannot go to sleep again. We must maintain an efficient air force able to take the air and fight within 24 hours, and ships that can be commissioned and placed on the high seas in the same period. The men of this country must be trained to take their place in our defence, because it is wicked", damnable and shameful to send men into action untrained, or only partially trained. A government or a country guilty of doing that is guilty of cold-blooded murder. </para>

                    <para>That indicates the negotiations that have taken place on this matter which has been constantly raised in the Parliament, particularly with reference to the desire of the Ameri-. can Government to be granted the use of Manus Island as a base. I point out that Australia controls Manus Island under mandate. Therefore, we have not the power to make any arrangement along the lines intimated by the American Government. Honorable senators opposite also suggested that some arrangement might be made to make Canton Island and Christmas Island available to the Americans for use as bases. Those islands are British possessions, so we have no say with respect to their control. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Collett</inline> delved rather deeply into history when dealing with the subject of defence, and in order to support his case he quoted extensively from statements made by the late <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin</inline> when he was Prime Minister. I recall with sadness that this is the eve of the first anniversary of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Curtin's</inline> death, a fact which rendered more undesirable the honorable senator's action in citing our late esteemed leader in order to bolster up some political argument relating to " the Brisbane line ". </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator also dealt with various phases of our defence policy between World War I. and World War II. During that period a Labour government was in office at a time when this country experienced the worst economic depression in its history. Owing to the circumstances then prevailing that Government in its efforts to effect essential economies reduced defence expenditure. However, other governments during that period must accept responsibility for our defence policy between the two world wars. I again remind honorable senators that the only Labour government which was in office for a little over two years in that period was not in power, because the Opposition parties had a majority in this chamber. What <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> said with regard to the cordite factoriesand ammunition factories in the period between the two wars is correct. The staffs of those factories were reduced to a minimum. The staff at some factories which numbered 2,000 at the conclusion of World War I. were reduced to 100 employees. Honorable senators opposite will recall that when I was in opposition I drew attention to the fact that no provision was made to develop those factories from 1936 to 1939 when the clouds of war were looming. As the result we were caught unprepared when war broke out. Except for the comment with regard to the briefness of the Prime Minister's stay in London, no criticism has been levelled against  the Government in respect of the report in the paper now under consideration. Indeed, honorable senators opposite have received the paper with unusual favour. In doing so they have accepted it at its true value. </para>
