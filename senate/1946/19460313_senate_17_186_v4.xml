Ex-Senator Uppill was truly one of nature's gentlemen. He was kind and considerate and always thoughtful for the welfare of other people. He took a keen interest in rural matters and was a recognized authority on wheat and wheat production. He was of considerable assistance to the Rural Industries Committee,' of which he was a member, because of his extensive knowledge of primary production. We deeply regret his passing and tender our deepest sympathy to his widow and family in their bereavement.

"When I first came to this chamber I found the late ex-Senator Uppill most courteous, kind and generous, and in his passing the Senate has suffered the loss of a very gentlemanly representative of South Australia. I regret that he was not able, owing to ill-health, to finish his term as a senator.  His  loss will be felt greatly in South Australia as well as in the wider Commonwealth sphere. </para>

                    <para>-South Australia). - Since its inception the Senate has had among its members many men of outstanding ability and great powers of oratory, who have been remembered chiefly for those qualities. Not only in this chamber, but in the many other spheres in which my late colleague ex-Senator Uppill served, he was always regarded as one of nature's gentlemen. No ' incentive of personal ambition brought him to this chamber; he entered it because of a sincere desire to be of service to the State which he represented. Nature did not equip him as a "wordspinner", but it gave to him a keen analytical mind, a firm determination, and the courage to stand to his opinions, whether or not they were popular. As a member of the Senate he gave of his best; South Australia has lost a splendid citizen. I join with other honorable senators in expressing sympathy with his family in their great loss. </para>

I had known him for many years, and I believe that every one who knew him will admit that he was ii very fine character indeed. He had strength of character, and possessed <inline font-style="italic">a</inline> great sense of humour. He had been left with three motherless children, and he battled for them in a way that inspired every one who came in contact with him or with any of the members of his family. The late ex-senator also lived in a way that provided a lesson to us all. J have not known a man who has lead a cleaner life than ex-Senator Dunn. I deeply regret his passing. One would  have been prepared to take a lease of his life, and his sudden death is another illustration of the fact that in the midst of life we are in death.

For many years he <inline font-style="italic">was</inline> a prominent figure in public life in South Australia, first as a. journalist, and then as a member of Parliament. As a journalist he travelled extensively throughout South Australia, and wrote one or two interesting books on the interior of that State, and also on the river Murray. Subsequently he became a member of the House of Representatives for the South Australian Division of Boothby, and later in the Parliament of South Australia he held office of Minister of Education. For a number of years he was  President  of the Legislative Council.

                        <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - From time to time representations have been made to the Prime Minister by senators and members of the House of Representatives that they should be granted some alleviation of the disabilities under which they carry out their public duties. Not only must they incur substantial expenditure within their electorates in attending to the wants of their electors but in addition to maintaining their own homes within their respective States, they must also meet the cost  of  travelling to and from Canberra and  of  living expenses at Canberra while in attendance during parliamentary sessions. The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has given careful consideration to these representations and has come to the conclusion that some financial relief should be afforded to meet the cost of maintenance of senators and members at Canberra during the sittings of Parliament. A Commonwealth officer in receipt of a salary of £1,000 a year receives a daily allowance of £1 2s. 6d. when required to travel on official duty away from his home. The payment of a similar daily amount  to  members of Parliament would be a fair recompense of additional expense incurred by them while absent at Canberra from their homes. Senators and members travelling to Canberra from New South Wales and Victoria will therefore he paid £1 2s. 6d. a day for each sitting day  on  which they attend to their duties in Parliament, with a maximum payment  to  each of £100 in any financial year. Senators and members travelling  to  Canberra from the other four States and from the Northern Territory will be paid £1 2s. 6d. a. day for each sitting day  on  which they attend to their duties in Parliament, and for days at week-ends between sitting days on which they remain in Canberra during parliamentary sittings, the maximum to each to be £125 in any financial year. Payments will commence from the 6th March and provision will be made in the Appropriation Bill to cover the expenditure. </para>

                        <para>- I understand that the Commonwealth Government pays a subsidy to the governments of the States for the conveyance of honorable members on the State railways. I draw the attention of the Minister representing the Minister for Transport to the fact that at present it is impossible for a member of this Parliament to travel from Melbourne to Adelaide without giving seven days' notice, unless he is prepared to sit up in a second-class carriage for the whole journey. If he desires a sleeper" he is not allowed to have one, and he is not even permitted to occupy a seat in a first-class carriage, unless he gives seven days' notice. </para>

I might be excused if I drew attention to the fact that until recently there was a great clamour because of the control exercised in these matters. Now apparently the absence of control appears to constitute a difficulty. </para>

                        <para>- The shipping position is somewhat acute, but the disability being suffered by Tasmania is no greater than in any other State. Provision has been made for the removal from Tasmania, between the 15th February and 19th March, of approximately 200,000 bags of potatoes and 800 tons of crated potatoes. Other commodities are urgently required from Tasmania, and the Shipping Council is being pressed to bring them from that State. I refer particularly to timber for housing, and to fruit. I can assure the honorable senator that every attention is being given to the necessity for the lifting of potatoes and other commodities, and Tasmania is receiving a proportionate share of the shipping available, having regard to the claims of the other States. </para>

I have not seen the paragraph to -which the honorable senator has directed attention; but I 'should prefer to have these ships where they are than that the whole of the ships on the waterfront should be tied up.

                        <para>- Before the war Australia obtained its supplies of tinned plate from Great Britain, but after the outbreak of war supplies were obtained from the United States of America. I fear that as the result of strikes in the steel industry in the latter country there is a possibility of tinned plate being in short supply in Australia. Will the Minister investigate the position with a view to ensuring that fruit, vegetables, butter, and other goods, will not be lost through a shortage of tinned plate? I understand that unless prompt action be taken there is danger that this country will be left without supplies of this material, which Great Britain cannot manufacture in any considerable quantity. </para>

                        <para>- It is true, as stated by the honorable senator, that there is a shortage of tinned plate as the result of industrial trouble in the United States of America, but the Commonwealth Government has been alive to the situation, and has taken steps to secure supplies from both the United States of America and the United Kingdom. There is no danger that the canning industry of Australia will he jeopardized through any lack of supplies so long as the present Government is in office. </para>

This follows naturally from the facts («) that copyright owners for their own protection are members of their respective national organizations and (6) that the association acts for its own members and for the members of the overseas societies. The scope of the association's repertoire was fully explored by the Royal Commission on Performing Right, 1932-33. and the report deals with the matter at pages 7-9. When its rights have been challenged by persons conducting public entertainments and the association has been compelled to appeal for judicial protection, the courts, without exception, have been fully satisfied as to the right to collect fees. The association assumes the obligation to produce, if desired, written authorization to collect fees for the public performance of musical works (in terms of the Common wealth Copyright Act) of which the right of such performances is vested in the association by composers, authors and publishers. </para>
