                            <para>- It is the policy of the Commonwealth Government to encourage inquiry and activity in the matter of the education of pre-school children. In accordance with that policy, the Government has financed pre-school kindergartens at Lady Gowrie centres in. each of the capital cities of Australia. Recently, it decided to continue its assistance to those centres for a further three years, at acost of ##£##20,000 per annum. That decision has given much satisfaction to the committees which are giving voluntary service at those centres. The Government recognizes, however, that it has no general powers in regard to education, which is  primarily a matter for the States. This gesture is in the nature of a pilot-plant in. order to demonstrate what can be done in the field of pre-school child education. I doubt that the Government will consider favorably an extension of these centres beyond the capital cities of Australia; it may prefer to leave such matters to the States, as it is their legitimate field. I shall give further consideration to the honorable senator##'##s request. </para>

                                <para>(Senator the Hon. Gordon Brown). - I again remind honorable senators that it is not in order to address questions to the  President.  However, the honorable senator##'##s questions are of paramount public importance, and it behoves me to answer them briefly. To answer the second question first, I say in fairness to the committee that no, slight has been offered to the Senate. This chamber stands very high in the opinion of the House of Representatives. Undoubtedly the facts are as stated by Senator Aylett. During the three weeks period of parliamentary broadcasting ending on Friday next, the Senate will have been on the air for only one day. This is due to the fact that the committee, in its wisdom, has so decided. When the committee, in further exercise of its wisdom, decides that the Senate shall ##"##go on the air##"##, that will be done. It is well for the public to understand that honorable senators on the committee have not acted in any way that is derogatory to, the Senate, because they have pressed for the allotment of more broadcasting time to this chamber. Unfortunately, the com,mittee is so constituted as to have on it a  majority of members of the House of Representatives. Naturally, they view their own affairs with special favour and have allotted themselves a greater period for broadcasting than has been allotted to the Senate. I remind honorable senators that, on every day on which the broadcast is made from the House of Representatives while the Senate is sitting,  a  recording of questions in the Senate will be broadcast between 7.20 p.m. and 7.55 p.m. In answer to the third question, the committee would undoubtedly have power to discontinue broadcasts of parliamentary proceedings if the Senate continued to sit after the House of Representatives bad gone into recess. However, by no stretch of imagination can I agree with the conclusion implied in the honorable senator##'##s question. Most certainly, if the House of Representatives is not sitting while the Senate is sitting, the proceedings of the Senate will be broadcast. </para>

                        <para>- On the 19th July, the honorable senator asked, without notice, whether there was an embargo on the importation of steel sheets from the United Kingdom. I now inform him that there is no embargo on the importation of steel sheets from the United Kingdom. Licences are being issued freely for the full quantity made available by the United Kingdom authorities for shipment to Australia from production during the first half of 1946. There is a world-wide shortage of steel sheet, and the above-mentioned quantity - approximately 3,500 tons - was made available as a result of cabled representations through the Resident Minister##'##s office, London,- stressing the urgent need for steel sheet for motor vehicle and refrigerator production in this country. Advice is still awaited from the London office, of the quantity allocated to Australia from United Kingdom production during the second half of 1946. The importance of steel sheet in post-war rehabilitation plans is fully recognized, and licences have been issued covering all steel sheets of suitable types available for shipment from North America. </para>

                        <para>- I ask the Minister for Health whether, in view of the extreme shortage of hospital accommodation in South Australia, particularly maternity hospitals, he can advise me what action has been taken by the Commonwealth in co-operation with the States to overcome this vexatious problem? Can he say what is the cause of this appalling shortage of  accommodation?  Is it due to the miserable conditions and low rates of remuneration which fail to attract sufficient employees to staff the hospitals adequately?. Or is it due to a shortage of man-power and materials for the erection of new hospitals, or to the short-sighted policy and maladministration of previous governments? In view of the paramount importance of this question to the health of our people will the Minister endeavour to place the subject on the agenda for discussion at the forthcoming conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, to enable the Commonwealth, in  co-operation  with the States, to formulate a comprehensive policy for the complete rectification of the present appalling position within a stipulated period? </para>

In fairness to the honorable senator, I may say that his question is not a ##"##Dorothy Dix##"##, about which we have heard so much recently in the Senate. In my experience as a member of the Senate during the past two years, this chamber has been singularly free from that kind of question. I do not propose to lend myself to that practice. The honorable senator originated his question, as he has originated every question he has asked me in this chamber. </para>

                            <para>- That may be so; but my protest is called for in view of, what has been said in certain quarters on the matter. The honorable senator##'##s question opens up many matters. I shall deal briefly with them. As to how far the Commonwealth is prepared to cooperate with the States to provide increased hospital accommodation, the Commonwealth has not power under the Constitution to provide hospitals. That is peculiarly a matter for the States. The Commonwealth, certainly, has power to provide hospital accommodation in the territories under its control, namely, the Australian Capital Territory, the Northern Territory and the Mandated Territories, but those territories constitute a very small field for Commonwealth activity. The Commonwealth is, in fact, makins; a very substantial contribution to the solution of the problem of hospital accommodation in two ways. Insofar as the States use borrowed money to establish hospital accommodation, and the States very largely do that, the Commonwealth contributes one-third of the amount required to extinguish the debt over a period of years. Under the Financial Agreement the Commonwealth is contributing one-third of the total cost of hospitals built by the States from loan funds. Recently, this Parliament passed a measure providing hospital benefits for the people. Under that measure an amount of 6s. a day for each occupied bed is made available to the States. The whole of that amount is not required to compensate the hospitals in respect of the collections they were previously making. A substantial proportion, approximately one-quarter, of the 6s. is put aside by the States for capital purposes, that is, for the purpose of building hospitals and providing plant and equipment for those hospitals. The Commonwealth further intends, as the States can undertake hospital building and accommodation, to assist the States financially. It has already committed itself in that respect. </para>
                        </talk.start>
                    <para>With regard to the honorable senator##'##s second question as to how many factors contribute to the present shortage, those factors are legion. The honorable senator inquired as to the##'## position of nurses and staffs in hospitals. I admit frankly that room for improvement exists in that respect, and that poor conditions of employment in many instance##'##s discourage females who may be employed in professional and non-professional classes from seeking employment in hospitals. Recently, the Government, recognizing that difficulty, declared hospitals a vital industry and provided that 75 per cent, of the male rates shall be paid to domestic staffs in all hospitals. That has meant a substantial increase of the wages bill of all hospitals, and to a degree has been responsible for the increased charges recently authorized by the Prices Commissioner. </para>
                    <para>With regard to the shortage of manpower required for  the  construction of hospitals, such difficulties have been with us ever since the depression. In those years apprentices for the building trade  were not trained, and right up to the outbreak of the last war we felt the repercussion of that period in the building trades. There are not sufficient men in the building trade, and six years of war have accentuated the shortage; but even in war time the Government, through the Department of War Organization of Industry, relaxed its controls when it became a matter of providing maternity or hospital accommodation throughout Australia. That was done very generally even during the war. The necessary materials for hospital building are in short supply, but are coming through rapidly, and I believe that the shortage will be overcome before very long. With regard to the third portion of the second question, I point out that, had extensive plans of hospital building been undertaken during the depression years - arid that should have been done in the interests of both economy and public health - the shortage which we are suffering to-day would not be nearly so bad as it is. </para>

However, I repeat that the Commonwealth lacks power in this connexion and that a great deal will depend upon the outcome of the social services referendum to be held later this year. </para>

                        <para>- After the honorable senator asked her previous question, I took up the matter with the department and inquiries are now on foot to ascertain whether some of the administrative difficulties which I envisaged can be overcome. One of the difficulties that is readily apparent is that of fixing one of the most important elements, namely, the exact date of confinement of a prospective mother. The determination of the pre-natal period  of  four weeks is contingent upon that very interesting but variable event. I see little difficulty about making payment of the allowance in respect of  a  child and in respect of the four weeks ##'## antecedent to confinement at a fairly early date.  I  assure the honorable senator that the matter is receiving full consideration. </para>

The value of the clips marketed since then is ##£##391,000,000, and the increased return to the producers would therefore be 15 per cent, of that figure. It has been agreed under the new wool scheme that the reserve price at present will! be 18.15d. per lb., Australian currency, less a contributory charge of 91d. per lb. This will give growers an average return of 18.15d. per lb., or an increase of 1.79d. per lb. more than the price paid by the United Kingdom Government under the war-time agreement. </para>

A reply was given to the effect that no representations had been made. I regret that the information supplied to the honorable senator was incorrect. Representations were made by the organiized  poultry-farmers of Western Australia in connexion with assistance to the poultry industry. A number of applications which have been made to the Government by organizations representing the poultry industry in various States either for an increase of the price of eggs, or a subsidy to offset increased costs of poultry feed ##&amp;##c, are at present under consideration. </para>

                        <para>- I am confident that the Attorney-General##'##s Department has taken adequate steps to ensure that this country did not take any risks during the recent war. I am sure, too, that the administrative body charged with the maintenance of security is adequate for the purpose. However, I should like the honorable senator to have a complete and considered reply to his question, and in order to give the Acting Attorney-General an opportunity to supply it, I suggest that he should place the question on the notice-paper. </para>

                    <para>In recent months, American magazines have been concentrating upon the attitude of American youth to the problems of the future, and I cannot help feeling that it istime that some survey was made of the feelings and desires of young people in Australia.

                    <para>With that aim in view, I am trying to find out the attitude of mind, particularly with regard to the future, of the average Australian boy of high school age. It seems to me that a survey over a number of schools is the best way to do this, and I have evolved a set of questions whose answers will, I think, give me some idea of what I want to knowI wonder if you would be good enoughto put them to the leaving certificate boys of your school. </para>
                    <para>My only fear is that the answers given might be those that the boys feel would be expected, rather than those that they would give in discussion among themselves. I should be most grateful if you would do your best to circumvent this. </para>
                    <para>If it is possible, I would like you to send me the boys##'## actual answers to the questions, so that I can make an accurate analysis over the whole country. I am making this request to about thirty schools, and I feel that answers from twenty boys in eachcase will be sufficient. </para>
                    <para>I shall be most grateful if you will help me with this task, which I can only hope to carry out with your assistance and that of your colleagues in other schools. If you are interested in the results, I shall be only too glad to send them to you. </para>

                            <para>I am sorry that the honorable senator has asked this question. The officer concerned is a returned Australian Imperial Force man who fought in the Western Desert and spent several rigorous years as a prisoner of war in Italy and Germany. He is now attempting to re-establish himself and is doing excellent work and I will not allow his livelihood to be placed in jeopardy by one error of judgment. I am sure that the honorable senator, who is himself a returned soldier of the First World War, would wish me to deal with this matter with sympathy and understanding. I am, however, prepared to give these details to the honorable senator privately if he wishes to press for them. </para>

Passenger cars and vehicles of up to 1 ton loading capacity are distributed in accordance with the. system of priorities administered by the Directorate of Emergency Road Transport, under which preferential consideration is given to applications by ex-members of the services. In Queensland, where the largest number of releases has been made, a modified form of the permit system is in force, under which priority is given to users coming within the liquid fuel priority classes numbers 1 to 6. However, as ex-servicemen requiring vehicles for rehabilitation purposes are given high priorities in the use of liquid fuel, the system in operation in that State accords them in effect the same protection as they are given elsewhere. So far as heavier vehicles are concerned there has not been the same disparity between  supply and demand, and allocation is not now subject to governmental control. There is, however, a firm understanding with the primary distributors that the demands of ex-servicemen are to be given preference, and up to the present, demands in all States have been met practically in full. </para>

                            <para>Employers were circularized from time to time in an effort to obtain reliable estimates of the number of women covered by the Women##'##s Employment Board decisions, but the desired information was supplied in comparatively few instances. It was estimated during the war that a maximum of approximately 80,000 women were employed under wages and conditions determined by the board. This number has been very considerably reduced since the cessation of hostilities, but it is impossible at present to give a reliable estimate. </para>

                            <para>The rates of wage prescribed by the board varied from about 70 per cent, to 100 per cent, of the corresponding male rate, according to the efficiency and productivity of the women in the particular type of. work, and 90 per cent, of the male rate may be taken as a fair average. In those States where a female basic wage is declared it is approximately 54 per cent, of the male basic wage, and an amount approximating 54 per cent, of the basic wage is found as a minimum rate for females in many Commonwealth awards. Nevertheless, awards of the Commonwealth Arbitration Court prescribe minimum female rates varying from about 54 per cent, up to 75 per cent, of the basic wage. In many of the awards also margins above the minimum are prescribed for certain classifications. In isolated instances the court has prescribed female rates equal to male rates for particular types of jobs. </para>

                            <para>The jurisdiction of the board was specifically limited to women engaged on work usually performed by males, performed by males at any time since the outbreak of war in the establishment of a particular employer, or not performed by any person in Australia at the outbreak of war. The Government was anxious to do as much as possible forwomen not under the jurisdiction of the board, but was hampered by serious constitutional limitations. The position has been met to a certain extent by the National Security Female Minimum Rates Regulations, which provide that 75 per cent, of the minimum male rate shall be paid to females employed in a number of specified vital industries. If the referendum later this year is passed, it is obvious the Government will be able to do much more to improve the conditions under which many women work. The honorable senator will recall that interests which he represents challenged the validity of both the Women##'##s Employment Regulations and the Female Minimum Rates Regulations in the High Court and that the work of the board was at times seriously hampered when regulations were disallowed as a result of actions by honorable senators opposite. In view of the further fact that the honorable senator is now opposing the referendum which would enable the Government to take more effective action, it is difficult to understand his present interest in improving the wages and conditions of female employees. </para>

                    <para>The plan is designed to provide for stabilized returns over a period of years. Funds will be held on account of growers in years##'## of high prices, and paid out in years of low prices. But the Government underwrites the scheme to the extent of guaranteeing that, whatever be the rise or fall of the market over five years, the farmer will receive a return of not less than 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. bagged at ports each season. The plan provides security for the industry which, next to##&gt;## wool, is the most important in Australia##'##srural economy. It affects between 60,000##'## and 70,000 growers in all States, and deals with problems which are very important not only to the growers directly concerned hut also to all Australian governments. The details have been discussed with State governments and with growers. It is now presented as a plan which meets the needs* of the industry, and one in which State governments will co-operate so that the united powers of Commonwealth and States can be used to further a mea##'##sure##"## to which all Australian governments agree. </para>
                    <para>Stabilization of the wheat industry has been discussed for many years. The industry is subject to sharp changes because prices are so uncertain, and the rapidity with which prices fluctuate, added to the wide price variation, has  made the return to growers more than usually uncertain. For ten years before the war, prices were ruinous, and the wheat-growers needed constant assistance from governments. That condition may return within a few years unless action be taken now. The present plan is intended to give to growers a guarantee of a floor price for a reasonable time ahead, and so to remove the uncertainty about the future as much as we reasonably can. </para>
                    <para>At present, export prices are high, but wheat surpluses build up quickly, although they do not disappear quickly. When the countries overseas, are doing their best to provide all kinds of food, as they are now, their need for food, with the ##"##fact that prices are high, is likely to change the supply position from one of scarcity to one. of over-supply within a few seasons. It is unsafe to count on high prices continuing, and it is necessary to guard against any return to the depressed conditions in the wheat industry, which existed before the war. Australia sells most of its wheat overseas, and so depends on the overseas market to decide what the return to the grower will be. The market is keenly competitive, and although Australia is an important exporter our production is only a small part of the total world production. We sell a large part of our crop overseas, but our supplies exert little influence on prices overseas. This makes the wheat-grower##'##s income particularly uncertain, and affected by factors outside his control. </para>
                    <para>Another aspect is that a period of high prices .tends to make the industry over-capitalized and economically unstable. There is a regular change in the industry with old growers retiring and new ones coming in. High prices bring an additional influx of new growers and new land. T.hey come into the industry on inflated values,  and  are unable to stand up to .the impact of low prices when the inevitable price swing comes. All these factors .which have been -recognized for years are at the. back of the constant, request by wheat-growers##'## organizations##'## for a stabilized industry, and the Commonwealth and State Governments have: recognized the need. Now, it is :intended to. meet this need. </para>
                    <para>I have .summarized the various points of the . plan. The first is a fixed price of 5s.. ##'##2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports for bagged. :f.a.q.;. wheat used in Australia. This extends the home consumption price  princible  adopted in 1938. At present it applies to wheat used for local flour, but in future.. it will apply to all wheat used in Australia. We can control local prices, and this alone provides stability for about one-third of our normal crop. That portion of the crop will not be subject to fluctuations which follow the uncertain movements of the overseas market. Growers will receive the price irrespective of overseas movements, and consumers in Australia will pay the fixed price regardless of . the movement of export prices. Both will forgo the alternation of benefit1 and disadvantage which price variation brings, and in the long run both growers and consumers will be better off through having a constant price which is fair to all. </para>
                    <para>The Government guarantees a minimum price for export wheat of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. bagged. Growers know for five seasons that they will not get less than this price although they may get more. If prices fall growers are protected against the effect of low returns, and they can arrange their farm programme with an assurance of a fixed price i which they have never had before. Growers are to contribute 50 per cent, of the excess export return to a stabilization fund. It is generally agreed that when prices are high growers should contribute, and a basis of fifty-fifty is accepted a.s fair. It has been accepted by growers##'## organizations and Governments as a reasonable contribution by growers for their own benefit later. It should be noted that this contribution applies to export wheat. The contribution begins with the 1945-46 season, from which the return will be high. Growers have accepted the principle of contribution in high-price years, and it is impossible to give a guarantee on the present basis unless they make a reasonable contribution for their own benefit. The 1945- 46 crop must therefore be included, and growers##'## representatives agreed to the inclusion when the plan was discussed with them. </para>
                    <para>When export prices fall, the fund will be used to meet the guarantee by making up the difference between the actual export return and . the guarantee. It will be - a trust fund. As this is a season of high export prices there will be a credit in the fund from the outset. It is intended that the growers##'## contribution will not be more than a reasonable sum, and that the amount in the fund will not become excessive. The Commonwealth will provide the money to meet the guaranteed price if the fund becomes exhausted. Having asked the growers for a reasonable contribution the Commonwealth accepts the additional liability if prices abroad are so low that the fund cannot meet the guarantee. In conformity with the decision that the  growers##'## contribution should be reasonable, it is intended this year not to apply the contribution beyond 9s.6d. a bushel for bagged wheat. Export prices are now above that price, but the fifty-fifty basis will apply between 5s. 2d. and 9s. 6d., so the maximum contribution will be 2s. 2d. a bushel. Everything received for export above that price will go into the pool for distribution to growers. </para>
                    <para>The plan has an original term of five year##'##s. This has been taken as a reasonable guarantee period. It is intended that the scheme will be. permanent and subject to constant review. Any review will not affect guarantees already given, but before the expiration of three years the next period will be considered. It is intended then to give a guarantee for another period, which will not necessarily be five years; and then by constant reviews to provide a guarantee to wheat-growers so that they can plan their farming with a definite minimum price for a period ahead. The world wheat market is uncertain, and subject to violent fluctuations. We have to sell our wheat on a competitive market to which we must adapt our methods, but we will prevent injury to the industry caused by rapid falls in price. The guarantee will give the wheatgrowers , time to conform to overseas market trends without suffering the disruption they have caused in the past. </para>
                    <para>The plan can work only if the Commonwealth and States use their respective powers in co-operation, and the scheme provides an outstanding example of agreement between Commonwealth and State governments in solving Australia##'##s greatest agricultural problem. I have given an outline of the plan; but reference must also be made to the machinery for operating it. This covers two important features, first, the marketing of wheat; and, secondly, the regulation of production. . The Commonwealth will use its export powers, and the States their powers in marketing of production. The war-time marketing operations in wheat have been very successful. The system is established and is working smoothly, and its operations are familiar. Growers wish to continue the present form of marketing and after meeting all the difficulties during the war period it can now be adapted to those of peace. </para>
                    <para>The plan provides for acontinuanceof the marketing of wheat on an Australian pool system, with an AustralianWheat Board constituted on the samelinesas the present one. Complementary legisla - tion by the States is intended to provide for marketing through the board.The board will be a federal body, acting on behalf of the Commonwealth and the States to carry out a joint policy. The marketing organization needs extensive powers to enable it to deal with the received, handling, and sale of our crops.During the war the Australian Wheat Boardhas had those powers, and for the futureit seems that they do not need to be altered. The present act confers the necessary powers, so far as the Commonwealth can give them, and the complementary State legislation is intendedto provide those powers which come within the ambit of the States. The boardwill therefore be able to deal withwheatin the manner well known to growers,and approved by them. </para>
                    <para>The other aspect is control of production. The Commonwealth has thispower within its territories, andtheStates exercise it within their borders.Asthe States produce practically thewholeof Australia##'##s wheat this is one partofthe plan which could not possibly operate without the fullest State co-operation. The State legislation is intendedtogive that co-operation. The Stateswillcontrol production within theirownareas, and, in fact, the State organizationshave been doing so during the war  years. </para>
                    <para>To ensure that the regulations shall be uniform throughout Australia, State representatives will be membersofthe CommonwealthStabilization-Board which will  be  concerned largelywith uniformity of administration.The general principle of regulationof production is recognized  by  governments and growers. Wheat-growers, like other farmers, are essentially individualists, and  as  a general rule do not like regulations;but they know that regulation is essential in anystabilization plan. Having had the experience of the system during the war they consider it the fairest and most effective method of providing for sound  development of the industry in the future. The policy of an ##"##open go##"## has had disastrous results in the past, and the industry is determined to avoid those results in the future. To avoid disaster, wheat-growers are ready to co-operate with the Government in the regulation of production, because they recognize it as desirable. The necessity for regulation arises from the uncertainty df conditions in the industry. The swing from a shortage to a glut is a regular occurrence which keeps the industry unstable both in Australia and overseas. At present there is a shortage of wheat, but no one expects that to last, and the next swing may come within a short period. It is too late to take action when it does come, so wo must prepare for it now; and the best way to do so is by making our plans so that we will not over-produce for a glutted market. </para>
                    <para>Adequate production, with a price ##"##which is fair to both growers and consumers is the aim. There is no reason to assume that Australia will need to reduce its production below the normal  pre-war  figure. It is, however, essential that , any expansion should be supervised carefully. Wheat-growers cannot enter the industry and leave it at short notice. Once. committed to the initial expense they are expected to engage in the industry for a term of years, and the entry of new growers must be directed according to the prospects for several years ahead. Unwarranted expansion affects not only the newcomers, but also the whole industry. Regulation of production is necessary to safeguard##'## growers, and to adjust our supplies to the markets. Having made provision in that direction the framework of a plan which will confer great benefits ##»##n Australia##'##s wheat farmers should be complete. </para>

                    <para class="block">This bill is complementary to the Wheat Industry Stabilization Bill. It imposes a charge on wheat of the 1945-46 and later seasons exported from the Commonwealth, and provides for imposing and collecting the charge. It provides for the growers##'## contribution to- the Wheat Stabilization Fund in years of high prices. The charge will be 50 per cent, or less of the surplus of export prices above the guaranteed price of 5s. 2d. a bushel f.o.r. ports for bagged wheat. It is intended that the growers##'## contribution shall not exceed 50 per  cent.  of the surplus export price, and it is intended also that the stabilization fund will not be built up to an excessive amount. Growers are asked to make a fair contribution only; the variations of future export prices cannot be foreseen accurately. For this reason, there is a provision that the contribution may be prescribed by regulation at a rate lower than##'## 50 per cent. This course will be adopted when justified. It will, in fact, apply to the present pool, because the Government has decided that the contribution will not apply this season to export prices above 9s. 6d. a bushel in bags, so that for the present pool the contribution will be 2s. ##'##2d. a bushel on export wheat, and the whole of the return above that will be paid into the Australian Wheat Board##'##s funds for payment to growers. The reason for the decision to apply a smaller charge than 50 per cent, this season is that export prices have risen since the calculations of financial returns were made. If 50 per cent, were collected the growers##'## contribution would be higher than the first estimates, and it has been decided to give the full##'## benefit of the increase to the growers. This will give them this season an additional amount, estimated at 6d. a bushel, on all wheat exported from the current wheat pool. Other provisions of the bill include convenient methods of payment so that the disbursements to be made by the Australian Wheat Board will be based on the total transactions of the pool. This is more convenient than making a large number of payments to cover each, seperate shipment overseas. </para>

                    <para>This bill needs little explanation, its purpose being to provide for a change in name of war savings certificates and war savings stamps. Owing to the termination of the war, those designations are inappropriate and it has been decided that future issues will be known as savings certificates and savings certificate stamps. This requires legislative authority, and this bill is designed to provide the necessary amendment to the Commonwealth Inscribed Stock Act. The terms of sale and redemption of the savings certificates and savings certificate stamps will be exactly the same as those of the war savings certificates and war savings stamps which they replace. </para>

                <para class="block">The adoption of the amendment would make clear that, in the event of two men with equal qualifications applying for promotion, an applicant who has war service to his credit must be selected. Another clause provides for consideration to be given to war service in deciding what position an ex-serviceman should occupy in the employment of the commission. The object of my amendment is to give credit to an ex-serviceman for his war service, so that he may be assured of promotion in preference to a man with equal qualifications who has not rendered war service. I realize that the Postmaster-General is as anxious as is the Opposition to protect the interests of ex-servicemen, and therefore I ask him to accept my amendment so that whoever may be charged with the administration of this legislation will be obliged to give preference to ex-servicemen. </para>

The Minister should state that war service will be taken into consideration in assessing the seniority rights of an employee of the commission. I can imagine the case of two young men at the age of eighteen years, one entering the armed forces and the other securing employment with Cable and Wireless Limited or Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. What would happen if the former, on discharge from the  armed forces, secured employment with the </para>

We should make clear beyond any possibility of doubt that, under such conditions, war, service must be taken into consideration in making promotions if the applicants are equally qualified. It is not much to ask that the principle be clearly stated in the bill. By this means the Government##'##s intention would be placed beyond doubt for all time. I ask the Minister  to  reconsider the matter and accept the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The weakness of the Minister##'##s statement is obvious. He said that the Government##'##s policy is to give preference to ex-servicemen. If that be so, what is the objection to expressing that policy in the bill ? He has stated no objection to doing so. If the principle were laid down in the bill, there could be no doubt about the policy being observed in future because it would be stated in the legislation. The proposed commission will not be a department of the Commonwealth Public Service. The telecommunication services will be handed over to a commission, and although the Government may be firm in its desire to exercise preference to ex-servicemen within the Commonwealth Public Service, its intentions may not bc carried  out by the commission. I want the Minister to realize that the Opposition is in favour of this bill, except in a few details, and that our only desire is to improve the measure, if possible. In those- circumstances I ask the Minister to take cognizance of some of the arguments used by him when a member of the Opposition. It should be made clear that the commission is being instructed by the Parliament to carry out the wishes of the Government in this matter. These will not be ordinary appointments, to which the customs and traditions of the Commonwealth . Public Service will apply. I urge the Minister to make certain that the ex-serviceman shall receive full consideration for the years spent by him in fighting for his country. </para>

                    <para>, -  The suggestion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has more than ordinary merit and importance. Replying to a similar point earlier, the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> pointed out that certain provisions in the Commonwealth Public Service Act did not apply in cases such as that now under consideration. It will be remembered that employees of the commission, upon provisional pro motions, will not receive increases of salary during provisional terms of office. Therefore, it is most important that some period should be stated, during which provisional appointments should be confirmed or appeals upheld. No objection would be taken to a provisional appointment remaining unconfirmed for twelve months, if the officer concerned received the rate of pay appropriate to that position. The interests of an officer called upon to discharge higher duties than those previously carried out by him should be safeguarded by fixing a definite period before the expiration of which the board should hear the appeal. The board should be expected to deal with an appeal within two months. </para>

If lie will give an assurance that regulations will be promulgated to provide that the things which we have asked for shall be done within a reasonable time, we on this side shall be satisfied, but in the absence of any such assurance we do not know whether the board will, in fact, issue such regulations. The Minister must see that, in the absence of any such undertaking, the whole matter is indefinite, and officers may be done it grave injustice. </para>

                    <para>. -  Sub-clause 7 of proposed new clause ISd shows the importance of the suggestions that have already been made. Under it, the commission may appoint an officer provisionally to a position and keep him in it for an unspecified period. He may occupy the position provisionally for one year, two years, or even ten years, without receiving any .increase of sala##'##ry, and at the end of that period he may be forced to revert to his original position because the Promotions Appeal Board decides not to confirm the appointment. That is not fair to any officer or employee. The Minister should give a definite assurance that regulations to safeguard employees in the manner suggested by honorable senators on this side will be promulgated. The unwillingness of the. Minister to give such an assurance is somewhat disturbing. I again remind him that these officers will not have the protection of Commonwealth Public Service Regulations. The difficulty can be overcome by the Minister giving an assurance along the lines indicated. </para>

                        <para>-I direct the attention of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> to proposed new clause 18d (1), which provides that a provisional promotion shall .be ##"##without increased salary##"##. This should make clear the purpose of the amendment that I have moved. In the absence of a specific time limit, it would be competent for the commission to promote an officer to a senior position provisionally, and . without increased salary, and then under the terms of subclause 7 . cancel the provisional promotion. My amendment becomes most important1 in view of the refusal of the Postmaster-General to insert a time limit during which appeals against promotions shall be heard. It becomes even more important having regard - to the Commonwealth Public Service Regulations, which provide that appeals against a promotion shall be, lodged within 21 days, and I understand that, within fourteen days after the closing date for appeals, certain action must be taken. If the Postmaster-General is unable to accept my amendment, my wishes would be met if he would indicate that steps would be taken to ensure that regulations framed under sub-clause 3 would conform to the provisions of the Commonwealth Public Service Regulations. However, in the absence of such an assurance, it would be a reflection upon this chamber to allow this proposed new clause to be passed in##"## its present unsatisfactory form. </para>

Certain discretionary powers must be allowed to all administrative authorities. If the commission does not carry on its administration according to the spirit of the act, the Postmaster-General may intervene. </para>

I am not convinced that the commission will be free to exercise its discretion in regard to this matter. For the Postmaster-General to say that any defect in this legislation will be rectified by some f future holder of his office is not sufficient. The place to rectify obvious anomalies is in the Parliament. Only to-day we had .an example of the difficulties that may arise through the passage of inadequate legislation. When##'## the Australian Broadcasting Commission Act was before this chamber, the Opposition drew attention to certain things that might occur; but the Postmaster-General would not accept our suggestions, and earlier to-day we found that the very things that we said would happen had happened. A repetition of such a state of affairs in connexion with this legislation should be avoided. Is <inline font-style="italic">it</inline> not better that this legislature should insert safeguards whilst the bill is before it, rather than rely upon action being taken by the Postmaster-General at a later date? The Minister has not said how he proposes to rectify this anomaly. He simply said that he would rectify it. What power has he under this bill to interfere with the administration of an outside body? The commission will carry on its administration in accordance with the provisions of the bill, and for the most part, the Postmaster-General will not have any say in the matter. Surely the Postmaster-General is not content simply to say, ##"##I shall not accept the amendment ##"##. Would he have us believe that everything the Government does is perfect and cannot be improved? His attitude is mere obstinacy and reveals a dislike of accepting advice. </para>

I know that the act covering a certain industry in Western Australia, with which I was closely associated, does not specify the method by which appeals shall be made. The method is prescribed by regulations. Under this measure, employment will be given not only in Australia but in ad j accent territories, and it is obvious that to impose a mandatory time limit would be detrimental  to  the interests of e##'##-me employees. In these circumstances, the commission should have discretionary powers. Therefore, I can see no necessity to alter the clause as drafted. </para>

                        seems to be under a misapprehension when he says that sub-clause 7 deals with appeals. That is not so. That sub-clause will enable the commission to make a provisional appointment, say, of a junior officer to a senior or higher paid position without increasing the officer##'##s salary; and the commission will have power to retain that man in the higher position on the lower salary applicable to his former position. We object to the commission being given that power.

After the lapse of 60 days the commission should be able to make up its mind whether to confirm the appointment or return the officer to his former position. We do not mind if the period in respect of provisional appointments be 90 days. I repeat that the sub-clause does not deal with appeals, but with the right of the commission to make provisional appointments to important jobs at low salaries, and at the end of one year, or two years##'##, have the power to declare the higher position vacant, returning the officer to his former position. That is exactly the power which will be given to the commission. The committee should not agree to such an utterly unfair provision. If an officer is employed in a higher position, he should be paid the salary in respect of that position after the lapse of 60 days or 90 days. We have already dealt with appeals in earlier sub-clauses. </para>

Despite  what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> has mid with regard to provisional appointments the sub-clause is designed to allow the usual time of 21 days to permit of appeals being lodged. Members of the Commonwealth Public Service who were on active service, or who may have been absent at the time, automatically have the right of appeal, and in some cases might require a period exceeding 21 days to lodge their appeal. Indeed, in some circumstances a period of even 60 days mighty not be sufficient to meet the convenience of all persons eligible to lodge appeals. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> has said the terms of sub-clause 8 clearly show that these provisions deal with appeals. </para>

                <para class="block">I am compelled to place on record as strongly as I can the objection which I and my colleagues take to. the sub-clause 7 of the proposed new clause. Had the views expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> been put before us by the Minister we would have been assisted very greatly. Much difficulty will disappear if the Minister can assure us that the position as explained by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Nash</inline> can be assured under the regulations. However, I point out that a provision similar to that contained in the sub-clause is not  contained in the Commonwealth Public Service Act; and I should be surprised if it is contained in the Commonwealth Bank Act. This provision. is something new and unique. It simply allows the commission to appoint, provisionally, a junior officer to a senior position with no increase of salary, and in the absence of any limitation to such provisional appointment the officer can be retained in the senior position at a low salary indefinitely. Perhaps, after a period of several years the commission may decide to cancel the appointment altogether, and dispense with the higher job. The object of my amendment is to ensure that justice is done to officers appointed provisionally in the circumstances I have mentioned. In the period I suggest, the commission should be able to make up its mind whether the person so appointed is competent to fill the higher position permanently, or whether the position should be abolished. No officer should be asked to fill a higher position at a salary appertaining to a lower position for a period of more than two months. The Commonwealth . Public Service Regulations provide a period of 21 days in respect of appeals, and after the lapse of that period the provisional appointment must be confirmed or the officer must be returned to his former position. That seems to be the proper procedure; and we should follow it in .this case. If the Minister can assure us that regulations will be made to protect officers in such circumstances, much of the difficulty will disappear. </para>

                <para class="block">I can understand the amusement shown by honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber. Apparently not many of them have given attention to these proposals or considered their  intention. This new clause will establish a Promotions Appeal Board, which will have authority to take evidence when considering appeals. I suggest, in all seriousness, that all parties to appeals dealt with by the board should have the right to be present when evidence is being taken. That is practised in law, and is merely common justice. I consider that the absence of such a provision is due only to an oversight, which should be rectified in fairness to the officers who may be affected. </para>

It is usual, in such cases, for a person accused of a misdemeanour or making an appeal to have the right of representation and for the employing authority, in this case the commission, to have the same right. That has been customary in my long experience of such affairs. I am sure that the Minister will be able to inform us that the practice adopted in the Commonwealth Public Service will be adhered to by the commission. </para>

                    <para>,- This clause raises again the objection that I had to another clause giving the power to the commission to reclassify positions. When I voiced that objection,- I was told that this new clause would give to the officers concerned the right to appeal. I point out that the. commission will have power to reclassify a position and then to appoint an officer to a position so reclassified, which may involve promotion, without any extra pay. The bill does not provide any right of appeal against such a procedure. That right can be provided by regulation, and I hope that that will be done, so that every employee will be fully protected. </para>

                    <para>. -Proposed new sub-clause 18m is very important, and the phraseology may seem strange to honorable senators not familiarwith the Commonwealth Public Service procedure. If I were the secretary of an organization whose members were employed by the commission, I should be anxious regarding their rights. The practice seems to have developed in the Commonwealth PublicService and other governmental instru-mentalities to accept control by commissions. I take it that the Commonwealth Public Service organizations are efficient, and that their members are . alive to their own interests. They have made no protest against theacts and regulations under which they are employed. I certainly do not like thephraseology of sub-clause 1 of the proposed new clause, which states that; where an officer is dismissed, retired, transferred1 or reduced in status or rate of pay, he ##"## may ##"## appeal to the Disciplinary Appeal </para>
                </talk.start>
                <para>Board. I shouldnot favour the commission having power to dismiss an employee without the case first being heard by an independent tribunal. If it were suggested that the commission should not have power to dismiss, that would be pre- . ferable; but I understand that those are . the conditions under which the employees in such instrumentalities have worked, and they have expressed no desire toclip the power of the bureaucrats under which they are employed. The custom has always been to provide that an employee ##"## may ##"## appeal, and I oppose the insertion of the word ##"## shall ##"##. An employee who is dismissed##'## knows the reason why  his  services have been dispensed with, and  he  may consider that the least said about  the  matter the better. No attempt should  be  made to force an employee to appeal. </para>

                    <para>. -  The discussion on the proposed  new  clauses has served to emphasize the soundness of advice given in this chamber last Thursday evening. If we had an assurance that regulations similar to  the  Commonwealth Public Service Regulations will apply to the employees of  the  commission, this discussion would be unnecessary. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> has pointed out that employees in the Commonwealth Public Service are well organized, and are satisfied with the regulations under which they work ; but the employees under the commission will operate under different conditions. Having had experience of Commonwealth Public Service Regulations, I foresee dangers. Perhaps the proposed regulations will be similar to the Commonwealth Public Service Regulations. Under sub-clause 5 of the proposed new clause, the Disciplinary Appeal Board may take evidence on oath, and I suggest that provision might be made for that evidence to be taken in the presence of all parties to the appeal. </para>

                    <para>. -  This is the most important clause in the bill. I take it that the sum of ##£##3,000,000 mentioned in the measure represents the limit beyond which negotiators on behalf of the Government, for thepurchase of- certain- assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, shall not go. Although the Government cannot be expected to say in advance the exact amount necessary to purchase the assets of the company the committee and the public are entitled to some indication as to the basis on which the assets which the Government proposes to acquire were valued. Without going into details, the Minister in charge of the bill should tell the committee what procedure is to be followed in the negotiations with the companies whose assets it proposes to purchase. Let us consider for a moment the position of the shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. During the course of the debate it ##"##has been said that the amount proposed to be paid to them is exorbitant, and that the value of their shares has risen as the result of the introduction  of this legislation. Whatever may be said on that point, we must admit that those who invested their money in the enterprise did so in good faith. Therefore, it would be most unfair to say that, because the value of each share was originally ##£##1, the shareholders should not be paid any amount in excess of ##£##1. Not all of those who invested their money in the. enterprise bought shares at ##£##1 each.; many of them paid ##£##2,- or even ##£##3, .a share. If the Minister would give some indication of the procedure to- be followed, and will say who is to determine the value of the shares, and whether the amount will be decided by arbitration or otherwise, we would know better bow to deal with* this proposal. The committee is entitled to know the amount to be paid for the assets to be taken over, and bow that amount was arrived at. I am sure that the committee is prepared to act generously towards the Government in this matter; but the Government should take the committee more into its confidence, and say how the negotiations will be carried on and by whom, and whether the amount to be paid will be fixed by arbitration, or whether the commission, when appointed; will carry on the negotiations until a settlement is arrived at. In the event of an agreement not being##'## reached as to the price to be paid, the Minister should tell us. what form of appeal tribunal will be set up - whether a judge of a Supreme Court will be appointed, or in what other way the matter will be decided. I appeal to the Minister to s let the committee know what is in his mind. </para>

                    <para>. - I am in a position to say that negotiations have been in progress between the Government and representatives of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for some time, and so far have proceeded satisfactorily. In my opinion, it is highly probable that as the result of those negotiations an agreement will be arrived at. The bill provides that, in the##"## event of an agreement not being arrived at, an arbitrator may be appointed, such arbitrator to be approved by both parties to the negotiations. Failing satisfaction in that way, an appeal may be made to the High Court. I believe that neither of those two alternatives will have to be adopted. The Government will stand or fall by what is set out in the bill. I remind the committee that the sum of  ##£##3,000,000  is the maximum amount which may be paid. It is possible that the sum eventually agreed to will be considerably less than  ##£##3,000,000.  The bill provides only that the amount to be paid shall not exceed that sum. Some limitation is necessary. The Government accepts the responsibility for what it proposes to do, and I am confident that the result will be most satisfactory. The Government is acquiring a well-established anil profitable undertaking, and it is essential for the proper functioning of the business that sufficient funds should be made available to the commission. The amount which will be advanced to the commission will be determined by the Treasurer, and I do -not think that honorable senators have any cause for alarm. </para>

                        <para>- I do not know, but I do know that half of the amount to be paid should belong to the Government. Does the Government propose to leave that amount in the company to enable it to carry on its manufacturing activities? In my opinion, that would provide the company with more money than it needs for the purpose, seeing that it now carries on a bigger business with  a capital of ##£##1,000,000. In my second-reading speech I said that it was a clumsy way to conduct negotiations to proclaim beforehand that the Government is willing to pay up to ##£##3,000,000 to the shareholders of the company. Even if the Government does not intend to pay ##£##3,000,000 for certain assets of the company, it must expect to pay nearly that amount. Whatever amount is to be paid, the committee is entitled to know whether or not the money will be wasted. I do not like to see the Minister sitting dumb when he is asked to supply information to the committee. These are matters which concern the taxpayers of Australia. Any unwise business venture on the part of the Government might jeopardize the taxpayers##'## money, and therefore the protest by the Opposition is justified. If only, say, ##£##1,500,000 is to be paid, the Minister should say so; or if the shares are to be bought on a basis of ##£##1 each, we should know what is intended. It is most unwise for any negotiator to announce in advance the limit that he is prepared to pay for certain assets. Naturally, any business man would think that he was being invited to claim the full amount. Had the Government proclaimed that it intended to pay only a maximum of ##£##1,500,000, the shares in this company would not have risen to ##£##3 l1s. or ##£##3 12s. as they have done, and it would have been the responsibility of the company then to argue, if it could, that ##£##1,500,000 was not sufficient. The Government has unwisely thrown all its cards on the table. In effect, it has said : ##"## There is our limit. You can bargain with us up to that amount ##"##. The Postmaster-General is not being fair to himself or to this committee when he refuses to give any information as to how the ##£##3,000,000 is to be expended. </para>

                    <para>. - This is the most important clause of the bill. The Government should have first brought down a measure providing for a basis of settlement with the companies concerned, and then introduced a further measure appropriating the amount of money agreed upon. If the Government were negotiating for a city property for use, say, as a post office or for some other public purpose, surely it would not say to the owner : ##"## We do not believe that your property is worth ##£##10,000. We think it is worth ##£##5,000, but we have fixed ##£##10,000 as our maximum ##"##. By providing for an expenditure of ##£##3,000,000 in this measure, the Government is indicating that it may pay up to that amount for the assets that are to be acquired. Obviously, those who hold stock in the company will retain it, and others will seek it, because they know that they will secure a handsome dividend. The Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> should give further consideration to this matter, and indicate the Government##'##s intentions. Although the honorable gentleman has mentioned a sum of ##£##1,500,000, he has not said that the Government will not pay up to ##£##3,000,000. We have a right to know how the negotiations will be carried on, and whether the matter will be referred back to the Parliament for reconsideration. </para>

Assessors may be appointed by the Minister to assist the board, and at least one of these assessors must be a person not in the employment of the Commonwealth. By agreement of the parties concerned, the  chairman  of the board may adjudicate alone. Provision is also made for the exercise of the functions of the Compensation Board in the event of absence of certain of its members through death, illness or other cause. The wording of this clause is in agreement with the corresponding provisions in the Australian National Airlines Act, except that it is stipulated that the  chairman  of the board is to be of judicial status instead of being a police, stipendiary or special magistrate, as provided in that act. This variation was made to meet representations by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited that the status of the  chairman  should be higher than that of a magistrate, particularly in view of the complicated issues that may require to be determined failing Agreement between the Commonwealth ,and the company as to the purchase price to be paid for the transfer of the company##'##s overseas teleCommunication assets to the Government. </para>

Reading the proof of my remarks on the motion for the second-reading of the bill, I noticed that L said that the bill was crude. I appear to have given the impression that the machinery and drafting of the bill was crude. I am afraid that I did an injustice to the officers who drafted the measure and those eminent men who ##'##advised them. What I wanted to convey was that the idea of the bill was crude, I had no intention of suggesting that the work of the officers responsible for drafting it was crude. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the measure, the object of which is to establish and incorporate an Australian-National University in the Australian Capital Territory. Unlike <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> I fail to see anything crude in the conception of a national university. This proposal is a step forward in our intellectual advancement and development as a nation. I happen to be a graduate##"## of the Western Australian University, the only free university in Australia. I represent in the Senate a State which, although it has only a small population, places education very high in its list of priorities, and which, since a Labour government in Western Australia introduced the University Act in that State in 1911, has ensured that the University of Western Australia shall be free and open to all qualified to attend it. I am pleased that that principle has to a large degree been followed by . this Government in its university education legislation during recent years. A few years ago I was a member of a committee set up by the universities of Australia to determine the income groups of university students throughout the Commonwealth. That committee found, as the result of its investigations, that the average income of parents of students at the University of Western Australia was  considerably lower than that in any other State. I attribute that to the fact that the University of Western Australia is free. So, when the Commonwealth Government instituted its aid to universities during the war, it made it possible for the sons and daughters of working-class parents to attend universities by means of financial grants. That is a step in the right direction. To-day, the Commonwealth Government has very little control so far as education is concerned. It is about time that we recognized that education is a national problem. I have travelled throughout all of the States, both before I was elected to the Senate, and since; and One thing which surprises me in my work as a member of a parliamentary committee is the total lack of any Australian spirit, or Australian system, so far as professional standards are concerned. It is necessary in a young country like Australia to foster an Australian spirit in literature, education and science. Thus, I was amazed when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> attacked this proposal to establish a research university in Canberra. He said that research would concern only a few persons. All of us know that research benefits far more than those persons who engage upon it. One can recognize the immense impact upon##'## the world of the research work of a few scientists who have been working in oblivion and have produced some of the wonder drugs, which, in these days, have lessened the fear of death from disease and accident. I cite, . for example, Madame Curie and <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Howard</inline> Florey. In . the Commonwealth Serum - Laboratories in Melbourne a group of scientists are working quietly and unobtrusively in this great war against disease. If there is one achievement of which this Parliament can be proud it is the work which is being carried on at those laboratories. I am afraid that very few of us realize the full importance of that work. During the war most of the serums and plasma supplied to the South-East Asia Command, as far afield as India and Southern Asia, was produced in those laboratories, where young and old men and women are devoting their lives to scientific research, not for any prospective material gain, because, unfortunately, scientists are proverbially poorly paid, but because they realize the value of their research to the community. One of ##'##the memorial windows in my old university at Perth is dedicated to a man who gave his life to the study of radium in the treatment of cancer. So far as the people of Australia are concerned he was as much a hero as any man who fell on the battlefields, .because  in his research he gradually became a victim to a very slow and deadly disease which, however, did not kill him until his research was completed. Therefore, the University of Western Australia owes a great debt to <inline font-weight="bold">Dr. Hancock</inline> and his colleagues for their fight to conquer cancer. I mention that because I believe that what is being done in a few centres throughout Australia, could be done much more effectively in n national capital if we were to have here a national university with all the means at the disposal of scientists which only a national university can give. In every capital city our universities at present are overcrowded, teaching staffs are overworked, and students find it very difficult to obtain accommodation in the cities. We find, also, that the resources of most of the universities are taxed almost beyond capacity, and this has been rendered all the more serious because of the. Commonwealth Government##'##s policy of assisting ex-servicemen in their rehabilitation training. Large sums of money are being expended by the Government in extending university training in all States of the Commonwealth. I believe that by creating in the National Capital a university which will engage in research particularly, but which,##'## at the same time, will offer undergraduate facilities to those who require them, we ##'## shall assist not only to relieve overcrowding at the universities in the capital cities, but also go a long way towards solving many of the problems, both scientific and economic, which at present confront the nation. Hearing honorable senators opposite speak on this measure, one would be led to believe that all that science did was to obstruct mankind. Perhaps, they do not realize the benefits which science has conferred on man throughout the centuries. Only by harnessing atomic energy and all the other scientific discoveries for the benefit and improvement of mankind will the world make any progress at all. ##"##When we weigh the good and evil which science has done for humanity, we shall find that the balance is heavily in favour of progress. </para>
                    </talk.start>
                    <para>The primary aim of this bill is to establish research schools in medical science. This is the crux of the whole function of the universities because upon medical research depends so much the maintenance of the health of the people. The decision of the Government to call the school the ##"## John Curtin School of Medical Research##"## is highly commendable. It will be a great monument to a great man. No monument that could be raised by the people of Australia to his memory could be dearer to his heart than a school of medical research in the national capital. We saw rapid advances made by medical research during the war years. Much more was achieved in a relatively brief space of time than could be achieved in many years of peace. Unfortunately, in time of .peace, facilities for research are not readily available as they are on##'## the battle-fields and behind the lines during war. A national school of medicine in Canberra could combat cancer, tuberculosis and many other scourges of humanity. Surely there is much more in this conception than the mere crudity of which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> spoke.  His  speech suggested that the time is not opportune to proceed with this scheme. But we cannot afford to wait another five or six years before commencing this project. Now is the time for action. </para>
                    <para>The bill proposes the establishment of a school of research in physical science. Surely everybody realizes the enormous importance to the world of physical science. Within the last few weeks, experiments have been conducted with atomic bombs. The newspapers and the radio told us to-day that twenty atomic bombs dropped on Great Britain could destroy the civilization of centuries. These facts must be faced by Australians. We must realize that our isolation from other countries can no longer justify us keeping our eyes closed to the developments of modern science.Distance has been virtually annihilated by modern means of transport, and the terrific power of atomic bombs has demonstrated the importance of keeping up to date with research in physical science. The bill also provides for the establishment of a school of research in social science. Never before has the necessity for such a school been so obvious as it is to-day. We are forced to appreciate the interdependence of social and physical sciences and medical research. Just as no nation can remain self-sufficient today, so no single branch of learning can remain sufficient unto itself. Every branch of scientific research depends upon others, and in order to make a complete whole we must round off our research universities with a school for the study of those geographic regions which intimately concern us, namely a research school of Pacific Affairs. By beginning with the establishment of these four research schools, we shall lay the foundation of a truly national university. </para>
                    <para>I am very pleased that the Minister, in his second-reading, speech, stressed the importance of the university staff. We must be on our guard to ensure that  appropriate inducements are offered in order to secure the services of the best men available. The time has gone when the traditional university lecturer or professor looks like a down-at-heel tramp. Such men must be properly rewarded in accordance with their qualifications and the status which they hold in the community. Therefore, I hope that we shall endeavour to attract men from all parts of the world by offering adequate remuneration for their services. During the last few years we have seen the spectacle of brilliant men and women graduates of Australian universities going abroad to further their studies only to learn that the opportunities available to them in Australia are not sufficiently attractive to induce them to return. Very many intelligent young people who received their initial training in Australia have been lost to the nation because##'## of the lack of incentive for them to pursue their life work here. Therefore, I hope that we shall not repeat the mistakes that have been made in connexion with our State universities and that we shall see that young scientists, are encouraged to return to Australia to take positions in the national university. I am glad that the Minister realizes the importance of the university staff. The Vice-chancellor of the University of </para>
                    <para class="block">Western Australia came, originally from Canberra. His influence on students has been even greater than that of the lectures delivered to them in the university halls. The principle value of a##'## university lies not so much in the academic knowledge acquired there, as in the knowledge of community life and the tradition of service to the community acquired by living with, talking with and following the example of those in charge of the institution. I pay tribute to the vice-chancellors of our Australian universities. I have met all of them at various times when I have been engaged on university work, and I do not believe that a finer group of men of high intellectual standing could be found in . any country. They carried the burdens thrust upon them during the war with remarkable distinction and discharged their tasks with a high degree pf efficiency. I hope that the Australian National University in Canberra will be fortunate enough to acquire an administrative head of the calibre of the vice-chancellors of our existing universities. </para>
                    <para>I hope also that the proposed university will include a school of literature that will have for its aim the development of an Australian literary concept. The age of the ##"##Dad and Dave##"## aspect of Australian literature should be gone forever. Too many people in other countries are not aware of the fact that Australia has a standard of literature comparable with their own. From cartoons, from bad literature that has been widely publicized, and from radio serials, other people have gained the belief that Australians are the ignorant sort of people portrayed in some of those caricatures. Therefore, I hope that the claims of literature, particularly Australian literature, will not be overlooked in the. organization of the proposed university. A proper appreciation of the real Australian spirit does not exist to-day. We have found that there is no Australian standard in the professions. For instance, there is no Australian standard amongst doctors, dentists or nurses. Each State has its own standard,  and this is something which an Australian National University can rectify by establishing a common standard second to none in the Empire. I am proud to be associated with the Government that has framed this bill. . The building of an Australian National University in our National Capital will be a lengthy task, and we must start at once because the need for it is urgent. Australia is a nation and Canberra is the proper place for a national university in which, I hope, a true spirit of Australianism and intellectualism will be developed by the appointment of men and women who will not tolerate anything that is second-rate or cheap. I commend the bill and congratulate the Government upon having introduced it. </para>

                        <para>.- The proposal to establish a national university at Canberra is a step in the right direction. Already, we have in Canberra research institutions such as the Institute of Anatomy, the Council for Scientific and Industrial Research and the Solar Observatory at Mount Stromlo. The facilities available in these institutions, and the highly technical and specialized apparatus that they contain, will be of great value to the staff of the proposed university. The National Library and the valuable records and statistics available in the various departments, and in Parliament itself, will all be useful factors in the process of learning and research. There is no doubt that, in connexion with at least some of the sciences, a university at Canberra will have a distinct advantage over those in the States. As a member of the Public Works Committee, I have come in contact with various scientists and others at the universities and research institutions in the capital cities of the States. All of them agree that conditions at the State universities are becoming increasingly difficult as the result of overcrowding. In some instances, universities are attempting to cater for three times the normal number of students. It is evident, therefore, that students at a university in Canberra, even though it be small, would be more likely to receive efficient training than those attending State universities. .Similarly, the teachers of smaller groups of students would have more opportunity than their colleagues elsewhere to keep in touch with modern trends in their particular fields of science. The establishment of the proposed university may well pave the way  for the introduction of a system of providing trained scientific teachers to relieve members of State university staffs, whose energies are greatly over-taxed, for certain periods each year so that they may come to Canberra to carry on research work in their own spheres of learning to </para>

Although I am not in favour of replacing the proposed university by extensions at Duntroon, as has been suggested in the House of Repre-  sentatives, it is clear that a university in Canberra will provide an influence which will be of the greatest value to students at the Royal Military College. </para>
                    <para>There is no doubt that, during the war, defence training became more closely related to scientific developments than ever before. In the future it will be even more important for our defence organization to keep abreast of scientific achievements. The connexion between university work in physical science and military operations is much more pronounced now than it was a few years ago. The development of atomic warfare has emphasized that a great deal of military training in the future will have to be done in collaboration with scientists. A university staffed by outstanding scientists with energy and enthusiasm, and with students and efficient research workers keenly interested in their work, could soon establish a record of achievement that would be the envy of the world. Many of our scientists have achieved results second to none, which have brought renown to Australia. Some of them made their investigations in the jungles of New Guinea and in the tropical areas of Australia.##"## Others achieved their successes on orchards and farms. Their knowpledge is eagerly sought in overseas countries, where their advice is needed for application to the##'## problems awaiting solution there. </para>
                    <para>There is no reason why the pro-  posed university should conflict in any way with those in State capitals. In fact, it is agreed, that tremendous fields await development, and that every effort should be bent to that task. In my experience it seems requisite that a great deal should be done in co-ordinating the work and efforts of our scientific men before we can reap the full results of their labours. Each university is largely a self-contained entity, and, although there is a certain, degree of collaboration, there is no planned co-ordination. If a university at Canberra succeeded in creating a living and active link to draw together, and bring to fruition, the scattered efforts in Australia it would have more than justified its existence. The provision of adequate buildings, with an exterior appearance sufficiently good to satisfy the most particular aesthetic taste, is also one of the requirements of a university for Canberra. Many prominent architects agree that a project of this kind should be thrown open to wide competition, in order to secure the most appropriate plans. </para>

The University College which was established some time ago at Canberra, recognized the subjects and examination standards of the University of . Melbourne, but there was not similar reciprocity between Canberra and the Universities of Adelaide and Sydney and universities in other capital cities. If a young student passed in several subjects for the diploma of commerce or took Commercial Law I. and Commercial Law II., he was not recognized at the Canberra University College as having passed in those subjects. </para>

Standards of training reached by students in universities in the capital cities will, I hope, be recognized at Canberra. If a student has passed examinations at the University of Adelaide in Commercial Law I. and Commercial Law II. his passes are not recognized by the University of Melbourne. Economics I. is recognized both in Melbourne and Canberra, but if Economics II. has been passed at the University of Adelaide it is not recognized either at Melbourne or Canberra, although it is the most difficult examination in the study of economics. There is a good opportunity for the Government to hold an interstate conference of the councils of the various universities for the purpose of establishing uniform standards throughout the States, so that a student who begins a course in one State, and through economic necessity or other reasons transfers to another State or to Canberra, may continue his studies without interruption. </para>

Ex-service men and women need the personal touch in connexion with their educational, studies more than those who did not see war service, and were fortunately able to continue their studies without interruptions by passing from the schools and colleges to the universities. I speak from personal knowledge of this matter. My daughter has been fortunate ##'##enough to proceed to the university without interruption of her training, and I have noticed that she has thereby had an advantage over others whose studies were interrupted by their enlistment at the age of eighteen, nineteen or twenty years.

It is my earnest hope that much good . will accrue . from the vast sums :of money that are being expended on education,- -but I sometimes wonder whether we are not making mistakes in the kind. of education that is given our children. The old system of apprenticeship, under, which men and boys were apprenticed to various arts and crafts,, seems##'## to have disappeared. In the past the master was generally, not only a good craftsman, but also a man of high moral character. The system of apprenticeship training therefore produced men ##'##of high moral character as well as good craftsmen. It allowed apprentices time for reading. That is one reason why we must go back to the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries for the best in our literature and in art. In those days people were not only trained in various arts and crafts; they also were taught how to use their leisure to advantage. We may have to go back to the system under which- ##'##young people were taught not only how to read and write and to earn a livelihood, but also something of history and geography, an appreciation of the classics and a love of the beautiful. With that foundation, we  should  then make it possible for Australian students who show special promise to have a university training, after which those  most  suitable for post-graduate training should be able to receive it at Canberra. Such an educational system would lead to greater stability and more real knowledge in this country. If the proposed Australian National University at Canberra will instil into the minds of the people that all work is honorable, and that it should be done to the best of a man##'##s ability, it will accomplish much. Our people should be taught that service to the community in what might be called the humbler spheres is as valuable an asset as is prominence in science or medicine, and that the humble tradesman who does his work to the best of his ability is as worthy of our esteem as is <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Howard</inline> Florey or Professor Hugh Cairns, who have won world renown.

                        <para>. -  This afternoon I was handed a reply to a question upon notice which I asked some days ago. The answer was quite satisfactory, and I thank the Minister for it. There was, however, an addendum to it which I greatly resent. I do not think that it would have been included had not the proceedings of the Senate been broadcast. I have been in the political life of this country for about a quarter of a century, and never during that period have I heard anything like what I have heard in this building during the last##'## fortnight, when members of the </para>

Ordinarily, questions without notice in this chamber occupy from ten to fifteen minutes; to-day, just because proceedings were to be broadcast, they lasted for more than one hour, and included many inspired questions. Approximately half of the 35 minutes that is allowed for questions##'## that are to be broadcast later in the day was taken up by one Minister alone in answering all the inquiries directed at him. Probably the Minister was annoyed because he had been unable to make his reply to my question within the 35 minutes. I repeat that I resent strongly the addendum attached to the answer. I do not mind criticism in fair debate, but I resent a Minister taking advantage of. parliamentary privilege to reprimand me in answer to a question. </para>
