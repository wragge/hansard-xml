The work is proceeding with all possible despatch; but it is expected that, even under the most favorable conditions, at least three months will be required to complete the work, and that the ship will not be able to be  recommissioned  before early in June. </para>

            <para>- On the motion for tho adjournment of the Senate on the 14th Marek, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator 0&#39;Flaherty</inline> referred to the telephone service in South Australia and also to the trunk line service between Adelaide and the other States. As I have explained on  previous occasions, the telephone service throughout the Commonwealth has&#39; been ad&#39;versely affected, due to conditions arising from the war, and in order to overcome the difficulties now being experienced it is necessary to install &#34;a considerable quantity of automatic equipment, erect new buildings and lay large, quantities of underground cables. The shortage of equipment is being overcome. Substantial quantities have been secured recently and regular deliveries of supplies which have been on order for a long period are expected to he maintained in the future. The main obstacle to securing a market! improvement in the situation is the necessity for the erection of new buildings to accomodated  the additional equipment, the great majority of the existing exchange buildings being already occupied to full capacity. An early solution to the problem is also prevented by the shortage cf skilled manpower and the time which will bc: needed to train men in the special classes of work involved. The plans which have been made to  meet  the position in the Adelaide metropolitan area include the provision of two new large automatic exchanges in the city and six new automatic exchanges in the suburbs. The Commonwealthwide programme also includes the provision of many new automatic oxchanges in country districts in South Australia. </para>

          <para>Concerning the trunk-line service between Adelaide and the other States, it is anticipated that the number of telephone channels between Adelaide and Melbourne will be increased from twelve, to 22 within the next two or three weeks, and two Perth- Adelaide circuits will be extended to Melbourne at the same time, making a total of four between those centres. On the Sydney-Melbourne . route the number of trunk lines has been increased from ,21 to 43 Since the war ended, and an additional eleven channel; should be available before the end of </para>
          <para class="block">April. Between&#39; Sydney and Brisbane the number of circuits will be augmented from thirteen to 21 within the next two months, whilst, in about four months, an increase from seven to twelve, will take place in the .channels available between the mainland and Tasmania. On the  Canberra-Sydney  route the number of circuits will be increased from eleven to fourteen towards the end of July, whilst the matter of further augmenting the facilities on this route as well as that between Canberra and Melbourne is now under review bv the Department. </para>

          <para>- I cannot let this opportunity pass without paying my tribute to a very old friend. Probably I knew the late <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Robert</inline> Best longer than most  people. I have a keen recollection of the fir.;t time I met him. He was then member of the Victorian Parliament for the Division of Fitzroy, and was also president of the Fitzroy Football Club. In my first year of league football, I had the pleasure of shaking hands with him and of receiving some worthwhile advice from him. I am afraid that, at that time, I regarded his office as president of the Fitzroy Football Club as of considerably more importance than hi? membership of Parliament, or even of the Ministry. Our friendship lasted from that time until his death. He was courageous and kindly, and in every way was a pattern for anybody who wished to devote his life to his country. He took his good fortunes with a. .smile and his ill fortunes - he had many of them - with a wave of the hand, a.= much as to say, &#34;that is a ball that will not bowl me again &#34;. His courage remained with him to the end. Within the last few months, I have seen him walking not in the manner of a decrepit old nian, hut  briskly  and energetically. <inline font-style="italic">One</inline> day lie told me about a game of golf he had played a week or two previously. His mind was as keen as ever, and he was taking the same spirited interest in public affairs and in the Australian people. He departed, this life a man of honour. In paying this tribute to bis memory and in extending my sincere sympathy to his family I shall conclude by saying, he was- a man indeed. </para>

          <para>I departed from Australia on the 25th August, and travelled to the United Kingdom via the United States of America. I returned to Australia on the 28th December. During four months abroad it was my duty to undertake several commissions on behalf of the Government. While in the United Kingdom I had talks with the Minister foi- National Insurance, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. -Tames</inline> Griffiths, on the question of reciprocal social service benefits for Empire citizens. Settlement of this question was a prerequisite for development of Australian plans for migration to this country  from the United Kingdom. The details of the agreement reached with the United- Kingdom for a free passage  scheme for ex-service men and women were recently announced. The agreement provides for an extension of substantial social service benefits to British&#39; persons settling under this scheme. While abroad &#91; was offered opportunities of studying social service legislation and of discussing matters of common interest with administrators in the United Kingdom and the United States of America. In those countries I found a keen interest in Australia&#39;s positive programmes for widening the spread, and . improving the standards, of social security and health benefits. I should like to pay a. tribute to the standard of efficiency attained by Australian legations and consular services overseas and to the help they afforded the delegation. They fulfil adequately the expanding functions which result from this country&#39;s increasing part in world affairs. </para>
          <para>It is not necessary for me to speak at length concerning the International Labour Organization Conference, as the report which I am about to table is a comprehensive one. The report which I propose to move be printed should incorporate, not only the views of -the Australian delegation, but also a full record of the resolutions of the conference on each of the items of the agenda. This procedure will ensure that a comprehensive record of the achievements of last year&#39;s meeting of the organization will be readily available in Australia. It is the Government&#39;s desire to cultivate an active public interest in the work of the International Labour Organization. The scope of its work - improved labour standards, social security and human welfare - is the concern of every individual and every group in the community. The breadth of its interests is &#39;reflected in the system of representation of members. The Internationa&#93; Labour Organization is not an inter-governmental organization alone. It is unique among international institutions in that it directly represents employers and workers as well as governments, and&#39; all three have a voice and a vote in the conferences of the organization. Before the war the International Labour Organization survived the spread tff fascism and of ideologies hostile to all it stands for. Under great difficulties it carried on during the war as, I believe, ihe sole remaining international organiza- tion of free peoples, in which faith in  the  ultimate destruction of fascism, and  the  uplifting of oppressed peoples, was kept alive. During those war years the foundations were laid for a post-war programme of work in spheres such as social security, medical care, social policy im dependent territories, employment organization and the protection of children and! young workers.  At the Paris conference&#39;1 the International Labour Organization showed itself to be a vigorous and realistic body, capable of making a solid&#39;, contribution to world collaboration <inline font-style="italic">im</inline> social matters. This record of strength! is largely explained, in my view, by  thedevoted  participation in the International Labour Organization of representatives of workers - the predominant element in every community and  thepeople  whom the International Labour. Organization aims to serve above all.. The workers group in successive conferences has vigilantly preserved the rights, of workers to be represented by freely chosen spokesmen and to protect  the  organization as a whole from the infiltration of fascist elements. It was a. moving experience to work with representatives of countries only just freed! from Nazi terror and subjection - men: who because of their convictions had! suffered in concentration camps. They&#34; spoke with understanding of the democratic freedoms which are the foundations of the International Labour Organization. There was an example at the Parisconference of the careful regard forgenuine representation. There theworkers&#39; delegates challenged the bona fides of Argentinian workers&#39; delegatesThe challenge was supported unanimously by governments, employer&#39;s and workers, and the persons purporting to be freely chosen representatives of Argentinian workers were denied admission to the? conference. </para>
          <para>The International Labour Organization is at present conducting a comprehensive, review of its constitution so as toadapt the organization to the newstructure of international organizations established since the conference of the&#39; United Nations held at San Francisco.. It is not expected that these changes &#39; will be far reaching. But certain improvements in machinery can be effected^  and action has to be taken to establish the organization as a self-contained unit now that the League of Nations has ceased to function. A draft convention to give effect to some of these constitutional changes has been submitted to member governments, and is now being considered by the Australian Government. At the Paris conference the Australian Government was elected to the governing body. Our representation on the executive will permit a more active role of the work of the organization. The Government is anxious to establish close relationship between the International Labour Organization and the United Nations, by agreement between the two organizations. In its own specialized sphere the International Labour Organization should take its place as one of the group of international agencies which, working together will promote the social and economic purposes agreed by signatories to the United Nations Charter. One development of special interest, from the point of view of Australian policy in the Pacific, is the decision to hold Asiatic regional conferences in the near future and the proposal for a South-West Pacific Regional Conference and liaison officers to be discussed by the Australian Govern ment and the Acting Director of the International Labour Office. These developments will correct a present tendency towards preoccupation with the problem of Europe, while the special problems of the huge . populations in other parts of the world are often given inadequate attention. Treatment of international problems on a regional, basis has provendisdvantages. It is the belief of the Government that effective action to promote improvement in such matters as conditions of employment in backward areas will in some cases follow more quickly if problems are discussed regionally, in close contact with the areas concerned, and with closer understanding of the political and social environment. </para>

          <para>No representations were made to the United Kingdom Government that Australian units which took part in the Syrian campaign should be eligible for the Africa Star instead of the 1939-45 Star or any war medal. It was proposed, however, that service in the Syrian campaign should be indicated by an emblem on the &#34;ribbon of the 1939-45 Star. This was not agreed to by the United Kingdom Government as corresponding recognition of many other campaigns in which Empire forces had been engaged would have been involved. Because of &#34;the general difficulties associated with such distinctive recognition the proposal nas withdrawn. </para>

              <para>- The Minister for Post-war Reconstruction has supplied the following answers: - 1. (o) No; (6) some delay was caused in the payment of re-employment allowances on account of change in the method of payment. Prior to the loth February all reemployment allowances in Kalgoorlie were handled by the local repatriation committee and paid in cash. Since the loth February the allowances are paid by cheque under the same arrangements as apply elsewhere in the Commonwealth. The cheques are drawn by the Commonwealth Sub-Treasury after authorization by the Repatriation Department following receipt of applications by the local National Service officer. It is not thought that there will be any cause for complaint in thu future. 2. <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> No; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> on the 14th March there wis re 104 unemployed ex-servicemen and 70 civilians. The gold-mining industry is taking some time to re-establish itself due to a number of reasons, e.g., shortage of firewood, shortage of plant and stores. In addition, the reinstatement process is somewhat delaying the engagement of casual labour, and the return of persons with reinstatement rights is causing some others to be retrenched. The bulk of the persons who are unemployed were not previously employed in the gold-mining industry in Kalgoorlie, and had gone there with the object of obtaining employment. </para>

              <para>Trade training consists usually of six months in a technical school during which period living allowance is paid. This is followed by subsidized employment at full award rates with an employer. Trainees may remain in technical schools longer than six months but obviously all trainees cannot be trained at one time. Training in technical schools is to be spread over a period of two years. The position is made quite clear to members of the forces when they apply. In regard to rural and business loans, inspection of premises, leases, &#38;c, and consideration of availability of goods and security are usually necessary. Subject to the time required in this connexion there is no delay in dealing with loans. 2 and 3. Government controls under the National Security Regulations do not delay the re-establishment of ex-service personnel. The Government is removing all controls as rapidly as possible. As a matter of fact strong representations have been made to the Government to retain controls because they could be used to assist in the re-establishment of discharged members of the forces. The Government&#39;s provisions for re-establishment are adequate for the purposes and it is not proposed to retain controls any longer than is necessary in the national interests. </para>

            <para>Some employment companies in the Army were enlisted from volunteer aliens who had taken refuge in Australia and legal doubt lias been expressed as to whether these men can be classified as enemy aliens as defined by the Re-establishment and Employment Act. They are men who left central European countries in the years prior to the war and sought, and were granted, asylum in British countries. These stateless aliens, who are either applying for) or have been granted, naturalization papers, served in the Australian forces to the best of their ability within the limits prescribed for their service - that is,&#39; they were permitted to serve only on the mainland. We were anxious to take advantage of their services during the war, and the Government has. decided that these stateless men, provided they apply .for naturalization, shall be eligible for reconstruction benefits on the same basis as other servicemen. These men have not been granted an accelerated release &#39;to take places in universities that should be reserved for Australians. Every man in the Australian forces who was eligible to enter second-year university classes was given the right to apply for accelerated release, and some twenty-odd of the hundreds of stateless aliens were .eligible. To date, &#39;837 members of th(e forces, including 21 stateless aliens, have  been  released for second or subsequent year study at Australian universities, lt is quite wrong to say that any of these men has taken a place that should have been given to an Australian, as no applicant who was eligible has been refused his discharge. </para>

            <para>The Government does not propose at present to restore this section of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. The order of preference for appointment given by former section 84 (9) (c) did not always operate in the best interests of the Public Service and did not always operate fairly as between exservicemen. Men secured priority in permanent appointment merely by the fortuitous circumstance of having been available for temporary employment. Capable and highly efficient returned soldiers who had not sought temporary employment but wished to secure permanent appointment in the Commonwealth Public Service were debarred because of the preference given to those who happened to have been available earlier for temporary engagement. </para>

There are ample stocks of tobacco leaf to supply the needs of Australia in manufactured tobacco, cigars and cigarettes. Manufacturers have stated for many months past that insufficient female labour has been available to enable them to convert this leaf into the quantity of manufactured products required to satisfy the demands by smokers. As man-power controls have been lifted, the tobacco factories are now free to employ types  of labour which were not previously open to them.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to provide for increased reimbursement grants to the States in respect of income tax and entertainments tax under the Commonwealth Government&#39;s plan for the continuation of uniform taxation. Before explaining its provisions, I shall outline briefly the historical background against which it should be considered. </para>
          <para class="block">It will be recalled that in  1942  the Commonwealth Government established uniform income taxation for the period of the war and one full financial year thereafter. Later in that year, the Commonwealth legislation was unsuccessfully challenged in the High Court of Australia by four of the State governments. The High Court found that, quite apart from the defence power, the Commonwealth could enforce priority in the collection of its taxation, and make grants to States on the condition that they vacated the field of taxation on, for ex ample, incomes. Following this litigation, the Commonwealth, in agreement with the States concerned, established a uniform entertainments tax on a similar basis later in  1942. </para>
          <para>After considering the views expressed by the State. Premiers, both before and during the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers held last January, the Commonwealth Government has decided that uniform income taxation shall be continued permanently. Uniform income taxation has many advantages. For example, prior to  1942  the many separate and widely differing State and Commonwealth taxation laws caused the individual taxpayer much confusion complexity, and, in some instances, inequity. There weretwenty-six different laws imposing taxes on incomes. These laws involved different income tax returns, different rates, different methods of determining taxable income, and different concessional allowances. On the other hand, under uniform taxation there is only one income-taxing authority and conditions are uniform for taxpayers in all States of the. Commonwealth. A taxpayer with the same income and the same family responsibilities pays the same tax no matter in which State he resides. An effective pay-as-you-earn system of collection of income tax is also practicable. From the point of view of the taxpayer, the abandonment of uniform taxation is unthinkable. Furthermore, prior touniform taxation, the Commonwealth&#39;s taxation policy was hampered by the difficulty of imposing uniform Commonwealth rates of income tax on top of widely differing rates of State taxation. If uniform taxation were abandoned, this difficulty would again be encountered, because the Commonwealth&#39;s financial commitments arising from the war and from new peace-time responsibilities require income tax rates much higher than those in force before the war. </para>
          <para>Because of its financial commitments, the Commonwealth must also remain in the field of entertainments taxation. At the same time, the Government recognizes that the reimbursement grants fixed in  1942  will not be adequate to the States&#39; responsibilities in peace-time, and increases in the reimbursement payments  are therefore proposed. At the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers last January, &#39;the Premiers of the States opposed in principle the establishment of uniform taxation on a permanent basis. Nevertheless, they agreed to discuss the basis of reimbursement to be adopted should the Commonwealth proceed with its legislation and, after lengthy and detailed discussions between the Premiers and the Prime Minister and between Commonwealth and State officials, unanimous agreement on this aspect was finally reached. This bill embodies the terms of that agreement. </para>
          <para>Under the existing legislation, separate tax reimbursement grants are paid to each State concerned in respect of income tax and entertainments tax, respectively. It is now proposed to combine these payments, so that as from the 1st July, 1946, the reimbursement in respect of both income tax and entertainments tax will be covered by the one grant. For this reason, and also because of the substantial amendments involved in the new method of calculating the grants, the Government considers it preferable to repeal the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942 and the States Grants (Entertainments Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942 and to submit an entirely new bill. </para>
          <para>As at present, the payment of the reimbursement grant in any year to any State will be subject to the condition that the State has not imposed in that year a tax upon incomes. Although the Commonwealth will continue to impose a tax on entertainments, the payment of the grant to any State will not be conditional on that State refraining from imposing a tax on entertainments. This is because, unlike the uniform income tax arrangements, the present scheme of uniform entertainments taxation was originally established under an agreement with the States concerned that it should not continue for more than twelve months after the war. Any State is therefore free to re-enter the field of entertainments taxation without prejudicing its right to a tax reimbursement grant. </para>
          <para>I turn now to the aggregate grant to be paid by the Commonwealth, and its distribution between the States. The present grants are fixed at the average collections of income tax and entertainments tax by the States in the years 1939-40 and 1940-41. The existing legislation also provides that a State may seek an increase of its reimbursement grant if that grant is insufficient to meet its revenue requirements in any year. Under the latter provision, an additional amount of &#163;553,000 was paid to South Australia in respect of 1944-45 but, in general, the grants have proved sufficient for the war-time requirements of the States. The Commonwealth Government recognizes, however, that the basis of present tax reimbursement grants is unsatisfactory for inclusion in a permanent scheme of uniform taxation. First, some immediate increase of the grants is necessary to cover a prospective deterioration of State finances due, not only to the gradual disappearance of war-time opportunities for economy and of the indirect assistance to State revenues arising out of Commonwealth war expenditures, but also to the increased level of wages and prices and to the increasing responsibilities of the States in the field of social services. Secondly, some automatic provision for subsequent variations of the grants, not involving special applications each year, is desirable to cover variations of inescapable State commitments due to increasing population and to movements in the levels of prices and wages. Thirdly, some variation in the present distribution of the total grant between the States has become necessary. The existing distribution is based on the tax collections of the several States in 1939-40 and 1940-41, and its continuance would prevent certain States from bringing their social and other services into line with those prevailing in other States-. Accordingly, the Government proposes that the aggregate grant shall be &#163;40,000,000 -in each of the years 1946-47 and 1947-48. That is an increase of &#163;5,745,000 on the present total, but after taking account of the increased needs of the States to which I have already referred, and of the reduction of the special grants under section 96 of the Constitution which may be expected to follow the increase of more than &#163;2,000,000 in the . reimbursement grants to South Australia, &#34;Western Australia, and Tasmania, I am convinced that the  increase is not excessive. The increase for each State is as follows : - </para>
          <para class="block">
            <graphic href="186332194604021_14_2.jpg" />
          </para>
          <para class="block">In 194S-49 and subsequent years the aggregate grant will be &#163;40,000,000, increased in proportion to the increase of population, and will then be further increased by half the percentage increase, if any, of average wages foi1 each person employed over the level in 1946-47. The reason for the population adjustment is self-evident. The adjustment for movements in the &#34; wage &#34; index brings into account the variations of State commitments which follow variations of the level of wages and prices. Commonwealth and State statistical officers have advised that the &#34;wage&#34; index is the best currently available index for this purpose. The adjustment is, however, limited to half the percentage increase of this index, because some State expenditures do not vary with levels of prices and. wages. It will be noted that the provisions relating to the variation of the aggregate grant are framed so as to ensure that the States will receive &#163;40,000,000 in each of the first two years of the scheme and at least &#163;40,000,000, increased in proportion to population, in subsequent years. </para>
          <para>The bill provides that in 1946-47 and 1947-48 the distribution of the aggregate grant between the States will be as set out in the First Schedule. The Premiers agreed to this distribution as approximating to their relative financial needs in those years. Thereafter, the intention is to progress by stages to a position where the aggregate grant is distributed between the States in proportion to their respective populations after adjustments to take into account relative sparseness of population and numbers of school children. Those adjustments arc made because of the greater costs of administration and social services in sparsely populated areas and because of the high cost of education for school children. The distribution will not be made solely on the basis of  adjusted &#39; population until 1957-58. In the intervening years a gradually diminishing part of the aggregate grant will be distributed in the proportions in which the aggregate grant of &#163;40,000,000 is distributed in &#39;1946-47 and 1947-4S, and a gradually increasing part in proportion to the adjusted populations of the States. Thus, in 1948-49 90 per cent, of the aggregate grant will be distributed in accordance with the 1946-47 proportions, and, in 1949-50, SO per cent., with a similar reduction of ten in each of the succeeding years. Further explanations of the provisions in the bill relating to the calculation of the aggregate grant and of its distribution amongst the States are given in an explanatory memorandum which has been circulated for the information of honorable senators. As at present, the grants to each State  will be reduced by the amount of any arrears of income tax which are collected by or on behalf of the State during any year. If the States should ever decide to forgo the &#39;Commonwealth grants, and to reimpose their own taxes on incomes, an amount -equal to these arrears, less any refunds of taxation made by the Commonwealth on behalf of the States, will be paid to the States. This provision continues the arrangements under the. existing legislation, except that interest will not accrue after the end of this financial year. </para>
          <para>As I have already mentioned, under section 6 of the States Grants (Income Tax Reimbursement) Act 1942, a State may seek additional financial assistance in any year if the tax reimbursement grants&#39; are insufficient to meet the State&#39;s revenue requirements in that year. &#34;With fixed grants, this provided a. necessary element of flexibility. The basis of reimbursement grants now proposed should prove sufficiently flexible to meet the future revenue requirements of the States, and, accordingly, the Government, does not propose to continue the provision. 1 should add that if, in special circumstances, any State does require further financial assistance from the Commonwealth, application may be made by that. State for a special grant under section 96 of the Constitution. It is understood that South Australia, Western Australia, and Tasmania are making application under section 6 of the existing act for additional financial assistance in respect  of the present financial year. Accordingly, in order that the Commonwealth Grants Commission may, if necessary, make recommendations on such applications after the 30th June, 1946, and to enable any payments that may be necessary in respect of 1945-46 to be made after that date, sections 6 and 7 of the present act will be preserved temporarily for this purpose. </para>
          <para>The basis of tax reimbursement grants set out in the bill should not require amendment for many years. Nevertheless, at the conference of Commonwealth and State Ministers, it was agreed that, in the interests both of the Commonwealth and the States, it was desirable to set out the circumstances in which a review of the basis of tax reimbursement grants could be sought. The understanding between the Premiers and the Prime Minister is that a review of the method of determining the aggregate grant and its distribution may be sought at any time after the expiration of seven years from the 1st July, 1946, by either the Commonwealth Government or a State government. If, however, there is a major change in Commonwealth-State relations having an effect on State finances caused, for example, by - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> a substantial alteration of the powers or functions of the Commonwealth or of any State or States, or <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> the assumption of tnajor new responsibilities by the States, either the Commonwealth or a State government may seek a review of the basis of reimbursement before the expiration of the period of seven years. As this understanding has not been incorporated in a formal agreement between the Commonwealth and the States, clause 10 of the bill does not purport to prevent, as indeed it would not be possible to do, future Commonwealth Parliaments from a mending the legislation. This Government will, however, abide by the understanding reached with the Premiers. I commend the bill to honorable senators. </para>

          <para>T hat the bill be now read a second time. </para>
          <para>It is proposed by this bill that the Commonwealth Public Service Act be amended to enable the appointment to the Commonwealth Public Service of officers of the income tax departments of the States. This proposal forms part of the programme under which the Government&#39;s decision to establish uniform income taxation on a permanent basis as from the 1st July, 1946, is to be given effect. The staff concerned is at present on transfer to the Commonwealth Public Service under the provisions of the Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act. Under that act, however, the transfer is of a temporary nature, as it was designed to cover only the war-time period. If the Commonwealth is now to be the sole income tax collecting authority the Government believes that the staff concerned should be given the opportunity to transfer to the Commonwealth Public Service permanently. </para>
          <para>This bill, therefore, sets out the manner in which the transfer of staff will be made, and the conditions under which the staffs will be employed by the Commonwealth. Each employee will be asked whether he desires to accept employment in the Commonwealth Public Service. A permanent officer of a State Public Service will be eligible for appointment as a permanent officer of the Commonwealth Public Service. A temporary employee of a State will be offered temporary employment with the Commonwealth. As well as those employees who are at the present time employed in income tax offices, the provisions of this bill cover any State income tax officer who is now a member of the forces, and any State income tax officer who is at the present time employed on other duties. The bill also covers the small staff which has been loaned to the Commonwealth in some States for duties  connected with the collection of entertainments tax. </para>
          <para>An officer who is a member of theforces, or who is absent from the income tax department because of his employment on other duties, will be offered employment with the Commonwealth under conditions which would have applied to him if he had remained on duty in the income tax department. Broadly, the bill seeks to appoint or to employ each member of the staff with remuneration not lower than he received in the service of a State. The right to recreation leave accrued to a State employee at the time of his transfer to the Commonwealth Public Service will be preserved, and continuous service by such an officer with a -State and the Commonwealth will be reckoned as service with the Commonwealth for the purposes of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. </para>
          <para>The bill states that the provisions of any law providing for preference in employment to ex-servicemen shall not apply in relation to appointments which are made under the provisions of the bill. This is proposed because of the difference between appointments to be made under the provisions of this bill and appointments made to the Commonwealth Public Service in the normal way. The appointment of officers under this bill will be, in effect, a transfer <inline font-style="italic">en bloc</inline> of State officers to the Commonwealth. </para>

          <para class="block">The purpose of this bill is to extend to State taxation officers who are being taken over by the Commonwealth, similar conditions in regard to superannuation as were granted last year to State officers appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service in connexion with the Commonwealth Employment Service.  A  State officer has the option of electing to pay to the Commonwealth Superannuation Board the refund of contributions received by him from -a State fund and to continue to contribute to the Commonwealth fund at the same rate as he contributed to a State fund for such pension benefits under the Commonwealth act as the Commonwealth Actuary certifies are equivalent to his State rights. </para>
          <para>If the State officer decides to retain his refund of contributions from a State fund he will come under the Commonwealth act as a new contributor at rate for age next birthday as at the date of appointment, and will be subject to medical examination. Where a State officer has gratuity rights instead of superannuation rights, the gratuity rights will be preserved to him under the Commonwealth Public Service Act. He may, if he so desires, convert such rights into a pesion under the Superannuation Act. The amendment will also protect the superannuation rights of other State officers who may, from time to time, be appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service, with the exception of any officer whose appointment is the result of competitive examination for admission to the Commonwealth Public Service. Opportunity is also being taken to amend the provisions of the act relating to payments from the Provident Account, by restricting the minimum payment of six months&#39; salary to cases of retirement on invalidity, retrenchment or death in the Service. The restriction will apply only to persons who become contributors to the Provident Account after the commencement of this act. </para>

          <para>Under the uniform taxation arrangements the State income tax organizations were taken over by the Commonwealth for the duration of the war. The Income Tax (War-time Arrangements) Act authorized the transfer of those organizations by providing for the States income tax staffs, office accommodation, furniture, equipment and records, to be temporarily transferred to the Commonwealth. The act also authorized the suspensionof the agreements between the States and the Commonwealth under which the States had collected Commonwealth income tax. </para>
          <para>In a bill to amend the Commonwealth Public Service Act, which is already before the Senate, provision is being made to appoint officers of the States income tax staffs to the Commonwealth.

Consequently, the sections of that act relating to the transfer of the staffs and to the conditions of their employment will no longer be necessary and their repeal is sought by this bill. It is proposed that the officers concerned shallbe appointed to the Commonwealth Public Service as from the 1st July, 1946, and the repeal of the sections will take effect on that date. If a State officer does not desire appointment to the Commonwealth service, the bill preserves to him his right to reinstatement in a State service.

In view of its present financial responsibilities, the Government proposes to continue in the entertainments tax field, and in the States Grants (Tax Reimbursement) Bill and the Enter.taimnents Tax Bil&#93; has made provision for payments to be made to the States in respect of both income tax and entertainments tax.

          </quote>
          <para class="block">The principal amendments to the Income Tax Assessment Act proposed in this bill follow upon the adoption by the Government of recommendations made by its representatives who attended a conference which was held with representatives of the Associated Chambers of Manufactures. That organization had submitted to the Government various proposals for amendment of the income tax law designed to encourage and facilitate industry in its transition from war to peace-time production. The Government gave careful consideration to all of these proposals and decided to adopt those recommended to it and which are now implemented in the bill before the Senate. In doing so the Government considers that it is making a practical contribution towards the establishment, reconstruction, and expansion of industry in the post-wa&#187;&#34; period. </para>
          <para>The proposals which have been adopted are, in the order in which they appear in the bill - (1) The allowance of an additional depreciation deduction in respect of amenities provided by employers for employees. (2) The allowance of a special depreciation deduction in respect of plant and machinery acquired during the post-war period. (S) The provision of additional allowances for expenditure on scientific research; and (4) the allowance of a credit of income tax in respect of certain losses and expenses incurred in reconverting businesses from war production, to peace-time production. </para>
          <para>Provision is made in clauses 7 and S of the bill for the allowance of depreciation on certain amenities provided by &#39;employers for the use of their employees, in respect of some fixtures and fittings for which depreciation deduction is not allowed under the present law, normal  races  of depreciation will be allowed. Other amenities for employees will be subject to depreciation allowances at the rate of 33^ per cent. </para>
          <para>The amendment proposed by clause 9 is to assist in the establishment and expansion of businesses in the immediate post-war period. The Government proposes to provide a special initial depreciation deduction of 20 per cent, of the cost of plant and machinery acquired during the period from 1st July, 1945, to 30th June, 1950. The concession will benefit all taxpayers engaged in business; including primary producers, except where the taxpayer elects not to have the special deduction allowed in his assessment. The deduction will be allowed in the year of acquisition or installation, and will be additional to the ordinary depreciation otherwise allowable in that year. Ordinary depreciation will, however, be calculated on cost less this special allowance. The amendment follows the general lines of similar provisions in the United Kingdom, New Zealand and South African acts, where the special deduction ranges f rom 10 per cent, to 20 per cent, of cost. </para>
          <para>In clause 11, provision is made for a special allowance in respect of amounts expended on scientific research for business purposes. It is the Government&#39;s aim to encourage the development of the nation&#39;s resources and the allowance of an income tax deduction is a practical form of encouragement to Australian industry to take fuller advantage of the opportunities which modern scientific discoveries offer. It is, therefore, proposed that certain research expenditure of a capital nature will be allowed as a deduction. Payments to approved research institutes will also be deductible provided the research is related to the business of the taxpayer. In addition, within certain necessary limits, expenditure incurred on buildings for research purposes will be allowed over three years and depreciation will be allowable in respect of plant used for research purposes at the rate of 33-J per cent. </para>
          <para>Clauses 12 and 17 of the bill provide for concessions in respect of gifts made by companies and individuals to approved  research  institutions. </para>
          <para>Clause 19 of the bill makes provision for a concession in the form of a tax credit designed to assist in the reestablishment of industry in the post-war period. It will apply to businesses which were converted to purposes primarily and principally connected with the prosecution of the war, and which are now being reconverted to meet the altered demands of peace. Under the law, business expenditure which is allowable as a deduction is deductible from the assessable income of the year in which the expenditure is incurred. Allowable expenditure which is incurred in reconverting a business from war production to civil production is accordingly deductible from post-war income. The Government acknowledges that where a business has engaged in production primarily and principally connected with the prosecution of the war, the cost of re-converting that business to civil production should fairly be charged against war-time income. By this method, the deduction would, in effect, be allowed at the war-time rates of tax instead of at peace-time rates. The proposed amendment will apply to expenditure incurred before the 1st July, 1947, in reconverting plant and machinery. It will also apply to losses sustained before that. date, as a result of the disposal or scrapping of plant which has greatly diminished in value and which has been subjected to excessive wear and tear because of its use for war production purposes. The concession takes the form of a credit of tax in post-war assessments, and will be equal to the reduction of income tax which the taxpayer would obtain if, instead of deducting the specified expenditure and losses from the income of the year in which they were incurred, they were deducted from the income of the year ended on the 30th June, 1945. </para>
          <para>Another concession designed to assist and encourage the development of Australian industry will grant income tax relief to visiting industrial experts, consultants, technicians and others from overseas. It is hoped that this concession will assist Australian industry to obtain the best possible advice from overseas in the task of developing manufacturing, mercantile, or mining businesses or businesses of primary production. </para>
          <para>With the cessation of hostilities, the income tax concessions hitherto granted to members of the Defence Forces necessarily arise for review. The concessions which have been granted to members of the Defence Forces are, in part, a recognition of the physical dangers faced and sacrifices made by members of the fighting units who went outside Australia on active service. Under the present law, all members of the forces are entitled to exemption in respect of pay and allowances earned out of Australia, and those members who served outside Australia for a specified period are, in addition, entitled to retrospective exemption of pay and allowances earned in Australia for periods of up to two years prior to their departure. Members of the Defence Forces who qualify for the retrospective exemption are also entitled to exemption of pay and allowances earned in Australia during the three months following their return from overseas service. Dependants&#39; allowances and deferred pay are also exempt. Now that the warhas ended, the Government considers that there is little justification for the continuance of the retrospective and prospective exemption of pay and allowances earned in Australia in the case of members who now go abroad for service, nor for providing exemption in respect of pay and allowances at peace-time rates. The bill, accordingly, proposes that, in future: <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> Exemption shall apply only to pay and allowances, whether earned in or out of Australia, which are at the special war-time rates; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> exemption of the pay and allowances earned in Australia shall apply to members of the Occupation and Interim Force who volunteered for service with that force on or before the date of the announcement of the Government&#39;s decision to modify the taxation concessions provided for members of the forces, i.e. the 13th February, 1946; but shall not apply to members who volunteer to serve with that force after that date; <inline font-style="italic">(c)</inline> exemption shall cease on and after the 1st July, 1947; <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> the exemption in respect of deferred pay shall be limited in the same manner ; <inline font-style="italic">(e)</inline> the special diminishing deduction of &#163;250 allowed to members of the Defence Forces in Australia and certain civilian personnel attached to the forces as well as to merchant seamen will continue to apply up to the 30th June, 1947. The Government desires to emphasize that the new provision will not deprive members of the forces of any concessions for which they have already qualified under the present law. Dependants&#39; allowances paid by the Government will continue to be exempt as hitherto. </para>
          <para>Clauses 5 and 21 propose certain benefits for ex-servicemen. By clause 5, exemption will be granted to exservicemen in respect of certain allowances paid to them while they are awaiting re-employment. By clause 21, ex-servicemen who are vocational trainees, will be brought within the scope of the tax instalment provisions. Another effect of the amendment proposed by this clause will be that trainees in receipt of living-away-from-home allowances will be placed, in respect of these allowances, in the same position as to taxation as employees who receive a similar allowance, in that they will receive a deduction of the amount by which the allowance exceeds 15s. a week. Clause 20 relates to the priority of the Commonwealth over the States in the matter of payment of income tax. This amendment is part of the Government&#39;s uniform income tax plan. </para>
          <para>Apart from those clauses which deal with purely technical matters, or amendments, consequent on alterations which have already been discussed, the remaining clauses of the bill make provision for the exemption of unemployment and sickness benefits and premiums paid in respect of Crown leases used for residential purposes only. Another amendment relates to the collection of income tax on bearer debenture interest in certain cases. The technical aspects of the proposed amendments are more fully explained in the printed explanatory memorandum which honorable senators have already had the opportunity of perusing. The explanations contained in that memorandum will, if necessary, be supplemented by further explanations during the committee stages of the bill. </para>

          <para class="block">This bill is complementary to the Income Tax Assessment Bill. Honorable senators will remember that that bill contains provisions for the allowance of a credit of income tax in respect of certain reconversion expenditure incurred by a taxpayer in the years ended the 30th June, 1946 and 1947. The provisions have the effect, of placing a taxpayer who incurs reconversion expenditure in those years in the same position as if the expenditure had been incurred in and allowed as a deduction from his assessable income of theyear ended the 30th June, 1945. The proposed provisions for the credit of incometax are explained in some detail in the explanatory memorandum circulatedto honorable senators in connexion with the Income Tax Assessment Bill, and in my second-reading speech on that bill. As public companies are subject to war-time company tax as well as income tax, this bill proposes to allow to that class of company a credit of war-time company tax on the same principle as is being adopted for income tax purposes. In order that the credit of income tax and the credit of war-time company tax will be ascertained on a uniform basis, provision is made in this bill to apply the a ppropriate provisions of the Income Tax Assessment Act. </para>

        <para>The purpose of the bill is to amend the existing provisions of the War Service Homes Act 1918-1941 to include as eligible persons within the meaning of the act, certain members of the mercantile marine who served in the Australian coastal shipping during the war and also, to provide other amendments which, it is considered will be of value in assisting ex-members of the forces desirous of obtaining homes. The principal amendments cover - <inline font-style="italic">(a)</inline> the extension of eligibility, as I have mentioned, to certain members of the mercantile marine; <inline font-style="italic">(b)</inline> the allotment of land held by the commission to applicants at fair value in lieu of capital cost under the rent-purchase system, Part IV. of the act; <inline font-style="italic">(c)</inline> the increase of the statutory loan limit of &#163;950 to &#163;1,250; and <inline font-style="italic">(d)</inline> the granting of facilities to provide loans on the security of Grown perpetual leaseholds of a State. </para>
        <para>Under the existing definition of &#34; eligible person &#34; members of the mercantile marine are excluded from the privileges of the act unless they were employed in sea-going services between Australian ports and ports other -than those of a State or Territory of the Commonwealth. The amendment proposed is that members who served their country in shipping engaged on the Australian coast during the war will be granted the same privileges in respect of eligibility under the act as those who served in other seagoing activities. With the development of the war in the Pacific honorable senators will appreciate the value of the services rendered by such persons and the justice of their inclusion within the category of those eligible to receive assistance by way of loans to acquire or erect homes under the War Service Homes- Act. </para>
        <para>A further amendment which is submitted for the consideration of the Senate relates to the acquisition of land and the erection of dwelling-houses under Part HI. of the act. Under existing conditions, the Commissioner is required to include, in the sale price of a home erected on land owned by the commission under this part, the total cost of such land. The total capital cost of certain land acquired some years ago to meet requirements now exceeds, in some instances, by fluctuation of value, or inclusion of total interest, or both, the fair market value of the land, but the Commissioner has no power to make the land available at its fair market value to eligible persons who desire assistance under the rent-purchase system contained in Part IV. of the act. This is an anomalous position in that under Part V. of the act, which covers the granting of advances on mortgage for the purchase of homes, the Commissioner may determine the fair value and- allot the land to an applicant at. that value: Therefore, the position is that a distinct benefit is conferred&#39; upon an applicant who is fortunate enough to be able to contribute a depo-.it of 10 per cent, or more to obtain assistance under Part V., but on the other hand&#39;, the applicant who is able to contribute only the lesser deposit of not more than 5 per cent, required under the rentpurchase system, Part TV., can be allotted the land only at a figure equalling its full capital cost. The need for an amendment to adjust this position is obvious and I commend the proposal that the Commissioner be empowered to determine, subject to the approval of the Minister, the fair value of land included in the cost of any home provided under Part IV. of the act, notwithstanding the fact that its value may be less than the capital cost including interest at the time of sale. As honorable senators will see from the memorandum distributed in connexion with the bill, the amendments proposed to give effect to the intentions expressed, comprise alterations of sections 18 (2), 19 (3) and the deletion of section 19 (9). </para>
        <para>To meet the changed conditions relating to the cost of erecting homes, it is proposed also that the present statutory limit of &#163;950, which the act allows to be granted for the purpose of acquiring or erecting a home, be increased to &#163;1,250. It is considered that if the Commissioner is granted power to make loans not exceeding this sum in the aggregate, it will be reasonably possible to meet the requirements of many applicants, .possessed of moderate means to acquire homes who, otherwise, because of the general increase of building costs, would be excluded from participating in the benefits and privileges which the act confers. </para>
        <para>Another feature of the bill which I commend for favorable consideration is the proposed amendment to empower the Commissioner to grant loans for the discharge of any mortgage, charge, or encumbrance already existing on homes erected on land leased by eligible persons within the Australian Capital Territory or the Northern Territory. Section 44 of the act at present provides that the Commissioner may acquire leases for the purpose of erecting homes thereon on behalf of applicants or, to grant assistance :o applicants to build a home on leases held by them ; but no provision is marie under which the Commissioner may grant assistance covering the discharge of a mortgage or other encumbrance entered into by an eligible&#39; applicant in respect of a home acquired by him in those territories. </para>
        <para>Whilst there has  been little demand in the past for a measure of this  nature, the expansion of the Australian National Capital which may reasonably be expected in the years  before us, together with the increase of the number of  ex-members  of the forces now resident in the Australian Capital Territory, warrant the same facilities being made available as those which are applicable in the different States. Generally, the provisions of the act now restrict the Commissioner to the granting of loans in respect of lands the title of which is  held  in fee-simple. The  only  exception to this is that he may accept as  &#39;Security  Crown leasehold in the Commonwealth territories which I  have  mentioned. Therefore, it. iS proposed that the definition of &#34; holding &#34; be amended to include State Crown lands held  by  eligible applicants in perpetual leasehold. This will enable the Commissioner to make advances for the erection of homes or for the discharge of  any  mortgage, charge or encumbrance existing on such land leased in perpetuity from the Crown by an eligible person where the Commissioner is satisfied that  this  should be done.&#39; This amendment will enable applicants resident in States where leasehold tenure  of  land is customary practice, such as  in  Queensland, to obtain assistance where otherwise  this  would not bc possible unless  land  with freehold title  could b.e  secured. </para>
        <para>The amendments to which I have re..ferred are important, in that they will he of material, benefit to ex-members of the forces who are eligible or will become eligible to receive assistance under the provisions of the act, and will also assist the Administration in giving effect to those provisions. I trust that honorable senators will give the bill favorable consideration, and expedite its passage. </para>

          <para>Under Commonwealth nationality law as it now stands, a woman who loses her British nationality because of her marriage to a foreigner may, by making  a  declaration, exercise in Australia and its territories the rights and privileges of a British subject. In such instances, a woman does not regain her British nationality, but, remains a foreigner, and the only way in which she can regain British nationality while her marriage continues is by her husband becoming naturalized. The bill provides that  a  British woman resident in Australia shall, on marriage, retain her British nationality under Commonwealth law, irrespective of her husband&#39;s nationality. It therefore makes a further advance towards the goal towards which many women have long and earnestly striven, namely, the right of a woman, on marriage, to choose her own nationality. </para>
          <para>The national status of married women is a somewhat complicated subject, and for the guidance of honorable senators I propose to give a brief historical survey cf the legislation governing the matter in the United Kingdom and Australia. Prior to 1844, the national status of married women in Great Britain was governed by the common law position. Under the common law of England, marriage had no effect on the nationality of a woman, although the legal position was not strictly adhered to in practice. This position applied in the United Kingdom and British possessions. The position of women was first modified by the Aliens Act of 1SS4, which provided that a foreign woman who married a British subject was deemed to be a naturalized British subject. The act did not, however, affect the status of British women who married foreigners, and legally such women retained their British nationality. In 1 870, the British Naturalization Act was enacted. Under that act, a married  woman was deemed to be a subject of the State of which her husband was a subject. Therefore, a British woman marrying a foreigner automatically lost her British nationality and acquired her husband&#39;s nationality, whilst a foreign woman marrying a British subject became ji British subject. It is not easy at this stage to state with any precision the considerations which actuated the British </para>
          <para class="block">Government to deviate from the common law principle in regard to the nationality of British women who married foreigners. The act was apparently introduced to give effect to the recommendations of the royal commission which was appointed in 1868 to inquire into the laws of naturalization and allegiance. There was little discussion on the bill, and it would appear that what was in the mind of the British Parliament was - (i) The law ought to be amended so as to make it conform more nearly with private international law and the principles governing the nationality laws of other countries; (ii) nationality as distinct from the right to hold property was not at that time considered of great practical importance; and (iii) except sentimentally, the legal status of the wife would not be altered by taking the nationality of the husband on marriage: British law remained in that position until 1914, when, with certain exceptions, the Nationality and Status of Aliens Act of the United Kingdom laid it down that the wife of a British subject was deemed to be a British subject, and the wife of an alien was  deemed  to be an alien. The two principal exceptions to the general rule were: (i) if a man ceased to be a British subject his wife would remain a British subject on making a declaration of retention of British nationality.; and (ii) a Britishborn woman whose husband was the subject of a State at war with  His  Majesty could, by making a declaration, regain her British nationality. In 1923, a joint select committee of the House of Lords was set up to consider the legal and practical aspects of questions involved in the possession by husband and wife of the same and different nationalities, and to report what, if any, alteration of British law was desirable. A number&#39; of important witnesses, including representatives of the Home Office, Colonial Office, Foreign Office, International Law Association and women&#39;s organizations, were examined, but the select committee was unable to agree as to the form of its report. </para>
          <para class="block">In Australia there, was no Commonwealth statute prior to 1904 dealing with nationality matters, and these were governed by State legislation - which, of course, was effective only in the State concerned. There was no uniformity iii the State laws in respect of the national status of married women, and generally their position was&#39; governed by the British naturalization lav; of 1870. The Naturalization Act which came into operation in the Commonwealth in 1904 gave to the Commonwealth Government control of nationality matters throughout Australia and. its territories. The only specific provision in that act in regard to women was in section 9, which provided that a foreign woman, upon marriage to a British subject, acquired British nationality by virtue of her marriage. The wife of an alien who became a naturalised British subject did not, however, acquire British nationality by reason of her husband&#39;s naturalization, but remained an alien unless she took out a certificate in her own name. The bill originally introduced contained a clause providing for the loss of British nationality by a woman marrying an alien, but this was deleted by the Senate, the expressed intention being to allow a British woman to retain her British nationality on marriage to an alien. According to a Crown law opinion given in 1910, however, a British woman who married an alien lost her British nationality because of the British Naturalization Act of 1S70. The Naturalization Act was repealed by the Nationality Act of 1920, which adopted Part II. of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act of 1914. Commonwealth law in regard to women was, therefore, the same as the United Kingdom law; that is, with- certain exceptions, the wife of a British subject was deemed to be a British subject and the wife of an alien was deemed to be an alien. In 1930, the Commonwealth of Australia was one of 45 nations represented at an international conference which met at the Hague under the auspices of the League of Nations, to consider certain questions relating to the conflict of nationality laws. The matters discussed included the national status of married women. As the result of its deliberations the conference agreed to an international convention to which the </para>
          <para class="block">Commonwealth was a party. The following articles were included in that convention :  - </para>
          <para class="block">Article8. - If the national law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality on marriage with a foreigner this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring her husband&#39;s nationality. </para>
          <para class="block">Article 9. - If the national law of the wife causes her to lose her nationality upon a change in the nationality of her husband occurring during marriage this consequence shall be conditional on her acquiring  her  husband&#39;s new nationality. </para>
          <para class="block">Article 10. - Naturalization of the husband during marriage shall not involve a change in the nationality of the wife except with her consent. </para>
          <para class="block">These articles have been embodied in our Commonwealth nationality law. </para>
          <para class="block">In  most civilized countries during recent years the trend has been to adopt a more liberal attitude in regard to the national status of married women, and in fact a number of countries including the United States of America, the Soviet Republics, Eire, and many South American countries have already placed women on an equal footing with men insofar as their nationality is concerned. The Canadian Government has also given a clear indication that it favours equality of treatment between men and women in matters of nationality. </para>
          <para>The bill now before the Senate does not entirely fulfil the Government&#39;s wishes, which are that a woman&#39;s nationality should not be dependent on that of her husband but that, equally with a man, she should have freedom of choice in so important a matter. Under the bill, a British woman who marries a foreigner will retain British nationality only in Australia and its territories. Outside the limits of the Commonwealth she maybe regarded as an alien if under the law of her husband&#39;s country she acquires his nationality. </para>
          <para>In explanation of this apparent  weakness  I  may  say that  at the  Imperial Conference of 1930 it was  agreedthat  no member would take any action affecting the &#34;common status&#34; possessed by all subjects of  His  Majesty, except by agreement with the other members, but that this did not debar any member of the British Commonwealth who desired to do so from conferring local rights within its territory on women who have ceased to be British subjects by marriage with aliens. All of the Dominions have adopted Part II. of the British Nationality and Status of Aliens Act, thereby ensuring uniformity of nationality laws throughout the British Commonwealth, and it would be necessary to secure the agreement of the governments of the United Kingdom and the other Dominions before an Australian woman who acquires a foreign nationality upon her marriage would be accepted as a British subject by those governments. For the present therefore the best that can be done for women resident in Australia is to make provision that in Australia and its territories they will not lose their British nationality because of marriage with a foreigner. The bill makes that provision. </para>
          <para>In asking the Senate tosupport the bill, the Government does not propose that the matter shall rest there. It is hoped that in the not far distant future representatives of the United Kingdom and Dominion governments will confer on various aspects of their nationality laws. The Commonwealth Government will then do its utmost to have brought into being a uniform provision throughout the British Commonwealth whereby a woman who marries shall be free to determine her own nationality. </para>

            <para>. - Honorable senators generally will be pleased to have an opportunity to read the statement made in the House of Representatives by the Minister for External Affairs <inline font-weight="bold">(Dr. Evatt)</inline> on the important subject of international affairs. </para>
          </talk.start>
          <para class="block">The paper embodying that statement may be regarded as one of the most important, documents that has been placed before us for many years. Those of us who had the privilege to be present at the Conference of the United Nations at San Francisco which began its sittings nearly twelve months ago baw followed with great interest the&#34; recital of what has been accomplished since in the realm of international relations. One has only to read through the statement made by the Minister, which contains an historical survey of international problems discussed over the last six months, to appreciate the enormous  ask  and the great, difficulties that must, have confronted Ministers responsible for- the external affairs policy of the nations of the British Empire in guiding the destinies of their countries throughout this difficult and complex period. I pay tribute 10 the officers of the Department, of External Affairs. They have not had long experience of diplomatic work, and they are overworked and underpaid. Nevertheless, :hey have worked like beavers, and, when we consider the problems that they have had to examine and pass judgment upon, we must acknowledge the great value of their services. The Minister for External Affairs has been very busy in the international sphere and has been entrusted with making decisions of the  greatest  possible importance to the future security of this nation and the peace of the world. I -believe that all honorable  senators  will agree that, with his special technical knowledge and flair for handling difficult problems, the Minister has been able to state Australia&#39;s case aggressively and hold his own in debate at international conferences.  1  do not necessarily agree with all of the views expressed by him, hut it would be unwise at this stage for anybody to be dogmatic nv. the subject, of international problems. We are building on shifting sands, and obstacles to be overcome are formidable.  1&#39;n  the course of his statement, the Minister said - </para>

            <para>The period since  VJ-Day  has been one of great historical importance. I think it is now recognized that during this period the status and prestige of Australia in international affairs have been dramatically increased. </para>
          </quote>
          <para class="block">I agree with that. Geographically, Australia has a prominent place in the world. </para>
          <para class="block">Therefore, it is important that this legislature should be supplied with up-to-date and reliable information so that it may lead public opinion along the right paths. </para>
          <para>I do not propose to deal in detail with the Minister&#39;s statement, because it is largely historical. My comments will deal in the main, with a. matter of judgment which is of very great concern to me. and should be of equal concern to every member of the  community  Perhaps the most pleasing feature of the first United Nations  conference  was the fact that the United States of America, with its enormous man-power resources and productive capacity, showed a genuine desire to do everything possible to secure the peace of the world. This fact was very gratifying in view of what happened after Word War I., when the United States Senate refused to allow that great democracy to take its place in the League of Nations. Because of &#39;.hat, mistake, 1 believe- that America and other nations have paid very dearly in loss of life and in other ways. The United States of America played a great part in saving Australia from invasion, when this country was  almost  occupied by the Japanese, and now we have every reason to be pleased tha&#39; it is co-operating closely with other English-speaking nations in working for peace. Australia&#39;s position in the councils of the world is more firmly established to-day than ever before. I am confident that one reason why the Minister for External Affairs was  able  to speak with authority at international conferences was the general &#39;recognition of the important part played by Australia&#39;s lighting men in both world wars. The feats of our armed services have helped Australia to improve its status considerably in recent years. Our forces are taking part in the occupation of Japan and elsewhere, and I hope that they will continue to do so. I consider that the Government displayed very bad judgment in making a last-minute decision to send a representative to the important first conference of the United Nations in London. It was most unfair to ask the Minister for the Navy <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Makin),</inline> at about three days&#39; notice, to pack his bags and arrive at the conference a week after it had started in order to occupy the very responsible position of  president  of the </para>
          <para class="block">Security Council. This appointment was a very great honour for Australia and, having regard to the enormous problems to be dealt with and the need for expert knowledge and research, an injustice was done to the Minister, and to Australia as a whole. There may have been reasons for the Government&#39;s tardiness, but it was nevertheless regrettable. Many complaints have been made regarding delay in making appointments to the Department of External Affairs. Work is accumulating in the department and it is difficult to obtain prompt decisions. I hope that the Government will take action to remedy this position. I am also at a loss to understand why the Government has not yet appointed a special representative to attend the Security Council now in session. This position calls for expert representation of Australia, and, as Australia will be a member of the council for three years, it is essential that the appointment should not be &#39; subject to change from day to day. I hope that the Minister will have something to say about this appointment, and indicate when it -will be made. T; is of very great importance. </para>

              <para>- I draw the honorable senator&#39;s attention to the fact that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Byrnes</inline> is representing the United States of America at the conference now in progress. I believe the matter to be so important as to warrant ministerial representation of Australia. I am very pleased that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> has decided to visit. Great Britain, and I hope that lie will have time to attend the peace conference. The problems of defence, international affairs, and peace are all so interwoven as to call for the best possible representation of Australia at international conferences. The Prime Minister, backed by. the prestige of his position, would enhance Australia&#39;s representation by attending such meetings. I sincerely trust that we shall be able to call a truce to &#39;all strikes and political warfare during the right honorable gentleman&#39;s absence so that he will not be obliged to make a hurried return to Australia, and will be able to give to international problems the time and attention that they deserve. We are to-day laying the foundation stone of the future world peace structure, and .we must not take the task too lightly. </para>

In my judgment, what was said by the Minister regarding Russia&#39;s attitude is not borne out by the facts. Actions speak louder than words. Honorable senators well know that there was an. agreement between Russia and other countries that it would vacate Persia, but it has not carried out its undertaking. We are entitled to know whether the Government still holds the view expressed by the Minister, or whether its opinion has been altered since the statement was made by him, because many people in this country are very anxious that at the present time we should not pursue a policy of appeasement in innernational affairs. </para>

          <para>I draw attention to another aspect of the Minister&#39;s statement which has a close relation to a matter of great importance to Australia. The Government should realize, as the Opposition has pointed out many times, that it is of the utmost importance to Australia from the defence point of view that there should be the greatest possible cooperation between this country and Great Britain and the United Statesof America. That co-operation is vitalto the defence of Australia and the future peace of the world. I accord my wholehearted support to the sentiments expressed by the Minister, but from time to time representatives of Australia have not always practised that co-operation with Great Britain and the United States of America which is most desirable in our own interests. It is obvious to a layman that for the next 100 years it will be necessary for Australia, with its population of 7,500,000, and for New Zealand with only 1,750,000 people, to depend for their defence largely on the help of Great Britain and the United States of America. The Minister further stated in his speech - </para>
          <quote>
            <para>The detailed means of implementing a security policy for the Pacific have yet to he decided, but this much is already apparent: Australian security is very largely dependent on our closest co-operation with the British Commonwealth and the United States of America. Any hindrance to the maximum degree of co-operation with either would be contrary to the interests of all these countries. </para>

          <para class="block">In view of that, statement, it is interesting to note, in reading the reports of meetings of the Security Council in connexion with the Persian problem, that t he Australian representative took a view opposite to that of Great Britain and flip United States of America. On the motion submitted by the Egyptian delegate that Persia be permitted to sit. at the Council table and make a statement without prejudice on the question of postponing consideration of the dispute, Colonel Hodgson, who represented Australia, voted with Poland against the proposal although it was supported by the representatives of eight other countries. </para>

              <para>- All I ask is whether the action of the Australian delegate in opposing Great Britain and the United States of America was taken on his own initiative. Does the Government justify his attitude, in view of the knowledge it possesses? I consider that his action was quite contrary to the sentiments expressed by the Minister for External Affairs inhis recent speech. I should not have mentioned this matter, had it not been for the fact that various reports which have been circulated in all parts of the world are doing considerable harm to Australia in Great Britain, the United States of America and other countries. After the Minister had made his speech in the House of Representatives, the Communist newspaper in GreatBritainthenext day,published four pages eulogizing him and one column criticizing the Prime Minister of Great Britain, although we are assured that the views expressed by the Minister on the Russian situation were approved by the Foreign Minister and the Government of Great Britain. If that be correct, it seems strange that we have had the sorry spectacle of a report which is not very comforting to the people ofAustralia who are anxious that the Dominions shall, within reason, support the MotherCountry in. important matters of this kind. </para>

          <para class="block">Those sentiments are not comforting. The people of Australia want to know where the Government stands in connexion with this matter. I trust that the existing differences will be settled amicably. I deplore that in the voting Australia and Poland were on- one side nml Britain and the United States of America on the other side. I trust that that will not be the future policy of our representatives. It must not be if we are to have that co-operation which will ensure to us the protection that we shall need in the next 100 years. I think that I can say in all fairness that Russia is the one nation of the 51 nations which has struck a discordant note. I have said before that the Russian way of life is not  our  way of life. I know that our delegates will say that, at the conference at San Francisco the representatives of all  countries  were tolerant and co-operative, with a genuine desire to dispose of difficulties and to keep all nations on the road  of  peace. It is quite obvious that if a great country like Russia is not in step with the other four permanent mem:  Iter- of  the Security Council, there will be very great trouble. The British and the Americans - in particular, the leaders who know all the facts - I am prepared to back in their attitude on this matter, as they have indicated it in the way in which they have voted. If the Government is not prepared to act similarly, it should state its reasons. I am putting (he matter fairly and squarely to the Government, and do not want it to dodge the issue. </para>
          <para>There is another important matter that has been shelved time and again It would appear that the political and military defence aspects of these problems have occupied so much time that so far Ministers have not been able to devote proper attention to economic problems, which are equally important. We can rem ember the peri od of international economic wa rf are after the last war. Unless, preventive action be taken in the early stages of peace we shall have the same trouble again. Honorable senators have had an opportunity to study the problem by a perusal of the pamphlet on the Bretton Woods conference in 1944. I regret that Ministers have shelved the matter by sending departmental officers to America, where they have been kept, for months and even years. Report after report has been received, but no action has been .taken. At such a time, Ministers themselves should- be in Washington. The Prime Minister of Canada, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mackenzie</inline> King, and the Prime Minister of Great Britain, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee,</inline> discussed these matters in America when the loan by the United States of America to Great Britain was being considered. Unfortunately, the Prime Minister of Australia could not be present at those discussions. The matter is being allowed to drag on too long. Australia, although it has a small population, has a very big export problem. Comparatively, we export an enormous volume of goods; consequently, we are vitally concerned with what other countries do in connexion with the depreciation of their currencies. The cardinal principle is to avoid the mistakes that were made after the last war. I regret that the Government is side-stepping the issue. Ministers are. not prepared to say whether they are for or against the Bretton Woods agreement or the establishment of an international bank and a fund to stabilize the currency. America gave to Australia an opportunity to make a decision before the 3.1st December, 1945. The Government has failed to act foi&#39; from eighteen months to two years, and now it is afraid to do so. In the interim, the. international organization has been established, officers have been appointed, and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Melville</inline> has been sent again to America merely as an observer to see what is happening. </para>

              <para>- My honorable friend has all the facts that he needs. What he and the Government lack are courage and the spirit of action. Many countries have approved of the agreement, believing that economic cooperation is just as important as military cooperation, and is the basis of the future peace of theworld. But Australia has not made a decision and, in common with Poland and Russia, is not a party to the agreement. Great Britain, the United States of America, and Canada, are  members of the organization. They say, &#34; If we are to play our part in the peace of the world, we have to accept our responsibilities in the economic world &#34;. There are two features of this report in respect of which a reply is demanded. The people of this country want leadership. First, are we prepared to back up our practical co-operation with America and Great Britain or to proceed along the lines we have been following recently? Secondly, do we intend toside-step the economic problems and obligations envisaged in the Bretton Woods agreement until after the next elections, meanwhile looking to the Minister for Transport <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Ward)</inline> to fight a rearguard action? </para>

              <para>- Our inspiration is in the reports that come from America time and again, stating that the Government of the United States of America, through its departmental officers, is appealing to Australia for a decision, but cannot get one. I have stated the two practical problems on which we need decisions. We are all looking forward to the most important conference of all - the pence conference. I trust that the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> will find the time to attend that conference with the Minister for External Affairs, in order that the matters which interest us, and will interest this part of the world for hundreds of years to come, will receive the best consideration that the host intellects in the Government can give to it. I trust that honorable senators opposite will forget party politics and will take a realistic view of the situation, doing their best in a practical way, first to co-operate with Great Britain, and secondly to ensure the peace of the world. I am convinced that no people in the world are more anxious for peace than are the people of the United Kingdom and the United States of America. </para>

            <para>. - Galvanized barbed wire is urgently needed by many primary producers, particularly in Tasmania. At present some rusty black barbed wire is being made available to them, but it is a waste of money to buy it In reply to representations, the Government has stated thai as soon asthe manufacture of ordinary fencing wire has caught up with the demand galvanized barbed wire will bo manufactured. In Tasmania, galvanized barbed wire is used as ordinary fencing wire, although that may not be so in the suburbs of Sydney and Melbourne.I appeal to the Government to give to farmers in all States equal opportunities to obtain galvanized barbed wire. In large pastoral areas, carrying one sheep to 10 acres, plain wire and wire netting may be ordinary fencing material, but galvanized barbed wire is used in Tasmania where the land carries ten sheep to the acre. </para>

          <para>I ask the Government to reconsider its decision not to continue theField Peas Board. The growers of field peas are practically 100 per cent. in favour of the continuation of the board and the guaranteed price until such time as the States can organize marketing control. Only by the. continuation of the present system can economic security be guaranteed to farmers for another season. In the meantime, the State governments would be able to make arrangements for the future. The Government would run no risk in continuing the present control, because  there is a world shortage of foodstuffs. Judging from the reports of those who havevisited European countries recently, the people there would be glad of a meal of peas. If Opposition members have any doubtastothe wishes of the growers of peas in this matter their doubts could be set at rest by arranging for a poll of growers to be taken. I am in constant touch with them, and Ihave no doubt. as to their views. Representations have been made to me by various organizations of farmers, and I have received letters, and telegrams from, and have had personal interviews with, individual growers who wish the board to be continued for another season. </para>
          <para>I askthe Government to lift the restrictions on the sale of ammunition to farmers and sportsmen. Owing to the prolific growth of feedin Tasmania, rabbits arel ikely to prove a tremendous pest. If ammunition couldbe released, farmers would have some hope of coping with this pest. </para>

If there is no longer any restriction on ammunition, I urge the Government to arrange for manufacturers of ammunition to switch over from the production of munitions to kill human beings to ammunition for the destruction of a pest which is doing much harm to Australian primary production.I ask also that themanufacture of rabbit traps, of which there is a great shortage, be accelerated. The destructionof rabbits will help the production of food which is urgently required ina famine-stricken world. </para>
