The late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> died at Washington, in the United States of America, on the 26th April American time. He had had a lengthy political and parliamentary career. He was elected to the House of Representatives for the Division of Bendigo, Victoria, at the general elections in 1939, and in that  House  he was a Temporary Chairman of Committees from  July,  1930,  to  November, 3931. He was elected to the Senate as a- Victorian senator at. the general elections in 1937, and was re-elected in 1943. In the Senate he was a Temporary  Chairman  of Committees from 1938 to 3940, and  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition in 193S and 1941. </para>

A State funeral was accorded the late honorable senator at Melbourne on tire 31st May. </para>
                    <para>The details of appointments and offices which have been recited exemplify that the late Minister had a distinguished political careel1, and that he took an important share in the work of governing this country, and guiding its policies through difficult .and. formative years. He has made a splendid contribution to the well-being of his country. Honorable senators will associate themselves with me when I pay tribute of a more personal nature to our ki.te colleague. It was my privilege to -work in close association with him over a period of years, when ho was  Deputy  Leader of the Opposition and I was the Opposition Whip. When he was Leader of the Government in the' Senate, 1! was  Deputy  Leader. Our relations were always cordial, as honorable senators will appreciate, when they recall his accessibility as a Minister, his u nfailing courtesy, and his ready assistance to those who approached him. Perhaps his most marked qualities were hi.1; energy and cheerfulness, and the delight he took in mixing with his fellow men.  His  passing is a great loss to the Government and a source of sadness to his colleagues. " Dick " Keane and his cheery greeting of " Halloo, brother," will be sadly missed, but his memory will not fade. I move - </para>

                        <para>. - I second the motion. I am sure it came as a great shock to all members of the Senate to learn of the sudden and tragic death of the late Minister for Trade and Customs and Leader of the Senate. I believe that this is the first time  in the history of the Senate that a Leader has passed away while holding that office. Most of the members of the Opposition have bad an opportunity to be associated with the late honorable senator) both when we were in office and when in opposition. He was forthright and courageous and had an abundance of common sense. As Leader of the Senate he was always cooperative and generous. Members of the Opposition have lost a worthy opponent, but, more than that they have lost a good friend. We shall remember him as " genial Dick ". I have had an opportunity of expressing our sympathy with his widow and family, and I commend the Government for its recognition of his services by honouring him with a State funeral, which I attended on behalf of the Opposition. </para>

                            <para>- The members of the Australian Country party in this chamber desire to be associated with the motion. The late Minister was one of the most popular members of this chamber, and he was esteemed- by honorable senators on both sides. He had served the public in both branches of the Commonwealth legislature. ., For some years he represented the Division of Bendigo in the House of Representatives. He was an able debater and .took a keen interest in this country's affairs.' When the. Government of which he was a member was formed he was , soon raised to the position of Leader of the Government in this chamber, and hedischarged the duties of that office with dignity and courtesy. He never. induced unnecessary debate with regard to bills presented to the Senate, and when amendments were submitted by the Opposition he knew how to say <inline font-style="italic">""No".</inline> He was respected by every honorable senator.  His  work was effective and he was a good administrator. He carried a heavy load of responsibility, which I have no doubt contributed largely to his death. The Australian Labour party is a great loser, because it has lost one' of , its staunchest members. The Senate also is a great loser, because it has lost a great Leader. To his widow and family we extend our sincere sympathy. </para>

                            <para>- lt was my privilege to be associated with our late Leader over a long period, both in industrial and political circles, and in this chamber. 1 When the late Minister began his career as a leader in the industrial movement 26 years ago, it was appreciated that he was destined to play an important part in the councils of the Australian Labour party. He made rapid progress. as a member of the administrative body of the Australian Bail ways Union. He became vice-president of the Victorian Branch of the organization, and afterwards, its  president.  In later years lie was general secretary , of the Australian. Railways Union. He played a prominent part in the work of securing improvement of the wages and industrial conditions of railway men throughout Australia. As the. chief advocate on behalf of that organization, he conducted one of the most lengthy Arbitration .Court cases that have come before that tribunal. The . completion of the case took some, years, and in the course of. its hearing hundreds of different types of workmen were dealt with. The late Minister dealt with the. log in a most efficient manner, and it was with much satisfaction. that his friends noted his election to the Commonwealth Parliament as the honorable member for Bendigo, and later to this chamber: The late Minister was a most likeable man, and although he held strong views, and expressed them fearlessly, in  both political and industrial spheres, there was not the slightest trace of" enmity in his make-up. However strenuous the political fight, and regardless of what might have been said in the heat of donate, " Dick " Keane met his opponents with a smile, and was always ready to return shaft for shaft; in the political battle -he displayed his keen sense of humour. I regret greatly th.e necessity for this motion.. We shall indeed miss him greatly. I regret the passing of a great man and extend to his widow and family my deepest sympathy. </para>

                            <para>-I cannot allow this occasion to pass without paying a tribute to my. friend and colleague, the late <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane.</inline> He has gone from among us, but he leaves in our minds only the pleasant memory of a man who was a friend to all of us. He was, of course, an opponent of mine in politics, but I always found him willina to examine views other than his own. No one, least of all the late Minister himself, would have called him a brilliant man,, but he was the epitome of sound common sense. He had a wider knowledge of his fellow mcn than is possessed by most people, and as a consequence he was able, not only to manage the members of his own party, but also to get on. well with those opposed to him in politics. As a "man of affairs and a capable negotiator, the deceased gentleman did a big job as a member of this chamber; he also did a big. job for Australia. I think that his qualities have been rather underestimated in the past.  His  last work was the biggest ever undertaken by him. As a personal friend of the deceased gentleman I am glad to know that before he died he had almost brought to a successful conclusion the biggest undertaking of his life- an accomplishment which will prove of lasting benefit to the- State which he represented and. to Australia as a whole. I shall miss him as a personal friend and also- as a man who was always willing to consider the views of others. Whenever he refused a request wc knew that it was not a personal matter at all, but that his decision was due to a difference of opinion on something over which he had no control. We shall miss his cheery' voice, and the public life of Australia will be the poorer for the passing of this man who to'ok such a prominent part in it. </para>
