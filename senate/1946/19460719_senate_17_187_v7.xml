                        <para>- Has the attention of the Minister for Supply and Shipping been drawn to an article appearing in this morning's <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> dealing with the acute shortage of panel steel in Australia and its probable effect on employment in the motor-body building industry? In view of the statement that only 40,000 tons of panel steel is available to the industry, and that its requirements in 1947 are estimated at 100,000 tons, is it the intention of the Government to agree to the importation of panel steel until the steel mills in Australia can supply the requirements of the industry? </para>

                 <para class="block"> In view of the unsettled future of the apple and pear industry, can the Minister representing the Minister for Commerce and Agriculture Bay whether the Governments of Western Australia and Tasmania have made representations to the Commonwealth Government for a renewal of the apple and pear acquisition scheme? If so, will the Minister, or the Government, negotiate with those two State governments for the introduction of complementary legislation in the Commonwealth and State parliaments concerned so as  to organize adequately for the stabilization of the apple and pear industry until such time as refrigerated shipping space is available for the free marketing of apples and pears? Is the Minister aware that, in the event of such legislative action being taken by the Commonwealth and the State governments mentioned, there will be no need to await the result of the referendum, which, I think, will be against the transfer of powers to the Commonwealth? </para>

                        <para>- It is true that the Governments of Western Australia and Tasmania have made representations to the Commonwealth Government on the subject matter of the honorable senator's, question, but it is not true that the referendum will have no effect, on any decision that the Commonwealth or State  governments concerned may make. To-day, we are acquiring apples and pears in two States, but that acquisition is being made under the Commonwealth's defence powers. The Government's future policy will depend entirely upon the result of the referendum. </para>

                            <para>- It is not unusual for persons to come to Canberra to interview Ministers, but they do not always get what they want. I take it that the purpose of such visits is to discuss matters with the responsible Minister. A lot has been said regarding a decision in respect of apples and pears, but I point out that in other years decisions regarding the acquisition of fruit have been made about October. There is still ample time for the Government to give sympathetic consideration to the representations of growers of apples and pears in Western Australia and Tasmania. </para>

I have already taken action to ensure the retention of supplies in Australia of certain components essential to industry, particularly in the manufacture of household fittings. Either a partial, or complete, embargo has been placed upon the exportation of such components. </para>

                            <para>- On the 26th June, Senator Aylett asked me, as the Minister representing the Acting Attorney-General, whether any action is contemplated against the Tasmanian Legislative Councillors who took fruit reported to be the property of the Apple and Pear Acquisition Board and distributed it to all and sundry. In reply, I now inform the honorable senator, that, provided the Crown Solicitor is satisfied that there is sufficient evidence to establish a prima facie case against them, proceedings will be instituted against the two Legislative Councillors in question. Considerable difficulty has been encountered in obtaining the necessary evidence to establish a case owing to the fact that, if the fruit were the property of the board, the suppliers and transporters of the fruit would be equally guilty with those who purchased or acquired it without proper authority and disposed of it. In those circumstances, it is only natural that there should be a conspiracy of silence amongst those concerned. The Government would Welcome any information that would enable the facts to be ascertained and, in the event of an offence being disclosed, will unhesitatingly proceed to prosecution as the law can, of course, be no respecter of persons. </para>

                        <para>- This question follows upon similar inquiriesmade by the honorable senator on Wednesday. It will be recalled that the honorable senator stated, when he asked his earlier questions, that 50,000 tons of housing materials were awaiting shipment at Newcastle. I asked him to indicate which State he had in mind. He later modified his question and said that 20,000 tons of materials were awaiting shipment to Victoria. I have had inquiries made, and I find that steel and housing materials awaiting shipment to Melbourne at Newcastle on the 11th July totalled 15,636 tons. The shipping space allocated to load this quantity was sufficient for 16,000 tons, so that only the current week's production of about 4,000 tons of materials is now to be catered for. This indicates that the information supplied to the honorable senator was not correct. I assure him that Victoria is receiving an equitable allocation of the shipping space available, not only for housing materials, but also for other requirements. </para>

                            <para>- It is not improbable that a vessel was at Newcastle from the 11th to the 18th July loading 5,000 tons of steel products. That quantity could not be loaded in a day, or even in 48 hours. As to the information which, the honorable senator says he has received from a reliable source, I assert that the information which I gave to the Senate this morning was absolutely, correct. Since I have been a member of the Senate I have never given information which was not correct, and I do not intend to. depart from that practice in the future. The honorable senator has evidently been misinformed. I assure him that the information that I gave to the Senate came from a more reliable source than that from which the information in his possession emanated. </para>

                            <para>- This vessel is 33 years old. It was on Navy charter during the war, and was to be returned from that service this month. Before the vessel could recommence its pre-war passenger and cargo operations, extensive alterations to crew accommodation and reconditioning would have been necessary. It? certificate will expire in February, 1947, when large-scale repairs must be undertaken. It will be clear that there would be little likelihood of <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba</inline> being used for any substantial period before the general return of requisitioned ships to owners occurs. To put the vessel in thorough order would require the use of repair facilities needed for more urgent work and would involve the Government in heavy expenditure, which would not be justified having regard to the limited contribution which the ship could make to Australia's needs. Upon consideration of the circumstances, the Australian Shipping Board approved of <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba's</inline> sale and transfer overseas. The engagement of a crew to take the ship overseas is a matter for the owners, who must make their own arrangements with the men they  engage.  There is no Commonwealth law dealing with the registration of ships. The Imperial Merchant Shipping Act 1894 is the relevant authority. Section 1 of the act sets out the qualifications for owning a British ship, which exclude foreigners. Section 21 provides that registration shall be closed immediately a ship is sold to a person not qualified to own a British ship. The registration of <inline font-style="italic">Katoomba,</inline> as a British vessel, therefore, automatically ceased when the sale by Mcllwraith McEacharn Limited was effected, as it is understood that the purchasers are not persons who are qualified to own a British ship. In Australia the Collector of Customs at each capital city port is the registrar of British ships, and marine branch surveyors carry out the actual measuring of ships and determine the tonnage. </para>

Will he arrange for an announcement to be made that all restrictions on the sowing of wheat will be removed until the close of the 1948-49 season, so that farmers may be able to plan ahead? </para>

                            <para>- The honorable senator's question appears to indicate that; he desires a measure of control to be exercised over the code of football to be played in the Australian Capital Territory. I am astonished that such a question should be asked by an honorable senator who is congenitally opposed to control of any kind. During portion of my term of office as Minister for the Interior there was a clash of interests between football codes. Personally, I prefer the national game; but, at the same time, I am patron of a rugby union club. However, I do not suppose that the honorable senator suggests that any Minister, either the Minister for the Interior or I, should take official action in this matter.  </para>

                    <para>.- Amendments and new clauses covering five printed pages were presented to. the Senate at a late hour last night, and obviously honorable senators have not had sufficient time to consider them. This seems to me to be an extraordinary way in which to conduct the business of this Parliament. A short examination of the amendments and new clauses before the Senate met this morning has resulted in a decision by the Opposition to move at least seven or eight amendments of our own. Probably if we had more time, we would be moving many more. In fairness to the committee, and also to the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> himself, more time should be allowed to consider these important proposals. I have only had time to notify the Postmaster-General of one of the amendments that the Opposition will move. We have at least seven others, and in the circumstances I suggest the postponement of consideration of this measure until the next day of sitting. </para>

                <para>This week honorable' senators discussed at length what had been done already for the re-establishment of ex-servicemen. Everybody acknowledges that the people want ex-servicemen, and others who served in combat areas, to be granted reasonable preference in employment. However, even if all of the Government's claims be true, its achievements fall far short of the promises that were made to these men. I appeal to the Minister to accept, the amendment. </para>

                    <para>.- The Minister has cut the ground from under his own feet. If the ^preference sought by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. Fraser is already provided for in the Reestablishment and Employment Act, what objection can there be to accepting his amendment? The Minister has -made a rocky bed for himself by providing for the establishment of a new commission to conduct the telecommunication services, instead of having the work done by the Postal Department, which would be the natural authority to do the job. If the services were conducted by the Postal Department, the employees concerned would be public servants. Under this bill, they will not be subject to the terms of the Commonwealth Public Service Act. The Minister did not say whether he favoured the principle of the amendment; he merely said that it might be redundant in view of the fact that the Reestablishment and Employment Act provides for preference to ex-servicemen. I cannot emphasize too strongly the desire of honorable senators on this side of the chamber to provide a fair deal for the men who fought for their country. The Minister's statement is not sufficient. Furthermore, we do not agree with it, because, we do not believe that the Reestablishment and Employment Act provides for preference in promotion, which is the object of the proposed amendment. T cannot understand the Minister's refusal to safeguard the welfare of the employees concerned by accepting the amendment. I ask him to be reasonable and, to change his mind. If he will accept the amendment, he will help to create in the minds of ex-service; nien a firm belief that the Senate is alive <inline font-style="italic">to</inline> their needs and is anxious to reward them for their services to the nation. </para>

                    <para>-. - The proposed amendment could very well be accepted by the Minister. The definition of " efficiency " which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> quoted goes reasonably far. It almost creates the opinion that complete preference will be given to ex-servicemen. I believe that to be the intention of the Government, and I know that the Postmaster-General is sincere and has ensured that, within his department, the true spirit of the Re-establishment and Employment Act shall be observed. I believe it is the Minister's intention to protect the rights of ex-servicemen. The clause provides that the efficiency and war service shall be considered, but the Opposition desires to know whether, if it came to a question of equality of efficiency, the ex-serviceman would be given preference. </para>

                    <para>. - When the last Government was in power, and a billwas before the Parliament to amend, the Australian Soldiers' Repatriation Act, a provision was included giving preference in employment to ex-servicemen, and at that time I opposed the insertion of the provision in the act because I considered that it would be out of place there. Subsequently, it was repealed, and full provision was made for preference . in the Re-establishment and Employment Act. The object was to have preference, whether it applied to ex-servicemen or to applicants for promotion, dealt with in one measure, in order to avoid confusion and conflict and provide uniformity of -procedure. Otherwise there would be* protracted litigation and unnecessary appeals to tribunals. </para>

During recent months I have had experience of the operation of the act referred to by the Minister, and it is because of that experience that I am concerned -that the proposed amendment shall be included in the bill. I know of instances of returned soldiers -with five years' service having been passed over, thereby losing seniority rights and other privileges. That happened, not in private employment, but. under administrations functioning under a State law. </para>

                        <para>- Yes. Nearly every ex-serviceman is at some disadvantage when he again resumes life as a civilian. Notwithstanding what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> has said, men who have had war service may experience difficulty in establishing their claim to efficiency. We on this side say that, if other things are considered to be equal, these men should not be required to state their case to an appeal - board; they have earned their right to preference. This is a matter of more than ordinary importance, because the Government is a partner in the company in which employment will be offered. It is not only our duty, but also our privilege, to set an example in this matter. We should let the people of Australia know where we stand in regard to preference to ex-servicemen. If as the Minister has said, there are some doubts about the matter let us remove them and establish the principle of preference clearly. Had the things we know now been known to the Parliament when legislation relating to ex-servicemen was under consideration, action which would have rendered the proposed amendment unnecessary might have been taken. </para>

                        <para>- It does not go far enough. I ask the Minister to give serious consideration to the amendment, because it is quite possible, for his action to be misunderstood. I think that he desires to make it clear that he stands for preference to ex-servicemen. If that is so, he should accept the amendment and make the position clear beyond any doubt. </para>

                        <para>- The amendment is not necessary, because the preference which' it seeks to grant is provided for in legislation already on the statute-book. That legislation may yet affect those who to-day clamour that preference .shall always be given to returned servicemen. It has been said that men have lost their lives on the battle-fields. That did happen in both world wars. It is also true that many of the men who gave their lives in the cause of freedom had sons who, when they grew up and sought employment, could not obtain it because of legislation providing for - preference to returned soldiers. Other men who fought were maimed, or have ill health as the result of their war service. Some of them also had sons. But although those men suffered greatly and had made tremendous sacrifices their sons could not get employment because they were not returned soldiers. I arn mindful of these things when people try to make a political football of preference to ex-servicemen. Others in the community are victims of infantile paralysis, and could not serve with the armed forces. They cannot obtain employment because they are not. returned soldiers. Are not these people also entitled to sympathetic treatment? I know many soldiers and I associate with ex-servicemen. From the genuine soldiers I have learned lessons in perseverence and courage. Many returned servicemen would scorn to think that the positions to which they have been appointed had been handed to them on a plate because of some law entitling them to preference for appointment to positions which they could not obtain by reason of their a-bility and fitness to occupy them. A- man of valour cannot take pride in anything gained in that way. The Government will ensure that employment is provided for ex-servicemen, but I earnestly , Dray that it will be mindful also of the sons of soldiers, cripples and their sons, and boys and girls growing up in the community, who, in the years ahead, will be called upon to do many things for their nation, either in war or in peace. I hope that nothing will be done to interfere with their chances to become  capable technicians or professional men. 1 hope that all those things will be done. T do not like to see the ex-servicemen made a political football. That is what happened to the invalid and old-age pensioners. We should not treat the ex-serviceman in that fashion. The Government has made provision for preference in employment to ex-service personnel for a period of seven years, and that fully meets their requirements. </para>

                    <para>. - I ' agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator A.</inline> J. Fraser when he says that the Government should set an example to the people of Australia. That is exactly what it intends to do. It has vividly in mind the gross injustices to which ex-servicemen were subjected after World War I. It has vividly in mind the fact that both Commonwealth and State Governments at that time were remiss in their duty to ex-service personnel. I shall  cite two examples. In 1924 many returned soldiers, picked men who were highly decorated, were dismissed from the Victorian police force because they had the temerity to protest against what were admittedly unjust conditions. All of those men were discharged, but their places were not filled by returned soldiers.. In 1928, approximately 2,800 returned soldiers of World War I. were deprived; of the means of earning a livelihood on. the waterfront in Victoria and South Australia. </para>

                        <para>- That happened in 1928. Included among the supporters of the Government are ex-servicemen with distinguished records who remember all those things. It is not my desire to hold any post mortems, but it is necessary for me to direct attention to those facts in order to convince honorable senators opposite, if that be possible, of the sincerity of the Government in its resolve to see that experiences of the kind I have mentioned shall not be repeated in the future. The Government has already enacted the Reestablishment and Employment Act, which in my judgment provides all that is required. If necessary, that legislation can be amended to meet any development in the future. The. amendment, if carried, would place the commission's officers in a more favorable position than members of the Commonwealth Public Service, and officers of other Commonwealth authorities, such as, the Commonwealth Bank. If preference is to be applied to promotions as well as to new appointments the proper course to take would be to amend the Re-establishment and Employment Act, in order that the amendment shall operate generally and not be limited to officers of the commission. If there be any doubt about how far we can go in that respect under this measure it is quite competent to prescribe by regulation that war service shall be taken into account in determining seniority. The last clause of the bill empowers the Minister to make regulations for such purposes. The Government has given convincing evidence that it stands solidly behind ex-service personnel, and that it will ensure that ex-service personnel receive justice and the consideration to which they are entitled. Therefore, it can be taken for granted that should the commission do anything which, in the opinion of the Government, constitutes an injustice to ex-service personnel, the Government has power by regulation to instruct the commission to act in accordance with the requirements contained in the amendment. </para>

                    <para>. -Whilst  some of the statements made by the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> astonish me, I welcome others that he has made. But if he believes all he said to be correct he robs the submissions of <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Finlay</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Amour</inline> of all value; because earlier in the debate he indicated that his only objection to my amendment was that it was redundant as such provision was already made elsewhere. Now, he says that if the amendment be carried it would place other public servants at a disadvantage. I have no doubt that he is sincere when he says that he desires to ensure that the fullest degree of preference shall be given to ex-service personnel. That being so, the Minister should either accept my amendment, or go further than he has yet been prepared to go and give a definite undertaking on behalf of the Government that a full measure of preference will be provided for by regulation. </para>

                    <para>. -  If I were called upon to interpret the preference provisions of the Re-establishment and Employment Act, I should say that they applied to -promotions. However, it does not necessarily follow that anybody else, acting in the capacity of a judge in the matter, would interpret those provisions as I do. The same approach is not made by every judge in such matters. Holding that view I consider that the amendment is redundant. If the clause be passed as drafted the commission shall be placed in exactly the same position as the Commonwealth Bank and other similar authorities. I repeat that, in my judgment, every provision is made to meet the wishes of the honorable senator. Therefore, I cannot accept the amendment. </para>

                        <para>- The Minister has already said that; but the purpose of the regulation-making power is something quite different from the principle involved in this matter. The Minister will remember that under the Reestablishment and Employment Act preference in employment to ex-service personnel is limited to a period of seven years. Of that period one year has already expired, and I have no doubt that a couple of years will elapse before this proposal is implemented, because the negotiations with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and other companies involved in the proposals will continue for a considerable period. </para>

The next government will be composed of members of the present Opposition parties and we shall have a say in this sort of thing. One thing we shall alter if we are elected is the present very limited preference in employment to ex-service personnel. Although, in many cases, members of the fighting services served for six years they are to be given preference in- employment for only a similar period. That is small recompense to such men who have fought for so long in defence of the country.

                        <para>- I know; but it is only lip service to say that there is a rehabilitation act on the statute-book and then provide that everybody else in the community shall be placed on the same footing as ex-service personnel. The Government's action abnegates the statement by honorable senators opposite that they support preference in employment to ex-service personnel. Much still remains to be said on this measure. Therefore the Minister would be wise to accept my earlier suggestion to postpone its consideration. If he does so, the bill will be clarified and will be passed much more quickly. </para>

                        <para>- I am not concerned with the exact number of days, but a limit should be imposed. When an officer is promoted he should not be kept on tenter-hooks for perhaps twelve months awaiting appeals against his promotion. Obviously such a state of affairs would not make for efficient service. This matter is much more serious than the Postmaster-General would have  us believe. I ask the honorable gentleman to remember that the acceptance by the committee of the Government's proposals will not be the end of this legislation so far as the Parliament is concerned. The Senate's amendments will have to be considered by the House of Representatives. It would be wise, therefore, for the Postmaster-General to ensure that the measure .is as near perfect as possible when it leaves this chamber. </para>

                    <para>. -  Apparently honorable senators opposite will never be satisfied with what they are told by Ministers in charge of bills. Sub-clause 1 provides that after a position has been declared vacant and an appointment made to it, the officer promoted shall serve in a temporary capacity without increased pay until his appointment has been confirmed. Subclause 3 provides that the manner in which, and the time within which appeals may be made against promotions, may be prescribed by regulations. I point' outthat some employees of the commission may be working outside Australia. If a position which such an employee is competent to . fill by reason of his seniority and efficiency becomes vacant, he should have equal opportunity with employees working within the Commonwealth, to be promoted to that position. Each employee should have the right to apply for a vacancy, provided that he has had the ' requisite length of service and possesses the ability to fill the position. The honorable senator's proposal leads me to believe that he does not understand the bill. </para>

                    <para>.- The only reference in the bill to a period of time is to a period of twelve months. This would be too long for cases such as we have in mind. Tie rights of officers should be protected. A man should not be called upon to carry out higher duties indefinitely withoutextra remuneration. It is equally important that officers who appeal against a promotion should have their claims dealt with within a reasonable period. I again ask the Minister to state definitely that regulations will be issued and to indicate what period will be specified- in them. </para>

                    <para>. -  The honorable senator is under  a misapprehension. The regulations to be promulgated under -this clause will be based on those which at present apply to appeals within- the Commonwealth Public Service. The- usual period specified is 21 days, but provision will be made, if necessary, for exceptional .circumstances'. 1 see no need to worry about this matter. </para>
