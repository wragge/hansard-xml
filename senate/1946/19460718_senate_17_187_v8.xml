If not, will the Government give favorable consideration to the use of Leigh Creek coal by the Commonwealth Railways Department? </para>

                            <para>- When the Leigh Creek coal-field was first opened the Commonwealth Government assisted the Government of South Australia in every way possible. At that time I was Minister for the Interior, and was interested in  the development of the field as a means of providing coal for use by the Commonwealth Railways Department. I remember that the department, in order to assist the development of the field, made drastic reductions of freight charges. It was estimated that 800 tons of coal would be conveyed daily to Port Augusta by rail. That decision was made following a visit to Canberra by the Premier of South Australia, Mr. Playford. In addition, Commonwealth officers and technicians assisted in investigations to ascertain what alterations, if any, would be required to locomotives so that Leigh Creek coal, which is of different quality from Newcastle coal, could be used. Beyond that, I am unable to speak from my own knowledge, but I shall be pleased to bring the honorable senator's question to the notice of the Minister, for the Interior  who, I am sure, will supply the information sought. </para>

Following the termination of that contract, and with a view to easing the rationing of motor tyres, will the Minister approach the United Kingdom Government with a view to increased quantities of Malayan rubber being diverted to Australia ?</para>

I understand that question time in the Senate to-day and to-morrow will be re-broadcast over the national alternative network between 7.20 p.m. and 7.55 p.m. on those days. I understand, also, that question time in the Senate and also in the House of Representatives will be re-broadcast over the short-wave system. I now ask whether you and the other Senate representatives on the Parliamentary Proceedings Broadcasting Committee will, at its next meeting, advocate that the whole of question time in both Houses shall be rebroadcast between the times mentioned? </para>

However, the Government is giving attention to this matter at present, and will make an announcement as soon as possible. </para>

                                <para>- I did receive a deputation in regard- to this matter, and the request referred to by the honorable senator was made. An alien with twelve months' residential qualification may qualify for unemployment or sickness benefit, but it does not necessarily follow that an alien would receive a higher rate of benefit than an ex-soldier in receipt of a war pension. For both unemployment benefit and sickness benefit the amount of a war pension is taken into account as income, and where the income is in excess of the exemption of Â£1 a week such excess is deducted from the benefit of Â£1 5s. a week. Thus the ex-soldier may receive a total of Â£2 5s. a week by way of benefit plus income - including war pension. If his war pension is Â£1 10s. a week, the rate of benefit is 15s. a week. The position in regard to income is the same in respect of other beneficiaries. The alien mentioned could thus receive benefit of Â£1 5s. a week if he had no income or income not exceeding Â£1 a week. Any income in excess of Â£1 a week would be deducted from the amount of his benefit. More often than not, the alien would have no income and would therefore receive only the benefit of Â£1 5s. a week, whereas the ex-soldier, even if eligible for less than the maximum benefit of Â£1 5s. a week, would receive by way of benefit plus income a total of Â£2 5s. a week. In the event of an ex-soldier claiming .a sickness benefit in respect of the same incapacity for which he is receiving a war pension, the amount of the war pension would be deducted from the rate of sickness benefit otherwise payable. As sickness benefit is payable only in respect of temporary incapacity, this position would scarcely arise in the case of a limbless soldier. </para>

If so, will he advise us when we  may  expect that measure to be introduced?

                                <para>- The Government contemplates introducing, upon its return  following the termination of the life of the present Parliament, a measure to consolidate the whole of our social service legislation. The consolidation is under consideration at present and the drafting of the measure has practically been completed, subject to consideration of various representations which are still being made to me and the departments under my control. I undertake to give consideration to the representations of the Western Australian Pensioners League as suggested by the honorable senator. I agree that many anomalies exist in our social service legislation, and we hope to rectify them. At present, the Government hesitates to embark upon that consolidation as it lacks a proper constitutional basis for a good deal of the contents of the legislation. We hope that that difficulty will be remedied with the return of the Government following the taking of the forthcoming referendum. </para>

                    <para>. - <inline font-style="italic">by leave</inline> - I appreciate greatly the exceedingly kind remarks made by the Leader of the Opposition (Senator McLeay). It is essential that he should mention that he does not share my political views. Sometimes, I am inclined to believe that he does, because on occasions one might be led to believe  that he is a leader speaking from the wrong side of the chamber. It would be idle for me to suggest that I am not pleased to be given the opportunity to represent the Government at the International Labour Conference which is to open at Montreal towards the end of September. I shall be very pleased to carry out my official duties and any others which may be allotted to me. However, I shall certainly not be silent upon the advantages which this great country offers to migrants. If there is one land of opportunity in the world we, certainly, are living in it. We are very privileged individuals indeed to be able to live in Australia and members of this Parliament, particularly of the Senate, are doubly privileged. I shall lose no opportunity to boost Australia whenever and wherever I can. I thank him for his kind remarks. </para>

The plan to which Mr. Marshall (the Minister for Transport, Western Australia) raised so many objections on behalf of his State, provided for approximately 70 per cent, of the total cost to be borne by the Commonwealth and as the remaining 30 per cent, was to be met by the five mainland States on a <inline font-style="italic">per capita</inline> basis, the greatest contribution would be made by the more populous States.

                    <para class="block">The preamble to this bill indicates broadly its purpose, namely, to give effect to the recommendations of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference, held in London in July and August, 1945, and attended by representatives of the governments of the United Kingdom, the </para>
                    <para class="block">Dominions, India and Southern Rhodesia. These governments are invariably referred to as the' " partner governments " in practically all documents relating to Empire agreements on telecommunication matters, and I shall also use that term for the purpose of simplicity. The recommendations made by the London conference contemplate the transference to national ownership and control of the overseas telecommunication services of the British Commonwealth and Empire, together with the adoption of certain measures designed to promote their efficiency and to co-ordinate the activities associated with their operation and development. It is desirable to mention, at the outset, that the conclusions of theconference were reached only after thecommunication companies at present responsible for the conduct of the services were afforded an opportunity to state" their views on the reorganization of the Empire's telecommunication systems. The conference recommendations have been approved by all the partner governments, and this fact in itself carries its own significance. The plan proposed was not merely a compromise, but was a constructive plan worked out in the public interest by a body of able men representative of all self-governing countries in the Empire. </para>
                    <para>Before I proceed to give to honorable senators a general outline of the plan under which the governments' intend to acquire the external telecommunication assets from private interests and " to operate and maintain the services as national undertakings, it is necessary to refer briefly to the circumstances which led to the evolution of this plan and to the justification for its adoption. To enable a full appreciation to be gained of the position which has arisen in this respect, it is also essential to recount the developments which have occurred since the Imperial Wireless and Cable Conference of 1928 was convened by the partner governments. Over the years since the earliest use of electrical communication the British Commonwealth and Empire had built up a world-wide system of telegraphy based originally on submarine cables. The introduction of the shortwave radio-telegraph service between Great Britain and Canada in 1926, and  the opening of similar services between Great Britain and Australia, South Africa and India in 1927, presented a serious financial problem to the associated cable companies responsible for the  opera-tion  and maintenance of the extensive system of submarine cables linking the Empire countries and connecting with foreign countries. The beam wireless services in Great Britain were, at the time of their inception, conducted by the British Post Office, and the terminal stations in Canada, Australia, South Africa and India were conducted by local wireless companies licensed by the Dominion and Indian governments. The cost of erecting and maintaining the stations and equipment required for the conduct of these beam wireless services was very much less than that involved in laying and maintaining submarine cables over extensive ocean routes. The overhead expenses of operating the cable services were therefore much heavier than those of competing beam wireless services. The greater capital outlay necessary for the laying of submarine cables naturally meant proportionately heavier charges for interest, while the cost of maintaining and renewing them after they had been laid was by no means light. Consequently, it was found possible to apply lower charges to messages transmitted over the beam services to Australia, South Africa and India, than to cablegrams. </para>
                    <para>Before the inauguration of the beam services, the cable undertakings were working with a large margin of annual surplus. The lower rates charged at the outset for messages handled over the beam channels had, however, resulted in a substantial diversion of traffic revenues from the cable to the beam services. It was apparent, too, that the lower charges for messages handled by the beam services were still capable of being substantially, reduced and yet of yielding a handsome return on the capital invested in these services. It is an ordinary commercial principle that the charges made for services cannot be lower than the cost of providing them. The cable organizations were therefore faced with an apparently insoluble economic problem. In effect, the beam wireless undertakings were in a position to undercut cable rates and, if competition were unrestricted, to render the cable systems unremunerative. The situation was fraught with such grave consequences to the Imperial cable interests that the partner govern'ments, convinced that retention of the cable system was necessary for both strategic and commercial reasons, were impelled to convene a conference in London in 1928 to examine the problem and to make recommendations with a view to a common policy being adopted. Information was laid before the conference that, if competition between the beam wireless and the cable services were allowed to continue without remission, the cable companies might be pressed to go into liquidation at once and distribute their large reserves among their shareholders rather than remain in operation and dissipate their resources. In such an event, it seemed possible that Empire cable assets might be acquired by certain foreign interests which had, on more than one occasion, exhibited a keen desire to secure an increased share in the control and operation of world communications. </para>
                    <para>It was evident that such a state of affairs could not be viewed by the partner governments with equanimity. Many parts of the Empire, besides the foreign countries served by the British cable system, were not, and could not be for some considerable time, catered for by wireless services. Wireless services, moreover, were subject to fading and occasional prolonged interruptions, which would have resulted in serious delays to traffic if the cables were not available. Furthermore, the cables were "secret", but in the mass of messages transmitted by radio there was always the risk of interception and also, in time of war, of jamming by a hostile power. The 1928 Imperial Conference accordingly considered various means by which the governments might deal with the situation, and ultimately it reached the conclusion that the best solution of the problem was to secure a fusion of Empire cable and wireless interests, so that unity of operation and direction might be attained over the whole field of British telecommunications. By this means, continuance of the cable system would be assured, economies could be effected, and the creation of a common purse and a common interest would leave the union free to devote its united energies to resisting encroachment on the part of foreign competitors. </para>
                    <para>Upon the recommendation of the conference, a fusion of cable and wireless interests was therefore effected in GreatBritain in 1929, the Eastern and Associated cable companies being merged with the Marconi Wireless Telegraph Company. A new company, now known as Cable and Wireless Limited, was given a charter to operate the whole of the overseas cable and radio-telegraph services in Great Britain. It acquired the entire cable .system interconnecting the Empire, including the formerly government owned Pacific cable undertaking and the Imperial Atlantic - cables. A lease of the four beam wireless telegraph stations in Great Britain, then owned by the British Post Office and communicating with Canada, India, South Africa and Australia, was also granted to the now company. The radio-telephone services, however, remained with the British Post Office. As the amalgamation referred to virtually constituted a privately owned monopoly, the governments devised ways and means whereby the public interests would be safeguarded. As the undertaking was one which closely concerned the several parts of the Empire, it was deemed essential that the governments should have a voice in the direction of the policy of that undertaking. A body known as the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee, later called the Commonwealth Communications Council, was therefore established. This body comprised representatives of all of the Empire governments, and the new company was required to consult this body on all matters' of policy, including any alteration of rates. Indeed, it. was stipulated that no increase of the rates prevailing at the date of the formation of the merger company could be made except with the assent of the Advisory Committee; nor could the company discontinue any service without the approval of the committee. </para>
                    <para>Although the capital shareholdings of the merger companies amounted in 1929 to -more than Â£53,000,000, it was stipulated that the capital of the company responsible for operation of the tele communication services should 'not initially exceed Â£30,000,000. As a corollary to handing over to private enterprise the conduct of public services, and in order that there should be an effective method of ensuring that the users of the services should not be exploited for the benefit of the shareholders in the private undertaking, a standard net revenue of Â£1,805,000 was fixed, representing approximately six per cent, on the capital of Â£30,000,000, all net revenues in excess of that sum to go, as to 50 per cent., to the. company, and. as to 50 per cent., to the reduction of rates, or such other purposes as the Advisory Committee might approve. Two other provisions were that British control of all the companies must be guaranteed, and that the governments  might  assumecontrol of the cable and wireless systems in time of war or other emergency. In a brief summary, the objectives of the scheme were (i) To secure as far as was possible all the advantages to be derived from unification of direction and operation of the services; (ii) at the same time to preserve for the governments concerned control over the unified undertaking which had been created so as to safeguard "the interests of the public in  general and cable and wireless users in particular; and (iri) to secure these desiderata at a minimum of cost to the governments concerned. But there was one obligation which the partner governments agreed to observe, so far as lay within their powers, and consistent with the exercise of their sovereign rights, and that was to refrain from   sanctioning the  opening of any additional radio-telegraph circuits, ' which might result in a diversion of traffic, and therefore of revenues, from the new merger company. This obligation, fully justified as it wa3 at the time it was accepted, had  inherent   in it, as subsequent events have proved, the seeds of future difficulties and misunderstandings. </para>
                    <para>It may be interesting at this stage to state what the position was in Australia in 1928, when the Imperial Conference made its recommendations. The cable undertakings were well established here and Australia was served with submarine cables to the north, the west and the east of the continent. Amalgamated </para>
                    <para class="block">Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the local company, in which the Commonwealth Government had, and still has, more than a 50 per cent, shareholding, had been authorized to establish, maintain and operate radio-telegraph communications between Australia and other parts of the world, and the company possessed, and still has, a complete monopoly in this respect. With considerable enterprise the local company had played a notable part in the development of its wireless communication services, and was keen to establish more and more direct  radiio  telegraph services between Australia and other countries. But, in the light of the decisions made in 1928, the Australian Government, having regard to its obligation, in common with other responsible governments of the Empire, to refrain from authorizing additional radio telegraph services which might divert revenues from the British merger company and its associates, was obliged to refuse the licences which Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited sought. This situation, as honorable senators know, caused local difficulties in Australia. </para>
                    <para>The 1928 conference had suggested that increased benefits would be derived from the British merger plan if the Dominion and Indian Governments were to apply the principles of the scheme to their local cable and wireless undertakings. Steps were taken subsequently to form local cable and wireless merger companies in India and South Africa, but, in the case of Australia, government policy had in the meantime expressed itself in favour of nationalization of the overseas telecommunication services, in alinement with the domestic policy whereby similar internal services were being operated by the Postal Department. In Canada, also, a merger of overseas cable and wireless interests was not effected. Both in Australia and in Canada the position was met for the time being by joint purse agreements negotiated between the respective cable and radio companies, under which a pooling and sharing of traffic revenues was arranged on an agreed basis. A merger of cable and wireless interests in Australia was negotiated by Cable and Wireless Limited and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in 1930. but the govern- ment of the day refused to sanction this merger agreement, in view of its policy for complete national ownership of the wireless services. </para>
                    <para>Since 1930, successive governments have given consideration to the means whereby a cable and wireless merger might be established at the Australian end, in conformity with a generally accepted policy that these services should be nationalized. It was expected that many advantages would accrue from SUe a unification of the cable and wireless services in Australia in that, apart from facilitating the movement of traffic" and its distribution over the alternative routes available, substantial economies would be possible in the conduct of the services,' since the overhead charges involved in the maintenance of two separate organizations, cable and radio respectively, in the Commonwealth might be expected to be reduced considerably, if the whole of the overseas telecommunication services were conducted by the one authority. Notwithstanding the endeavours made to implement the Government's policy, however, no finality was reached, and, in order to overcome the impasse that subsequently developed, an alternative scheme envisaging an amalgamation of the two overseas undertakings in Australia in a new telecommunications company was approved by the Menzies Government in 1941, and later was accepted also by the Curtin Government. This scheme provided for a tripartite partnership in which provision was made for predominant government control in the ownership and operation of the overseas telecommunication services. Heads of agreement were drawn up early in 1943 between the Government and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) 'Limited. Efforts were later made to secure the participation of Cable and Wireless Limited in the scheme, but negotiations broke down. </para>
                    <para>I turn now to review the results which followed the merger of overseas cable and wireless services in Great Britain in 1929. Although this merger was recognized as a notable step in advancing the interests of Empire communications as a whole, it failed in some respects to achieve the results which the 1.928 conference had confidently expected. The first difficulties encountered were of a financial nature. Soon after the formation of Cable and Wireless Limited in 1929, a world-wide trade depression reduced the traffic receipts of the company to an extent which seriously prejudiced its financial standing, with the consequence that the company approached the Imperial Communications Advisory Committee with proposals involving substantial increases of overseas telegraph tariffs. In view of the severe burden which an increase of rates would have imposed on telegraph users in a time of financial stress, and the doubt as to whether higher rates would effect an improvement in the position, the Empire governments accepted the recommendation of the Advisory Committee that an independent inquiry should be held into the administration and conduct of the company's affairs. </para>
                    <para>This committee of inquiry, .which was formed in England in 1931, concluded that there was need for modifications in the management of the company and in several other directions, including a writing down of its capital; that there should be a revision of the obligations imposed upon the company in respect of maintaining cables which were required for strategic purposes only; that justification existed for a reduction of the personnel of the company, as well as in salaries and wages; and that there should be a general overhaul of the company's activities with the object of effecting economies. The annual profits earned by the company continued to be so relatively low that the dividends paid to its shareholders were reduced in two successive years to 5s. for each Â£100 of share capital, instead of Â£6 per cent, as contemplated under the British merger plan. In 1935 the company considered its position so serious that it approached the United Kingdom Government with a view to the arrangements entered into in 1929 being revised, mainly in order that the financial disabilities under which the company waa labouring might be eased. </para>
                    <para>It became clear that something had to be done if the company were to emerge from its financial difficulties; and on the recommendation of the Advisory Committee, the United Kingdom Government ultimately agreed to cancel the annual rental of Â£250,000 which had been paid by the company in respect of its lease of the four beam stations in Great Britain and to grant it a freehold of these stations. In return for this and other concessions, the United Kingdom Government was allotted a Â£2,600,000 shareholding in the company. This arrangement  involved a substantial sacrifice by the British 'Government in terms  of annual revenues derived by it, since the beam rental of Â£250,000 considerably exceeded the annual return which might be expected by that Government from its newly acquired shareholding in the company. ' </para>
                    <para>The standard net profit of Â£1,865,000, fixed in 1929, was reduced to Â£1,200,000 - equivalent to 4 per cent, on the capital investment, instead of 6 per cent, as previously determined. This, in effect, had much the same result as would have been secured by a writing down of the company's capital. These financial readjustments were applied in 1938, following a conference of representatives of the Empire governments and the company in 1937. Consequent upon these revised arrangements, and as a result of an appreciable improvement of the revenues of Cable and Wireless Limited during the intervening period, the company, in cooperation with the governments, introduced a far-reaching scheme for the reduction of telegraph rates between Empire points. This scheme was put into effect early in 1938. The reduction of rates referred to was estimated to represent an overall benefit of Â£500,000 sterling per annum to the telegraph users throughout the Empire. Apart from the immediate sacrifice of revenue entailed under the scheme to Cable and Wireless Limited, and to the communication companies in the Dominions and India, the internal telegraph administrations controlled by the governments also contributed by reducing their component charges on inter-Empire telegrams. It had been anticipated that the initial revenue loss occasioned to the Empire communication companies and telegraph administrations by reason of these rate reductions would subsequently be offset to a great degree by the receipts from increased traffic loads engendered by the cheaper tariffs. Before the effect of the new rate scheme could be fully gauged, however, the second world war intervened. </para>
                    <para>During World War II. the volume of governmental and other overseas telegraph traffic increased enormously and the revenues of Cable and Wireless Limited and the ' other communication companies in the Dominions and India soared to Unprecedented levels. Cable and Wireless Limited was able to pay the standard dividend of 4 per cent. . to its shareholders during each of the years 1939 to 1944, while still leaving substantial balances for diversion to reserve, funds to cover war taxation* and other contingencies, including .provision for meeting future rate reductions in accordance with the arrangements agreed with the governments in 1929. World War IL, however, brought many other telecommunication problems and difficulties in its train, for both the governments and the company. These problems were considered initially at a conference of Empire representatives held in Canberra in December, 1942, and later at a meeting c-f the Commonwealth Communications Council hel.d in London in April and May, 1944. The chief problem for consideration arose from the establishment during the war of direct radiotelegraph circuits between  certain Empire countries, including Australia and the United States of America. An important point of policy in the scheme evolved by the 1928 conference was effected by this development. As I- have mentioned previously, the partner governments had agreed, in order to preserve a balance between, the cable and radio services, that they would resist the opening of new direct wireless services which would compete with the Empire cable system. The governments had adhered to this policy until 1941, notwithstanding continued pressure by interested foreign companies and governments for the opening of direct radio circuits between their countries and Empire points. Chief among those countries was the United States of America.- Before the war. the only points in the Empire with which -the United States of America had direct radio-telegraph communication were  the United Kingdom, the </para>
                    <para class="block">Bahamas and British Honduras. All telegraph traffic between other Empire points and the United States of America was transmitted over the Empire network. On the entry of the United States of America into the war, however, the Government of that country had made an irresistible case for the establishment,, as a war measure, of direct radio communication with a number of Empire points, particularly in those areas where United States of America forces were operating. Cable and Wireless Limited, when consulted by the Advisory Committee, objected strongly to the establishment of these direct radio-telegraph circuits, on- the ground that they were a departure from the policy agreed by the governments in 1928 and reaffirmed in 1937, and the company claimed that if these circuits were established it should, be compensated for any loss of revenues. It was impossible, in the circumstances of World War II., for the Empire governments to do other than accede to the request of the Government of the United States of America, and, accordingly, certain direct radio-telegraph circuits were established between Empire points and -the United States of America, including two between Sydney and San Francisco. The Advisory Committee, in the interests of the company, had urged the governments to accept the conditions that these circuits be maintained only for the duration  of the  war and six months thereafter, and that traffic over these channels be confined to that originating or terminating in the United States or in Empire countries- that is to say, that transit traffic for transmission beyond the United States of America or Empire country concerned should not be admitted oyer these circuits. Some governments accepted those conditions, but the Australian Go;vernment would not commit itself to terminate the circuits when the war was over. It had to be realized that the war had brought about a closer association than ever before between the United States and British Commonwealth countries. There was every reason to expect that this community of interest would continue after the war, and, indeed, that it should be fostered. There was every prospect, too, that the volume of telegraph traffic after the war would exceed that of the pre-war period and would require additional channels of communication, particularly with the United States of America. On these grounds it appeared unwise to prejudge the necessity or otherwise for the continuance of the circuits. The establishment of the additional radio-telegraph facilities with the United States of America had also involved considerable capital expenditure on the part of the communication authorities concerned, which might, therefore, reasonably expect to receive a fair return on their outlay. While on this subject, it should be mentioned also that, following the 1937 London conference, the Commonwealth Government had expressly stated that it could not bind itself or its successors in office to abrogate its right to authorize new wireless services at the Australian end if and when circumstances made it desirable to do so. </para>
                    <para>Honorable senators will remember that, during World War II. the Empire's telecommunications were gravely- imperilled. Many of the cables, particularly those in the Mediterranean, had been cut; Japan had seized the entire Ear Eastern cable system; the routes of the cables linking Australia with India and Canada were dangerously close to areas in Japanese hands, and the circuitous system of transmitting practically all traffic through London over a seriously depleted  cable  network was impeding the transaction of important telegraph business. At the 1942 Canberra conference, which was called at the request of the United Kingdom Government, the question of these direct circuits, and also the claims of Cable and Wireless Limited for compensation, were earnestly discussed.. In the meantime, the United States Government had been seeking assurances that the conditions attached to the establishment of the circuits with the United States of America would be withdrawn. Australia, for its part, made it clear that these circuits with the United States of America would be maintained after the war if traffic needs justified their retention, and that claims by Cable and Wireless Limited for compensation for loss of revenues resulting from their establishment could not be admitted. The. Commonwealth Government, however, invited the company to join with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and the Government in forming a merger organization, to which I have referred previously, for the operation of all external telecommunication services in Australia. By this means Cable and Wireless Limited would have been able to share in the local revenues derived from the direct radio-telegraph circuits with the United States of America. As I stated before, however, the Commonwealth was unable to secure the participation of Cable and Wireless Limited in such an arrangement. </para>
                    <para>At -the meeting of the Commonwealth Communications Council held in London in 1944, a further attempt was made to solve the problem. It became evident at that conference that there was a growing conviction among the dominion governments that Cable and Wireless Limited, because of the company's huge investment in submarine cables, had been more concerned in preserving that investment than in developing an integrated telecommunication system using both cables and radio; and that the company, in endeavouring, to maintain the circulation of traffic through London with the object of collecting maximum revenues, had been ignoring the advantages, from an efficiency point of view, which would be derived from direct radio circuits where the volume of traffic justified them. This policy, it was thought, had resulted in a retardation of the use of the radiotelegraph, to the detriment of the efficiency of the Empire telecommunication system as a whole, and had also left the Empire system vulnerable to infiltration by foreign telegraph enterprises, which were unhampered by any great capital investment, in deep-sea cables and, consequently, had been able to develop extensive radio networks. The situation had to be faced. The Commonwealth Communications Council regarded it as a challenge which could no longer be ignored, and which, in view of the attitude of the Dominions and India, could not be satisfactorily answered merely by imposing restrictions on .the use of direct radio-telegraph communication between Empire points and foreign countries. Apart from the vexed question of retaining these direct radio-telegraph circuits with the United States of America after the war, there were other factors which were likely to have an adverse effect upon the prospects of Cable and Wireless Limited in the post-war period and which the Commonwealth Communications Council felt impelled to consider. There were for example, the probability of a general r-ise of costs; the revision of currency arrangements relating to traffic settlements; the effect upon the overseas telegraph services of improved international airmail and telephone facilities; and the  competiton  for telecommunication business by foreign operators. The council discussed these matters with Cable and Wireless Limited and sought the company's advice. Later, a notification reached the council, through the United Kingdom Treasury, that the company had come to the conclusion that the really satisfactory solution of all these problems was to form a single overseas telecommunications corporation for the whole Empire, the shareholders in the existing companies to exchange their holdings for stock in the new corporation, with interest at 3 per cent, guaranteed by the governments concerned. That was tantamount to an admission by Cable and Wireless Limited that, in the light of the situation brought about by the war and of the changed conditions which .would have to be faced after the war in the field of world telecommunications, the 1929 structure and organization were no longer adequate. Although Cable and Wireless Limited had proved itself to be a noteworthy British enterprise which had rendered meritorious ' service to the British Commonwealth and Empire over a long period, the depression and the war, and circumstances and conditions unforeseen and largely uncontrollable had brought about a situation which the company itself could not meet and which required prompt measures on the part of the governments concerned. It was apparent to all that the attainment of unification of direction and operation of overseas communications, cable and radio, throughout the Empire, as visualized by the 1928 conference, had not been realized. Although Cable and Wireless Limited hold a substantial proportion of the share capital of companies responsible for the operation of radio-telegraph services in the Dominions and India, these companies are conducted as separate entities. </para>
                    <para class="block">For instance, in Australia, Cable and Wireless Limited conducts the cable services and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited the overseas radio communications. In Canada, a somewhat similar position obtains, whilst in NewZealand, the government operates the wireless services and Cable and Wireless Limited the cables. </para>
                    <para>After a full examination by the council of the_ problems presented to it, the conclusion was reached that the time had come to make a fundamental change in the present organization. The proposal made by Cable and Wireless Limited was that a single corporation be formed by Royal Charter, to operate throughout the British Commonwealth and Empire. As previously mentioned, ownership of this corporation would have remained with private shareholders, who would  ha  ve exchanged their existing stock for stock in the new corporation, the governments guaranteeing a fixed interest rate on the investment. It was suggested by the company, however, that the undertaking should be managed by a board of governors consisting of representatives of the United Kingdom, the Dominions, India and the Colonies, the number of each to bear some relation to the amount of guarantee and the responsibilities of the particular area. Governments were to control the corporation through terms laid down in the charter and by licences which were to be exclusive. Elaborating upon its proposal, the company explained to the Commonwealth Communications Council the premises on which the submission was based. It was pointed out that the present arrangement represented a patchwork of conflicting shades and shapes; that dominion governments were in an embarrassing position between their desire to manage their own affairs, without prejudice to Imperial interests, and their present obligations to, and dependence on, London as the centre of the Empire telecommunication services; that there might soon be in all Empire countries a conflict between the interests of company shareholders and of the public service; that the responsibility of maintaining a rationalized system of cable and wireless "services throughout the Empire could not be carried by one. particular" company; that the increasing and aggressive competition from telecommunication entities in foreign countries had to be realized and met; and that a system must be devised which, with public service the sole motive, would result in flexibility in the conduct of these services and a co-ordination of direction in policy in their planning and execution; that it should be such as to combine the advantages of public control without its disadvantages; that there should be public control over major policy but not public interference in management; and that it should have an area of operation which is right technically, economically and politically. </para>
                    <para class="block">On practically the same premises upon which Gable and Wireless Limited hadbased its proposal, the Australian and New Zealand members of the Commonwealth Communications Council had prepared another proposal. The Australian-New Zealand plan was that Cable and Wireless Limited and the existing Dominion and Indian companies should be replaced by a group of autonomous but interlocked government-owned telecommunication entities, one in the United Kingdom and one each in Canada, Australia, New Zealand, South Africa and India. This proposal involved the United Kingdom Government purchasing the shareholding of Cable and Wireless Limited outright, retaining 75 per cent, of it and setting aside 25 per cent, for division equally between the four Dominions and India. The Dominions and India were each to acquire by purchase the entire control of their respective local telecommunication companies, 75 per cent, to remain the property of the government concerned, and 25 per cent, to be property of the United Kingdom corporation. Under this arrangement each corporation would exercise complete sovereignty in its own territory, and in addition the United Kingdom corporation would be responsible for the upkeep of the submarine cables. The Commonwealth Communications Council was to be retained and developed as the essential co-ordinating authority on behalf of the partner governments. It will be noted that both the scheme submitted by Cable and Wireless Limited and the plan advanced by the Australian and New Zealand members of the council provided for government control ; yet, there were important differences-. Whereas the company's proposal contemplated abolition of existing local entities and the elimination of local authority altogether in the Dominions and India, the Australian-New Zealand plan provided for complete local autonomy of each telecommunications entity in its own territory. Further, under the company's proposal, ownership of the services would haverested with private shareholders, whereas the Australian-New Zealand plan provided for nationalization of the services. The council reachedthe conclusion that, although the company's proposal offered a simplification of the existing set-up, under which certain economies could doubtless be effected and a single front presented to foreign competition, it did not provide an acceptable solution of the general problem. It had been made abundantly clear to the council by the representatives of the Dominions and India that preservation of sovereignty was a cardinal policy of their respective governments. The council accordingly decided to recommend to the partner governments the adoption of the plan put forward by the Australian and New Zealand members. </para>
                    <para>The Australian-New Zealand plan was discussed at the conference of Prime Ministers held in London in May, 1944, but no unanimous decision was then reached other than that the scheme would be examined in detail by the governments. Later, the plan was adopted in. principle, with certain reservations on detail, by all the governments except those of the United Kingdom and the Union of South Africa. While accepting the view of the council that there was a case for a fundamental change in the structure of British Commonwealth telecommunication services, the United Kingdom Government considered that the plan recommended by the council did not provide the degree of central co-ordination necessary to secure the consolidation and strengthening of the wireless and cable systems which was felt to be imperative. Early in 1945, the United Kingdom Government appointed a mission, led by Lord Reith, to visit and discuss with the dominion and Indian governments how this objective might be secured. Since complete agreement was not reached another conference was held in London in July and August, 1945. This conference, which I have already referred to as the Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference, made a series of recommendations, all of which have been accepted subsequently by the partner governments, subject to ratification by the respective parliaments. It is intended that an overall agreement, in the form set out in the first schedule to the bill now before the Senate, be entered into between the respective governments, in order that the Empire-wide plan for national ownership of the external telecommunication services may be implemented. The bill seeks the authority of the Parliament for the execution of this agreement so far as Australia is concerned. The overall agreement referred to provides, inter alia, that the United Kingdom Government shall purchase all the shares of Cable and "Wireless Limited, which that Government does not already own, and thus acquire ownership of the company's telecommunications system. As soon thereafter as practicable, a national corporation will be established -in the United Kingdom to operate and maintain the overseas cable and radiotelegraph services in Great Britain. This corporation will also assume responsibility for" the maintenance of the extensive system of submarine cables connecting the United Kingdom with the several countries of the Empire and certain foreign countries. Contributions will be made on an agreed basis by the national undertakings of the other partner governments to the United Kingdom corporation for the use of these cables, and towards the costs incurred by the United Kingdom corporation in maintaining them. The United Kingdom Government, upon acquisition of the assets of Cable and "Wireless Limited, will arrange for transfer to the national bodies to be established in the Dominions and India, at a price in cash to be agreed, of such of these assets as may be situated in their respective territories and as are needed by them for overseas telecommunication purposes. Legislation for the acquisition of the privately held shares in Cable and Wireless Limited has already been introduced in the House of </para>
                    <para class="block">Commons. Under the terms of the overall agreement, the remaining partner governments, similarly will acquire the ownership of overseas telecommunication services and assets which are at present conducted and owned by local companies in their territories. In the case of Australia, this will involve acquisition by the Commonwealth Government of the interests held by ^private shareholders in the overseas telecommunication services owned and operated by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. </para>
                    <para>For the purpose of acquiring the services under notice, and of operating and maintaining" them as national undertakings, it is provided that each of the partner governments shall nominate a government department or other body, or establish a public corporation, having all the powers necessary to this end. In the bill now before the Senate provision is accordingly made for the establishment in Australia of a Government Commission, with corporate status, to acquire the ownership of and to operate and maintain the overseas telecommunication services at present conducted by Cable and Wireless Limited and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in the territories of the Commonwealth. This commission - to bo named the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia) - will be constituted on lines similar to the Australian National Airlines Commission. In the other Dominions and in India similar steps are being taken by the governments in order that full implementation of the plan recommended by the Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference may be achieved. </para>
                    <para>Following the establishment of national bodies in the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India, it is provided in the overall agreement that a board, to be known as the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board, on which all the partner governments will have direct and equal representation, be set up in Great Britain as a corporate body to advise the governments on matters of telecommunication policy and to co-ordinate the activities, including research, of the several corporations- throughout the Empire. The constitution and functions  of this board, which will replace the existing Commonwealth Communications Council, are detailed in the second schedule to the overall agreement. It is intended that the several governments will bear their due proportion of the expenses of the board. </para>
                    <para>In the third schedule to the overall agreement, a .form of tripartite agreement is drawn up for execution, in due course, by each partner government concerned, the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board and ' the local national telecommunications body. This tripartite agreement defines the relationship which will exist between the several parties thereto and, in particular, the mutual responsibilities of the local national body and the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board. It also provides that a central fund shall be established by the board, into which the national bodies will pay annually their net revenues. The board will open an account for each national body to which the net revenue so paid over will be credited to it. " Net revenue " for this purpose is to be arrived at after deduction of defined outpayments and working expenses, and will exclude consideration of revenue from certain specified services as, for example, ship to shore radio traffic and civil aviation and meteorological services. A debit will then subsequently be raised against this credit by the board in respect of (1) the expenses of the board ; and (2) in the case of the dominion and Indian corporations, their contributions on a defined basis towards any deficiency in the net revenues of the United Kingdom corporation resulting from the costs involved to the latter in the maintenance of the Empire's submarine cable system. </para>
                    <para>The combined contributions to be made by the Dominions and India towards the costs incurred by the United Kingdom corporation in respect of the maintenance of the submarine cable system are not, however, to exceed in all the total cost of cable maintenance and provision for cable renewals. The basis on which it is intended contributions, shall be made towards any deficiency thus incurred by the United Kingdom corporation is referred to in the third schedule to the overall agreement, and that basis is considered reasonable and equitable from the </para>
                    <para class="block">Australian viewpoint, bearing in mind the revenues derived in the Commonwealth from cable traffic and the extent to which the cables will be availed of for disposal of this traffic. Any contributions required from the dominion and Indian corporations in this respect will, moreover, be appreciably lower than they otherwise would be because of the decision of the British authorities to include in the net revenue of the United Kingdom national body substantial . receipts from telegraph and telephone services with Europe and radio-telephone services external to the British Isles and which are conducted by the British Post Office. After deduction of these costs from the contributions of the national corporations ro the central fund, the balance remaining clue to each national body will be repaid to it. </para>
                    <para>The plan adopted by the partner governments envisages a variation in the apportionment of revenues compared with that which has applied hitherto. At present, the division of receipts from interEmpire traffic, both in respect of outgoing and incoming telegrams, has been effected according to the services rendered by each party sharing in the handling of these messages. Under the proposed procedure, division of the receipts on this basis will be discarded in relation to traffic exchanged between Empire countries. Each national body will retain the full amount of the collections on traffic originating in its own territories but will receive no proportion of the collections on messages incoming from other Empire points. Settlement will, however, still require te be made by each national body with foreign administrations and companies in connexion with out-payments on telegrams exchanged with places beyond the Empire. The proposed new method of adjusting traffic receipts will greatly simplify the accounting arrange"ments which have previously applied. As a second schedule to the bill, there is appended a supplementary agreement which is being entered into between the partner governments in order that certain introductory and intermediate arrangements may be made by the governments pending transference of the overseas telecommunication services to national ownership and control. The preliminary  arrangements referred to in this agreement are necessary in view of the inevitable delay which may be expected to occur before legislation ratifying the plan to which the governments have subscribed has been passed in the several parliaments of the Empire and before the plan is put into full force and effect. In this respect, the Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference emphasized that, in the immediate post-war years, the need for a strong and well-ordered Empire telecommunications system able to hold its own against foreign competition, and to provide a solid base on which to build for the future, would be great and urgent. If, on the other hand, things were left as they are there would, in the opinion of the conference, be deterioration in every direction and serious and irretrievable detriment. It is intended, therefore, that the. provisions of this, supplementary agreement be applied by the partner governments during the interim period so that every possible step shall be taken to facilitate re-organization of the Empire telecommunication services on the desired basis. </para>
                    <para>The plan adopted by the partner governments will remove many of the disabilities inherent in the present organization. It provides for a unification of government policy and financial interest. It will eliminate any conflict between Empire cable and wireless entities and will facilitate the integration of the two means of providing external telecommunication services, cable and radio. It provides for functional unity over the whole field of Empire telecommunications, whilst at the same time enhancing local autonomy. Above all, it will greatly strengthen the Empire telecommunication organizations in meeting competition. On the admission of the company principally concerned in the conduct of the services under review, the future could not be faced with any degree of confidence without the imposition by the governments of artificial restrictions designed to secure to that company an economic existence.. This company, on its own admission, is not in a satisfactory position to withstand, without adventitious aid, intensive competition from telegraph undertakings in other countries, which have been intent on endeavouring to secure a larger proportion of the world's telecommunication business. The strongest competitors for this, business are the external telecommunication undertakings in the United States of America. During World War II. the United States of America,, as a war necessity, established an extensive system of radio communication interconnecting all theatres of war and bases ' of supply. The outcome is that the United States of America now has a comprehensive system of world communications by radio; and difficulties could arise from destructive competition between that system and the British Commonwealth system. </para>
                    <para>The Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference emphasized the great importance of securing an early settlement of a number of long-outstanding problems affecting relations between the British Empire and the United States of America in the telecommunications sphere, in order that causes of friction and misunderstanding which existed between the respective telegraph undertakings of the two nations might be removed and an understanding reached regarding rates and other matters affecting world telecommunications in which both nations are vitally interested. A conference was accordingly held between representatives of the governments of the United States of America and all Commonwealth countries at Bermuda in November, 1945, the results of which were highly satisfactory. Representatives of the companies were also in attendance. Mutual agreement was reached involving an appreciable reduction of the rates on telegrams exchanged between the United States of America and British Commonwealth territories. These reduced rates may later he applied between the United States of America and Empire territories on the one hand, and other countries on the other, if these other countries are prepared to cooperate. </para>
                    <para>The Bermuda conference was also notable for the generally satisfactory compromise reached between the United States of America and the British Commonwealth delegations regarding the question of the retention of the direct radio-telegraph circuits established between certain Empire points and the </para>
                    <para class="block">United States of America during the war. Whilst full recognition was given by the conference to the need for maintaining the world-wide cable system, both for economic and strategic reasons, it was  agreed that cognizance had also to be taken of the value of the radio networks in increasing the efficiency and adequacy of the telecommunications system as a whole: Consequently, discussions at Bermuda were concentrated upon devising means whereby a . carefully balanced network of world communications, employing both cable and radio, might be ensured without detriment to either system. The possible effect on the cable system of excessive competition from the employment of radio was fully appreciated by the conference, and ultimately a formula was adopted whereby the need for institution of new, or the retention of existing, radio circuits would be governed by certain specific traffic considerations. Application of this formula led to agreement by the ' Bermuda conference as to the particular radiotelegraph circuits between the United States of America and British Commonwealth points which should be retained and those which should be discontinued, whilst a similar basis was adopted in regard to future additional radio links between the United 'States of America and Empire countries. </para>
                    <para>Regarding the admission of transit traffic over the radio circuits with the United States of America - that is, traffic for transmission to destinations beyond the radio terminals in British Commonwealth or United States of America areas - it was concluded that the unrestricted admission of .such traffic over these radio links would disrupt the balance of the communication systems, cable and radio, which the respective governments desired to maintain. It was accordingly decided that the traffic normally handled over these radio circuits should be limited to traffic originating in or destined for the countries operating the circuits, except in cases when, to avoid excessive delay, it was obviously necessary and desirable that transit traffic should be transmitted over these circuits. There is every reason to believe that the agreement reached at Bermuda will pave the way to a lasting understanding between the </para>
                    <para class="block">United States of America and the British Commonwealth in the telecommunications sphere and that the -maintenance of a rationalized system of world communications, cable and radio, will be greatly assisted 'as a result of the conclusions reached. </para>
                    <para>Reverting to' the local position in Australia, it may be stated that, although the efficiency and enterprise of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in operating and developing the overseas radio-telegraph services in Australia is beyond question, there have always been fundamental disadvantages, from the Government's viewpoint, in the relationship between the company and the Commonwealth, insofar as telecommunication services are concerned. This has been, recognized by successive governments since 1930. The present arrangement under which the internal communication services are owned and operated by the governments in most Empire countries, including the United Kingdom, South Africa, India, New Zealand and Australia, whereas the external services are owned and conducted by private entities, is disadvantageous. The domestic services are complementary to the international -services and should be integrated as far as possible. Diversity of interest in the ownership and control of the internal and external services is unsound in principle and uneconomic in practice. External telecommunications, as in the case of the internal services, are essential public utilities, and the view taken by the partner governments is that their operation should be vested in government authorities, rather than in companies whose first responsibility is to their shareholders. There are obvious reasons why the profit motive should be dissociated entirely from the conduct of these services and why, any excess revenues derived from them should be applied to the reduction of charges to the public or in improving telecommunication facilities, rather than for the benefit of a limited number of company shareholders. </para>
                    <para>Effective co-ordination and control of the overseas telecommunication services in Australia in the national interests is impracticable of realization so long as two separate companies own and operate the respective means of communication - Cable and "Wireless Limited the cable terminals and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited the radio services.. Transfer of the services to the  Government will . enable their complete co-ordination under a single operating authority and will ultimately offer economic benefits to telegraph users by reason of the avoidance of the existing duplication of effort and of overhead costs resulting from the conduct of the respective services by separate undertakings. The disabilities under which the Australian Government has laboured in relation to the conduct of overseas telecommunications have long been manifested, and this fact has been recognized not only by the present Government but also by governments representing honorable senators opposite. Since 1930 successive Commonwealth governments- 'have, at various times, approved of proposals designed to secure n greater measure of control over these services and to have them conducted as national' undertakings, but not until the present has any measure been placed before the Parliament to give effect to them. </para>
                    <para>The position is now such that this issue cannot be allowed to remain undecided any longer, and the Commonwealth Government, in common with other partner governments in the Empire, has concluded that national ownership and operation of the services is the only satisfactory solution of the problem. In the bill before the .Senate, provision is accordingly made for the cancellation of the existing agreements between the Commonwealth and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and for the repeal of the Wireless Agreement Acts of 1924 and 1927. Acquisition by the Government of the overseas' telecommunication assets of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, for which provision is included in the bill, will later involve reconstitution of the company to permit of it continuing its manufacturing and allied businesses, as distinct from that associated with- overseas telecommunications. It will be realized that the Commonwealth has participated, as a majority shareholder, in this section of the company's business for some 24 years, and that, were the Government now to withdraw entirely its investment in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the company would probably be placed at a serious financial disadvantage, particularly during the period of . its reconstruction. The Government does not wish the company to be placed in such a position, and accordingly it is proposed that the Commonwealth should retain a majority shareholding in the reconstructed manufacturing company. </para>
                    <para>Part IV. of the bill provides for the assessment of compensation payable to Amalgamated ' Wireless (Australasia) Limited for the acquisition, by the Commonwealth, of the company's overseas telecommunication assets. The bill provides that the amount so payable may be arrived at by agreement with the company, and negotiations towards this end are now proceeding between the Government and the company. Failing agreement, however, the amount may be determined by a compensation board constituted in accordance with clause 50 of the bill. If either party is dissatisfied with the assessment of the compensation board, application may be made to the High Court for a review of the board's determination. Every avenue is therefore open to enable the acquisition of the company's telecommunication assets to be effected on terms which are just and fair to the company and the Commonwealth alike. </para>
                    <para>A recommendation was made by the Commonwealth Telecommunications Conference that the interests of the staffs affected by the change in the organization of the Empire telecommunication services should be safeguarded. In regard to the Australian personnel of Cable and Wireless Limited and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited at present employed on overseas telecommunication work, provision is accordingly made in clause 18 of the bill to give effect to this recommendation in the Commonwealth so far as it is practicable to do so. Employees of the two companies who have been exclusively or mainly engaged by them on telecommunication work in Australia and for whom suitable employment can be found by the commission to be established under the terms of the bill, will therefore become entitled to appointment to positions in the service of the commission, with preservation of their accrued pension, superannuation, furlough and other rights. If, however, notwithstanding this provision, it is not found possible by the commission to reengage all of the employees affected, the Government contemplates making such satisfactory arrangements as will not place these particular employees at a disadvantage. For this purpose, it is intended to set up a committee consisting of representatives of the Government, the companies and the employees to give consideration to matters relating to the safeguarding of the interests of all of the employees concerned and to make appropriate recommendations to this end. The employees of the companies who are transferred to the service of the commission will also carry over with them any conditions or rates of salary now  applying  to them under arbitration awards or agreements filed with the' Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration. </para>
                    <para>The powers, functions and duties of the commission to be set up in the Commonwealth to acquire, operate and maintain the overseas telecommunication services are detailed in clause 20 of the bill. "They embrace all the overseas telecommunication functions hitherto performed in Australia by Cable and Wireless Limited and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, including, in the latter case, the operation of the coastal and island radio stations which, as honorable senators know, handle wireless traffic with ships at sea and similar traffic exchanged within and between the territories of the Commonwealth. In conjunction with the national corporations to be set up in the United Kingdom, the Dominions and India, it is intended that the Australian commission also undertake intensive research and developmental work, with the object of improving the efficiency of the overseas telecommunication services. The results of this work throughout the Empire will be co-ordinated by the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board in London and will be applied generally for the benefit of Empire telecommunications and the telegraph users. The Commonwealth Telecommunications Board will also undertake research on behalf of all partner governments. It is clear that there is an immense field for research which can profitably be exploited by all the authorities responsible for the conduct of the Empire's overseas communication services. It is further contemplated that the commission shall, if so desired by another national body established by any of the other partner governments, undertake to act as an agent, on agreed terms, in maintaining and operating overseas telecommunication services in regional areas adjacent to Australia, where such an arrangement will prove economical from an Empire viewpoint. </para>
                    <para>Concerning any contracts which may be entered into by the commission in accordance with the powers to be conferred on it in terms of the bill, clause 24 provides that the commission shall not, without the consent of the responsible Minister, enter into any contract where supply, either directly or indirectly, of imported equipment or material of a value exceeding Â£5,000 is involved. This provision will ensure that due consideration is given to the use by the commission of equipment manufactured in Australia before steps are taken to import material of any appreciable value from abroad. The powers to he conferred on the commission will, further, not detract from those entrusted to the Minister administering the Wireless Telegraphy and the Post and Telegraph Acts and a stipulation to this effect is made in clause 28 of the bill. </para>
                    <para>In clause 60, it is also provided that the commission shall obtain all necessary licences, permissions or approvals required for its purposes from the Minister responsible for administering the Wireless Telegraphy Act. This provision is essential in order that the Minister may exercise his discretion- as to the terms and conditions under which licences will be issued to the commission to conduct radio services and so that he may remain the final authority for the co-ordination and control of wireless communication activities in the Commonwealth. </para>
                    <para>The conditions on which advances will be made to the commission for its purposes will be determined by the Treasurer. </para>
                    <para class="block">Similarly, the form in which the commission will keep its accounts will he subject to the approval of the Treasurer and to inspection and audit by the Auditor-General. The annual report and financial accounts of the commission, accompanied by a certificate of the Auditor-General, will be submitted to the Parliament as a normal course. As a Commonwealth Government instrumentality, conducting overseas communication services of a like nature to those undertaken within Australia by the Postmaster-General's Department, the commission will, under clause 36 of the bill, be relieved from payment of certain rates, taxes and charges. The commission will maintain a close liaison with the Postal Department in operating the overseas telecommunication services, and in this connexion certain land-line and other facilities previously made available to Cable and Wireless Limited, and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, respectively, for their purposes will be provided, in terms of clauses 62 and 63 of the bill, to meet the requirements of the commission. For its part, the commission will arrange free handling of meteorological telegrams exchanged with ships at sea and, when required, of similar messages exchanged between Commonwealth meteorological offices and stations. The commission will also handle free, on behalf of the Postal Department, other telegrams for transmission within the Commonwealth in cases of interruption to land-lines in return for which the Postal Department will arrange free transmission of messages relating to the commission's administrative affairs. </para>
                    <para>This statement gives a general outline of the purport of the bill before the Senate, and the reasons why legislation on the lines sought by the Government is necessary. The Government believes that the passing of this legislation, together with that of similar legislation by the other partner governments, followed by full implementation of the plan for national "ownership and operation of the overseas telecommunication services of the" British Commonwealth, will prove of immeasurable benefit to Australia and the Empire, and to the public who use the services. The plan is an essay in </para>

I commend the bill to the favorable consideration of honorable senators. </para>

I had an opportunity to read the second-reading speech made by the Minister for Immigration <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Calwell)</inline> on this bill in the House of Representatives recently, and I have since perused it more than once. It is interesting to note that in the Senate at present are three ex-Postmasters-General. I congratulate the present Postmaster-General on his good f ortune in having been placed in charge of this important measure in the Senate.  The bill will be regarded as providing for one of the most important and practical steps taken to bring about Empire unity, and close co-operation between the British Commonwealth of Nations and that great democracy, the United States of America. I pay a personal tribute to the work of Mi". D. McVey in connexion with this matter. I had the good fortune to be associated with him for a few months when I held the portfolio of Postmaster-General. I was in London with him, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Witt, Mr. Bourne,</inline> and others, who carried out the negotiations at which the final agreement was reached between the countries constituting the British Empire. It was considered there that the success achieved was due to the efforts of the Australian officials whom I have named, and other officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, to such a degree that the  proposal which finally formed the basis of the agreement was called the Anzac plan. </para>

I have not been associated with any government department which, during the war period, has displayed a better approach to the public and to public matters than the Postmaster-General's Department. That organization has developed a realization of the importance of service to the community which is superior to that of any other department.

                    <para>An hour and a half was occupied by the Minister, in delivering his second-reading speech, and it is. impossible for a bill of this magnitude to be dealt with in detail at the second-reading stage. The story of the negotiations referred to by the Minister has been condensed, in order' to place the whole of the facts before the  Senate, and it is impossible to follow " the ramifications of the proposal unless honorable senators have had an opportunity to read the details more than once. Whoever was responsible for their compilation is to be commended upon the effort. Of the many second-reading speeches which I have heard in. the Senate, that just delivered takes pride of "place for clarity and conciseness. I shall speak of the proposals only in general terms, and I shall suggest to the Government two major amendments, which could be discussed more satisfactorily in committee than now. It is gratifying to know that Great Britain, Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa, Southern Rhodesia and India have been able, after many years, to decide to go into business together, in order to cope with the important task of providing overseas cable and wireless communications. 'The fact that they have achieved unity leads us to believe that in this respect at least co-operation among the members -of the British Commonwealth of Nations is assured in the future. Our Empire speaks and acts with great authority than would be possible if the various parts of it acted as separate and independent units. At Bermuda, after the scheme had been decided upon, the representatives of the Empire countries, "following negotiations with representatives of the United States of America, were able to clear- away many misunderstandings which had existed for many years, and agree to a reduction of rates. That was another important step in the direction of close co-operation with the United States .of America. There is no doubt that the maintenance, of efficient communications facilitated the successful prosecution of the war. Although in times of peace the modern development of beam wireless, with its greater speed and efficiency, can provide a satisfactory service at a fraction of the cost of maintaining communications by means of submarine cables, we must remember that in -times of war secret messages cannot be sent by wireless, and therefore, that defence considerations alone necessitate the retention and efficient working of submarine cables. In order that the competition of beam wireless should not place other methods of transmitting messages at too great a disadvantage, the countries associated with the agreement found it necessary to combine the two services and to use them for the advantage of all. </para>
                    <para>It is easy now to criticize some of the provisions of the agreements made in 1922, 1924 and 1927 between the Commonwealth Government and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. Since those agreements were entered into, beam wireless has made great headway. I pay a tribute to those associated with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited for the industry and skill displayed in developing that great and efficient organization.  Wsen  we call to mind the pioneering work undertaken by the old companies which have been absorbed by Cable and Wireless Limited, the present occasion seems an appropriate one to pay a tribute also to those who have been associated with them in the field of communications. It is fitting, too, that we should learn from experience. Looking back, it seems to me that one weakness of the arrangement with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was that, although the Commonwealth had 500,001 shares and the private company 500,000 shares in the company, the arrangement provided that three of the directors should be appointed by the Commonwealth and three by the private company, with a seventh director to he appointed .by those six. I suggest that whenever in the future the Commonwealth is forced into a partnership of this kind it would be well to ensure that the Government does not allow the control of the business to be taken out of its hands. I regret that some time ago there was litigation between the Commonwealth Government and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. Such a state of affairs should not be allowed to occur again. We should learn from that experience, first, that the Government should keep out of business enterprises, and secondly, that when circumstances arise which force it to engage in such activities as Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has undertaken, the Government should ensure that, in addition to having a majority of shares in the concern, it also has actual control of operations. </para>
                    <para>I shall .make three suggestions to the Government at this stage, leaving the detailed discussion of them until the bill is in committee. Clause 18 deals with the welfare of employees. In this connexion I have received several communications from members of the staff of Cable and Wireless Limited, and other organizations. I emphasize that the trained men in the organizations are specialists, and that it is not right that they should be thrown on the labour market and forced to find other employment. I believe that the Postmaster-General is just as interested in these employees as I am, but in order to put the matter beyond doubt I suggest that the Parliament should provide that not one of them who is physically fit to carry out his work, and has a good record, shall be scrapped because of this agreement. The present Postmaster-General will not always hold that office, and an injustice might be done to these employees in the future unless their position is  safeguarded now. It has been truly said" that when a man's means of earning a livlihood is taken from him, his whole life is endangered. </para>
                    <para>Clause 29 enables the Treasurer to make advances not exceeding Â£3,000,000 to the commission. In the House of Representatives there was some discussion of this provision. In committee I shall ask the Minister to place beyond all doubt what is contemplated under this clause, first, as to the compensation to be paid to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited ; secondly the amount to be paid to Cable and Wireless Limited, or its agents; and thirdly, the amount to be paid to the new commission for sending and receiving communications to and from other parts of the world. I admit that these are complicated matters, but it is most desirable that we should avoid establishing a dangerous precedent by signing a blank cheque for Â£3,000,000. I should like to have an assurance from the Minister that the position will bewell safeguarded in respect of the matters to which I have referred. </para>
                    <para>An interesting part of the arrangement, and one for which the parties concerned are to be commended, is the proposal that the Government and the shareholders of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited should try to come to an agreement as to the amount of compensation to be paid. Should agreement not be reached on that point, the matter is then to go to a board, and, if necessary, to the High Court. That seems to me to be a wise arrangement, because we have to consider not only what is fair compensation to the shareholders of the company, but also what is right in the interests of the taxpayers. I understand that the Secretary to the Treasury, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Mcfarlane,</inline> and the Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fanning,</inline> and other trusted officers of the Commonwealth Public Service, are conducting the delicate negotiations connected with this agreement. I know these men, and have a high regard for their ability and integrity. I shall be surprised if <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McFarlane</inline> agrees to. pay ls. more than should be paid by way of compensation. </para>
                    <para>The Parliament should at least know the basis on which compensation will be calculated. </para>
                    <para>I understand that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has a controlling interest in certain commercial broadcasting stations and broadcasting licence.in Australia. ' In my opinion, it would have been better if the Government had withdrawn completely from the manufacturing and commercial activities of the company, and " the broadcasting stations. I am aware that the Minister indicated that the Government did not wish to embarrass the company unduly, but if he had in mind only matters of finance, I point out that it would have been easy for the Government to make a loan to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, through the Commonwealth Bank, repayable in 10, 15 or 20 years, so that it should not suffer by reason of the action taken in the interests of the Empire. I shall have more to say on these three matters when the bill is in committee. I -hope that by the time that stage has been reached the Minister will be able to give to honorable senators some detailed information on these points. I remind him that they relate to the welfare of employees, the compensation payable to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited, and the severance of the' Government from the commercial and manufacturing activities of the company, which may involve financial assistance to the company through ,the Commonwealth Bank. I want, if possible, to avoid in the futur.e any such conflict as arose in the past between the Government and its partners. I greatly regret that it has been found necessary to take the drastic action which we are asked <inline font-style="italic">iÂ«</inline> approve, but in the interests of the defence of the Empire and of the maintenance of up-to-date communications, within the Empire and with othercountries, I believe that the contemplated step is necessary. I compliment those who have "been associated with the agreement, which, I believe marks a forward step in telecommunications, and will help to bring more closely together Empire countries and all English-speaking peoples. </para>

                        <para>.- The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> referred to the Postmaster-General's Department and Postmasters-General. There were seventeen Postmasters-General before me, and all of them are either dead or have been defeated as candidates for election to Parliament. Since I left the departmentthere have been fourteen other Postmasters-General. Every one who has held that office has toyed with this question and has endeavoured to draw up some scheme for submission to the Parliament so that the communications section of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited could be divided from the commercial activities of the company. A search through the archives of the Post.masterGeneral's Department or the Attorney-General's Department will reveal many draft bills relating to this measure. In fact, in 1928, during my term as Postmaster-General, a bill was drafted to give effect to what is intended by this measure, with the exception that the purpose of that bill was to divorce the communications side from the commercial side, and leave the commercial activities entirely in the hands of private enterprise. I agree entirely that this separation should be effected, and that communications should be in the hands of the Postmaster-General's De'partment, or at least of the Government. There are many factors that bring cable and wireless services within the ambit of the Postmaster-General's Department. In the first instance, practically all messages pass through the. Postal Department. That fact alone means that the department is in close touch with telecommunications. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> touched upon an important point when he referred to the secrecy required in the transmission of messages in war-time. I understand that in neither the war of 1914-18 nor the last war were the cable systems interfered with. Gable messages are completely secret at all times, but no such claim can be made in respect of wireless messages. It is not generally known that during the last war the Postmaster-General's Department laid a cable from Australia to New Guinea. The service provided by that cable was effective and secret, and I understand it is still in operation. The cable itself was made from scraps collected throughout the Commonwealth. Why was a cable necessary on this route ? The main reason, of course, was that complete secrecy was necessary in the transmission of messages. The capital cost of initiating a cable service is enormous compared with that of setting up facilities for transmitting and receiving wireless messages. The cost of a cable may run into many millions of pounds, whereas wireless equipment can be provided for a few hundred thousand pounds. The term " beam " aS applied .to wireless transmission is rather misleading. The transmission is directional, but it is not a "beam" in the ordinary sense. In 1924, before the inception of overseas wireless transmission services, I talked with Marconi who was very candid and very modest about the future of wireless for this purpose. I asked him if secrecy could be ensured and he said he did not claim secrecy. Signals, he said, would leave Australia in a narrow beam, but when they reached Great Britain the beam might be 10,000 miles wide, and could easily be' tapped at any point along the route except in the immediate vicinity of Australia. That is still the position to-day. Another disadvantage of beam wireless is atmospheric interference which at some periods of the year may put the overseas wireless telegraphic system out of operation for several days at a time. When this happens, all the business normally handled by radio has to be given to the cable companies. Wireless transmission of course is considerably cheaper than cable rates. I understand that in 1928 we disposed of our interest in the Pacific Cable .Company for approximately Â£200,000.- That amount and much more will have to. be repaid to the Pacific Cable Company and the Eastern Extension Company for the right to transmit messages over their lines, or to purchase their assets within Australia to enable the cable system to operate under governmental control and in co-operation with the beam wireless system instead of in opposition to it. At present, there is cut-throat competition between the two organizations. The beam wireless companies offer- lower rates and handle a lot  of business which is not of a secret nature. I confess that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has done remarkably good work; but the Postmaster-General's Department too has done good work. Probably few people realize that in the workshops of the department Â£7,000,000 worth of material- much of it highly technical - was produced during the war. Technicians of the Postmaster-General's Department can hold their own with technicians in any part of the world. The department has also carried out valuable research. In the early days Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited made extravagant claims in regard to patent rights. It claimed that it had the sole right to broadcast within Australia, and to manufacture and sell valves. In fact, for quite a long time it actually obtained royalties from retailers of .valves. It also licensed dealers to sell wireless sets throughout the Commonwealth; but when these claims were challenged, the company did not fight the case. When wireless broadcasting commenced in this country in 1923, we had to erect stations in Sydney and Melbourne. Tenders were called for this work, and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited claimed that it was the only organization that could do the job because it held certain patent rights. However, Standard Telephones and Cables Limited tendered for the erection of the stations, and undertook to indemnify the Government for any claim for royalties. The contract was let to that firm, and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited did not seek to substantiate its claims to patent rights. I think also that Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited was instrumental in having a high duty placed upon imported wireless sets. I venture to say that the set in the members' lounge in this building contains material valued at only Â£5 or Â£10, although it probably cost more than Â£100. The purchasers of wireless receiving sets made Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited what it is to-day. </para>

                    <para>The legislation now before the Senate differs from the proposals considered by former Postmasters-General in that it provides for the operation of the telecommunications . section by a go vernmental organization - the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia). Clause 29 confers upon the commission power to make an agreement with the private companies as to the compensation that should be paid for the acquisition of existing services. There is also to be an Empire authority known as the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board, members of which will include one representative from each of the Dominions. The Leader of the Opposition referred to an amount of Â£3,000,000 specified in the bill. It is not proposed, I understand, that all that money shall be paid in compensation. Much of it will be used to purchase offices equipment, &amp;c, necessary for the carrying on of an external communication system. Incidentally, I believe that " external communications " would have been a better term than "telecommunications ". It was- stated in the House of Representatives that the amount of compensation to be paid is. approximately Â£1,500,000. I do not know what will be the source of that money, nor can I vouch for the accuracy of the figure. It is noticeable, however, that the Â£1 shares of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited have reached their highest figure, namely, Â£3. Ils. 6d. I have no doubt that the Government's proposal to take over the telecommunications side of the company's activities has been responsible for that rise. </para>

It will be realized that the greater source of revenue of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is from the communications side. I do not know thefigures, but, probably, the communications revenue is greater than the company's revenue from its commercial and manufacturing operations. However, if the figures cited in the House of Representatives be correct - and T have no reason to believe that they are right or wrong - an extraordinary position arises. If, for argument sake, the sum of Â£1,000,000 bc paid as compensation to Amalgamated </para>

                    </continue>
                    <para class="block">Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the company would then have a capital of Â£2,000,000. It could afford to give to its shareholders the whole of their share capital at Â£1 a share and still retain Â£1,000,000 of capital, which is equal to its present capital to carry on only half of its existing business. If the amount of compensation to be paid to the company be fixed at Â£1,500,000, the company could afford to pay to its shareholders a bonus of 30s. a share and still retain its present, capital. That would mean over-capitalization. There is no doubt that when compensation is paid, the- company will have to refund some of the money to its shareholders. The whole of the compensation will be paid to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I take it that the commission and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited will" attempt to arrive at the amount of  compensation  without reference to the Compensation Board df three members which is to be set up under clause 50 of the bill. If the parties cannot agree, the matter may be referred to the Compensation Board. One cannot foretell what will happen. The nominal value of shares of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is Â£1, but on the Stock Exchange to-day, as the result of the introduction of this measure, the value  of  the shares has risen to Â£3 Ils. 6d. a share. That is not the fair share value. The fair share value would be the value prior to information regarding the introduction of this measure becoming known, namely, about Â£2 3s. a share. Although the point is not made clear in the bill, it is likely that the Government will continue to carry on the commercial side of the company in conjunction with the company. That decision is to be left entirely to the shareholders. However, when we realize that the Government will hold one share more than half -of the total number of shares, the control is one-sided and whatever the Government says will be final. Should the Government decide to retain this hybrid arrangement, its decision will be final, because as holders of a majority of the shares it will have control. I do not believe in hybrid arrangements of this kind. Commonwealth Oil Refineries is carried on in exactly the same manner. I do not think that anyone can truly say that </para>
                    <para class="block">Commonwealth Oil Refineries has benefited petrol users in this country. As. a matter of fact, the price of petrol supplied by .that organization is the same as that charged by other petrol companies. I take it that when Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited relinquishes ownership of communications, but continues its commercial and manufacturing operations as at present, it will link up with other similar organizations, all of which will agree to charge the same prices, with the result that the general public will derive no benefit whatever from this arrangement. It will be realized that, in addition to its shares being quoted at Â£3 lis. 6d. a share, Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited has a reserve' fund of Â£625,000; and I believe that it has, in addition, a replacement fund of Â£500,000. Therefore, the company is in a very good position. We now have three Government directors on Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited who will remain there as at present. No provision is made for their removal. There are also three directors elected by the shareholders of the company. In 1922 those six directors appointed the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> as the seventh director, and he still retains that position. However, he was not, as manypeople think, the nominee of the Government. He was chosen by the other six directors. , Quite a lot can be said at the committee stages on several phases of the measure, but I have said sufficient to give the picture as I see it. </para>
                    <para>I was instrumental in calling together the first meeting of wireless interests in Australia in March, 1923. At that time the whole of the wireless interests came together and, led by one of the strongest men in the wireless world, <inline font-weight="bold">Sir Ernest</inline> Fisk, they decided to adopt the sealed set for broadcasting in this country. Honorable senators know what happened subsequently. Few accepted the set. Only a few thousand licences were applied for. After that conference the parties waited upon me and told me what they had done. I replied that if the step taken proved to be a success they were entitled to all the credit, but should it prove to be a failure, the blood was <inline font-style="italic">on</inline> their own heads. They returned  to me sis months later and told me that the whole arrangement had ended in a fiasco. They suggested that another meeting be called, and at that meeting the arrangement of wave-lengths was handed to the Postal Department which introduced the medium wave-length. That occurred in 1923 and was the beginning of broadcasting in this country. Great Britain had started broadcasting only in the previous year. Since that time over 1,000,000 listeners' licences have been issued in Australia. I give to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited due credit for what it has done; and I freely admit that it has done a great deal in manufacturing very good sets which it sold at very high prices. I also admit that efficient broadcasting stations have been developed throughout the country, and I pay tribute to the work carried out by stations in the transmission of messages to ships at sea. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited did much pioneering and research work; but in the research field other companies have done excellent work also and are deserving of equal credit. </para>

                        <para>. -  I congratulate the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> upon his second-reading speech. This measure is. one of the most important yet to come before the Parliament. I presume that the Government is taking this step mainly in the interests of the nation's defence. In addition, one can easily imagine the benefits which the public will derive when the Government takes over control of telecommunications in this country. It is important that this action be taken. The proposal to continue in conjunction with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in the commercial sphere is also very important. I agree with the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> that it is essential that when the Government enters into business with private enterprise it should hold a controlling interest through a majority on the board of directors. Such an arrangement will ensure some kind of measuring rod with respect to costs. The Leader of the Opposition also said that the Government should keep out of commercial undertakings, but that if it does engage in them it should do so in a proper manner and should not continue along the lines followed by Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in the past. The seventh director is the right honorable member for North Sydney <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes).</inline> I understand that the right honorable gentleman appointed himself as the seventh director of the company and was not so appointed by the other six directors as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has said. </para>

                            <para>- It would be interesting to know whether the other six directors could displace him. The proposal embodied in the bill is now placed before us after many governments, and, as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> has said, many Postmasters-General have advocated a similar plan with the exception that previously it was not proposed that the Government should enter into an agreement to operate in conjunction with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited in respect of commercial operations. I understand that the Pacific cable service was established in 1901. Many years ago the British Government, in conjunction with the governments of New Zealand, New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland, established cable communication with Britain. After the inception of federation, the Commonwealth took over the holdings of New South Wales, Victoria and Queensland. The Commonwealth then held a one-third share in the venture, in respect of which money borrowed from the National Debt Commission in Great Britain totalled Â£2,000,000. In 1928, following the Imperial Conference of that year, it was decided to institute the Beam Wireless Service. Imperial Communications Limited was then formed to take over the control of all existing wireless concerns. Cable and Wireless Limited came into operation in 1929 and took over full control. The government of the day sold its shares for Â£500,000, but in respect of loans outstanding amounting to Â£1,250,000, the Commonwealth agreed to pay interest, and it is still paying interest in respect of that indebtedness. That was a very bad deal. Anti-Labour governments did  not attempt to give effect to the wishes of successive Postmasters-General and so failed to save the nation a great deal of unnecessary expenditure. A change of government was required finally to secure action. The war may have accelerated the decision somewhat, as the Leader of the Opposition claimed, but I believe that changes of government in Great Britain, Australia and New Zealand did more than anything else to bring about government control of external communications. A great deal has been said in this debate about the efficiency of the Postal Department. It is a very valuable institution, but the Labour party's political opponents would have sold it to private enterprise if they had had the courage, to do so when they were in power. </para>

                            <para>- Anything is possible to those who have power in the Parliament. As an Australian, I am very proud of the Postal Department. This pride is based on knowledge which I have gained as Chairman of the Broadcasting Committee. One impressive fact is that the men who have held the office of Director-General of Posts and Telegraphs from time to time have displayed a consistent high standard of administrative efficiency and business ability. Men have been imported to fill vacancies and, because of the high degree of their ability, they have left the position to engage in private employment. The training methods of the Postal Department have' ensured that its work has been of the highest order. It deals with the public in a courteous manner, and it instils in its officers a high standard of public service. It certainly " delivers the goods ". </para>

                    <para>Both the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> expressed concern about the expenditure of the Â£3,000,000 to be set aside under this bill for compensation and other purposes. They were doubtful about the amounts that would he expended respectively in compensating Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and in providing buildings and equipment for the proposed commission. The Government will be particularly careful in supervising this expenditure. </para>
                    <para class="block">The Leader of the Opposition referred to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McFarlane</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fanning,</inline> who are conducting negotiations with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited on behalf of the Government. He said he was sure that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McFarlane</inline> would watch every shilling of governmental expenditure, but he omitted to refer to <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fanning</inline> in the same way. The inference to be drawn from this is that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fanning</inline> cannot be relied upon in the same way. I am sure that this was not the intention of the honorable senator, and I hasten to remove any false impression that he may have created. We all know that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Fanning</inline> will be just as astute and watchful of the interests of the Commonwealth in his dealings with the experts of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited as <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McFarlane</inline> will be. Both men will do what the Government expects them to do. The Postal Department is the most efficient government instrumentality in Australia. It provides its officers with training that takes them to the " top of the tree " in the business world. It has been said that the Commonwealth expends a tremendous 'amount of money at various times in sending postal officials on missions overseas and that frequently, as the result of contacts made abroad, these men leave the department to take employment with private enterprise. I am not sure of the reasons, but it is extraordinary that a very able man like <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. McVey</inline> should leave the Commonwealth service and that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Smith,</inline> after travelling about on an official tour, should do likewise. Another Commonwealth public servant, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore,</inline> accompanied the late Minister for Trade and Customs <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Keane)</inline> on a very important mission to the United States of America. <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore</inline> was conversant with all the details of the work done by the late Minister, and when <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Keane</inline> died he continued the negotiations with the American Government. However, when he returned to Australia he left the Commonwealth Public Service. No other man knew as much about the work that had been done in America as did <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Moore.</inline></para>

" I believe that it was once customary for a postal official who went abroad at the expense of the department to sign an agreement to remain in the - service of the department for a period of five years after his return. That practice should be re-introduced. The Government spends thousands of pounds to improve the knowledge of such men. Without Government assistance they would not be able to travel abroad and make contacts that other Australians are unable to make. Therefore, the Commonwealth should protect its interests and retain the services of such men for five years after their return to Australia. In taking control of wireless-telephone and beam wireless communications, the Government is making a very important forward step. The time is not far distant when the government of every country will have to take control of not only external communications but also internal communications. </para>

                            <para>- I am very doubtful about the range of amplitude modulation broadcasting stations. I have read all sorts of advertising " dope " on the subject; I can find no other description for it. It is claimed that the present clear-signal range of an amplitude modulation station is  00  miles. I challenge anybody to prove that claim. I sincerely believe that recent American tests have proved that frequency modulation broadcasting has a greater clear-signal range than amplitude modulation broadcasting. I place no credence in statements that the effective clear-signal range of frequency modulation stations is only  30  miles. The adoption of the frequency modulation system would enable thousands of new stations to be established in Australia. Privately-controlled broadcasting stations can become a menace to the nation. Only this morning I read a newspaper report of a debate in the British House of Commons on the operations of Radio Luxembourg, a station that pops up into the news every now and then and arouses world-wide interest. The British Government now proposes to "buy time ".on Radio Luxembourg in order to stem the flood of anti-British commercial propaganda sweeping into England from the Continent through that station. This propaganda emanates from all sorts of manufacturing concerns wishing to capture the British market, and the British Government wishes to counteract it. The same sort of thing will happen in Australia as surely as night follows day unless we take preventive action now. New broadcasting stations will be established, if licences are granted, and they will, be tied up with the major broadcasting systems such as the Macquarie network. This medium of communication can be a great menace to the nation under any government. It could be highly dangerous to any government or democracy. Therefore the time is ripe for the Government to consider taking entire control of both internal and external communications. </para>

                        <para>. -  I was pleased to hear that the Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> had changed his mind. I have a vivid recollection, when fighting election campaigns on behalf of the Labour party, of hearing him declare that he stood four-square to private ownership. He said that the Government should not interfere with private business at all. This afternoon, . however, he admitted that if the Government entered into business, even in conjunction with private enterprise, it should retain a controlling interest in the undertaking. The Labour party has been trying for years  to have effect given to that principle. Notwithstanding his keenness in supporting private enterprise in the past, I am pleased that the Leader of the Opposition has at last altered his opinion regarding the matter. Before long he may even see eye to eye with the Labour party in  advoca  ting that all public utilities, and particularly those which render service to the people, should be owned and controlled by them through their 'Parliaments. </para>

Australia has had to import a great deal from that country, but the time has arrived when, if we cannot manufacture locally all of the goods we need, we should get them from Great Britain rather than from the United States ' of America. Notwithstanding all the negotiations that have taken place overseas in connexion with the loan to Britain by the United States of America, let us pursue a policy of obtaining the things we need from GreatBritain rather than from the United States of America, using sterling exchange instead of dollar exchange. That can be' done by a little effort on the part of government departments instead of waiting for materials to come from the United States of America. I hope that the matters to which I have referred will be given careful consideration by the Government. The Government is to be commended on having entered into this agreement, notwithstanding that it will cost a lot of money to buy out private enterprise. </para>

                            <para>- If the value of the shares is now Â£3 lis., the shares held by the Government - or the people's shares, as the Vice-President of the Executive Council <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Collings)</inline> prefers to call them; - also are worth Â£3 Ils.' each. Therefore, the 5,001 shares held by the Government are now worth about Â£1.750,000. For the purposes of the negotiations it does not seem to me to matter very much what the value of the shares may be, and so I think that it would be better for the Government to make a clean break with the company. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> am informed that the profits of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited are fairly equally divided between its manufacturing activities and the communications side of its business. If a clean break were made I do not think that any harm would be done to anyone. The contention that the company would be financially embarrassed were the Government to withdraw from it entirely, does not seem to be well founded. On the contrary, any embarrassment would seem to be due to the company having so much money that it will not know what to do with it. Supporters of the Labour party frequently denounce private enterprise when it pays dividends above say, <inline font-style="italic">2i</inline> or 3 per cent., yet they support a government which has accepted much bigger dividends from Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The bill provides for taking over the shares of private shareholders, not only in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited- but ako in Cable and Wireless Limited. The authorities in the United Kingdom have undertaken to buy the private shares in that company and to make a. distribution  to the various parts of the Empire associated with this agreement. I suppose that that also will involve Australia in some expenditure. The negotiators on behalf of the Government are trying to make a bargain with Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited, but those companies know that a limit of Â£3,000,000 has been a uthorized. Would any man negotiating for the purchase of a house valued at Â£1,500 tell the vendor that his limit was Â£3,000? A vendor of property in such circumstances would be in a very happy position. Yet that is what is occurring in connexion with 'this proposal. </para>

It says, in effect, " In order to make it quite clear, and so that there can be no mistake, we will put in an act of Parliament the amount we are prepared to pay for certain assets ". I am not satisfied with the bill in that respect. Obviously, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> does not know what it contains. He has not yet digested the 32 foolscap pages read so eloquently by the Minister. If he had digested their contents he would be a marvel, and he is not a marvel. Some years ago, when I was a Minister in a previous government, I was a member of a committee which gave some consideration to the subject now before the Senate. I took the same stand then as I take now ; I said then that there should be a complete break between the Government and Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. In my opinion, the Government should take over only the communications portion of the business of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and should leave the manufacturing and commercial activities of the company in the hands of the company. </para>

                            <para>- That may be, butmany manufacturers are now making similar goods. During the war there was a temporary scarcity of wireless valves, because Holland, which manufactured a large proportion of the valves sold throughout the world, had been overrun by the Germans, but to-day a large Dutch company is operating in Australia, and other companies also are making similar articles. No great national purpose will be served by the Commonwealth Government remaining a partner in a company which manufactures wireless valves. This is such an unimportant part of the economic life of Australia that I am amazed that the Government does not make a clean break between the two phases of the company's activities. I believe that the Government is right in acquiring the telecommunications service; but it will be making a mistake if it remains associated with the manufacturing side of Amalgamated "Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and thus engages in competition with other wireless manufacturing organizations, not only in this country, but all over the world. The schedule to the bill explains the agreement that has been entered into by the Dominions and the United Kingdom. The scheme embraces not only those countries that we look upon as integral parts of the British Commonwealth of Nations, but also Mandated Territories and other territories under the protection of the British Empire. Having made that agreement, I cannot understand why. the Government of this country has decided to retain its association with a business enterprise quite alien to normal governmental activities. I would have much less objection to the Government assuming control of certain other private enterprises. Furthermore, I am not convinced that the Government is being entirely honest. It has been argued that the shareholders of Amalgamated "Wireless (Australasia) Limited will decide whether or not the Government is to remain in the company; but as the Government owns one more than half of the shares in the company, the Government, and not the private shareholder, will decide whether or not it is to remain in the company. </para>

                            <para>- I do not object to that; but I do object to the attempt to hoodwink the people of this country into believing that the private shareholders in Amalgamated "Wireless (Australasia) Limited will decide whether or not the Government shall remain in the company. Whilst negotiations are being carried on with efficient business organizations like Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, and Cable and Wireless Limited, it is not very shrewd of the Government to indicate in this measure that it is prepared to pay Â£3,000,000 in compensation. I should like the Postmaster-General to have another glance through his 32-page marathon speech to see if, by some chance, something has been omitted. Australia, of course, will have to pay its share of the expense of the Commonwealth Telecommunications Board, and will have to meet the entire cost of the Overseas Telecommunications Commission (Australia). As the salaries to be paid go as high as Â£3,500 a year, that expense will not be negligible. I am informed that there is not much profit in the operation of the cable and wireless services, and that the main advantage of this measure will be the security it will give to our external communications in war-time; but will the services continue to be profitable under governmental control, or will they become another burden upon the taxpayers? It is up to the Government to show the people of this country that it can take over a profitable organization and keep it profitable. If that cannot be done then the nationalization claims of honorable senators opposite will be prejudiced seriously. Again I ask the Minister to re-examine his second-reading speech, perhaps in cooperation with good actuaries or auditors, in an endeavour to devise a way of assessing equitably the value of the two branches of the activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited so that a clean break may be made, the Government taking over the telecommunications section in its entirety, and leaving the private shareholders to carry on the manufacturing business. </para>

                        <para>. - Like other honorable senators on this side of the chamber I am rather concerned at this proposal, and somewhat bewildered by it. I have tried to understand the second-reading speech of the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> who, I believe, made an honest attempt to put his case to us fairly; but it is no reflection upon the mentality of honorable senators to say that this measure will require more than average concentration before' we can even begin to understand it. Its main object, of course, is to place overseas telecommunications under governmental control. That is a sound move from the point of view of the defence of this country and the operation of such a service is a true function of government; but whether or not the Government is justified in remaining in the manufacturing business is another matter. It has been said that the shareholders in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited will decide whether or not the Government is to remain in that undertaking. Like <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> I am of the opinion that the Government will be well advised to sever its connexion with the company. One of my main concerns in regard to this legislation is this : How can the proposed commission and the two companies concerned arrive at a fair evaluation of the assets that are' to be acquired? Originally, the Government advanced Â£500,001 and, theoretically, the company was to subscribe Â£499,999, although I understand the actual figure provided by the company was approximately Â£480,000. According to a balance-sheet issued recently, the reserves of the company amounted to Â£625,878. Has the company any further assets so far undisclosed? If not, the total value of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited is Â£1,625.878. It has been said that for a half share in this company the Government proposes to pay Â£1,500,000. It would appear, therefore, that the Government is being generous. I do not know whether or not a charge is being made for what is known as goodwill; but it is pertinent to ask whether this goodwill, if any, is based upon the monopoly that the Government has given to the company. If the company shares are now worth Â£3 lis. 6d., it would be good business for the Government to sell its half interest which would be worth approximately Â£1,800,000. That would be sufficient to give to each of Australia's 7,000,000 people a Christmas box of approximately 5s. In the year 1942, shares in Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited were listed at Â£2 3s. 6d. To-day, it is said, they are worth Â£3 lis. 6d. This means a return of Â£2 15s. lid., per cent, on .the money invested, which is less than the interest paid on government loans. With the shares listed at Â£3 lis. 6d., it would appear that, if the Government agrees to purchase a half interest in the company at the amount of compensation suggested, it will be paying at the rate - of Â£6 a share. The only other point I desire to' raise is that should the Government work in conjunction with the company in the manufacturing business, will not the company be in a position to obtain concessions unfairly in competition with other companies? </para>

Otherwise, it will provide ground for the belief that the company will be in a position to obtain concessions unfairly over other companies. The public must be assured that the company would not receive any unfair consideration. As I said earlier, this is a colossal proposal. I join in the tribute paid by other honorable senators to the officers responsible' for the preparation of the bill and the compilation of the facts placed before us in the Minister's second-reading speech. I hope that at the committee stage the Minister will exhibit the same frankness in explaining the various points which, I have no doubt, will then be raised. If he does so, we may make the measure a little more acceptable than it is in its present form. </para>

In view of the fact that most of the Postmasters-General who have handled similar negotiations in the past have been members of this chamber, I should like to have seen the measure introduced in the Senate. I know that the bill contains an appropriation clause which virtually makes it a money bill. However, for the reason I have just mentioned, the Government could have made provision in respect of appropriation in a separate measure with a view to enabling this bill to be introduced in this chamber. I pay tribute to the officials of the Postmaster-General's Department, who, after long years of effort, have been responsible for obtaining unanimity with other dominions with respect to. control of Empire communications by the various governments. That achievement is a monument to their capacity, and also their patience. </para>

I cannot understand why the Government should set up such a body to handle this public service when officers of the Postma ster-General's Department are capable of undertaking this work. Why the taxpayers should be put to the expense involved in the appointment of the proposed commission is beyond my comprehension. .Control of these communications should be handed over to the Postin a s  ster-G eneral's Departmen  t. </para>
                    <para>Some astonishing statements have been made with' respect to the dividends paid by, and the financial ramifications of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I make only one comment with regard to the investment of the people's money in this hybrid organization. Figures supplied to me by the Treasury show that since the company was established in 1922 it has paid dividends to the Commonwealth amounting to Â£648,773 as at the 30th June, 1945. That is the dividend paid by the company on the money invested by the Commonwealth during the last 22 years; and it is not an  unsatisfactory  result. In the initial years, 1922-23, and portion of 1924, the operations of the company were not very profitable; but during the 22 years the return on the Commonwealth's investment of Â£501,000 averages approximately 5J per cent. That is quite a good effort by the company. The return may have been higher in certain years, but the proof of the soundness of the investment is in the general average over the full period. I should like to see the communications branch of the service dissociated from the manufacturing operations, and the company allowed to carry on manufacturing in competition with other companies, because such competition will guarantee efficiency. I repeat that I can see no reason for the establishment of an expensive commission when officers of the Postmaster-General's Department, who are rendering a public service equally important, are capable of controlling telecommunications in this country. </para>

                        for many years, and I have never worked with anybody who has been more capable, or conscientious in his duties. In respect of aircraft production problems he helped greatly to overcome difficulties which appeared to be almost insurmountable. Since I have been Postmaster-General I have had the privilege of meeting among' employees of the department men and women who are inspired by the service motive rather than by the profit motive. Their highest ambition is to render the best service possible to  the people.
                    </para>
                    <para>The Leader of the Opposition referred to the probable position of employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited when this plan is implemented. Ample provision is made in clause 18 to ensure that all employees of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited who are engaged exclusively on communications shall be transferred to the service of the commission. There is a proviso that the commission is obliged to take over only employees for whom it can find suitable employment. However, it is expected that the commission will have need of all skilled personnel now employed by those companies. Further, a committee will be appointed to provide an over-all safeguard to employees andon that committee the employees will be represented.  .The committee will deal with all matters concerning the staffs affected by this plan. It will see if it is possible to provide employment for employees likely to be regarded as redundant. Not many employees are likely to come within that class, but should there be some the committee will make recommendations with respect to the provision of other employment for them. Everything done in that connexion will be based, as far as possible, on the principle of conference and agreement; We all recognize that these men  have  rendered very useful service, and : the Government has everything to gain  and nothing to lose by doing its best to  help  them. The Leader of the Opposition said that it was a mistake for the Commonwealth to retain its interest in the manufacturing activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. The Commonwealth has participated in those activities for more than 24 years, and there appears to be no good reason why at this stage the Government should terminate an arrangement which has operated satisfactorily for such a long period. Moreover, it would be unjust for the Commonwealth to withdraw its financial investment in those activities during the period of the company's reconstruction. At that time the company will be faced with a considerable number of problems, and the withdrawal of the Government's investments would place it in a particularly unfortunate position. The Government does not desire that to happen. In addition, the employees of the company are anxious that nothing should be done to cause any disruption which would result in unemployment. The Government appreciates the wisdom of moving slowly in these matters and of doing so only by consultation and agreement. I am sure that honorable senators would not expect the Government just to say, " We will take over the telecommunications side of the company's business without making provision for the disturbance that is likely to occur". Many alterations and adjust- ments must be made, and such radical changes cannot be made overnight. Both the Leader of the Opposition and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> in referring to the compensation that they understood would be paid to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, said that the figure was too high. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Gibson</inline> cited the present value of the company's shares at Â£3 lis. 6d., and said that the price had increased considerably since the Government's intention to nationalize the overseas telecommunication services had been announced. The fact is that a final agreement has not yet been made with the company. Negotiations, are proceeding,, and it is expected that an amount will be agreed upon. However, I point, out that, in addition to the purchase of the physical assets concerned, the loss of profits resulting from the termination of agreements made by the company must be taken into account. The company has always maintained that it has valuable rights in such agreements. We must not overlook the fact that, in acquiring the telecommunication assets and services of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited, the Commonwealth will acquire not only full ownership of the physical assets but also full revenue benefits arising from the conduct of the services. Therefore, adequate and reasonable compensation must be paid to the private shareholders for loss of rights and interests at present held by them in 'those services. The increased value of the company's shares has no bearing whatever on the amount of compensation to be paid to the company* In connexion with what <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'flaherty</inline> said in relation to employees, it is expected that the commission will be in a position to absorb a majority, if not all, of the persons employed in the telecommunication services of the two companies. However, if the commission finds that it cannot profitably employ certain members of the staffs, the <inline font-style="italic">ad hoc</inline> committee to which I have already referred will consider means whereby these employees may not be placed at any financial disadvantage. The committee will consist of representatives of the Government, the commission, the two companies, and the employees. It will also give consideration to various matters affecting the welfare of the transferred employees in order to ensure fair treatment for them. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> also referred to the policy of the commission in relation to the purchase of materials. In my introductory speech, I said that the policy of the commission would be to purchase materials in Australia if possible. If materials are not available locally, it will obtain them from Great Britain. That is the policy of the Postal Department at present. If equipment cannot be made in Australia, it purchases its requirements from Great Britain. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> referred to the provision in clause 29 of the bill for the making of initial advances to Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited up to an amount of Â£3,000,000. He said that this appeared to be an invitation to the two companies to increase their valuation of the assets to be transferred, because the amount specified was probably much greater than the true value of the assets. Clause 29 merely imposes a limit of Â£3,000,000 on initial advances. The actual words used are, "not exceeding in all the sum of Â£3,000,000 ". That amount must not be regarded as the amount of the advances which will actually be made to the commission. The total will probably be considerably less than that. The figure also provides for working capital to be advanced to the commission apart from the price to be paid to the companies for the acquisition of their telecommunication assets and the surrender of their rights and interests in the services. The amount of Â£3,000,000 also accords with the amount specified in the recently enacted airlines legislation for similar contingencies. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Allan</inline> MacDonald referred to the Government's continued participation in the manufacturing activities of Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited. I repeat that, as the Government will be taking away the major part of the company's business, it will be morally bound to preserve the interests of shareholders. It would be unfair of the Commonwealth to withdraw its financial investment during the period of the company's reconstruction. The telecommunication services should be taken over only under conditions which will obviate financial loss to the people concerned. Although we may have our own views about what the shareholders are entitled to receive, the fact is that the company has accepted the Government's plan in good faith. The Government desires to be reasonable and just. </para>

                        <para>Some have returned to Australia and their places have been taken by other  cablemen  at intervals within the last three years. In every case an injustice would be perpetrated, as the requisite period under this clause cannot lie complied with.

                        <para>In World -War I., the Government of the day refused to accept these men as volunteers for the Australian Imperial Force, as the very nature of their occupation rendered them indispensable in maintaining communications overseas.

At Hong kong, Singapore, Batavia, Labuan - to mention but a . few cable stations where they maintained communications with the outside world to the last, finally falling into the hands of the Japanese. Under the bill in its present form these men would be denied employment and we feel constrained to ask for a full explanation of what compensation they would receive if not engaged by the Commission, so that they would not be placed at a disadvantage.' </para>
                        <para>With this in mind, we question the preference to be extended to certain former ex-Postmaster-General employees who transferred to the Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited at its formation in 1922. </para>

Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> regarding this important new clause because it conflicts with what the committee has just decided. Moreover, I object strongly in principle to allowing any employer to determine the rate of pay that shall apply to any position. The Commonwealth Public Service Act contains provisions for determining the rates of salary or wages which shall be paid to employees of the Commonwealth,  but  no such provision is contained in this  bill.  I  regard  the proposed new clause as most dangerous. It will lead to a great deal of conflict between the commission and its employees. </para>

                        <para>. - I support the view expressed by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan.</inline> I have had experience of employers who have taken to themselves the right to alter the classification of the positions held by their employees. For instance, a man may be classified as a clerk, first class, the rate for which may be Â£6 a week, but the employers have reclassified him as clerk, second class, thereby reducing his salary to Â£58s. a week. This provision gives to the commission the right to re-classify its employees. In the Commonwealth Public Service classifications are made by the Public Service Board. In a case where no specific classification has been made, an application may be made to the Public Service Arbitrator. If mandatory action is taken to alter a classification there is trouble immediately. This provision gives to the proposed commission the right to override awards and to make its own classifications. I am sure that that is not the intention of the Government. </para>

                        <para>.  - Recently, the Broadcasting Committee reviewed the Australian Broadcasting Commission's regulations. These regulations were discussed in the presence of representatives of the Australian Broadcasting Commission itself, employees of the Australian Broadcasting Commission, and the Australian Journalists Association. Although quite a number of regulations were contested, no exception was taken to the provision corresponding to that now under discussion. As the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> has pointed out, a similar provision exists in the Commonwealth Pub lic Service Act, the Commonwealth Bank Act, and the Australian National Airlines Act. I understand that the War Service Homes Commission too is clothed with similar power, and that no complaint has been made. Dealing with the Australian Broadcasting Commission's regulations the committee was concerned very much with the provision relating to the declaring vacant of positions. It was stated that the object of this provision was that promotions should not be made without due regard to the claims of all officers interested. If there was justification for the inclusion of this provision in the other legislation that has been mentioned, I see no reason whyit should be omitted from this measure. </para>

In any case, its inclusion in other acts does not mean that it is right, and it is high time that officers of the departments concerned got busy and brought the anomaly to the notice of the respective Ministers. I have had considerable industrial experience, including the interpretation of awards, and I have seen wide powers such as this exercised unfairly by employers This clause is not consistent with the one to which we have just agreed, and, in view of the late hour, I ask the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> to have it re-examined. I am rather perturbed also about the replies given to <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Armstrong's</inline> questions.

I suggest that progress be reported so that honorable senators, and the Postmaster-General himself, may examine these proposals more closely.

                        (New South Wales; [10.34].  -  It is necessary to make the proposed provision in order to cover the cases of employees who may be found guilty of committing some offence in respect of which the penalty may be a reduction of status. For instance, a manager might be reduced to the status of assistant manager. In that case the employee would be penalized, but the position he originally held would not be affected. However, any person so penalized has the right to appeal to an appeal board against the decision of the commission. Provision must be made for the application of penalties in certain circumstances. The proposal to establish a Promotions Appeal Board is a new provision and will provide complete protection for the employee. Circumstances might arise analogous to those which recently arose in respect of the position of the State manager for New South Wales of the Australian Broadcasting Commission. The commission has a manager in each State, but as thehead-quarters of the commission were established in New South Wales it was decided to abolish the position of state manager in New South Wales in order to eliminate duplication. The commission proposed to be set up under this measure might find itself in a similar position, and the new clause will enable it to take action to eliminate waste.

                            <para>- I do not know whether it is proposed to bring these employees under the Commonwealth Public Service Superannuation Act or to provide a separate superannuation scheme for them. New officers will be appointed from time to time according to the procedure provided in this bill. They will become employees of the commission. I submit that they will not automatically come within the Commonwealth Public Service. Thus there are quite a number of -matters which reveal conflict with recognized industrial practice. I believe that inadvertently these aspects have escaped the notice of the Minister. However, I intend to see that' they are not overlooked. I hope that in the future more care will be taken in the drafting of measures to observe the recognized industrial practice in relation to employees of authorities of this kind. T regret that the proposed amendments and new clauses were not made available to honorable senators in time to enable them to study them carefully. </para>

                        <para>. -  Much of what has been said on this matter is not justified. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> has argued in absolute terms. He would argue that the commission has power to do all the things he has indicated regardless of any other provision in the measure. That is not correct. Whatever the commission does under new clause  18a  would be subject to other provisions in the bill and other new clauses. For instance, another clause prevents the commission from interfering in any way with the rates of wages or conditions of employment laid down in an award of the Arbitration Court. Any officer who does not come under a court award would have the right to appeal to the Promotions Appeal Board against any action taken in respect of him individually. </para>

I shall not argue whether- such practice is right, or wrong. I simply say that this established practice has never been objected to by organizations of the employees concerned, and, that being so, we are justified in assuming that such organizations acquiesce in the provision being made. If they have any objection to the procedure now proposed they would have made their objection known. However, no objection has been taken to similar provisions in the Commonwealth Bank Act, the Commonwealth Public Service Act and the Australian National Airlines Act. </para>

                        <para>. -  I read the new clause with a great deal of trepidation, but I am not so conversant with industrial legislation as are <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty,</inline> and I commend them for drawing its faults to the attention of the committee. I have heard nothing from the Minister to change my view that  the proposal is gravely objectionable. I resent his adoption of the view that, because nobody has objected to a practice that is unfair to employees, he has the right to perpetuate it. I do not believe that the Minister has considered this matter. I have always believed him to be sympathetic towards employees, and I am sure that he would not knowingly cause them to suffer a hardship. I am very disappointed in him. Bte appears to be more intolerant than some of the employers whom he has castigated on many occasions. I agree with <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> that this matter should be very carefully considered, and I support <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays's proposal that consideration of the new clause should be postponed to enable us to secure further information about it before a division is taken. </para>

                        <para>. - <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> says that he wants time to consider the new clause. We are considering it now; there should be no objection to that. I have no objection to the honorable senator considering it; I assumed that he was capable of understanding it and making up his mind in the time at our disposal. It would be quite unreasonable to adjourn the consideration of the new clause. Does the honorable senator object to the commission having the right to create or abolish a position in the service of the commission? Should the commission have some authority, or does the honorable gentleman want it to be subservient to the authority of some unspecified person? Sub-clause 2 of new clause 18a provides that the commission may reclassify any position by raising or lowering the salary, or the range of salary, applicable to the position. If, in the judgment of the commission, a change warranting the reclassification of a position occurs, it should have power to make such* a reclassification. Consider the work of skilled artisans engaged in the manufacture of guns or aircraft. When war broke out, it was found that their work could be done by semi-skilled workers operating up-to-date machinery. Therefore, a reclassification was made. Such reclassifications, to which the honorable senator apparently objects, are taking place every week. That is one reason why there is a continual state of industrial turmoil in which employers are taking advantage of these reclassifications. When a position is reclassified it is deemed to be a new position. What I have said is in conformity with established practice, to which no objection has been made until now. At any rate, I have never heard of any such objection by a recognized organization. The honorable senator is merely splitting straws. </para>

                            <para>- The Government supporters opposed the Minister. When <inline font-weight="bold">Senator- Mattner</inline> voiced similar opposition, the Minister rose and was offensive to him. Having thrown down a list of amendments in front of us, he should be willing to report progress to enable us to consider them overnight. He implied that <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner</inline> is not capable of understanding the new clause now before the committee, and that he, himself, is the only person who does understand it. After a casual examination of the provision, it appears to me that the objections to it by Senato Sheehan and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator O'Flaherty</inline> have a great deal of force. The Minister would be wise to say, " Let us examine the proposal overnight to see whether or not 1 have made a mistake ". To ask the committee to pass a series of important amendments in a few minutes is not a proper way of transacting legislative business. I am very pleased that some honorable senators on the Government side of the chamber are not swallowing holusbolus a lot of the proposals submitted by the Minister. </para>

                            <para>- The Minister would help to heal the breach if he agreed to report progress. If he is willing to do so, I shall sit down. The attitude he has adopted is. not characteristic of bini. He is exhibiting a dictatorial- manner that" would be more appropriate to the Union of Soviet SocialistRepublics or some other dictatorship. He, who claims to be a democrat, should have some respect for the rights even of minorities. Some of the Government's supporters are equally as sceptical as Opposition senators about the provisions of this measure. By refusing a simple request at 11 o'clock at night to adjourn discussion until the next morning so that the proposals may be more closely examined, the Minister is likely to delay the passage of the bill instead of facilitating it. </para>

I merely directed his attention to what I consider to be unnecessary opposition to the new clause . and criticized an attempt to convince nic that he had insufficient time to consider it. I pointed out as dispassionately as I could, and as courteously as is my custom, that the committee had plenty of time to consider the matter. If <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie</inline> had asked for time to consider the schedule of amendments when it was first submitted I should have been the first to accede to his request. However, the honorable senator has not referred to the matter until now. </para>

The provision consists of only seven or eight lines of printed matter, and honorable senators opposite should not need more than a casual glance at il to enable them to interpret it. The Minister made a reasonable suggestion that the committee should deal with proposed new clause 18a' and then report progress. The whole  discussion has centred on the remainder of the proposed new clauses. </para>

                        <para>. -  The fears expressed by the Opposition are unjustified. All of the employees of the commission, with the exception of the manager and other officers in receipt of more than Â£1,500 a year, will have their rates of pay and conditions of employment determined by awards of the Public Service Arbitrator or the Arbitration Court, and the commission will have no power to interfere in the matter. The proposed new clause under consideration provides that the commission may from time to time reclassify any positions in the service of the commission by raising or lowering the salary applicable to the position, and whenever any position is reclassified it shall be deemed to be vacant. Although the commission may do those things, provision will be made later for the establishment of a Promotions Appeal Board to which employees may go if they consider that they have been unjustly treated. The Minister has foreshadowed his intention to move for the insertion of the following new clauses : -  18j. Unless the Commission, in any particular case, otherwise directs, the appointment ot every officer (not being an officer to whom subsection (11.) or (12.) of section eighteen of this Act applies) shall be on probation for a period not exceeding twelve months and the appointment may be terminated- by the Commission at any time during that period. 18k. - (1.) If an officer appears to the Commission to be inefficient or incompetent, or unfit to discharge or incapable of discharging the duties of his position the Commission may retire him from the Service of the Commission, or may transfer him to some other position in the Service of the Commission with salary appropriate to that other position. (2.) An officer shall not be retired from the Service of the Commission under this sec tion unless he has been given at least one month's notice or is paid salary in lieu of notice. 18L. The Commission may dismiss an officer, or reduce his status or rate of pay, for incapacity or misconduct. 18m. - (1.) Where an officer is dismissed, retired, transferred or reduced in status or rate of pay under either of the last two preceding sections, the officer may appeal to the Disciplinary Appeal Board. </para>

                        (Western Australia)  [11.14J.-  I have been trying to ascertain how the employees are to be protected under this measure. The new clause under discussion gives the commission the right to create any new position in its' service and to abolish any such position. It is also to be given the right to reclassify any position by raising or lowering the salary, or the range of salary, applicable to the position. Whenever any position is reclassified, it is to be deemed to be vacant. If a position is reclassified, it automatically becomes vacant. Proposed new sub-clause 18L reads -

Are we to say that it shall not have the power to create, abolish or reclassify a position ? A successful business undertaking must have some control of its employees. In order to protect employees against unfair treatment the bill gives to them certain fights. The proposal is easily understood; there is no ambiguity about its language. </para>

Whatever may be said by the Minister, the fact remains that the new clause was not in the bill as originally drafted. If it is as important as the Minister would have us believe, it is strange that the need for it was not realized by him or the parliamentary draftsman when the bill was being prepared. It is all very well for <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan,</inline> who first raised the point, to back down when he finds the Opposition supporting him. The wording of the proposed new clause  18a  is clear; under it, the commission is to be given powers in addition to those originally intended. </para>

                        <para>. - Obviously <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Herbert</inline> Hays is deliberately exaggerating the possibilities of this provision. He knows that a wrong can be done under any act on the statute-book. A great deal depends on the administration of the legislation passed by the Parliament. If administrative officers deliberately set out to act unjustly, they can do so. The honorable senator assumes that the members of the commission will consist of men who will consciously and deliberately act unfairly towards the employees of the commission. If an employee of the commission considers that he has been treated unfairly, there is provision for him to appeal to an independant tribunal. </para>

                        <para>.- The fact that we have had so many amendments placed before us at this late hour is an indication .that those responsible for the drafting of this bill have not had sufficient time to give to it the consideration that it demands. It was stated earlier to-day that over a long period of years various Postmaster-General had considered bills similar to this. That would suggest that those responsible for the drafting of this measure had a good foundation on which to start. This measure has already passed through the House of Representatives. Is it not reasonable to ask why some of the amendments now before us were not made before the measure reached this chamber? </para>

                            <para>- My purpose will be served by drawing attention to the fact that sub-clause 12 of clause 18 refers to employees for whom the commission can find suitable employment. Bearing that fact in mind, the importance of the new clause now under discussion is obvious. I should like to obtain from the Postmaster-General <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Cameron)</inline> a clarification of the position. I had hoped that we would be able to discuss this matter without resorting to personalities, believing that on both sides of the chamber there is an honest desire to do the right thing. After all it is only because we feel some sense of responsibility that we appeal to the Post-  master-General to hasten slowly, so that we may avoid perpetuating the errors that may have been made by highly qualified public servants in preparing' this measure. </para>

                        <para>. - I am pleased to learn that a member of the Opposition has such sympathy for the employees of the companies concerned. Certainly he is much more sympathetic than <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Leckie,</inline> who apparently is content to see an injustice done without fighting it. If this new clause is wrong, let us debate it all night if necessary and put it right. This measure proposes to set up a new organization to takeover a function which in the , past has been carried out by private enterprise. Many times honorable senators opposite have said that government enterprises cannot succeed ; yet, when the Government seeks to provide for a certain degree of resilience in the commission's administration, Opposition senators raise their voices in protest. At present, employees of the companies are classified in a certain way, and arereceiving certain payments. In the years to come the scope of the telecommunication service may alter considerably. Provision may have to be made for television, and the progress may be such that the present classifications will not suffice. New classifications may have to he added and old ones changed. It may be necessary to reduce the status of certain jobs. I do not think that any rigid restrictions should be imposed upon the commission. The commission must have the right to alter classifications and vary remunerations up or down. Amalgamated Wireless (Australasia) Limited and Cable and Wireless Limited have been in operation for many years, and their employees have not had the benefit of an appeal board. The Government is prepared to retain existing classifications, and to provide extra protection by setting up a Promotions Appeal Board. I believe therefore we should agree to the inclusion of clause 18a. </para>
