                            <para>- The Commonwealth Government acknowledges its responsibility in this matter in respect of the areas served by the Trans-Australian Railway under the powers conferred upon it by the people at the recent referendum, but it has not yet had time to develop a complete national medical scheme. Hospital accommodation is peculiarly a State function. The States have not only concurrent jurisdiction with the Commonwealth in this matter, but also a prime duty in respect of hospital accommodation. If there is a need such as is indicated by the honorable senator##'##s question, the Commonwealth Government will consider the matter, and should it be found that the States are unable to act without Commonwealth assistance, and that the need U real, I shall give the matter my careful attention.</para>

                    <quote>
                        <para>During last session Parliament passed the Australian Broadcasting Bill, which contained very important amendments of our broadcasting legislation. The Royal assent has been given to that measure, but I understand that because of some hold-up it will not become operative until the beginning of next year. Will the Postmaster-General, who introduced the measure, ascertain who is responsible for delaying the promulgation of certain sections of that measure, and what is the reason for such delay? </para>
                    </quote>
                    <para>Immediately the amending legislation was passed by the Parliament, steps were taken to promulgate the measure, and all sections came into operation on the 1st October, 1946, excepting those relating to the staff of the commission, namely, sections 3, 4, 6, 7 and 19. After consultation with the Attorney-General##'##s Department and the Australian Broadcasting Commission, the proclamation of the sections mentioned, which relate to the commission##'##s staff, -were deferred because it was clear that certain provisions of these sections would be ineffective unless appropriate regulations were issued at the same time. It was decided that these regulations should be incorporated in the general Australian Broadcasting Commission (Staff) Regulations which had been drafted prior to the passing of the act, and which had, in consequence, to be revised in several important respects. It was hoped that these regulations would be completed within a few weeks, and would thus enable the remainder of the Act to be proclaimed and the regulations gazetted on the 1st November. The commission, however, because of unavoidable delays, was unable to complete the final draft of the regulations in time for this to be done. I have taken up the matter with the commission, and have stressed the need for finality being reached as quickly as possible. I hope that it will be possible to promulgate the outstanding sections of the act at an early date. </para>

However, the best way to test this would be for the Public Service Arbitrator to request the acting Chief Judge to permit him to consider the claim. </para>

              <para>It has been suggested to me that, on days when the proceedings of the Senate are being broadcast, questions on notice should be read by the honorable senator in whose name they appear on the notice-paper, and that then the appropriate Minister should reply. That, I think, is a good suggestion. When I call upon an honorable senator who has a question on the notice-paper, I ask that he shall read his question or questions and then the Minister will reply.</para>

I thought that in his maiden speech in this chamber, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devlin,</inline> in well-chosen language, indicated a moderate approach to the important problems that lie ahead. I do not propose to speak at length, but at the outset I express the view that the Speech was the most vague, the weakest, and the most anaemic statement of policy on behalf of a government that I have ever heard. It is almost impossible to debate the Speech in detail because every paragraph of it deals with vague generalities. On this occasion, honorable senators sitting in opposition, to use a phrase once employed on a similar occasion, ##"## speak with dying voices politically##"##, but I remind the Government that we on this side who were defeated at the recent elections were elected by a majority of the voters of Australia to serve until the end of June, 1947, and therefore we propose to express our views on behalf of those who elected us with the same vigour, enthusiasm and sincerity as we have done in the past. It is interesting to examine the official figures in connexion with the voting at the elections held on the 28th September last. I propose to cite only the Senate figures. Candidates of the Australian Labour party received 2,133,273 formal votes, and Liberal and Australian Country party candidates 1,774,922 formal votes. On that result we on this side of the chamber have a right and duty to appeal to the Government to give due attention to the point of view which we put forward on behalf of the electors who voted in support of candidates of the opposition parties. At the recent poll, other votes totalled 189,032, whilst no fewer than 356,614 votes were informal. Thus, Government candidates received approximately 48 per cent, of the total votes cast, Liberal and Australian Country party candidates 40 per cent., and other candidates 4.24 per cent., whilst 8 per cent, were informal. </para><para>I appeal to the Government to give to the Parliament and the people detailed information with respect to its future defence policy. All who had practical administrative experience during the war years, when this country was attacked bv the Japanese, have this subject uppermost in their minds. It behoves the </para><para class="block">Government to tell the people, in their own interest, what proposals it has under consideration in respect of future defence policy.  We shall then be less likely to slip back into the position in which we found ourselves prior to the last war. 1 do not intend at this juncture to delve into past history on the subject. Each party in this Parliament must accept its share of  responsibility  for our unpreparedness when the last war broke out. However, when we read statements by national leaders published recently in the pres3, we must view with alarm the ##"##resent unpreparedness of Great Britain, Australia. Canada and even the United States of America. The press reports this week that the British Prime Minister, <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Attlee,</inline> told Labour party leaders and trade union leaders in Great Britain that he regarded the present world situation as so troublesome that Britain##'##s armed forces at the end of the year would not be allowed to fall below 1,500,000, whereas previously it was proposed to reduce the total strength of those forces to 1,000,000. Simultaneously, he announced nationwide peace-time conscription  for every man reaching the age of eighteen year.=. One statement reads - </para><para>Recognition by the United Kingdom Government of the vital importance of national defence becomes more of an example to our own Government when it is realized that <inline font-weight="bold">Mr Attlee##'##s</inline> Government took these decisions in defiance of the left-wing extremists. </para><para class="block">We also read in to-day##'##s press the report of a statement by a distinguished American soldier, General Kenney, in which he draws the attention of the American people to the present unpreparedness of that country. In view of these facts, we receive no comfort from the vague generalities which appear in the Governor-General##'##s Speech dealing with defence policy. Of course, as all of us know, the subject-matter of that Speech was supplied by the government of the day as advisers to B!is Royal Highness. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>122</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0W</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ASHLEY, William</name><name role="display">Senator Ashley</name></talker><para>- That is nothing unusual. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>122</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KUA</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLEAY, George</name><name role="display">Senator McLEAY</name></talker><para>- Lt was not unusual in the past for our people to be so apathetic and ostrich-like in their approach to this problem that we nearly lost this country in the last war.

The Government must convince the Parliament and the people that everything requiring to be done at this critical stage in respect of this important problem is being done. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I direct attention to the present widespread industrial unrest throughout Australia. After five years of Labour rule in this Parliament, and with Labour Governments in office in five of the six State Parliaments, those of us who are interested in increasing production and in the provision of adequate social security and full employment about which we hear so much talk to-day, cannot but view with alarm the position which has existed for many years. Prior to the recent elections, Ministers and supporters of the Government made this appeal, in effect, to the people and trade unionists, ##"## Whatever you do, do all in your power not to have a strike until after the elections. As soon as we get back, every thing will be all right##"##. However, no doo ner were the elections over than we had the greatest transport strike in the history of this country, with strike after strike in the coal-mining industry. For five years the Government has muddled ;ind meandered along with this problem. The Government has taken over two mines which it has run at a loss. It has appointed political friends to positions to over ride the decisions of Commonwealth and State Arbitration Courts. It has done this, so it says, with the object of maintaining peace in industry. During the last session of the last Parliament we passed a measure to ratify an agreement between the Labour Government of New South Wales and this Government dealing with the control of the coal-mining industry. However, to our amazement we read in the Gover- nor-General##'##3 Speech - </para><quote><para>My Government has been in consultation with the Government of New South Wales regarding the personnel of the joint authority to be appointed in terms of the Coal Industry Act, and an announcement will be made in due course. My Government is very hopeful that the operation of the new Act will materially assist towards better production in the coal industry which is so vital to Australia##'##s economy and to its future progress and development. </para></quote><para>It is four months since the Parliament passed that measure. When we were considering it, we were told by responsible Ministers that its passage was of extreme urgency. However, the joint authority has not yet been appointed. The decisions of Arbitration Courts have not been enforced. Arrangements have been made for coal-miners to work on Saturdays, for which they receive payment at the rate of time and a half ; but reports have come through that miners, because they work on Saturdays are not prepared to work on Mondays, or Tuesdays. The result is that coal production is not sufficient to meet the needs of the community. Strike after strike has taken place in the industry since the legislation mentioned was passed. If, after five years in office the Government takes four months to appoint the proposed coal authority, what ground have we to hope that it will be able to obtain adequate coal production? The result of the shortage of coal is that great hardship is being inflicted on many sections of the community, and thousands of men have been thrown out of employment. </para><para>The Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> and his Ministers are trying to do all they can to prevent inflation in this country. However, it must be obvious that nothing, will tend to bring about inflation somuch as ##"##go-slowism##"##  in industry##'## and the tactics of extremists in the tradeunions who are preventing their members from working overtime in key industries such as those engaged in the manufacture of galvanized iron, cement and other commodities, which are so urgently required by the community. These things are creating a bottleneck. Big organizations are tooled up in preparation for the employment of thousands of men next year, but they will be compelled to work at only half capacity because of the shortage of sheet steel and other similar materials. I .am amazed that the Government is prepared to stand idly by whilst extremists decide that workers shall not be permitted to work overtime in these industries. In the building industry, too, men are being urged to ##"##go slow##"## because they are unable to obtain increased wages and shorter working hours. The Government##'##s muddling and inaction in the face of these things is appalling and alarming. </para><para>In paragraph 32 of the Governor-General##'##s Speech one finds a most amazing statement which, in itself,##'## is ample evidence of the Government##'##s lack of appreciation of the urgency of resolving the questions of higher wages and shorter working hours and bringing about industrial peace. Six months ago, the Government ordered the Commonwealth Court of Conciliation and Arbitration to hear the .application by trade unions for a 40-hour week. I cannot imagine any intelligent body of men being so lacking in good judgment as to take that action at a time of national emergency when there was an urgent need for more work and increased production. Many months ago, members of the Opposition in this chamber stressed the fact that the problems of increased wages and fewer hours of work were interlocked. We urged the Govern##"##ment to ask the Arbitration Court to ##"##consider the question of wages as well as that of hours; but the Government exhibited its usual stubbornness. Now,  after  six months##'## delay, during which an election has taken place, the Government has approached the court in a most unsatisfactory manner, with an instruction that the question of wages be considered side by side with that of hours. This means, in effect, that the unions wasted five months presenting their case to the Arbitration Court </para><para>I understand that the Government proposes to introduce legislation under its defence powers to carry out certain controls now exercised under the National Security Act. In the past, honorable senators opposite argued that the Government was unable to do anything to remove wage pegging and so permit workers to earn a remuneration adequate to provide them with a reasonable standard of living in these days of rising costs. I have no hesitation in expressing my personal opinion that, under modern conditions, ##Â£##4 18s. -a week is totally inadequate to provide for a man, wife, and one child. If ever there was a time when good pay should be given for high production, it is now, when we have record high prices, ample markets for our products, and other favorable circumstances that are likely to continue for many months and perhaps years. After all this delay and trouble, this muddling </para><para class="block">Government now proposes, in accordance with paragraph 32 of the Governor-General##'##s Speech -  . . to set up as early as possible a committee, . including representatives of both parties in industry, to inquire into and report upon aspects of the basic wage. The setting up of this committee will not preclude earlier consideration by the court of any application that may bc made relating to the amount of the basic wage or the principles upon which it is determined or varied. </para><para class="block">I invite the Minister for Supply and Shipping <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator Ashley)</inline> to tell the Senate what has prompted the Government to set up an independent body, the authority of which will bo limited to giving advice. If the Arbitration Court is competent, and has jurisdiction over these matters, it should carry out the inquiry. To appoint a special committee at this stage will be a waste of time. In 1920, the then Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Hughes)</inline> appointed a similar committee consisting of representatives of employers and employees which recommended to the Government of the day that the minimum living wage for a man, wife, and three children under fourteen years of age should be ##Â£##5 14s. 7d. per week. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>124</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K0W</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">ASHLEY, William</name><name role="display">Senator Ashley</name></talker><para>- The recommendation was never given effect. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>124</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KUA</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLEAY, George</name><name role="display">Senator McLEAY</name></talker><para>- That is <inline font-style="italic">60.</inline> and whatever this proposed committee does or says will not be heeded either, because it will have no authority. Its appointment is only a smoke-screen to cloud the issue. This is a job for the Arbitration Court alone,##'## and I hope that the court will be given an opportunity to deal with it promptly. The court is experienced in taking and sifting evidence. If the Government believes that the Arbitration Court requires strengthening, then it is quite within the power of the Government to take whatever action it considers wise in that direction ; but it is ludicrous to have two bodies inquiring into this matter, one without any real authority, and, so far as I can gather, not competent to give a reasoned and unprejudiced judgment such as would be given by the Arbitration Court. On several occasions during the currency of the last Parliament, the Minister for Health and Social Services <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McKenna)</inline> and other Government spokesmen stated that the </para></talk.start></continue><para class="block">Government proposed to amend the Commonwealth Conciliation and Arbitration Act; but although the Government has held office for five years, during which industrial dislocation has been greater than at any time in our history, no action has yet been taken in this direction. This matter should be speeded up. </para><para>One of the most misleading and lying statements made during the recent election campaign was that of a Cabinet Minister, who said that the reason for the Government##'##s refusal to pay child endowment in respect of the first child of any family was that such a concession would mean that the basic wage would be reduced by 12s. 6d. per week. I hope that in the course of this debate the Minister responsible for that utterance will explain the grounds upon which he bases his grossly misleading assertion. When the Menzies Government introduced the child endowment scheme in 1940, the basic wage was not reduced. In fact, since that time it has increased considerably. If there is one section of the wage-earners of this country that is entitled to more consideration than any other in this time of rising costs, it is married men with children; but no fewer than 1,000,000 homes are excluded from the benefit of child endowment under the present legislation. I trust that the Government will again give consideration to this matter. </para><para>In regard to the serious problem of housing, we are not making anything like the progress that should be made towards a solution. The Commonwealth has ##"## passed the buck ##"## to the States; yet in the Governor-General##'##s Speech it is suggested that some marvellous agreement has been reached with the States to speed up the production of homes. If Ministers have been able to bring about some magical agreement, their duty is to explain the. details of it to the Senate so that we may give this important matter the consideration which it deserves. How- ever, from the reports that I have seen concerning the position in various States, it appears to be a well-known fact that, because of the shortage of materials, the shortage of skilled labour, and the union ban on overtime, the production of houses is far below the target set by the authorities. I refer to a newspaper report of the 5th November dealing with the housing programme in South Australia. It states - </para><quote><para>A comparison between figures in a report presented to the Premier <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Playford)</inline> recently by the Director-General of Building Materials <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. J. W. Wainwright)</inline> and the latest information released by the Government Statistician <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. A. W. Bowden)</inline> discloses that while 11,251 building permits were sought in the eight months ending September 30th last, only 1,087 homes were built in South Australia during the first nine months of this year. </para></quote><para class="block">Those figures are alarming. The Commonwealth Government has expended thousands of pounds on the publication of booklets, which have been circulated throughout Australia, containing promises regarding house construction. I challenge Ministers to state the number of houses actually completed on behalf of the War Service Homes Commission since the end of the war. I ask them also to give figures for all house construction throughout Australia so that we can see whether the total is anywhere near the70,000 houses a year which will have to be built for the next ten years if we are to overtake the shortage. The provision of homes and hospital accommodation is of the utmost importance, but this unimaginative Government apparently has no appreciation of the urgency of the matter. Evidently it is afraid to make a supreme effort to solve the problem. Men should be working overtime to build houses and hospitals, and they should be paid good wages for doing so without having most of their overtime pay filched from them by means of high taxes. Unless the Government attacks this problem in a businesslike way and on a large scale, chaos will continue to rule throughout Australia and people will have to go without houses and hospital accommodation. I have mentioned the seriousness of this matter on many occasions in this chamber. There has been plenty of talk by Ministers, but an almost complete lack of action. There seem to be only two possible kinds of government in the Commonwealth - the slow and the very slow. </para><para class="block">This Government is very slow. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>125</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JXE</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">NASH, Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Nash</name></talker><para>- But very sound. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>125</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KUA</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLEAY, George</name><name role="display">Senator McLEAY</name></talker><para>-Too much sound and not enough action. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The last matter to which I direct attention, namely, the policy of the Government in relation to import licensing, is of very great importance. A Division of Import Procurement was established during the war to restrict the importation of goods from other countries. I nui amazed that, although the war ended ii bout fifteen months ago, this Government permits to remain in existence an instrumentality which refuses to allow the unrestricted importation of goods oven from the United Kingdom. I consider that the action of the Government in prohibiting certain imports from the  United  Kingdom constitutes a violation of the Ottawa Agreement. The restriction of imports might have been justifiable during the war, but there can be no justification whatever for the continuation of such a policy now. I had an opportunity to discus##'## this matter with representatives of .British trade interests when I visited London last year. These men were greatly dissatisfied because, although the Empire \vas at peace, the Australian Government continued to use its war-time powers to prevent the importation of British goods which they were anxious to export, to Australia. Honorable senators will recall that the Ottawa Agreement provided that the rates of duty fixed by the Tariff Board would be the only bar to the importation of British goods into Australia, r also remind the Government that, during the war, an extra war duty was imposed on imports. The Government is ##'##abusing its powers by refusing to permit the importation of goods from Great Britain. Australia has a credit balance in London of over ##Â£##200,000,000, and manufacturers in Great Britain urgently need to increase their export trade. In view of these facts, the attitude of this Government in imposing quotas on imports is 3curvy. That is the only appropriate term. The Commonwealth Government has virtually gone on its hands &lt;and knees to plead with the British Government to grant greater preference to Australian exports. Therefore, its attitude in maintaining quotas on British goods in the post-war period is short-sighted, to say the least, and indicates lack of imagination and business ability. I hope that Ministers will speedily revise this policy, because it is causing very grave injustice to the British people. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>126</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K5X</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SHEEHAN, James</name><name role="display">Senator Sheehan</name></talker><para>- Has the honorable senator noticed that Great Britain is not able to satisfy orders from overseas because of the shortage of labour? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>126</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KUA</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLEAY, George</name><name role="display">Senator McLEAY</name></talker><para>- Yes.

Elderly people, many of whom are partially crippled, should not be called upon to travel three miles by tram-car to collect their pensions.

If there were railway transport on standard-gauge lines from Queensland to Western Australia, employment in the latter State would be increased. There .are serious shortages of building materials, and house construction is held up because of inadequate transport facilities.

Australia, ##"## Go on the land, young man ##"##. After World War J. many ex-servicemen were placed on the land, but unfortunately they had not been trained to be farmers. Ex-servicemen are now being trained for life on the land and in addition to being instructed in the production of foodstuffs, they should be taught woolclassing and lamb-marking and tailing. Great benefit would result from the provision of instructors in those subjects in all of the States. </para><para>For many years Australia has not paid sufficient attention to water conservation. The standardization of railway gauges would help to draw attention to the necessity for conserving water. Every possible encouragement should be given to those who take up life on the land. A young married man should be compensated for his outlay in clearing virgin country, and for each child of the marriage a certain reduction should be made from the cost of the property, as is done in some other countries. The present Ministry favours the granting of assistance to young farmers, who may rest assured that the Labour Government will safeguard their interests, during the long period in which it will no doubt remain in office. I draw attention to the actual value of the primary products exported from Western Australia for the year 1938-39. These figures indicate the excess production after the needs of the people of that State had been met. The figures are as follows : - </para><quote><para>Wheat, ##Â£##3.6##]## 0,000; oats, ##Â£##89,340; bailey, ##Â£##51,220; apples, ##Â£##503,493; pears, ##Â£##2S,G51; dried fruits, ##Â£##100,000; wool, ##Â£##4,000,000; fat lambs, ##Â£##317,904; butter, ##Â£##231,137; condensed and dried milk, ##Â£##S1,877; pork, bacon and binns, ##Â£##40.248: poultry and eggs, ##Â£##47.100; total, ##Â£##9,101,089. </para></quote><para>Provided adequate encouragement be given to the man on the land and the necessary education be received by recruits to farming life, I have no doubt that Western Australia will be able to produce results comparable with those of any other State of the Commonwealth.

I had charge of a factory in Western Australia where young ex-servicemen were taught a trade in two and a half years, and many of them are now occupying positions as foremen in factories throughout the Commonwealth. Excellent work is being done by the present Government in providing technical education for ex-servicemen to fit them to engage in both primary and secondary industries, and I hope that they will show their appreciation of the treatment received.

It has been  Raid  that the speech of  His  Royal Highness, the Duke of Gloucester, is a colourless document, and that is, to some degree, true. It is couched in vague and general terms, having been placed in the hands of  His  Royal Highness by his advisers. Certain matters of great moment were, however, omitted from the speech. For example, I might mention immigration and water conservation. During two world wars we have had ersatz substitutes for a hundred and one different things, but there is##'## no substitute for water. I suggest that the population which this country can carry is governed almost entirely by its water supply. The absence of any reference in the Speech to such matters as population, immigration, and water conservation is a grave omission. These matters are wrapped up with##'## defence, a subject to which reference is made in the Speech only in vague and general terms. It is not so much what is said as what is left out, especially with regard to the need for preparedness, that impresses me. I read in the Speech that the Government recognizes Australia##'##s obligation to make a larger contribution towards the defence of the. British Commonwealth. That is a general and vague reference to a common scheme of defence in the Pacific by Britain, New Zealand and Australia. Australians should know what that vague phrase really means. Political assurances do not make a defence policy. When one ask?. ##"## What is Australia##'##s defence policy?##"##, echo answers, ##"##What?##"##. No policy is laid down in the Speech, and it is possible that the Government has not yet considered what its policy shall lie. In 1942 this country narrowly ;##]## verted invasion &lt;and occupation by the Japanese; yet to-day, even before the signing of the peace treaties, our defences have fallen away and are nothing more than plans on paper, if they are even that. In the air we have not one squadron of the Royal Australian Air Force on an operational standard, and there is not a squadron which could quickly be brought to that ##"##standard. Air Vice Marshal Bostock in pointing this out stressed that even our Australian fighter wing in occupied Japan is using obsolescent planes. Signs of decay are evident right through our services, and as far as one can judge, there are no plans for a continuity of policy. If defence is neglected in peace-time, that neglect cannot suddenly be made good. In Australia to-day there are large numbers of men with operational experience in war, and steps should be taken to utilize their services, and so prevent the present lethargy from becoming permanent. If defence were only a matter of machines, and if we were sure that we would not need to renew our armaments for, say, ten years, I would still suggest that we should continue with training and research. As far as I can discover, no proper provision is being made for the future of the Air Force. As for the Army, all that I can discover is some reference by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Forde,</inline> when Minister for the Army, to an interim army of 39,000 men. With fewer ##"##than 50 recruits offering each week, it is clear that the Army will be below 30,000 men in three months time, notwithstanding the publication of such advertisements as I hold in my hand -  ##"## There##'##s a##'## specialist##'##s job for yon in the Army, perhaps, a trip to Japan. Modern armies are technical armies. Specialists are the order of the day. If you##'##re an engineer, electrician, radio expert, carpenter, ##&amp;##c, the Army has a place for you##"##. </para></talk.start><para class="block">And so it goes on. If we are to get  a  satisfactory response to these advertisements we must, as a beginning, ensure that the pay and conditions are good, and, more important still, that there is a future in the Army for those who join it. That is one direction in which Australia has fallen down in the past, and that is one explanation why the response to these advertisements is so pathetic. As I have said, fewer than fifty recruits in the whole of the Commonwealth are offering to join the Army each week. The Navy may get sufficient men to maintain the interim figure of 12,500 men which was announced some time ago, but we must remember that, with the possible exception of Tribal destroyers, our vessels are obsolete. Even our flagship is about 20 years old. The total strength of all the services is only a guess, and a bad guess at that, as to what is required to keep the machinery of our defence from complete decay and ineffectiveness. These totals mean nothing in the light of the phrase ##"## a larger contribution towards the defence of the British Commonwealth ##"##. I suggest that a nation which cannot afford the manpower for a large permanent Navy, Army and Air Force in peace-time can do one of two things. The first choice, which is also the truly democratic one, and should therefore appeal to Australians, is that there should be universal training of young men in our citizen force. When Australia went to war in August, 1914, it was possible to produce a division and have it actually on the water on its way to Egypt in October of that year. Its men were fairly well trained; the personnel did have some skill with their weapons, and they were disciplined. That was because in 1911 universal training was instituted by the Fisher Government. Australia was much better off then than it was in 1939, when it had to improvise because it had discarded the democratic and just method of compulsory training, and had adopted the washed-out voluntary system. Failing to make that choice, we must leave military service to those who volunteer for it; and we can gamble on the result. Because we gambled in the past, many of our young men had to learn in the hard way when war came; thousands of raw militia men  bad to take their elementary small arms course in the swamps and jungles of New Guinea because they had not had any training when civilians. I remember well in World War I. that, as the war progressed,  draffts of  young Australians came to us, and we had to give them what elementary training we could within a few hundred yards of the front line. It is a wicked thing to send the youth of a country into battle without training. But for God##'##s good providence and the help of the United States of America##'## and other allies, many more young Australians would have paid a heavy price for our gambling. Are we going to gamble just as disastrously again? I hope not. The course is clear if we will only approach this matter in the right spirit. The Government should be as willing as is the United Kingdom Government to accept the idea of universal service should the military advisers to the Empire recommend it. It is imperative that the Commonwealth Government should provide money and materials for an interim force on sea, land, and air, which will make service attractive to the best types of young Australians. That brings me back to the conditions of service and the prospects for the future. At 45 years of age men in the Navy are ##"##shot out on the beach ##"## and left to do the best they can for themselves. Security is not something of mushroom growth, and it is more than the expression of vague platitudes. Security can come only from the steady development of a sound plan. We must look ahead and decide on a policy; and there must be continuity of that policy. I well remember when the American Army joined us in 1.918 in front of the Hindenburg Line. I have seen many dreadful things, but I have never seen anything more horrible than the slaughter of the men of the 27th American Division because they were raw and untrained. Thousands of live? were thrown away because of their lack of proper training. It will happen again, unless we prevent it. To-day if we are not to perpetuate the same bloody mistake, we require not words but action. Will this Government have the wisdom and courage to take this essential and vital course? I devoutly hope so. It cannot be said that lying never pays. Hitler knew that technique - the greater the lie, the greater the profit - and that technique paid Hitler handsomely. He would have applauded one of the most successful Australian adaptations of his technique, and one of the most lasting, too, in returning profits, namely, the monstrous lie that the present. Opposition parties in this Parliament were wholly and solely responsible for the state of unpreparedness in which we were caught at the outbreak of the last war. At election after election that lie has served Labour well ;##'## and it has served our side badly. Even- at the last elections there were obvious signs that that lie had by no means outlived its usefulness. Yet one has only to examine his own memory of relevant events between the two world wars to refute the falsehood. It will then be seen that this lie measures right up to Hitler##'##s standard in being actually the truth in reverse. The easily demonstrable fact, which not. even the hawkers of the lie would dare to refute, is that throughout the period between the two world wars Labour was not merely a passive but a most active ##"## no defence ##"##  party.  The active part in wrecking Australia##'##s dpfence establishments, and, right into the period of actual warfare, of opposing moves to restore them, were taken by Labour and by nobody else, unless the Communists can be regarded as a separate force. From the time Labour took the first action in its brief term of office in 1929-31 to abolish universal military service, it was anti.conscriptionist until war, panic and funk forced it to change its policy. Even then, by limiting the area of service to preclude  compulsorily-enlisted  men from helping in the rescue of Japanese-held and Japanese-tortured prisoners of war, Labour still looked at the voting angle and at that frightful price. That is Labour##'##s record which the most blatant hawker of the ##"## unpreparedness ##"## and ##"## defeatist ##"## lie would not attempt to disprove. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>130</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZH</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">AMOUR, Stanley</name><name role="display">Senator Amour</name></talker><para>- I rise to order, ls the honorable senator in order in reading his speech? </para></talk.start></interjection><para>The <inline font-weight="bold">DEPUTY PRESIDENT (Senator Nicholls).</inline> - I was not aware that the honorable senator was reading his speech. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>131</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K3L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SAMPSON, Burford</name><name role="display">Senator SAMPSON</name></talker><para>- I am consulting copious notes. There is no substitute for military training. There is no short cut to defence preparedness. Do not let us fool ourselves into thinking that should another emergency arise we can create an army over-night. We cannot. That way lies madness and national suicide. When war actually comes upon us, we shall not have time to create an army. We must do so in peace-time, when we have time to train men and prepare. Otherwise, when war comes we shall be caught off balance. We shall become muddled, and become involved in the extravagant cost of improvising and, possibly, without having any chance, we shall be obliged to push untrained men into action. This means dreadful casualties. It is a bad ##"## show ##"## in every respect. I repeat that raining for war must be done in peace time. This foul doctrine, this vile lie, has paid regularly in votes. The Labour party knows that fact so well, that Australia now looks certain to continue its present drift into complete unpreparedness so far as the vital defence element of man-power is concerned. Since 1914, at various degrees of unpreparedness, Australia has been involved in two major wars. Realism demands that in future we must prepare constantly for whatever emergency may arise. In spite of any peace terms that, may be made, or any system of international organization that may be established compulsory military training is essential to the future security of Australia. For the past year or more good work has been done in an endeavour to build up an international organization that will, so far as it is humanly possible, prevent war. Notwithstanding any system which may be devised, this vast continent with its sparse population must always be prepared to defend itself. All future wars will be undeclared. They will break upon us without warning. Therefore, Australia at all times should have a large reserve force of trained civilians, a citizen army which is truly democratic. We must have a small leavening of professional soldiers. We cannot afford a wholly professional army. We must be able at short notice to reinforce with a trained citizen soldiery any professional army which we are capable of maintain ing. That would be more economical and effective than maintaining a large professional military establishment which would be quite beyond our means. That is the only sane and sound course for us to pursue. It has been said, and only recently the Prime Minister made some statement to this effect, that in the future war will be scientific. But all wars are as scientific as the period and the times enable them to be. Alexander and the famous Greek generals of ancient history introduced new methods of warfare in their day. We boast about tanks as a modern weapon. Hannibal employed tanks, not the tanks that we know, but armed elephants ; and these were effective until Scipio devised ways and means of defeating them. All wars are scientific. World War I. was as scientific as the world could make it. So to-day, because of technological advances, the geographical position of Australia no longer affords sufficient protection to us to enable us to prepare adequately for armed conflict after war has been declared. Therefore, military preparedness not only affords safety in the event of attack, but also is the best way to prevent attack. Every non-aggressor nation will help to promote peace by letting it be known that it is prepared to meet attack. Universal military training would give Australia greater status in the international sphere, and win greater respect for our international policies and proposals. In this country, universal military training should always be regarded as a vital defence measure. Committed as we are to the principles of democracy and the right of self-government, our military forces would never he used in a war of aggression. Under our obligations to the United Nations, we might have to pool certain of our service resources. We might be asked to supply ships, or a number of air squadrons, or portion of our armed forces, in order to enforce the decisions of the United Nations. But. our forces would never be used for aggression. For several years in the immediate future the responsibility which Australia must shoulder as a member of the - United Nations will require on our part the maintenance of an efficient military force. As I have already said, it is beyond our means to maintain a wholly professional army. Therefore, we must reinforce our existing services by a trained citizen soldiery. Invariably, all great wars are followed by a period of unrest and uncertainty. That was the case after the World War I., and it is the case to-day. Australia should have a trained reserve of fighting men ready for any emergency. Unpreparedness at the outbreak of war always results in hasty, partial training which in turn - and this is the worst feature of it - means thousands of needless casualties. To train a large reserve of citizen soldiery would necessitate a considerable stock of weapons, munitions, supplies and equipment, and a programme of production of these goods should be embarked upon. In the past, the tendency always has been to permit stocks of weapons and war materials to become depleted. That occurred after the war of 1914-18. A system of universal training would give reservists an <inline font-style="italic">esprit de corps</inline> which cannot be developed in a civilian army hastily assembled after war has broken out. If called up for war service, reservists would be professionals because they would be trained; they would not be amateurs and that is the important point at which I am driving. When war is already upon us there is not sufficient time to give to a conscripted army the training that it should have had in basic military facts and skills. Imparting such knowledge is a long job and requires patience. Without these skills a soldier is far better to be not in the battlefield at all. Then there are also economic considerations, because preparation for war when war has already commenced, necessarily results in  extravangance.  Military equipment and supplies have to be produced hurriedly, thus causing general confusion and a substantial waste of money. The manufacturer of military equipment and supplies necessary for a universal military training scheme would provide employment for many people. We must consider also the personal values which are many and great. First, military training, provided it is given on the right lines, establishes healthy habits. It teaches personal health care, and this instruction is of great value in civil life. My conception of a compulsory military training scheme is that it should provide not only basic military instruction, but also, in a large percentage of cases at least, a valuable programme of vocational training. The two could be carried on together. When I speak of universal training, I do not want honorable senators to run away- with the idea, that 1 visualize many hours spent in close-order drill with precious little weapon training, and an occasional march on a Saturday afternoon. That was the old system, and although these things may have their use, to-day, they can be reduced to a minimum. Modern warfare demands that men should be trained in the use of weapons, the study of ground contours, and so on. At the same time, under a universal training scheme recruits could be receiving instruction in things which would he of the greatest value to them later on in civilian life. The training that I have in mind would afford lessons in co-operation, efficient team-work, and the assumption of responsibility. All these things go together. Discipline, too. is an asset to any individual in civilian life. There are many misconceptions and misapprehensions about the meaning of the word discipline, but I am speaking now of real discipline; in other words, a wholesome regard for duly constituted authority. None of us is very keen on discipline, and no doubt in the past, some of us have kicked over the traces, but discipline has its uses, and if there is one thing that service##'## in the Army, Navy or Air Force teaches, it is prompt obedience to commands. I remind honorable senators of the old adage, ##"##growl you may, but go you must ##"##. To growl is a soldier##'##s privilege, and so long as he goes, he may growl. Voluntary military service has never been adequate, and universal peace-time training is a logical national policy. Compulsory military training in pence- time is just as democratic as is conscription in time of war. Training for war must be done in time of peace. My belief is that universal military training is of the essence of democracy because in the training camps, rich and poor live together and engage in common tasks - men from the city, men from the country, professional men and unskilled labourers all meet on the one level and work together. Such associations are valuable from a national point of view because they promote a wider understanding. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The time to decide the policy that is to be pursued in regard to military training in this country is now. Universal military training should be introduced without delay whilst we have the officers, instructors, and camp facilities available for such a scheme. To-day I believe that there  is  an awareness amongst the people of this country of our defence needs. It is true that the people are tired of war - after every war defence matters are usually in the doldrums for a while - but I believe that they are alive to the dangers that confront this country. In peace-time it is hard to dispel the sense of false security which blinds people to the most essential defence requirements, and I suggest that what is required is a fact-finding commission. Many people will smile at that suggestion because, in the past, there has been a tendency to throw anything but bouquets at commissions, boards and committees; but I believe that to-day there is a need for such a body, consisting of the most practical men in this country, to examine the whole problem##'## of Australia##'##s defence in an atmosphere free from party politics. The commission could be appointed by the Government, or by the Parliament, and could include in its membership eminent judges, lawyers, professional men, scientists, educators, and perhaps a few senators and members of the House of Representatives. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>133</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JZH</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">AMOUR, Stanley</name><name role="display">Senator Amour</name></talker><para>- Free from party bias ! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>133</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K3L</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SAMPSON, Burford</name><name role="display">Senator SAMPSON</name></talker><para>- There would be a mixture.

A start should he commenced almost immediately - the sooner the better - and the commission -should continue its work until, such time as world developments, and an analysis of the lessons of World War II. enabled it to reach finality. The report of such a body would be of great assistance in solving the problems of preparedness and defence. Only in such a way can we establish a framework of a sound integrated defence system, keyed to our obligations to the United Nations and to our social, economic, and political life. Does any one of us, notwithstanding his faith in an international organization for the prevention of war - we have already had one experience of the failure of collective security - believe in his heart that we in this country with our White Australia policy, and our great unpopulated, territory, will not be challenged by the millions of Asiatics to our north, perhaps not in the immediate future, but sooner or later? My sons had to fight in this war and, although I shall not be here, I do not want my grandsons to have to fight in another war; but I should be very surprised indeed if they did not have to acquit themselves like men, twenty or thirty years hence. I suggest in all seriousness that we should take steps to put this country in the best possible posture of preparedness. It is a poor dog that will not fight for its own bone; Australians are the people who must do the fighting for Australia, possibly with the assistance of allies. When one studies, reads, and thinks about these things, one is confident that sooner or later this Commonwealth will be challenged from the north. It is nonsense to think that we can shut up in their own small islands forever, ,a virile race like the Japanese who have just been overthrown, or that the Germans will not rise again. A country cannot be occupied by the forces of another nation for all time; its people cannot be kept powerless. Therefore we must be prepared for what must inevitably come. Any system of military training provided by law in Australia should be designed on these lines : - </para></talk.start></continue><list type="decimal"><item label="(1)"><para>It should be designed primarily to train men for military service under conditions of modern warfare. </para></item><item label="(2)"><para>It should conform in its details to the requirements shown by experience in World War II.; and be influenced by future technological developments, and what is necessary to prepare men to serve effectively in the armed forces. </para></item><item label="(3)"><para>It should be universal, and applicable to all classes alike, with a minimum of exemptions or exceptions. </para></item><item label="(4)"><para>It should be fitted into the existing military, naval, and air force establishments. </para></item><item label="(5)"><para>It should provide for training youths in such a manner as to cause the least possible interference with their normal education and careers. </para></item><item label="(6)"><para>It should provide for training only, and should not require any kind of military service except in the event of a national emergency. </para></item></list><para>The main point is that the men would he trained.

The success of the world security organization will depend on the continuing efforts and ability of its members to discharge the obligations jointly and mutually undertaken under the United Nations Charter. We must be prepared and willing to make our contribution of force to the United Nations. The alternative to a large standing army is the maintenance of a professional peace-time establishment, which could be reinforced in time of emergency by organized units drawn from the citizen army, which should be a reserve, effectively organized for the purpose in time of peace. I reiterate that the provision of a machine in readiness for war must be carried out in peace-time. We must do all of our war 1 1aining in peace-time. If we wait to do it in war-time, we shall be caught offbalance and will suffer very badly indeed. Experience has proved that the old voluntary system of military training is costly and inefficient at best. It is high time for us to discard that system completely. We have had plenty of experience of that system. World War II. was a ghastly laboratory for military science. The progress - if it can be called progress - made in the art of destruction, was amazing and beastly. We saw great developments in robot bombs and rocket bombs, in electronics, and in amphibious and##"## air operations that revolutionized warfare. The process is still continuing. We do not know what the future has in store for us. All such natural barriersas great expanses of ocean will be overcome. Time and distance have been annihilated. If we do have to face another war, Australia will have insufficient time to mobilize for training or for production. We shall have to mobilize to fight immediately, because the war will be on us like a thunderclap, and it will be total war. I hope that other honorable senators read the recently-published story of the destruction caused by the atomicbomb dropped on Hiroshima. It made me shudder. We in Australia -must ##"##maintain a constant state of preparedness for war. Weapons to-day are very complex They require experts to use them. It would be futile to start training men to use them after war had actually started. It is fallacious tobelieve, as many people do, that the human element does not count in warfare any more and that machines and appliances are of supreme importance. Aircraft will not fly by themselves and guns will not lay and fire .by themselves. The calibre of the men in control of the machines is the thing that counts, as it always has done. Men must be trained for war, because the sending of untrained  nien  into action would be a crime tantamount to murder. I repeat what I have said many times in this chamber, namely, that we should institute a thorough investigation of the whole problem of the defence of Australia. I was greatly disappointed that the Governor-General##'##s speech made no reference to water conservation or to immigration, two problems which are part and parcel of the bigger problem of the defence of this great Commonwealth. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>134</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K5X</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SHEEHAN, James</name><name role="display">Senator SHEEHAN</name></talker><para>. - I am very pleased to associate myself with the motion for the adoption of the Address-in-Reply to the Speech delivered by  His  Royal Highness the Governor-General last week.

I am pleased that my hope has been fulfilled and that Australia, in common with other nations, is now grappling with the great problems of pence. </para></talk.start><para>I join with other honorable senators in congratulating <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devlin,</inline> a new representative of Victoria, upon the excellent impression which he made upon us with his maiden speech. In doing so, 1 do not overlook the very fine speech that was delivered by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Tangney</inline> of Western Australia in submitting the motion now before the Senate. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Devlin</inline> is a practical farmer, and I am *are that we shall have cause to appreciate the value of his experience as a primary producer when we deal with some of the important matters that will come before the Senate. In recent years, much of the business of this Parliament has been occupied in dealing with vital problems affecting primary producers. <inline font-style="italic">I</inline> regret that at present there is a possibility that the purpose of legislation passed by the Commonwealth Parliament to aid that great body of primary producers, the wheat-growers, ma.y be defeated ::s the result of the activities of certain politicians who presume to call themselves representatives of the wheatgrowers. The newspapers report that the legislation which I have mentioned may be rendered ineffective through the defeat of complementary legislation in the State of Victoria by the actions of the members of the Australian Country party. If these reports be true, those persons are not representing the interests of the wheatgrowers. The wheat-growers are appreciative of the legislation passed by this Parliament. They showed this by the way in which they voted at the recent elections. Whilst it is true that, in one or two instances, Labour party candidates were defeated in rural constituencies, a survey of the final results shows that an overwhelming majority of the rural population of Australia voted in favour of supporters of the Government responsible for the introduction of this legislation. I remind honorable senators that the bill was framed as the result of direct negotiations with the organizations which represent the wheat-growers. I have noted with a great deal of pleasure that those organizations have intimated to parliamentary representatives of the Australian Country party that they should not do anything which would endanger in any way the Commonwealth legislation or the complementary State legislation which was necessary to give effect to it. There is no doubt that some specious arguments were used during the election campaign in the hope of diverting the primary producers from their allegiance to the Labour party. Half truths were told. We had the spectacle of men who claimed, that they represented country interests suggesting that, the wheatgrowers should place themselves once more in the position that they were in a few years ago, when the present Leader of the Opposition in the Senate <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> was Minister for Commerce. On one occasion he told the wheatgrowers that the product of their industry was not worth 3s. a bushel. I also remember that when large gatherings of wheat-growers were held at Donald and Bendigo in Victoria to induce the government of the day to introduce legislation to help the farmers out of their difficulties, they were termed ##"## a lot of snivelling mendicants ##"##. Honorable senators opposite and others who ask the wheatgrowers to reject the present proposals are bringing pressure to bear on the State Parliaments to reject the necessary complementary legislation. If effect  were given to their counsel, the primary producers would again become mendicants seeking assistance from governments. They should accept the present scheme, and prepare against times of adversity. They would then be able to look the Government squarely in the face and say that in the times of prosperity they did  something to help themselves. I believe that the great majority of the wheatgrowers favour such a policy. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>135</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KTX</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">MCLACHLAN, James</name><name role="display">Senator James McLACHLAN</name></talker><para>-  Why is the honorable senator not prepared to support a poll of the growers on the matter? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>135</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K5X</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SHEEHAN, James</name><name role="display">Senator SHEEHAN</name></talker><para>- A vote was taken recently, and I am afraid that it  was rather disastrous to one honorable senator from South Australia, <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Mattner,</inline> who spoke of the necessity for a poll of the wheat-growers.

That is not the attitude of the primary producers throughout Australia, and I am sure that the attempts being made in the parliaments of some of the States to defeat the stabilization scheme will result, if successful, in the wheat-growers realizing the insincerity of those who pretend to be their friends. In South Australia, from which <inline font-weight="bold">Senator James</inline> McLachlan comes, a general election will be held in the near future.

I should say that all honorable senators who heard the Speech, and those who have perused it since, will disagree entirely with the Leader of the Opposition.

It dealt with the important matters likely to engage the attention of the Senate and the House of Representatives during the present session. </para><para>It is regrettable that notwithstanding the outcome of the recent world war, much of our time and attention must be given to the future defence of this country and the part that Australia must play as a member of the British Commonwealth of Nations.

I venture to say that even honorable senators opposite possessing a greater knowledge of military strategy than that of the honorable senator would not be so bold as to claim that this problem is so easy of solution as the honorable senator would have us believe. In the Governor-General##'##s Speech, the Government visualizes the difficulties lying ahead, and therefore it has asserted that Australia must co-operate in the defence of the British Commonwealth of Nations. ##"##Who knows what particular type of armaments may be necessary in future, or whether large armies will be required ? </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline>declares that compulsory military training must be introduced, and that a vast military organization should be established immediately, yet there is a general demand for increased production.

If the future of this country depends on increased production - and I have no misgivings on that point - careful consideration must be given to what we shall do with our young men now. This matter requires much thought. The atomic age is in its infancy. What the future has in store, I do not know and therefore I shall not attempt to lay down any hard and fast programme for the future. The Government has decided that it will be represented on the various committees which will meet from time to time to grapple with problems as they arise, by men well qualified to discuss the proposals that will come forward. Before committing ourselves to any definite plan we must take cognizance of world trends and the effect of the great discoveries and inventions that took place during the war. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> spoke truly when he said that the war had turned the world into a great laboratory.

Through the Governor-General##'##s Speech the Government indicated its intention to participate in all discussions on the defence of the British Commonwealth with the particular emphasis upon the role which Australia should play in the Pacific. With ourselves, our sister dominion of New Zealand, the United Kingdom and the United States of America are vitally interested in the maintenance of the peace in the Pacific. The Government has indicated that discussions will take place with the United Kingdom and the United .States of America on the future, control of certain bases. Australia is prepared to play its full part in this matter. It is unfortunate that in our day this problem should rest urgently upon us. It is regrettable that so much of the Governor-General##'##s Speech should of necessity deal with the part which Australia, along with the other nations of the world, must play in evolving precautions against war in the future. I use the term ##"## precautions ##"## advisedly, because the current conferences of representatives of the different nations which fought as allies in the combat against the evil forces of fascism are beset with difficulties. Differences have arisen between our allies. The representatives of the peoples of these nations in their own parliaments and in international conferences must approach this great problem by first endeavouring to obtain the other fellow##'##s point of view. After World War I. our allies established the League of Nations. Unfortunately, that body was dubbed in some quarters as a ##"## retired burglars union ##"##, the suggestion being that the members of the League of Nations had obtained all that they needed to maintain themselves in affluence, and that they were the ##"## haves ##"## whilst the ##"## have-nots ##"## were to be locked out of their councils. Bearing in mind these facts, we sincerely hope that the United Nations will proceed along different, lines. It is unfortunate that up to date little progress has been made. Jealousies arc developing among the United Nations. In these circumstances.  every effort must be made at these conferences to obtain the other fellow##'##s point of view. Under those conditions the attitude of the Australian Government at such conferences should merit our approval. We have suggested that the exercise of the veto, which is part and parcel of the constitution of the Security Council, should be restricted. We believe that peace cannot be maintained if, at such conferences, one nation can veto the decision of the majority. Such a provision can completely nullify the work of these conferences. At least, the veto should be used only in very grave circumstances. If the exercise of the veto be limited in this way, the discussions at these conferences should go a long way towards overcoming the difficulties which have already  arised.  It is clear that little progress has been made towards establishing permanent peace. All of us uphold the right of small nations to work out their own destiny according to their own ideals. At the moment, unfortunately, this principle seems to be overlooked ; and one gains the impression that power politics are in play with the result that the claims of smaller nations which were conceded to them unanimously at the conclusion of the last war are not receiving the consideration to which they are entitled. However. I believe that as time goes on and the United Nations come to understand each other better, they will devise a formula which will offer some guarantee of world peace. The common people suffer most in war. Their aspirations are blighted by war. Therefore, 1 fervently hope that as the result of these deliberations a better feeling will prevail among the nations. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Leader of the Opposition said that  the  Governor-General##'##s Speech consisted of vague generalities, and that it. was not worthy of the  occasion.  The honorable senator, who dealt with the problem of industrial unrest, said that because of recent industrial disturbances Australia##'##s economy was now at stake, and that we would not be able to develop this country as we should develop it. Whilst it is true that industrial unrest has occurred in recent weeks in the transport industry and other industries, I suggest that the honorable senator should look first for the reasons for those disturbances. I was associated for 25 years with the transport industry in Victoria. It is true that during that long period no member of the unions in that industry was called upon to lose one day##'##s work in support of a claim for better conditions. It is also true that no stoppage had occurred in the Victorian railways for about 43 years, and that during that period the unions by having recourse to arbitration had succeeded in improving beyond measure the conditions of railway employees in Victoria. For instance, the working hours of certain station-masters have been reduced from 108 to 88 a fortnight. I do not suggest that the recent stoppage was brought about just at the whim, or the will, of Communists, as the Leader of the Opposition alleged. I believe that the reason for that stoppage is that over a long period of years efforts have been made by those in control of the administration of the railway system in Victoria to circumvent the gains which the unions have made under arbitration awards. On every occasion we made a gain, certain officers in the administration did everything possible in order to whittle down those gains by their interpretation of awards of the Arbitration Court and industrial boards. That attitude on the part of certain officers in a bad administration engendered hostility among railway employees. We had successes; but, as I have said, we had always to fight a small coterie in the administration which was intent upon whittling down any concessions we gained through arbitration. I believe that that observation can be applied to industry generally. Nobody will suggest that men will strike just for the fun of striking. No worker desires at the end of a pay period to go home with a ##"## short ##"## pay. Every man desires to have as much money as possible in his pay envelope, but there comes a time when conditions are such that he ceases to work. It is then that the community takes notice of what is going on. So, I say to the Leader of the Opposition and to others who think as he does, that if they earnestly desire industrial peace in this country, the price of it must bo paid, and that price is justice to the workers. Recently, in this chamber, an honorable senator asked if the Government favoured forcing men to work overtime to increase production. Honorable senators who would favour such action would be better advised to consider whether men should be rewarded because of their increased productivity. Have honorable senators opposite ever suggested that when improved methods of production are devised, due either to the application of science, or the invention of new machines, the increased wealth produced by the workers should be distributed amongst them? ##"##When, as the result of the introduction of labour-saving appliances there have been wholesale dismissals in industry, have honorable senators opposite ever expressed the view that the welfare of persons so displaced should be a charge on the nation, or that the increased wealth should be distributed amongst those remaining in industry? I have never heard such a suggestion. When the Opposition claims that the fixing of the basic wage should be left to the legal minds of men on the Arbitration Court Bench, have they ever thought that wages should not  be  based solely on the pounds and ounces of bread, tea, sugar meat, or any other commodity that the workers consume? After all, the workers are human beings, and surely they are entitled to be regarded as being on a higher plane than animals. The owner of horses and other beasts of burden measures out the amount of chaff or oats necessary to keep them in good physical condition so that they may work; but surely human beings are entitled to more consideration than that. So long as we continue to permit our basic wage to be determined by the number of ounces of foodstuffs, calories, vitamin?, and so on required by workers and their families, we cannot hope to bring about the improved standard of living for which we all hope, nor can we look for that new world about which we heard so much when every able-bodied man was urged to respond to the call to the colours, or to work long hours in order that the conflict would be brought, to a successful conclusion. We must have something new. If we want industrial peace, we must offer to those who create the wealth of this nation and of the world by the application of their labour to raw materials, something more than that which is handed out to them to-day. In setting up a special committee to deal with this matter the Government i? proceeding on sound lines. We must break new ground and get away from the old legalisms. If a committee is set up to go into the whole question of production, and it succeeds in introducing a new formula, it will have done something to achieve industrial peace. I have said on many occasions that it profits a worker very li tie to go home with his pay envelope containing quite a lot of bank notes and silver if that money has lost its purchasing power. We must put more food and other commodities into the basket that is taken as a measure by statisticians. We must provide a greater regimen for the workers. We must give to them a fair reward for their increased productivity. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><page.no>139</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>KR9</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">LECKIE, John</name><name role="display">Senator Leckie</name></talker><para>- Is there greater productivity in the world to-day? </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><page.no>139</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>K5X</name.id><electorate /><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">SHEEHAN, James</name><name role="display">Senator SHEEHAN</name></talker><para>-There i.greater productivity in spite of labour shortages, and the dislocation of industry as the result of the war.

My friends of the Opposition will have to alter their attitude. The same arguments may be advanced with regard to a reduction of the  working  week. It may be that, at the moment, because of a shortage of labour, we could do with men working longer hours, but that is just a. passing phase. We musT take a long-range view of the matter. Unless the working week be reduced, there is no doubt that, within a short space of time, improved methods of production will cause widespread unemployment, and none of us want that to happen. Full employment is the important aim and if honorable senators opposite desire progress to be made in an orderly fashion, they must support the Government##'##s proposals. Unless they do that, chaos will result. It always amuses me to hear members of the Opposition denouncing the rise of communism and urging the Government to do this or that to suppress the Communists. The very attitude that they adopt on matters such as the basic wage and a shorter working week is conducive to the growth of communism. The Australian people who have made great progress in an orderly way during the past 30 or 40 years, with the development of trade unions, are proceeding along peaceful lines ; but constantly denying to the workers any improvement of conditions, the Opposition will assist to bring about the very state of affairs that they fear so much. As I have said on other occasions, unless the Labour Government can give increased benefits to the workers of this country, they will be forced to turn to communism. Therefore, if honorable senators opposite do not wish to see##"## any further development of communism in this country they should support all the legislation that will give to the workers a greater share of the wealth r.hey produce. </para><para>Referring to the recent elections for the Senate, the Leader of the Opposition said that Labour had won greater representation in this chamber than that to which it was entitled. I am reminded of the position that exists in some of our State parliaments. To-day, quite a number of people appear to be very anxious about the future of this chamber, because after July of next year there will be 33 Government supporters and only three Opposition members. It is not so long, of course, since exactly the reverse position obtained, and whilst there were one or two pious expressions of concern from members of the party then, in office, nothing was ever done. However, the party representation in this chamber after the 30th June next will come about as the result of a direct appeal to the people at, the last elections, on the basis of an adult franchise, with the principle of one vote one value operating. It is suggested that the Senate may lose its effectiveness as a house of review, but I draw attention to the state of affairs that has existed in certain State legislatures for many years. With the exception of Queensland, the bi-cameral system of government prevails throughout Australia. The upper houses are intended to be houses of review, but let us look at the franchise upon which they are elected. I have never heard it suggested that there should be a review of the constitution of the Victorian Legislative Council, to which chamber those who are opposed to the Commonwealth##'##s wheat legislation and other progressive measures are looking to frustrate the will of the popular lower house which is elected on adult franchise. It appears therefore that whilst honorable senators opposite are prepared to support an electoral system under which the upper house of the State of Victoria is able to deny to the people of that State and indeed, to the people of the Commonwealth, legislation that they desire, when, as the result of an election held on the principle of one vote one value, there is to be a preponderance of Government supporters in this chamber, they express grave concern. I feel that if honorable senators opposite would give reasonable consideration to the policy speech of the Prime Minister <inline font-weight="bold">(Mr. Chifley)</inline> instead of accepting the view of the Leader of the Opposition that the Governor-General##'##s Speech contained nothing worthwhile and held out little hope for the future, they would appreciate the fact that the Chifley Government has drawn up a programme that will meet the requirements of Australia, and will give to this country an opportunity to play an important part in world affairs. Under Labour##'##s administration Australia will be able to develop its industries to such a degree that the dangers feared by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> and others will never arise. With increased production, and a growth of population, Auustralia  will be able to fulfil its destiny in the Pacific area. Not only will it be able to take its place in this sphere, but also it will be able to lend assistance to the British Commonwealth of Nations as a whole in whatever role it may be cast in the future. We should not think only in terms of the armed forces that we could raise in the event of an emergency. We oan make other contributions to world security and the development of civilization. I appreciate that, owing to the present unsettled conditions throughout the world, it is necessary for us to make defensive plans, but the progressive nature of the present Government##'##s policy gives Australians reason to look beyond the troubled present to a long period of security and progress in the future. I commend the motion before the Senate, and believe that it will be agreed to unanimously. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><page.no>141</page.no><time.stamp /><name.id>JQP</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party /><role /><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech><name role="metadata">COOPER, Walter</name><name role="display">Senator COOPER</name></talker><para>. --His Royal Highness, the Governor-General, in his Speech at the opening of t he Eighteenth Parliament, said, that at m early date both he and the Duchess of Gloucester would have to depart from our shores owing to the fact that His Majesty the King would leave England early next year to visit the Dominion of South Africa. I am sure that the many thousands of Australians with whom their Royal Highnesses have come in contact during the past few years will regret their departure. We wish them Godspeed on their return home. </para></talk.start><para>The assembly of this Eighteenth Parliament followed closely on the recent general elections, the result of which was that the Labour party was returned to power for another term of three years. In the House of Representatives, the Labour party has a decreased majority, but in the Senate it has an increased majority, and after the 30th June next year the Government will have 33 supporters in this chamber and the Opposition will be represented by only three senators. This result makes abundantly clear the fact that the method of electing honorable senators leaves something to be desired. The present system does not give to a very large proportion of the electors the measure of representation to which they are justly entitled. An examination of voting figures at the recentelections shows that the total number of votes cast for  Labour  party candidates was 2,184,432, representing 49 per cent, of the total, whilst the number cast for Liberal party and Australian Country party candidates totalled 1,913,956, representing approximately 43 per cent. of the voting population. In spite of the slight difference between the percentages, the strength of the Labour party in this chamber after the 30th June next will be eleven times- greater than that of the Opposition parties. I bring this to the notice of the Senate because I consider that it is entirely opposed to the democratic principles of Australia and because it is not in the best interests of the community. The Senate was originally designed by. the framers of the Constitution to be a States##'## House to represent the interests of the different States, and that was why all States irrespective of their populations were represented by an equal number of senators. The Senate was also designed to be a house of review. During the last 46 years, it has become more a house of review than a States##'## House. There can be no doubt that the Senate was able to serve the country best at a time when the difference between the numerical strength of the party in power and that of the Opposition was very small. At that time, the Senate was able to take full advantage of the combined knowledge, experience and ability of all parties. There have been rumours that, during the next three years, the size of the Commonwealth Parliament will be increased. If action should be taken to increase the number of members of the House of Representatives, it would also be necessary to increase representation in <inline font-style="italic">the</inline> Senate. This would be an appropriate opportunity to consider improved methods of electing senators, in order that voters might secure more satisfactory representation in this chamber. I suggest that consideration be given to a system of proportional representation##'##, together with other methods, such as that of electing senators to represent divisions within each State. There are various systems of proportional representation, but I consider that the method most suited to the needs of the Senate would be that which is used for the election of members of the House of Assembly in Tasmania. That system is proportional representation, with single transferable votes. This gives an opportunity for preference votes to be used. The basis of proportional representation is that the majority shall, ruN and that the minority shall be heard. 1 do not blame the Government for the position which has arisen from the latest elections. As <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sheehan</inline> said, a similar position occurred in reverse in L934. At that time there were 33 antiLabour senators on the Government side of the chamber and three representatives of the Labour party in opposition. The position then in relation to representation of the voters was just as bad as it will be after the 30th June next. Had proportional representation been in force, the results of Commonwealth elections would have been considerably different. In 1934, for instance, Labour party candidates for the Senate received 47 per cent, of all votes in the Commonwealth and anti-Labour candidates received the balance. Under the system in operation, the Labour party candidates gained no seats in the Senate at that election, and eighteen anti-Labour candidates were elected. Had a system of proportional representation with single transferable votes been in operation, eight Labour candidates and ten anti-Labour candidates would have been elected. Under the existing system, the Labour party was completely unsuccessful, whereas under the proportional voting system I have mentioned it would have won eight seats. In 1937, Labour received 48.6 per cent, of the votes and the non-Labour candidates 51.4 per cent.; yet 16 Labour candidates were returned and only three nonLabour senators were elected. Although the non-Labour candidates at that time received the greater proportion of the votes throughout the Commonwealth, only three were returned to the Senate, and the party which received the smaller percentage of the total votes cast had sixteen candidates elected. Under proportional representation, Labour would have secured only nine seats, instead of sixteen, and the non-Labour candidates ten. In 1919, the position was worse still-. At that period the Nationalist party##'##s vote in Australia was a little over ?60,000 and the Labour vote 819,S86. Although there was very little difference in the total number of votes of the opposing parties, the Nationalist party received seventeen seats and the Labour party only one. It will thus be seen that this anomalous .position has required correction for many years. 1 shall endeavour to explain briefly how the system of proportional representation operates. First, all valid votes are counted and a quota is fixed. This is obtained by dividing the total number of valid votes by the number of vacancies and adding one. Let us assume that at the last general elections senators were to have been elected according to the system of proportional representation. As three candidates were to be elected in most of the States, three plus one would have been divided into the total number of votes to -arrive at the quota for representation, and one more would have been added to the quota so that it would be impossible for four candidates to get an equal number of votes. The preference votes are counted in exactly the same way as at present. The candidate who polls the lowest number of votes goes  out first, and his preferences are distributed amongst the other candidates until one receives either the quota or more than the quota. It is interesting to note that the preference votes of the elected candidate are not then distributed to their full value, but with a value in accordance with his surplus votes. That value is arrived at by multiplying the number of second preference vote,received by each candidate by the surplus votes over the quota and dividing by the total number of second preferences. This gives a value to the second preference votes which prevents one candidate from receiving the full quota by which the No. 1 candidate has been elected. I suggest that if the Government, proposes any alteration of the number of members in the House of Representatives or the Senate, it should consider the desirability of a thorough investigation of the proportional voting system. That would make the representation in the Senate more equitable than at present, and at least give some representation in this chamber of review to a large number of voters who, under the present system, get no representation at all. </para><para>In glancing through the speech delivered by the Governor-General I note, amongst other things, that the Government intends to explore the possibility of full collaboration with the States for the prevention and treatment of tuberculosis. I regard this as rather a belated effort to do something to stamp out that terrible disease. Undoubtedly, tuberculosis in a young country such as Australia takes a heavy toll of the population and particularly of the workers in industry. Steps necessary to be taken for the amelioration of the disease were indicated in the sixth report of the Social Security Committee, which carefully investigated the incidence of the disease in an endeavour to discover means of arresting its progress. Paragraph 87 of the report of the committee which was presented to the Parliament fin the 1st July, 1943, stated - </para><quote><para>The present position regarding tuberculosis in Australia is a reproach to all who, possessing knowledge of the facts, have not done </para><para class="block">I##'##Vi##'##rytliing in their power to secure substantially improved facilities and im-rensed tiiianrial provision to provide for early detection of the disease, economic security for the tuberiilous and their dependants, and modern facilities fnr treatment and. in suitable cases.  n##'##l-uputionnl rehabilitation.

The patient requires many months of hospital treatment which involves separation from his family, who must be looked after while he is in hospital. The patient must be relieved of family worries. Many sufferers leave hospital too soon, with the result that they eventually have to return to hospital ir, a worse condition than previously An investigation made in New South Wales in 1934 disclosed that, the number of sufferers from tuberculosis admitted to hospital during that year was 767, and in 1939 it. was found that of those 767 patients 350 had died of tuberculosif and 329 had been re-admitted, whilst fewer than .K##'##O had been cured. This disease is taking a heavy toll of the community. There is, unfortunately, a shortage of suitable sanatoriums and preventoriums. In 1943 it was estimated that 2,963 beds were needed in the Commonwealth to cope with this disease. The best time to attack this disease is in its early stages, and, accordingly recommendations have been made to the Government that it should provide means of early detection. That can be done in various ways, such as skin testing by the Mantoux method; mass minature X-ray examinations of the population: the provision of chest clinics and hospitals where patients can be examined and accommodated for observation, diagnosis and treatment, and where X-ray or other diagnostic aids will readily be available; and by improving and modernizing the methods of diagnosing and treating tuberculosis as taught to students at the teaching hospitals attached to medical schools. </para><para>It is claimed that at the Papworth settlement in England no child born at the settlement has contracted tuberculosis.

It has been claimed by persons competent to express an opinion that if treatment similar to that which I have advocated were carried out, tuberculosis could be completely eradicated within 25 years.

During the war the people of Australia, in common with the people of other belligerent countries, suffered a great deal. It is true that there is still considerable unrest in the world, and a lack of unity at the United Nations conference, but it is gratifying indeed to know that bullets are not being fired and that the people of the world are not any longer engaged in armed combat. It is better that the representatives of the nations should be engaged in disputations at conferences than that they should be at war with one another. </para><para>In 1943 a majority of the electors entrusted the destiny of this country to the Labor party, which was then led by <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. John</inline> Curtin. As the result of that leadership and the good comradeship and loyalty which existed between him and his supporters, and because of the sound policy pursued by the government, Australia emerged successfully from the war. In the recent election a majority of the people demonstrated their continued faith in the Labour Government, under the leadership of <inline font-weight="bold">Mr. Chifley.</inline> I regard the verdict of the people as evidence of the soundness of their judgment. The Leader of the Opposition <inline font-weight="bold">(Senator McLeay)</inline> and <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Cooper</inline> contended that the time was ripe for consideration to be given to an alteration of the method of voting for the Senate. I well remember the time when there was only one Labour senator in this chamber and 35 non-Labour senators supporting the then government, but I do not recall any great outcry against the method of electing senators at that time. Later, there were three Labour representatives in this chamber opposed te 33 non-Labour members, but again there was no great public outcry against the system which produced such results. There was no insistent clamour for an amendment of the Electoral Act. I have in mind also that Western Australia has a Legislative Council elected on a restricted franchise, with the result that in that chamber there are eight Labour members who are continually outvoted by their opponents. It seems almost impossible for the Labour party to gain control of the legislative machine in Western Australia, but there is no urgent demand by anti-Labour electors for an alteration of the electoral system which gives such results. Whatever may be the merits or demerits of proportional representation, or of any other electoral system, the people have recorded their opinions, and have shown dearly that, for the time being at least, there shall be a majority of Labour senators here. That- being the position, there seems to bp no great call for a change. </para><para>The Leader of the Opposition claimed that the Speech was full of vague and indefinite generalities, and was practically a worthless document. He did not blame  His  Royal Highness for that; indeed he was particular to point out that the Speech had been prepared for him by his advisers. The Leader of the Opposition said that the first 51 paragraphs of the Speech contained very little, and that from the remaining paragraphs he could not glean a great deal. The honorable gentleman seems fit at all times to offer destructive criticism; rarely does he make a constructive suggestion. Despite his criticism of the Speech, I believe that it has considerable merit, and that if effect be given to the constructive policy outlined in it the people of this country will have little of which to complain. Much has been said in this debate with respect to the Government##'##s defence policy. <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson,</inline> who spoke for more than an hour emphasized the necessity to re-introduce universal military training. He also alleged that at the last two general election campaigns labour candidates and their supporters had circulated a lie to the detriment of Opposition candidates, the alleged lie being that governments supported by Opposition members had been responsible for Australia##'##s unpreparedness at the outbreak of the last war. The honorable senator said that our unpreparedness was due to the action of the Scullin Government in abolishing universal military training. On that point I should like the honorable senator to answer one question. The Scullin Government, which was in office from 1929 to 1931, was not succeeded by a Labour government until the Curtin Ministry took office in October, 1941. I want <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> and his colleagues to tell me why anti-Labour governments in the intervening ten years did not attempt to re-introduce universal military training. To that question the honorable senator can give only one answer. Those governments did nothing whatsoever to re-introduce universal military training and thus redress what, in the honorable senator##'##s mind, was apparently heinous on the part of the Scullin Labour Government. It is obvious, therefore, that blame for unpreparedness at the outbreak of the last war insofar as it was due to the abolition of universal military training must be shared by the anti-Labour governments which held office from 1931 to 1941. - </para><para>Despite what has been said by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> the Government##'##s defence policy was clearly set out in the Governor-General##'##s Speech. That policy may be classified under three heads: First, the maintenance of forces for use in association with the United Nations for the preservation of world peace and security ; secondly, the maintenance of forces for Empire defence; and thirdly, the maintenance of forces for the defence of Australia itself. No individual member of the Parliament is competent to say offhand what will be our best method of defence in the immediate future. As the result of the last war, defence methods have undergone tremendous changes, and it is not within the competence of any individual member of the Parliament to speak dogmatically with respect to our future requirements. The Government is confronted with a very difficult problem. It is obvious that Australia is deficient in man-power. ##"##We must remember that one-sixth of our total population was directly employed in our war effort. Of our population of 7,000,000, approximately 50 per cent, are females. Thus, we can draw our military man-power from only half our adult population. However, that source  i3  further reduced when allowance is made for those who are not fit physically for war service, and also for that proportion nf the population which must necessarily be employed in the production of the requisites of war. In these circumstances we must act in the closest consultation with not only the United Kingdom but also the United States of America. The responsibility for the maintenance of peace in the Pacific rests upon Australia and the United States of America. It is not unfair to say that the best Australia could do would be in the role of a watchdog in the Pacific. The future defence policy of this country must be based primarily upon association with the British Commonwealth of Nationsand the United States of America. In view of these facts <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> barely touches the problem when he says that the only way to save Australia is to re-introduce universal military training. The problem, obviously, requires much deeper consideration. In view of all that has happened in recent years, and bearing in mind Australia##'##s commitments as a member of the United Nations, we must maintain a standing army consisting of the three branches of the services, the Navy, Army and Air Force. However, the composition of such an army is a. matter for decision by our military experts. I am not prepared to dismiss the problem as lightly as <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sampson</inline> does. </para><para>I am also pleased to note from the Governor-General##'##s Speech that the Government##'##s attitude is one of unwavering support of the United Nations for the principles of the Atlantic Charter and the United Nations Charter. As time goes on, we become more prone to forget the lessons of the last war, and to drift into a position analogous to that which existed after World War I. That war was described as a war to end war, but our victory on that occasion did not have that result. We fought the last war for our self-preservation against the evils of fascism and nazi-ism, which are anathema to democratic people. We must not forget the principles of the Atlantic Charter, or the aims and objects of the United Nations. Our objective now is to secure freedom from want, freedom from fear, freedom of religion and freedom of speech. The peoples of the world must not lose sight of those four cardinal principles which are worth fighting for. We know that in all nations certain sections desire to prosper at the expense of other sections. The only way to defeat avarice of that kind is by guaranteeing economic security to the peoples of the world as a whole. By doing so we shall progress along the road to universal peace. In order to achieve that objective, we must first provide full employment and promote a higher standard of living among all peoples. The Government is endeavouring to the utmost of its capacity to give effect to those principles. Reviewing the recent economic history of Australians all of us will admit that we have made considerable progress in this direction. As a nation which now enjoys economic security we must be able to export more than we import. According to the latest figures available the value of our imports is now almost equivalent to that of our exports. I ask leave to continue my remarks at a later stage. </para><para class="block">Leave granted; debate adjourned. </para></speech>
