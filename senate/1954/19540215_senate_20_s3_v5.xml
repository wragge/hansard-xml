      <para>HER MAJESTY was pleased to deliver the following speech: - </para>
      <para>Members of the Senate and Members of the House of Representatives : </para>
      <para>The first section of the Constitution of the Commonwealth of Australia provides that the legislative power of the Commonwealth shall be vested in " a Federal Parliament, which shall consist of the Queen, a Senate, and a House of Representatives ". </para>
      <para>It is therefore a joy for me, to-day, to address you not as a Queen from far away, but as your Queen and a part of your Parliament. In a real sense, you are here as my colleagues, friends, and advisers. </para>
      <para>When I add to this consideration the fact that I am the first ruling Sovereign to visit Australia, it is clear that the events of to-day make a piece of history which fills me with deep pride and the most heartfelt pleasure, and which I am  confident will serve to strengthen in your own hearts and minds a feeling of comradeship with th&amp; Crown and that sense of duty shared which we must all have as we confront our common tasks. </para>
      <para>I am proud also, speaking as the granddaughter of King. George V. and the daughter, of King George VI., to recall two earlier events in the history, the short history, of the Commonwealth of Australia. The first was the opening of the First Parliament of the new Commonwealth of Australia in. 1901 by my grandfather, then the Duke of Cornwall and York. The second was the opening of this building in 1927 by my father, then the Duke of York. Thus the history of Australia as a nation has a special family significance for me. </para>
      <para>It is, I think; fitting that I should, speaking to you to-day; recall to mind those elements of unity which combine in the fabric of the British Commonwealth. The great institutions of parliamentary sovereignty, a democratically controlled executive, the just and. impartial admin- '  istration  of the law; these exist and flourish in each of the great realms, which call me Queen. They have, in this century, survived great trials of war and economic hardship. And they have done so, I am proud to say, because of the great qualities of my peoples, qualities which have shown themselves through labours manfully performed, duties courageously clone by men and women, sorrows sustained, and happiness earned. </para>
      <para>In the result, as I acknowledge the wonderful welcome of my Australian people, I do so in a country whose growth and progress are manifest,, a country of freedom, eloquent of that true democracy which dignifies and expresses the individual human being. </para>
      <para>Already, in my journeys through the Commonwealth, I have been made even more vividly conscious of the true brother hood of my peoples, even prouder of their services to civilization, and more richly confident of their future destiny. </para>
      <para>I would like also to take this opportunity to say to my Australian people, through you ladies and gentlemen of the Australian Parliament, how grateful I was, and am, for their loyal support and encouragement on the occasion of my Coronation. My husband and I can never forget your affection on that great day, an affection which you have expressed with such marvellous warmth in your own land since our arrival. </para>
      <para>Moved by these feelings, it is my resolve that, under God, I shall not only rule, but serve. This is not only the tradition of my family; it describes, I believe, the modern character of the British Crown. </para>
      <para>In this uneasy world of conflicts open or hidden, my peoples in Australia and throughout the British Commonwealth want peace in its fullest and richest sense ; that peace, based upon freedom and justice, which must some day be the unquestioned inheritance of all mankind. </para>
      <para>To play their part in the achievement and preservation of peace, my Australian Ministers will continue the closest cooperation with my Governments in the other Commonwealth nations. Only last month my Finance Ministers conferred in .Sydney with the frankness and friendliness which always mark discussions between the Commonwealth countries. This was one of a long and continuing series of such conferences.. Their immediate objective is to strengthen the British Commonwealth; but their ultimate benefit will flow to other nations and to the great world community of people everywhere. </para>
      <para>Pursuant to the terms of the Constitution, a general election for the House of Representatives must be held at the end of this Session of Parliament. My </para>
      <para class="block">Ministers will submit to Parliament the financial and other measures which must precede that election. </para>

It is difficult to assess the precise degree of assistance that is needed, and to determine whether the very minor variations of duty proposed would confer any benefit on the industry.

          <page.no>8</page.no>
        </subdebateinfo>
        <para>We  Your Majesty's loyal subjects, the members of the Senate of the Commonwealth of Australia, in Parliament assembled, desire to thank Your Majesty for the Gracious Speech which you have been pleased to address lf&gt; the Parliament on this, your first visit to our country. </para>
        <para>The presence in Australia of Your Majesty and of His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh has brought unbounded pleasure to the Australian people. We, their representatives in the Senate, invoke God's choicest blessing upon your life and reign, and are grateful for this opportunity to re-affirm our loyalty and devotion to the Crown and Person of Your Majesty. </para>
        <para class="block">After the historic and inspiring spectacle in which we were privileged to participate to-day, it is fitting that the first business of the Senate, other than formalities, should be an address of loyalty and gratitude to our Queen. This occasion will retain a warm and an abiding place in the hearts and memory of us all. </para>
        <para>With profound respect, enriched with affection and pride, we remember that it was  Her  Majesty's great grandmother who signed the Charter of our Australian nationhood; that it was her illustrious grandfather who opened our first National Parliament in 1901; and that it was her own beloved father, accompanied by her gracious mother, who opened this very Parliament House and its first sittings in May, 1927. Now, to-day, we have had the unique experience and extraordinary privilege, for the first time in our history, of our Queen, in person, opening our Parliament. With every justification, therefore, we feel that  Her  Majesty, quite apart from being our Queen, who with the Senate and the House of Representatives constitutes our Parliament in terms of our Constitution,  ha3  herself a very close personal and family association with the Australian Parliament and the people whom it serves. We who flourish under and cherish a democratic, Christian, mon.arabia 1 form of government, appreciate it, but it must be a paradox to other peoples that the more representative our device of government becomes and the more the Crown vacates active participation in the sphere of day-to-day government, the firmer and stronger grows the bond between sovereign and subject. Without criticising or comparing other forms of government but simply stating an historical fact, to us the Crown is no mere symbol of absolute and irresponsible authority, no archaic relic of times and customs that belong to a dead past. It is a living and vital focus of our social and national life. It is the inspiration which enables us to surmount all considerations that emerge- from differences of race, religion and politics, and to realize and appreciate that under it we are all one people. </para>
        <para>The subjects of the Queen throughout her world-wide realms can justly claim, not in a spirit of idle and boastful vainglory, but with a deep sense of pride and with humble gratitude to God that in a day and age when people of our own generation have witnessed thrones topple over and totalitarian forms' of government si rise, the bond between sovereign and people has never been firmer or more affectionate throughout the centuries of history than it is to-day. This is not the result of <inline font-style="italic">mere</inline> chance or luck. It is because we have to-day as our Queen a young and radiant lady who, even before her accession, manifested outstanding qualities as daughter, wife and mother and who, since her coronation, has shown a jealous pride in the inspiring tradition passed on to her by her illustrious father and grandfather. On a recent occasion His Holiness Pope Pius XII. said, in reference to Her Majesty - </para>

            <para>, -  I second the motion on behalf of every member of  Her  Majesty's Opposition in this chamber. The motion invokes God's blessing upon the life and reign of  Her  Majesty Queen Elizabeth the Second. It re-affirms our loyalty to the Crown, our devotion to and affection for the person of  Her  Majesty, and thanks her for opening this third session of the Twentieth Commonwealth Parliament with a speech that has been delivered by her in person. It has the enthusiastic and unqualified approval of all of us. Membership of this Senate is a great privilege at any time, but on- this historic and unforgettable occasion, it is also a matter of the highest pride and joy. This day has given honorable senators a fragrant memory that will abide with them always. On this day our Queen has taken part with us in the functioning of this Parliament. </para>

          <para>The Queen, beautiful, youthful, gracious, noble and good, appears to a generation that has known mass slaughter and all the horror, brutality and sorrows of war. The very existence of Her Majesty restores our faith and strengthens our hope for . civilization and the world. It refreshes and satisfies our longing for beauty, goodness and truth. The Queen lias come to the throne with the acclaim of all her people in Australia regardless of distinctions in status, religion and politics. The unprecedented warmth and enthusiasm of Her Majesty's reception by the Australian people can leave no doubt in any mind of the loyalty of Australians to the Crown and their deep affection for the Queen. That is true also of the peoples of other countries who were visited earlier in the Royal tour by the Queen and His Royal Highness the Duke of Edinburgh. "We of the Opposition assure Her Majesty that we shall continue to make the most generous contribution of  which we are capable to the deep measure of respect and affection that has been and will be offered to her throne and person. This offering springs from an appreciation of the personal qualities of Her Majesty. I do not presume to enumerate them, but they are obvious to all her people. </para>
          <para>The Queen has vast responsibilities. More than any other individual, she will set and maintain standards of behaviour in private and public for her people and, maybe, for the world. The eyes of the world are focused to-day upon our Queen and her husband. May their power of producing unity among their people spread beyond the bounds of the British Commonwealth of Nations and be a potent influence for peace throughout the world. The Queen has already shown that high sense of duty and awareness of her responsibilities that distinguishedher illustrious father, King George VI, and this has justified fully our belief that she will nobly fulfil the high destiny to which she has been called and to which she has already solemnly dedicated herself. In many utterances, the Queen has shown that she has continually before her the example of the one Life that was perfectly lived on earth and its impact upon the world. She has given ample earnest of her will that the best may flow from the example of her own life. We can further her high Christian purpose only by determining that our own lives shall be well lived. We, of the Opposition, pray that she will be given the strength to discharge her vast responsibilities, and that she will grow in grace and wisdom. We shall watch her reign with sympathetic and loving interest. We feel inspired and stimulated by her presence to-day to a determination that we shall try to be worthy of her example and leadership. </para>
