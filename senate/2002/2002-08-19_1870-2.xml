I recall your work on joint committees, such as the Public Works Committee. And of course we particularly recollect your 5Â½ years as whip on our side in this chamber. You are well qualified for this task. I think it is a good thing that finally a Liberal from Tasmania has been given an opportunity to be President of the Senate.

All parties in this chamber look to the President to maintain order in this place. We all know that on some occasions that is no small challenge. Presidents gain the necessary respect of the chamber if they exercise their responsibilities with fairness and impartiality, and I am very confident that you will certainly do that. All of us acknowledge that a degree of firmness is expected from the President when presiding in the chamber as well.

That said, Mr President, I have no doubt that in any contest you would have won the presidency on this occasion.</para><para>Finally, I would like to congratulate all the new senators in this place.

I take this opportunity also to express my appreciation for the manner in which the previous President of the Senate, Senator Reid, exercised her functions. I wish her well.

As all of the other speakers have previously stated, the position of the President of this chamber is important; it is also a position through which the standing of this chamber is conveyed not only in this country but also worldwide. It is very important that the President of this chamber does have the ability to express to both the media and the public the work that is carried out in this chamber. Senator Harradine mentioned the issue of a house of review, and that is to a large degree one of the major functions, but I also believe, Mr President, that it is incumbent on all senators in this chamber to conduct themselves with decorum, and in that way the standing of this chamber will be appreciated by the public of Australia. To that end, Mr President, you have my support in that particular matter.

I have felt it a great privilege indeed to have served in that capacity myself, especially as the first woman to do so. I, by great good fortune, had the opportunity to serve during the year of Australia's centenary, which was very special indeed. If I may, Mr President, I should wish to convey to the Clerk of the Senate and to the Deputy Clerk, and to all the staff of the Senate and the chamber as well, my thanks for the support that I received from them during my six years as President and for the relationship that I had with them. I would include in that, of course, the other people who support the parliament in the departments led by Mr Bolton and Mr Templeton. I have enjoyed the relationship that I have had in running that part of the building that I shared with the Speaker as well. Mr President, I do wish you well.

The government has complied with the order with the following exceptions. Firstly, a number of the documents have not been provided because they are publicly available already. The cover sheet provided with the tabled documents indicates where they can be obtained. Secondly, the interpretation of synthetic aperture radar data for areas offshore north-east Queensland is currently under way. The final report will be subject to a rigorous acceptance process by Geoscience Australia. The government cannot produce material relating to the data interpretation at this time as the process is still under way. The government will consider tabling the report when Geoscience Australia has accepted it and the government has taken advice on the matter. Finally, some of the documents requested do not actually exist. Again, the cover sheet provided with the tabled documents indicates which these are.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>3058</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>âPetitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area</title><page.no>3058</page.no><no.signed>9</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bartlett</name></names></petitioninfo><para>The Petition of the undersigned shows strong disappointment in the Australian Government's inadequate protection of the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area from the destructive practices of prawn trawling.

Japan was wrong to bomb Pearl Harbour, Iraq was wrong to invade Kuwait and the United States would be wrong to militarily attack Iraq without proof of direct and imminent threat. There is not sufficient grounds to justify Australia supporting a first strike.</para></talk.start><para>The Australian Democrats believe that a first strike action will create further instability in the region and undermine international law and will not necessarily remove Saddam Hussein or keep weapons of mass destruction out of the hands of terrorists. There are dangerous and unpredictable consequences for the region and, indeed, for the world. The facts that Iraq is the largest importer of Australian wheat and that total Australian exports to the Middle East are worth $7.7 billion are just more reasons to add to the very long list of reasons not to support a first strike.</para><para>Concern about a potential war against Iraq has been voiced by many people in recent weeks: by former Australian prime ministers and US presidents, senior security experts in both countries, the leaders of almost all nations and the majority of the Australian public. If you look at Australian opinion polls, you will see that a Newspoll commissioned by SBS recently shows that 50 per cent of Australians were against military action against Iraq. Strongest opposition comes from those over the age of 50. A recent UMR Research poll showed that only 32 per cent of respondents approved of Australian participation in a US-led operation. </para><para>The Australian Democrats have said from the beginning that supporting a first strike should be ruled out. As Leader of the Australian Democrats, on behalf of my party I have written to the Prime Minister, John Howard, and to the Leader of the Opposition urging them to oppose a first strike action. I know that many Australians have also written to those leaders.

We welcome his stanceâin line, in fact, with an Australian Democrats motion passed by the Senate during the last session. We welcome the ALP's support for that motion. I think it is the first time that the Labor Party has supported the long-held Democrat belief that the decision to commit troops to war should be put before the parliament. I do not want the Prime Minister to renege on that commitment. Despite interjections that suggest we have had an hour and a half's debate on it today, if parliamentary debate is nothing more than a few dorothy dixers, then I think the Prime Minister is wrong in his beliefs and I am sure that Australians will make clear that that is not sufficient.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Prime Minister has admitted that the consequences of military action must be debated in the community and then he said it would be debated in the parliament. A Senate committee in the United States Congress recently opened hearings on potential military conflict, so why would Australia not at least consider the details of this issue and Australian interests and Australian opinions in a similar parliamentary forum? Richard Woolcott, Secretary of DFAT during the Gulf War in 1991, has advised:</para><quote><para>... it is only prudent that the advantages and disadvantages for Australia of involvement in such a conflict should be considered thoroughly by parliament and the public.</para></quote><para>Shouldn't the government at least present a report or at least a statement to the parliament on the Australian government's position? To date, the government have been all over the place on this issue. They cannot decide if there is a `very high risk of a war with Iraq', to quote Minister Downer, and that there must be a community debateâthe Prime Minister, on 10 Augustâor if it is `hypothetical', according to Minister Downer, and that anyone who debates it is `talking like Saddam Hussein'.</para><para>The Democrats will ensure that parliamentary debate occurs, and this motion today and the motion that was passed two months ago are only the first few steps. We recognise, as most senators would, I am sure, that the government is legally able to commit troops to war without consulting parliamentâwe know that; we know section 68 of the Constitution; we understand that legally the Prime Minister can do itâbut historically we also know that to go to war without community support is a heavy burden, and it is one that I should think all governments would seek to avoid.</para><para>The Democrats recognise that if there is a war it will be very difficult for Australia not to be involved, as we already have troops in the region and of course HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Arunta</inline> are serving on the Gulf blockade enforcing US sanctions against Iraq too. It would be very difficult to suddenly withdraw if war broke out. But that does not prevent us doing everything in our powerâeverything that we can doâto urge the United States not to rush into military action. Recognising that down the track we may be involved in a war does not prevent us from urging the United States not to make the first military strike.</para><para>The opposition have said that they would only support US action against Iraq if evidence emerges that links Iraq with the September 11 attacks or of the rapid development of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq. Even the foreign affairs minister has admitted he has seen no evidence that Saddam Hussein is linked to the September 11 attacks. Furthermore, Australia is not required by ANZUS, as we all know, to follow this path with the United States. Indeed, it is argued that ANZUS is a hindrance and not a help for those who favour Australia backing a US invasion of Iraq.  </para><para>The foreign affairs spokesperson for the Labor Party has said that the ALP supports exhausting diplomatic options before taking military action. That is one intent behind this motion today. Let us do that. Let us exhaust those diplomatic efforts before we support a first-strike action. Given the ALP position, I believe that they can support our motion today. Let us get the first-strike option off the table. Australia is well placed to play a constructive diplomatic role in this debate. We are well placed not to be distracted by the evils of Saddam Hussein and the undesirability of weapons of mass destruction. We can all agree on that. We can all agree on the undesirability of those issues. Let us oppose first strike. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3068</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am not surprised that Senator Stott Despoja has brought this urgency motion on today because everything today for the Democrats is urgent. If she thinks that she is going to detract from their internal problems with a notice of motion like this, then she has another think coming. I was also very surprised to hear Senator Stott Despoja say that you only have to read the opinion polls in relation to Australia's position regarding Iraq. Senator Stott Despoja, I am sure that you read opinion polls more than anybody else these days because in the time since we left this place in June the opinion polls have only been going one way for you, and that is down.</para></talk.start><para>Let me correct some of the things that Senator Stott Despoja has said. She talks about having a full parliamentary debate before Australia commits itself to action in Iraq. I would remind the Senate that the Australian Prime Minister and the Australian foreign minister have already indicated that if any decision were made to commit forces to military action involving Iraq there would be a full parliamentary debate. A full parliamentary debate means that everybody will have a chance to state their caseâeverybody will have a chance to put their views on the recordâand a decision will be made. </para><para>Of course that is not good enough for Senator Stott Despoja or, it would appear, for Senator Brown, who has come up with another fancy notice of motion today to establish a committee to look into something which is in fact hypothetical. You would never be able to get the necessary information for such a committee to form a considered opinion when intelligence on such is available to governments and executives but not available to the public. So I think it is ridiculous for Senator Stott Despoja to bring this on today as a matter of urgency when the current government has already promised that there will be a full parliamentary debate before any Australian forces were committed to any action involving Iraq. How much plainer can it be, Senator Stott Despoja, than those public statements that have been made by both the foreign minister and the Prime Minister?</para><para>My colleague Senator Payne and I were in the Middle East for nearly two weeks during the break visiting our forces currently serving there, and we were very proud of our forces serving in that area and the commitment that they are making to the war against terrorism. Even more so, we were able to visit our sailors on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Arunta</inline> who are involved in the United Nations Multinational Maritime Interception Force. Why are they there? They are there because Iraq cannot be trusted. Iraq cannot be trusted because it has failed to abide by all of the UN resolutions that it is bound by. So we have Iraq with a very poor track record, and here we have Senator Stott Despoja with a notice of motion asking us to go easy on Iraqâthose people who are breaking United Nations sanctions and who have also been involved in acts of terrorism in the past.</para><para>Let me ask you, Senator Stott Despoja: what more do you want than a full parliamentary debate? You are asking us in your notice of motion to rule out supporting this without having a parliamentary debate in the House of Representatives. At this stage any such development on your part and any passage of this motion would be totally hypothetical. Nobody has full cognisance of the facts. Nobody in this chamberâand particularly Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Brownâare aware of any military intelligence that either the United States or the Australian defence forces might have. Yet you want us to sign a blank cheque saying that we will rule out Australia supporting a first strike without ever being cognisant of the relevant facts. That is a typical red herring from Senator Stott Despoja to try to drag her party away from all the internal difficulties it is having just so that it can maybe raise a separate issue which they hope will gain the support of the Labor Party, the Greens and the other minor parties in this place. I do not know what the Labor Party's position is on this. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name></talker><para>âIf your track record is true, Senator Faulkner, and the decisions that you have made in the past standâ and also the indications from the people that we travelled with in their support for what the Australian troops are currently doing overseasâI imagine you will think very long and hard about this. All we are asking is that you allow the proper process to take placeâ that is, that there be a full parliamentary debate before the commitment of any forces to Iraq. That is what the Prime Minister and the foreign minister have already committed to, and do not let that be forgotten.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What is not hypothetical is the fact that Iraq has failed to abide by the relevant resolutions that have been passed by the United Nations Security Council. Iraq has failed to abide by those United Nations resolutions. The Democrats and the Australian Greens, who champion the cause of the United Nations and the decisions made by them, are here giving some comfort to a country that at this stage has failed to abide by the resolutions that have been passed by the security council. We all know how difficult it is for a resolution to be passed by the security council. The power of veto that countries have while they are there means that it is very difficult to get a resolution through the security council. Those resolutions have been passed. Iraq, as a country, has not abided by those United Nations Security Council resolutions.</para><para>The 10 days that Senator Payne, I and othersâincluding members of the oppositionâspent with our Australian defence forces, who are currently serving in the Persian Gulf, Kuwait, Afghanistan and Kyrgyzstan, left us full of pride for the work that they are doing in the war against terrorism. We are absolutely full of pride for what they do, working in Kuwait and other countries that have day temperatures of above 53 degrees every day, in very dry, dusty and hot conditions. I did not see any evidence of low morale or anything other than pride in what they were doing by serving their country in the war against terrorism. If we get to the stage where this parliament decides that we should take some action against Iraq then I am sure those same forces will serve Australia and the coalition against terrorism in exactly the same way, and with the same dedication, in which they are currently serving in the Middle East and Afghanistan. These people who are serving in those countries are held in such high regard by all of their coalition partners. They are highly skilled and highly trained. They are dedicated and professional. All of the people we spoke to gave them the highest acclamationâand that included very senior members of the opposition who happened to be with us on that particular visit. They unanimously agreed with us on the outstanding professionalism that was displayed by our people.</para><para>Australia supports and is involved in the continuing diplomatic efforts to have Iraq comply with the United Nations requirements and resolutions. What more can the Australian government do than use its best offices to continue strong diplomatic efforts to try and make Iraq comply with those requirements? What is the alternative? A foreign country's representative also asked: what is the alternative? Do we let Iraq continue to build up biological warfare weapons, chemical warfare weapons and get closer to having a nuclear capacity, or do we stop them before they get to that stage of having such a proliferation of weapons of mass destruction within Iraq that they become a threat to the rest of the world? I know what I would do: I would want to do everything to make sure that those weapons of mass destruction are not used on other human beings around the world. In my own personal view, if that meant a strike against Iraq then that would necessarily have to occur. If we want to stop the spread of weapons of mass destruction, something may have to be done. This urgency motion does nothing. All it does is refer to things that the government has already committed to. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>3070</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn the view of the opposition, it is appropriate that the Senate should be debating this issue today, because there is no doubt at all that this is one of the most serious issues that currently faces Australia. It is for that reason that the Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, wrote to the Prime Minister on 16 August asking him to make a comprehensive statement to the parliament setting out the full evidenceâsuch as it existsâon the connection between the Iraqi regime and international terrorism and on the status of Iraq's nuclear chemical and biological weapons programs. Mr Crean requested that such a statement provide sufficient information to the Australian people so as to allow for a more considered debate in the parliament if and when a request for military action is made. </para></talk.start><para>It is disappointing that the Prime Minister responded to the request made by the Leader of the Opposition by effectively claiming that he had nothing to say. He considered that any statement would be premature and that it would risk encouraging the debate to run ahead of the debate in the United States. It is difficult to understand this position when it comes from a Prime Minister who has been emphasising the importance of publicly debating those issues and whose foreign minister runs so far ahead of the debate as to imperil our national interests. The opposition hopes that on cooler reflection the Prime Minister will see the merit of Mr Crean's proposal and that he will make a statement on Iraq to parliament in the near future. If that does not eventuate, the opposition will consider other options such as a parliamentary inquiry.</para><para>Let me take this opportunity to set out very clearly the opposition's position on the possibility of military action against Iraq and the issue of Australia's involvement in such action. That position was announced by Mr Crean on 22 April this year. On the question of Australian diplomatic support for any US military action against Iraq, we will be guided by certain principles. We do not believe that the case has yet been made as would warrant a direct attack from the United States on Iraq. We do not, as yet, have public evidence available directly linking the government of Iraq with the events of September 11. We remain open, of course, to such evidence emerging in the period ahead.</para><para>Iraq has a deeply disturbing record on the question of weapons of mass destruction. Iraq deserves to be condemned for its continued refusal to allow the United Nations Monitoring, Verification and Inspection CommissionâUNMOVICâto discharge its mandate. Nonetheless, we are not yet in possession of evidence that there has been a quantum deterioration in Iraq's weapons of mass destruction profile since 1998, nor are we yet in possession of public evidence directly linking Iraq with the provision of weapons of mass destruction to international terrorist organisations. We remain open to receiving and reviewing such information if it should become available. </para><para>We are of the view on Iraqi weapons of mass destruction that the international community should exhaust the options available under the fresh mandate for UNMOVIC created by United Nations Security Council resolution 1284 of 17 December 1999. Specifically, UNMOVIC should be given a reasonable but finite period within which to enforce its mandate in Iraq on monitoring, verification and destruction of any remaining weapons of mass destruction or WMD related materials or delivery systems. In the event of UNMOVIC's failure, we would still require convincing evidence of Iraqi complicity in the terrorist attack of September 11 or weapons of mass destruction before committing to support direct US military action against Iraq. </para><para>In the event that we obtain evidence that would lead us diplomatically to support US military action against Iraq, our military capabilities are such that we could only provide limited military assets to any coalition operations against Iraq because of the drain on our military resources elsewhereâin Afghanistan, the war against terror, East Timor, Bougainville and the Solomons. Quite significant military resources are being used in those areas. Under these circumstances, our military support should be limited to the usual levels of intelligence cooperation and broader logistical support. </para><para>Mr Crean has also outlined a process for a decision on any military action. The appropriate course of action should involve full consultation with the opposition prior to any government decision on Australian involvement in or support for military action. The government must provide the Leader of the Opposition and, where appropriate, other senior shadow cabinet ministers with a full briefing from all relevant agencies and authorise the US government to provide similar briefings concerning the proposed military commitment after which, in our view, there should be further consultation between the Leader of the Opposition and the Prime Minister. Labor will insist that the government make available all relevant evidence and that the parliament should be recalled as a matter of urgency so that the matter can be debated and then determined. </para><para>We welcome the Prime Minister's recent commitment that there will be a full parliamentary debate before any decision is made to commit Australian forces to military action but, as I said, we believe, given the importance of this issue and the degree of concern in the Australian community, that it is time for the Prime Minister to make a detailed statement to parliament. And that, of course, does not preclude in any way any subsequent or ongoing debate if it became necessary about any request for Australian support for military action against Iraq.</para><para>It is clear that the position I have set out and Mr Crean has indicated previously is not consistent with the precise terms of the urgency motion before us. In the future, threats to international peace and security are unlikely to manifest themselves as clearly as Iraq's 1990 invasion of neighbouring Kuwait. The Democrats motion acknowledges that there may be some circumstances that would warrant a pre-emptive strike, such as the threat of imminent attack by Iraq on a neighbouring state. Pre-emption may not necessarily need to be in the form of military action. This is acknowledged in the framework of international arms control agreements whereby states have agreed to intrusive inspection measures, such as the International Atomic Energy Agency and the chemical weapons organisations. They do that to ensure that the threats do not develop. Article 1 of the Charter of the United Nations anticipates the need for some kind of pre-emptive action to maintain international peace and security. It says:</para><quote><para>... to take effective collective measures for the prevention and removal of threats to the peace ...</para></quote><para>Labor does not oppose the principle of pre-emptive military action per se. There is a case to be made that more strident military action against Al-Qaeda may have been justified during the 1990s, when there was clear evidence of links between Osama bin Laden and attacks on US military bases, ships and embassies in Africa. But, above all, the theory of just war requires a clear and unambiguous breach of international law before military action in response can and should be considered.</para><para>That said, pre-emption is not a strategy that Labor would support in relation to Iraq. Labor believes that UN weapons inspectors are the best means of achieving the stated objective of ensuring that Iraq is not building nuclear, chemical and biological weapons. For these reasons, because of the wording of this urgency motion we will not support it in this form. I am disappointed at the Australian Democrats, who will probably express disappointment at the opposition's inability to support such a motion in this form. If anyone is swayed by such lamentations if they are forthcoming, let me point out that, if the Australian Democrats were serious about wanting to get majority support in the chamber for this motion, they might well have lifted the phone and consulted the opposition about the wording. There was no such consultation; that is disappointing.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator Hutchins</name></talker><para>âIt had to go to the compliance committee. </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>âI do not know; that might be right. I conclude that there was not any interest in gaining the opposition's support. It would be very simple to make some amendments to this motion in order to secure a majority position in this chamber. I think it is a pity that in relation to an issue like this those efforts were not made and that the Democrats clearly wish to remain in the minority rather than attempt to foster as broad as possible a consensus on an issue like this. Such an approach, as outlined in the wording of the motion before the chamber now, would have ruled out our current participation in the military action in Afghanistan, which Labor has been committed to.

The global environment and the social, economic and natural environments will be at stake. This parliament must inform itself and then must put maximum pressure for restraint on the irresponsibility of a Prime Minister who is led from the White House and not from the houses, the people, the streets of this nation which elected him.

They concern the bringing to this chamber of an urgency motion in this form and just how genuine one would be without consulting other parties in the parliament, let alone other individuals, about the process that one takes. Between a genuine effort and a stunt, I suspect it is a very short distance to travel.</para></talk.start><para>The question today is in many cases, and as other speakers have said, whether this debate is actually premature. I think it is worth making the point, and I think it is important to make the point, that the debate is definitely at this stage hypothetical. The motion in front of the chamber calls for a ruling out of Australia's support for any first-strike action in that regard. As I understand it and as other speakers have said, no support has been given, no decision has been taken and the call has been made for parliamentary debate on the issue. As the Prime Minister has indicatedâand I believe the foreign minister and the defence minister have both supported thisâif any decision is made to commit Australian forces to any military action involving Iraq, there will be a full parliamentary debate. I think I even heard in the tenor of the words of the Leader of the Australian Democrats some outrageâmock or genuine, one can never be sureâabout the fact that there has not been a parliamentary debate already. Given the short space of time available since the Senate sat at 2 o'clock this afternoon, I cannot imagine when it was expected that that would be fitted in, but I also imagine that, as is the usual case every day in this chamber and in the House of Representatives, the relevant ministers and the Prime Minister were available in the House for questioning in the normal parliamentary process. So I hope that those opposite and those on the crossbenches will take as much advantage of that as they possibly can. </para><para>There has been much news about the discussions on this particular issue in the United States, and I think the equivalent opportunity to have appropriate discussions in Australia is very important. In that regard, I state my emphatic support for a full debate on this issue. But again, as the Prime Minister has assured us and as the defence minister and the foreign minister have also indicated, any request for Australian involvement will be considered at the time and on its merits. No advance commitment of Australian forces to military action has been given. The Prime Minister and the relevant ministers have indicated that Australia supports and is in fact involved in the exercise of the continuing diplomatic efforts to have Iraq comply with the requirements of the United Nations.</para><para>Senator Faulkner mocked also the question of whether debate of this nature here and now would encourage the debate in Australia to `run ahead'âI think those were the words that he said and I think he was paraphrasing the Prime Ministerâof the debate in the United States. As I understand it, during the recent US Senate Committee on Foreign Relations hearings, which have been held in the United States on the subject of Iraq, neither administration officials nor serving military personnel gave testimony. The Senate appeared content to proceed without those administration representatives. I stand to be corrected if that is incorrect but that is my understanding, and I think that it is very important that we operate in a very constructive and as inclusive a fashion as possible in that case in Australia.</para><para>As other speakers have indicated, Australia already has a very substantial presence in the Gulf in particular and in other parts of the region, whichâas Senator Ferguson, the leader of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delegation to the region in July and August, said earlierâis a very important operation and deployment of Australian personnel. We have two frigates in the Gulf: the <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> and the <inline font-style="italic">Arunta</inline>. I can say from a personal perspective that the work of those teams is nothing short of exceptional and that they are working in an extraordinary environment and under extraordinary circumstances in enforcing the UN sanctions and preventing the smuggling of oil from Iraq and through the Gulf. The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade delegation visit was able to demonstrate to those individuals from all of the services deployed in the region the bipartisan support of the parliament for those troops for their efforts and, of course, for the support that they receive from their families. They are dealing with smugglers and are engaging in both compliant and noncompliant boardings. It is not an easy task. I think in fact last night's <inline font-style="italic">60</inline><inline font-style="italic">Minutes</inline> portrayed quite effectively some of the challenges that they are facing on a daily basis. As the Australian commander in the MIF indicated, this is the very simple reason for the blockade:</para><quote><para>The reason for a blockade is to stop Iraq getting money for weapons of mass destruction and to stop the money flow for a support of terrorism.</para></quote><para>They are activities that Australia, through the parliament, has supported over almost 11 years and that engage the sons and daughters of our constituentsâand I suspect in some cases family members of our ownâand it is very important to recognise and acknowledge their presence. In concluding my remarks this afternoon, I want to indicate that parliamentarians need to take a very constructive approach to this discussion, to participate at a sensible and logical level and not come into the parliament with an urgency motion in this form that has not even received today the support of the opposition. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>3073</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also speak on behalf of the Labor opposition in this debate. I think it is a useful mechanism to at least have the debate on the Democrats motion, although Labor will not be supporting the precise motion because of the points that Senator Faulkner made, in the sense that we were not consulted about the wording. It is important that the motion does give the Senate the opportunity to debate an issue that is foremost in Australians' minds. There is a lot of concern in the community about where we might be headed and concern around the world about where an attack on Iraq by the United Statesâin combination with others or aloneâmight take the whole world because of the ramifications for international security more generally, so I think it is important that we have this debate today. </para></talk.start><para>In anticipation of this debate, in March and April Labor worked through a position to try to set out what we saw as being Australia's national interest in these mattersâ and I stress it is Australia's national interest in these matters. Our foreign affairs spokesman, Kevin Rudd, and I worked with Simon Crean's office to finalise a detailed Labor position that set out our assessment of Australia's national interest and under what circumstances our interest might be served by any involvement in an attack on Iraq, to try to logically work out where we stood and in what circumstances we ought to consider potentially being involved in such an attack. We started, and I want to make this very clear, from the premise that Saddam Hussein is an evil dictator whom we would best see removed from power in Iraq. I do not think there is anyone in politics in Australia who would argue any differently. He is a man who has taken murderous action against his own people and other peoples, and we would like to see him removed.</para><para>As I said, Labor have always taken the position of supporting UN efforts to seek change in Iraq, in particular their efforts in terms of the weapons of mass destruction. That has been the key issue with the Iraqi regime that we have had as an international communityâthe serious concern that exists about weapons of mass destruction being developed in Iraq and our efforts to use diplomatic means, through the UN, to ensure inspection and to ensure those weapons are not developed. Labor were at the forefront of that when we were in government; it is a policy being continued by this government and it is a policy that has the backing of the international community.</para><para>We have been very concerned about the way that the rhetoric has been ramped up in the United States and particularly in Australia in recent weeks by government ministers and about the way that the arguments have been rolled into one: that the war on terrorism has become the war on Iraq. It has all become one argument without any clear analysis about what is actually occurring. Labor's thinking was made very clear by Simon Crean when he announced our policy in April. It sets out clearly what the conditions for involvement would be and what we would seek to do in that position. Senator Faulkner eluded to it earlier. First of all, it is to express the primacy of the role of the UN in dealing with the question of weapons of mass destruction and in continuing their role in trying to get international pressure to get inspectors back in and to assure ourselves that Saddam Hussein was not developing a capability in terms of weapons of mass destruction.</para><para>In the event of the failure of that regimeâ and I am the first to admit that that has been problematic and success has not been forthcoming on that frontâLabor takes the view that there are two grounds for military involvement in Iraq. The first is that, if there were clear evidence of Iraqi support for terrorist activity, particularly in relation to the September 11 attacks, we took the view that as part of the war on terrorism we would commit to trying to destroy the Al-Qaeda networks and that, if Iraq had some complicity in those activitiesâsome involvement with support in that terrorist activityâthen we ought to support action against them. That was part of our commitment to the war on terrorism, but, quite frankly, nobody is now arguing over any evidence linking Iraq to that September 11 terrorist attack. The US administration do not argue that they have been able to establish links to Iraqi involvement. On those grounds, the case has not been made and looks, at this stage, unlikely to be made. I am not saying that evidence might not emerge but, at this stage, no-one is arguing that link.</para><para>The second thing Labor said was that we would consider Australian involvement in action against Iraq if there were an increased threat from the nuclear, biological or chemical weapons programs that Iraq may be developingâthat is, if there were a serious deterioration in the Iraqi profile in terms of their capability in nuclear, biological or chemical weapons since the inspectors were last there. The very reason that we had the UN involvement in Iraq was the threat of those weapons of mass destruction. If they were to prove a seriously increased risk to international security, to neighbouring nation states or, indeed, to their own peoples, then that would be a reason to make a case for potential Australian involvement. It is on those grounds that we have argued that the case has to be made, if there is a case to be made for Australian involvement. Clearly, that case has not been made. Clearly, no-one has been able to come up with credible evidence or make the argument as to why, in Australia's national interest, we ought to be involved in an attack on Iraq at this stage. </para><para>Labor have made it clear that we remain open to be convinced if evidence emerges, if the case can be made, but at this stage the argument has not been made, the case has not been made and, as we know, the Americans have not actually asked for any involvement at this stage. But it is important that we get the thinking very clear as to the basis on which Australia should be involved. What is Australia's national interest in these issues? On what basis should we take the terrible risk of involving ourselves and making war, putting the lives of Australian troops at risk and, indeed, risking what could be a very major development of tension and warfare throughout the Middle East?</para><para>The government has been quite bellicose in its comments on this issue in recent weeks and that has concerned me greatly. We have had Minister Downer talking about appeasement and talking about people using the language of Saddam Hussein. It is important to note that the question of the first-strike policy came originally from a speech given by Senator Hill when he outlined this government's support for a first-strike policy. A couple of days later, of course, when I queried him about it and wrote to him about that change in policy, he said that he had not announced any change in policy and that he would look into my request about any evidence of Iraqi involvement with terrorist activity. I have not received any other evidence forwarded by him. This comes from a government which has been talking up Australia's involvement, talking up a first strike and talking up the threat of war. That is why I think that senators and the Australian public more generally are interested in debating these issues, because the government has been preparing them for war by its rhetoric.</para><para>The other point I want to make in the short time available to me is that I think there has to be much clearer thinking about Australia's capacity to be involved in such activity. We have had some very loose talk about sending our armoured brigades into Iraq, and then it was noted that we did not actually have any armoured brigades. The Prime Minister and defence minister had to explain why they were sending in forces that we do not actually have. I think that shows the lack of clear thinking that has occurred inside the government about our capability and that the rhetoric has been dominant rather than clear thinking about Australia's capability and Australia's national interest.</para><para>I also point out, for those interested in the issue, that our guided missile frigates, which are operating in the Gulf currently, are still awaiting an upgrade project that now is more than two years behind schedule. That upgrade project is designed to increase their defences against missile attack. There is some concern about their ability to remain in the region of the Gulf should the environment change and should warfare break out. Again, we have to be very concerned about our own capabilities in this regard. Also, our combat aircraft are awaiting upgrades to their electronic warfare defences. We need a much more clear-headed debate about our capabilities; we need a much more clear-headed debate about Australia's national interest and the rationale for our involvement, and we need people to understand what war will mean: it will mean death, it will mean loss of limb, it will mean great damage to large numbers of Australian troops, if they are involved, to Iraqi troops, to Iraqi civilians and to American forces. This is real warfare in prospect, not some CNN broadcast. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>3076</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe government rejects out of hand this motion brought today by the Democrats. I would firstly like to comment on Senator Evans's final comments in his speech to the Senate. I do not think there is a government or a parliament that does not accept the gravity of sending troops to a war. I think that has been proven on every occasionâ whether by a Labor government or by a conservative governmentâfrom the First World War and Second World War right through until, perhaps, an imminent decision on an Iraqi war. But it was a comment worth making by Senator Evans, to remind us all of the gravity of this decision. That is why there will be, as the Prime Minister said today, a debateâas there always has been a debateâ in this parliament regarding a decision about Australia involving itself, should there be a war against Iraq. Rest assured that that debate will occur, as it has in the past in regard to Kuwait and Afghanistan and all such serious matters. We would expect such a debate in publicâit is going on nowâand we would want such a debate. We would want the support, if not the understanding, of the public. </para></talk.start><para>Of course, as Senator Evans and other speakers have rightly pointed out, our capacity to contribute to a war on Iraq is extremely limited due to our stretched resourcesâresources used in Timor, Bougainville and other placesâif nothing else. So Australia's capacity would be limited anyway. The Prime Minister said today in parliament that he would be more than happy for, and that he would expect, the Leader of the Opposition and other opposition leaders, perhaps those in the Senate, to approach him for private discussion and briefings on what he knows to this point. He would be more than happy to meet them on that basis. So there is no cover-up of information hereâand there will not be one, should such a serious and grave decision be made.</para><para>But I say to that: this is not what we are being asked to discuss today. This is not the matter of urgency the Democrats have brought to the Senate. I think we have all drifted from that particular point. Let us go back and read what the Democrats have brought to the chamber today. It has nothing to do with an open, transparent parliamentary debate or with seeking evidence about Iraq being a terrorist state. Let us read what the Democrats have put down:</para><motion><para>That, in the opinion of the Senate, the following is a matter of urgency:</para><para>The need for the Australian Government to rule out committing Australia to supporting a first strike against Iraq unless there is evidence of an imminent attack by Iraq on another nation.</para></motion><para>That is a policy. They have already made their decision. This is an attempt to pull back from the war on terror's main policy of a pre-emptive strike against sponsors of terrorism or terrorist states such as Iraq. This is not calling for a debate in parliament; this is a serious policy doctrine by the Democrats to undermine the key policy of the war on terror. To pull back from the pre-emptive strike policy is to neuter the war on terror.</para><para>This is all about the decision that the United States has made, supported by Australia, to seek out terror before it seeks you out: the pre-emptive policy. This says more about the leader who moved this motion and about the pattern she has followedâjust follow her contributions to parliamentary debates since September 11âthan it does about an open, honest, transparent debate in regard to Australia committing its resources to Iraq. This is in fact replacing the key cornerstone policy of a pre-emptive strike to the point of saying, `Hands off Iraq.' This is a `hands off Iraq' policy that suggests that Iraq get the first strike. Look at the words of the motion. I cannot understand how this got through the Democrats' party room, other than through the senator sitting there. The motion says `unless there is evidence of an imminent attack by Iraq'; you would be lucky to get a chance of that. There was no imminent evidence in regard to September 11. You would be lucky to get it in regard to Iraq. Everyone in this chamber knows what a terrorist state Iraq is, and everyone knows the history of Saddam Hussein in regard to his own people and his bordering nations and his history as a sponsor of terror throughout the world.</para><para>It must be a great disappointment to the four senators in that party room who do not support Senator Stott Despoja's leadership that she has once again imposed her will and her left-wing policies upon that party room. The motion is against a first strike unless there is evidence of an imminent attack by Iraq. There will be plenty of evidence of that. I could understand it if the Democrats came to this chamber and sought evidence of Iraq's acts of terror or of it not adhering to United Nations resolutions, or sought proper evidence of its weapons of mass destruction or evidence of its sponsoring terrorism. They are entitled to see the intelligence on that matter before this country makes a decision. But to introduce the policy of not moving against such a country until an attack from that country is imminent is to overturn the cornerstone of the war on terror. This follows their leader's pattern since September 11 of being anti-United States. She is against the ANZUS Treaty; she is basically against us being in Afghanistan. I heard an interjection from the Democrats: `What about Israel following the United Nations resolution?' That possibly says it all. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>3077</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âSenator McGauran is obviously trying to compete with Mr Downer for the most inane, stupid, ridiculous and quite destructive approach to what is a very important issue. This is the most important issue of concern to the Australian public. I wish Senator McGauran would take the advice of his colleague Senator Payne in trying to approach it in a constructive and logical way so that we can have a meaningful debate, rather than the typical, pathetic slurs that are all he is capable of and his deliberate misrepresentation of anybody who argues for a different approach as being soft on terrorism, pro-Saddam Hussein, soft on September 11 and anti-United States.</para></talk.start><para>The Democrats' position is quite clear. It is on the record any number of times. If you read and listen to the debate, rather than babble your own rubbish, you might realise how far off the mark you are. The Democrats have, in the speech Senator Stott Despoja made just an hour ago, talked about our support for ANZUS and how Australia's approach in terms of a first strike actually undermines part of the intent of ANZUS. If you looked at the issues logically, you might make a positive contribution instead of just competing with Mr Downer to prove who has the most hair on his chest. </para><para>Everybody in this place recognises the importance of thinking through the issues before engaging in military action. The approach of a first strike is a major precedent in international activity. The words that are put forward here by the Democrats have been on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> in the form of a general business notice of motion since last June. They are not new or out of the blue. To somehow or other suggest that if we simply ask the Senate to signal our support for the UN charter is giving a blank cheque shows how poorly understood the debate and the issues are amongst many of the knee-jerk sabre rattlers amongst the coalition.</para><para>We note the constructive approach that the Labor Party have taken to this debate, despite their unwillingness to support this particular motion. I draw the Senate's attention to the statements made by many ALP membersâincluding in the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday Age </inline>last weekendâruling out Australian involvement in a pre-emptive US-led strike on Iraq. This is all this motion asks us to do. Australia can play a constructive role in this debate, because we are, for better or worse, one of the strongest allies of the US. The US is having a more decent debate about this issue than Australia is. That is probably because the US has better politicians on the government side than the pathetic excuse that we have in Senator McGauran. We need Australia to contribute to the global debate by sending a strong message to the US that we want a responsible approach to military engagement rather than simply a knee-jerk, sabre rattling one. I note the comments of many Labor Party members. This is an important issue, and the Senate should send a strong signal on it. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Stott Despoja's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

In response to a recommendation made by the then Bureau of Air Safety Investigation (BASI) following its investigation into the incident in 1999, the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) undertook an extensive review of the certification of the BAe 146 aircraft and concluded that the aircraft continues to meet the design standards applicable at the time of introduction of the aircraft into Australian service. </para><para>Nevertheless, concerns continue to be raised about cabin air quality and as a result, various national and international organisations are undertaking major studies into air quality in passenger aircraft. There are currently two major studies being conducted worldwide and one that has recently been completed:</para><para>Â·	the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) have tasked a committee to draft ASHRAE Standard 161, Air Quality Within Commercial Aircraft;</para><para>Â·	the United Kingdom (UK) Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions has initiated research into air travel and health, prompted by the UK House of Lords Select Committee on Science and Technology Report on Air Travel and Health; and</para><para>Â·	the USA National Academy of Sciences (NAS) reported in December 2001 on its study of air quality in passenger cabins of commercial aircraft.</para><para>The House of Lords report contains a number of recommendations in relation to ventilation, air quality, filtration and the importance of further research, and this Government has taken its findings into account in developing its response to the Senate Committee's recommendations. The UK Government's response to the House of Lords' recommendations was released in February 2001, and further research is now being conducted.  </para><para>The study undertaken by NAS was sponsored by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and was established to assess air quality conditions, associated health effects and contributing factors in passenger cabins of commercial aircraft. Its report strongly emphasised that available air quality data is not adequate to address specific questions regarding aircraft cabin air quality and its possible effects on cabin occupant health. To address important unresolved questions, the NAS Committee recommended a surveillance program that includes a health component to determine the incidence of health effects in cabin crew and passengers and to identify possible associations between air quality and health effects. The NAS report is now being considered by the FAA.</para><para>The Government takes very seriously the issues relating to air safety and cabin air quality in the BAe 146 and other passenger jet aircraft. The Government is therefore committed to addressing the matter by implementing the following two measures to address the issues raised in the Senate Committee's report. These measures involve:</para><para>Â·	the establishment of a `Reference Group' (comprising Government agencies, key industry representatives and a passenger/consumer representative coordinated by CASA) responsible for following the progress and analysing the outcomes of international research and developments and working cooperatively with other countries, major regulatory bodies and those conducting related research to develop a harmonised view of the cabin air environment; and</para><para>Â·	CASA mandating an Inspection Service Bulletin (ISB) distributed by BAE Systems by issuing an Australian Airworthiness Directive (AD), which follows recommendations from the UK.

Working cooperatively with other countries will allow for a more timely and effective response into cabin air quality and the introduction in Australia of suitable standards that are internationally harmonised.</para><para>I would also like to thank all agencies and industry representatives involved in this response, including the advice from those stakeholders that are not specifically named in the recommendations. </para><para>A response to each of the Senate Committee's recommendations is attached.</para><para>The Government also acknowledges the work carried out by the Senate Committee and the important contribution it has made to world-wide consideration of these issues.</para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Response to Recommendation 1</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(a)The Committee recommends that CASA should reassess matters recommended for further action by the BASI/ATSB incident report (No. 199702276) concerning the incident on 10 July 1997 involving Captain Kolver.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Since the Senate Committee released its report, Australian airlines have progressively installed modifications designed to improve the cabin air environment of the BAe 146 fleet, developed in conjunction with the aircraft manufacturer.

It would be premature, however, to develop unique Australian cabin air quality standards at this stage. Rather, the Government proposes to further consider air quality issues following consideration of the international studies currently being undertaken that are likely to lead to a globally accepted approach to this issue. It would also be inefficient of CASA to develop a specific national standard for checking and monitoring the engine seals and air quality in all passenger commercial jet aircraft, in the absence of an agreed global approach to the matter. Such actions may result in an Australian response that is not harmonised with a future globally accepted approach, which could impose unnecessarily high costs on Australian aviation. A number of major aviation countries are conducting wide ranging reviews of the linkage between cabin air quality and adverse health impacts that are likely to lead to a globally accepted approach to this issue. Recommendations from UK and US reviews are likely to emerge in late 2002. The `Reference Group' established in response to this report will analyse the potential application of the outcomes of these reviews within the Australian aviation industry, and will work cooperatively with other countries, major regulatory bodies and those conducting related research to develop an appropriate Australian response. This task will be included in the Terms of Reference for the Reference Group.The Government also notes that:(a)	In accordance with the obligations established by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) (Annex 8 to the Convention on International Civil Aviation), the States of Registry and the State of Design, aircraft and engine manufacturers have developed procedures and standards for the checking and monitoring of aircraft seals on BAe 146 aircraft.(b)	The National Airworthiness Authorities that certificated the aircraft (the UK CAA and the United States Federal Aviation Administration (US FAA)) have approved these procedures and standards, which also apply to BAe 146 aircraft operating in Australia.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(ii)maintenance procedures (including specific maintenance procedures for ageing aircraft); </para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(ii)CASA already requires additional maintenance for ageing aircraft where routine maintenance may not be sufficient to detect all potential problems. All areas of the BAe 146 aircraft systems impacting upon the cabin air environment have a complete maintenance program to ensure that appropriate aircraft standards are maintained throughout the life of the aircraft. For example, the air conditioning packs are subject to regular overhaul, the engine seals are replaced at frequent intervals and the air conditioning ducts are thoroughly cleaned or replaced at each servicing. These requirements are set out in the aircraft maintenance manual. The Government considers that maintenance procedures currently performed on the BAe 146 aircraft are appropriate. However, CASA will continue to liaise with the manufacturer to ensure the adequacy of these procedures. An ISB distributed by BAE Systems has also been mandated by CASA. The Authority issued an Australian AD (see Recommendation 2), effective 3 April 2001, which requires all operators to undertake inspections of oil contamination at intervals not to exceed 500 flights. At this time, the Authority does not propose to introduce additional maintenance requirements for the BAe 146 aircraft.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(iii) specific, appropriate maintenance and operational procedures for the BAe 146 which pay particular attention to the need to ensure aircraft are withdrawn from operational flying and serviced to ensure any operating faults resulting in oil leaks, fumes or smoke are immediately repaired;</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(iii)BAE Systems has issued a number of changes to the BAe 146's Aircraft Flight Manuals (AFM) that provide for improved procedures for the isolation of any source of fumes into the aircraft. This process allows faulty components, such as leaky engine seals, to be isolated and the problem corrected at an appropriate time and location. The aircraft manufacturer and the regulatory authority (UK CAA) that issued the Type Certificate approved a Master Minimum Equipment List (MMEL), which specifies the equipment to be included on that list and stipulates the period of time and the circumstances in which the aircraft can be operated with unserviceable equipment. This procedure is part of the day-to-day operations of all operators worldwide. The Government is satisfied that this internationally accepted practice would ensure that aircraft are withdrawn from service in the event that a threat to safety was identified.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(iv)that incident reports should now be specifically designed so as to reflect the history of the cabin air problem that has been encountered on the BAe 146;</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(iv)A specific reporting mechanism for cabin air complaints is not considered necessary at this time. There are already several types of incident reporting systems in place, including the ATSB's Confidential Aviation Incident Report (CAIR), CASA's Major Defect Report (MDR) and the operator's own internal reporting procedures. However, the Government has asked CASA to establish a `Reference Group' (comprising Government agencies and key industry and passenger/consumer representatives) that could monitor the appropriateness of these reporting arrangements in light of overseas developments.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(v)sources of contamination in the cabin and cockpit environment in the BAe 146 be identified and further evaluated using appropriate sampling and analytical technology for the contaminants which, for example, might result from the burning of lubricating oil used in the BAe 146 engines;</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(v)This issue has been addressed in the international fora. The US National Academy of Sciences (NAS) has researched the sources of contamination and the affect of contaminants on the quality of cabin air. However, no causal link between contamination and health effects could be substantiated using available data. The Reference Group, to be established by CASA, will be tasked to address these issues more closely once further international studies have been completed. Working cooperatively with other countries will allow for a more effective response to cabin air quality and the possible introduction in Australia of suitable standards that are internationally harmonised.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(vi)companies operating BAe 146 and other passenger commercial jet aircraft in Australia provide CASA with specific reports on the results of monitoring these matters within an appropriate timeframe, whether quarterly or six-monthly, in order that CASA can assess the operations of the aircraft; and </para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(vi)In light of modifications made to BAe 146 aircraft to address cabin air issues, the `Reference Group' will consider whether the provision of these additional reports is necessary once international studies have been completed (see Recommendation 1(b)(v) above). </para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(vii) air quality monitoring and compulsory reporting guidelines for all passenger jet aircraft operators.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>(vii)As mentioned above, the `Reference Group' will consider whether a specific reporting mechanism needs to be introduced based on research currently under way. </para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Response to Recommendation 2</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>The Committee recommends that CASA adopt the modification to aircraft air circulation systems proposal for the Bae 146 aircraft by the aircraft's manufacturer as compulsory for all Bae 146 operating in Australia and that this be achieved by preparation and issue by CASA of an appropriate form of maintenance direction under the Civil Aviation Regulations.The Committee also recommends that registration of Bae 146 aircraft operating in Australia be reviewed, and that renewal of Air Operating Certificates and registration of the Bae 146 be subject to completion of those recommended modifications as a condition for continued registration of the aircraft.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Major Australian operators have already completed air circulation modifications that are designed to improve the cabin air environment of the Bae 146 aircraft. CASA advises that prior to Ansett Australia being placed under administration it had completed modifications to all its aircraft, and that National Jet Systems has also completed modifications to its aircraft. The modifications were accomplished in conjunction with major servicing of the aircraft. The modifications are intended to raise an already acceptable cabin air quality to a standard that is higher than the original certification basis of the aircraft. CASA anticipates that all Bae 146 aircraft imported into Australia in the future will have the modifications incorporated prior to operation in Regular Public Transport services.The available modifications are well publicised in the Bae 146/RJ Service Information Leaflet (SIL), `Cabin Air Quality Troubleshooting Advice and Relevant Modifications', issued by BAE Systems in November 2000.Furthermore, air conditioning testing was conducted on aircraft VH-NJY during a one hour twelve minute test flight on 20 February 2001 from Bournemouth International Airport, England. The objective was to prove the effectiveness of BAE Systems Modifications HCM40424Q (additional air into headspace between cabin overhead lockers) and HCM60174A (addition of electrically powered air extraction in forward vestibule). The test results confirmed that the modifications provide an improved airflow at the seat positions along with improved air extraction in the vestibule areas.On 3 April 2001, CASA issued an AD, AD/BAe 146 / 86 for all British Aerospace BAe 146-100, -200 and -300 series aircraft, requiring the following:1. At any time cabin air contamination is suspected to be associated with engine oil, carry out the inspections specified in British Aerospace Inspection Service Bulletin ISB.21-150, Paragraph 2A and 2B and the associated flow chart.If defective components are found during these inspections, either rectify such defects before further flight or isolate the defective component/s and operate the aircraft in accordance with the limitations specified in the approved MEL.2. Carry out the inspections specified in the British Aerospace Inspection Service Bulletin ISB.21-150, Paragraph 2A and the associated flow chart. The provision of Requirement 1 to invoke to MEL may be applied to this requirement if required. 3. Report defects to British Aerospace in accordance with British Aerospace Inspection Bulletin ISB.21-150, Paragraph 2J.1 using the forms provided in the service Bulletin. Additionally whenever oil contamination of the cabin air system in confirmed, forward a copy of the associated report to CASA addressed to the Section Head, Systems. 4. Ensure operating procedures include provision for required action in the event of a suspected cabin air contamination and for reporting such defects for maintenance action and that all flight crew are aware of those provisions. Note 2: BAe146/RJ Service Information Leaflet NO21-45 and BAE 146/RJ Operational Notice OP 16 contains information with respect to required aircrew action in the event of a suspected cabin air contamination event. Such action includes specific provisions for oxygen usage by the flight crew. Compliance with the AD is required: 1. Either before further flight, or within 10 flying hours provided the source of the contamination is identified and isolated from the cabin air environment before further flight, using either flight operations procedures to maintenance procedures. 2. Initially at the next A Check after the effective date of this Airworthiness Directive, and thereafter repeat the inspection at intervals not to exceed 500 flights. 3. As of the date of this Airworthiness Directive. 4. Unless previously accomplished, no later than 3 May 2001. This AD, which mandates the requirement contained in the SIL to perform inspections when oil contamination is suspected, reflects action by the CAA (UK) and effectively mandates action already enacted by local operators to address cabin air contamination events. This includes incorporating various modifications to the cabin air system, APU and engines. Local operators have also introduced improved maintenance procedures to further address this issue. These actions have resulted in a significant reduction in the number of cabin contamination incidents reported to CASA and the ATSB. In addition, the operators have changed the oil used in their respective fleets to Mobil 291; a fourth generation turbine oil (see Recommendation 7).The UK CAA and CASA did not issue the SIL in full as an AD as it contained information regarding the cabin environment, which was not related to the airworthiness of the aircraft. CASA has advised that to mandate all aspects of the SIL would establish a precedent where the Authority is involved with mandating various aspects of customer comfort, such as number of toilets, colour scheme, quality of food, etc. Through mandating the requirements of the SIL in an Australian AD, CASA has taken action consistent with the UK CAA, the National Airworthiness Authority that originally certificated the aircraft.Whilst modifications have been completed, the Government supports CASA's view that mandatory introduction of the modifications for all BAe 146 aircraft operating in Australia would impose unique requirements, an action taken only where there is an unacceptable risk to safety and not to mandate aspects of customer comfort. </para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Response to Recommendation 3</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>The Committee believes that development of an appropriate and accurate test for the presence of any chemical fumes in aircraft cabins is essential.

Furthermore, a mandatory ISB distributed by BAE Systems has been mandated by CASA. The Authority issued an AD (see Recommendation 2), effective 3 April 2001, directing that inspections for identifying oil contamination be carried out at intervals not to exceed 500 flights. The developments in regard to this issue may be examined by the `Reference Group'.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Response to Recommendation 4</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>That the issue of cabin air quality be reviewed by the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission with a view to including aerotoxic syndrome in appropriate codes as a matter of reference for future Workers Compensation and other insurance cases.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Several of the ingredients used in the fuel of BAe 146 of Mobil jet Oil II are already listed on the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission (NOHSC) Designated List of Hazardous Substances. The NOHSC Designated List of Hazardous Substances is generally reflected in the regulatory framework of all Australian occupational health and safety jurisdictions. The Government therefore believes it is not necessary to develop new codes covering fuel substances used by these aircraft. The issue of identification of a new injury or illness type such as aerotoxic syndrome as a compensable illness or injury is a matter for the respective workers' compensation jurisdictions. States and Territories have primary responsibility for workers' compensation arrangements in Australia, while the Federal Government has responsibilities in respect of its own employees. Beyond these circumstances, it is for States and Territories to determine a compensable injury or illness.The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations will advise his State/Territory counterparts on the Workplace Relations Ministers' Council (WRMC) of the Senate Committee recommendation, and refer this matter to it for consideration. </para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Response to Recommendation 5</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>The Committee recommends that the Minister for Transport request the Strategic Research Development Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council to set up and undertake an appropriate research program on the effect of exposure to aircraft cabin air on air crew and passengers.

The Strategic Research and Development Committee (SRDC) provides a complementary research funding mechanism. The NHMRC has advised that the issue of aircraft cabin air does not meet the criteria against which urgent requests are assessed. These criteria are: there must be a medium/high risk of threat to public health, its potential to spread, the population at risk, the unfamiliarity with the disease or issue, and the extent of the morbidity and mortality as a consequence of the disease to be deemed in urgent need of research through the NHMRC. Therefore, it would not be appropriate for SRDC to set up and undertake such a research program. The NHMRC relies on researchers themselves to determine the topics for investigation. Applications for health and medical research are then assessed in the annual grant process on the basis of significance, approach and feasibility of the proposed research and on the track record of applicants. The House of Lords Select Committee Report on Air Travel and Health, which was published on 23 November 2000, canvassed many recommendations similar to those of this Senate Committee. The main theme is that the Government, regulators and industry are responsible for ensuring that the risks are properly identified, managed and communicated so that intending passengers can make properly informed choices. Specific attention should be drawn to paragraphs 1.59-1.73, 3.33-3.41 and 4.16-4.43 where the UK Committee concluded that tri ortho cresyl phosphate and volatile organic compounds, which have been cited as potential causes of the symptoms complained of by cabin crew, have been found in such low levels that concerns about significant health risks are not substantiated. The Committee found no substance in any of the extreme claims about health risks from air travel. </para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Response to Recommendation 6</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>While the Committee is aware that the cases referred to are a matter of state jurisdiction, the Committee recommends that the Minister for Transport, in co-operation with appropriate State Ministers, appoint an experienced, retired judicial officer or eminent person who is appropriately qualified to conduct a review of unsuccessful or inordinately delayed employees' compensation cases, pilots' loss of license insurance, personal income protection, and with-held superannuation/other insurance claims made for personal injury and loss of employment as a result of ill health claimed to result from exposure to fumes on the BAe 146 and other aircraft.

The National Industrial Chemicals Notification and Assessment Scheme (NICNAS) is a Commonwealth assessment scheme that assesses new chemicals introduced into Australia and available data on existing industrial chemicals of concern, and provides assessment findings to regulatory bodies for decision-making. While NICNAS has not assessed any ingredients of Mobil Jet Oil II as new or existing chemicals (the ingredients of Mobil Jet Oil II pre-date the scheme and were accepted onto the Australian Inventory of Chemical Substances without further testing), a significant body of information has been compiled internationally and is already available on the hazards of the constituents of Mobil Jet Oil II. However, there appears to be no adequate monitoring data indicating exposure to the substance or its by-products under current conditions in aircraft. NICNAS will retain Mobil Jet Oil II on the list of candidate chemicals for the Priority Existing Chemicals program, and will review its priority in light of any further information becoming available. NICNAS is also reviewing the findings from the review of Cabin Air Quality by the UK House of Lords Subcommittee.BAE Systems has approved the use of some fourth generation engine oils (eg. Mobile 291) for use in the BAe 146 and recommends that airlines use these modern oils that are essentially a significant improvement in this regard.Since the Senate Committee released its report, CASA confirms that operators of BAe 146 aircraft in Australia now use Mobil 291 oil. An examination of Mobil Jet Internet is therefore of interest in regard to other aircraft, but will not be relevant to future operations of the BAe 146 aircraft in Australia.</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Response to Recommendation 8</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>The Committee recommends that CASA assess how quickly fitting appropriate high-grade air filters can be made mandatory for all commercial airliners flying in Australia to minimise any deleterious health effects arising from poor aircraft cabin air on crew and passengers. In view of proposed standards currently under consideration in the United States of America and elsewhere, such a system should ideally be designed to remove at least 99% of particles 0.3 micron or larger from recirculated cabin air.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>CASA advises that, prior to being placed under administration, Ansett Australia had introduced filtering for the BAe 146 aircraft air supply. The filters are made of carbon-impregnated material designed to remove undesirable odours. The filters were introduced at the same time as many other changes were made to the BAe 146 cabin air-conditioning system. Accordingly, taking these changes into account, the filters fitted by Ansett were designed to remove the presence of odours in the cabin air environment, but did not remove at least 99% of particles 0.3 micron or larger from recirculated cabin air as recommended by the Senate Committee. National Jet Systems currently do not have filters fitted to their fleet, however, they completed a modification program which incorporates modifications to improve galley air extraction and to increase air flow in the aisle and vestibule areas. CASA also continues to communicate with the FAA, the UK CAA, the Joint Aviation Authority and the American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) in regard to potential changes in international standards relating to filtering of re-circulated air. The Government believes that it would not be appropriate for CASA to initiate Australian unique regulatory action while the overseas organisations in a number of major aviation countries are conducting wide ranging reviews that are likely to lead to a globally accepted approach to this issue.There are currently two major studies being conducted worldwide and one that has recently been completed:ASHRAE has tasked a committee to draft ASHRAE Standard 161, Air Quality Within Commercial Aircraft;the UK Department of Transport, Local Government and the Regions has initiated research into air travel and health, prompted by the UK House of Lords report into Air Travel and Health; andthe USA NAS reported in December 2001 on its study of air quality in passenger cabins of commercial aircraft.The NAS Committee report and the UK Government response both acknowledge the need for additional research into aircraft cabin air quality and its possible effects on cabin occupant health. In particular, the NAS Committee recommended that the FAA investigate installing air-cleaning equipment for removing particles and vapours from the air supplied by the Environmental Control Systems (ECS) on all aircraft. More generally, it recommended a surveillance program that includes a health component to determine the incidence of health effects in cabin crew and passengers and to identify possible associations between air quality and health effects. The UK Government recommended research into real time monitoring of air quality and other aspects of the cabin environment with a view to establishing clear regulatory standards for passenger cabin ventilation. The US FAA is proposing two Aviation Rulemaking Advisory Committee activities, one of which is the Occupational Safety Issues Group to address issues associated with âCabin Air Qualityâ. CASA will participate in the public discussion, and intends to significantly contribute to these reviews. The `Reference Group' as outlined in this response also provides a forum for the continued monitoring of cabin air quality issues.</para></entry></row></tbody></tgroup></table><para>âââââ</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE REPORT OF THE SENATE EMPLOYMENT, WORKPLACE RELATIONS, SMALL BUSINESS AND EDUCATION REFERENCES COMMITTEE ON THE EDUCATION OF GIFTED CHILDREN</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">INTRODUCTION</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government supports the underlying assumption of the Report that all Australian children should have the opportunity to maximise their educational potential.

The benchmarks for literacy and numeracy specify minimum standards that should be achieved by all Australian students. Work is proceeding within the MCEETYA Taskforce on Performance Measurement and Reporting to develop measures in the other areas specified by MCEETYA.</para><para>The concept of developing high achievement targets and measuring achievement in relation to those targets would be a matter for the MCEETYA Taskforce on Performance Measurement and Reporting. It would need to be made clear that any targets that might be developed were not seen as putting an upper limit on possible achievement. Another question to be weighed up would be a judgement about jurisdictions' reporting responsibilities and how far these can be extended without imposing a heavy burden on resources.</para><para>This is not to say that the Commonwealth and States and Territories are not already valuing, measuring and reporting on high achievement among students. In 1998 the Commonwealth, State and Territory governments accepted an invitation to participate in the first OECD-led study of international educational achievement, known as the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA). The assessment is not primarily a test of curriculum content but rather of how well students can apply their knowledge, understanding and skills to meet real situations encountered in adult life. Three domains (or subject areas) are tested: reading, literacy, mathematical literacy and scientific literacy. During 2000 over 6,000 Australian 15 year old students participated in the assessment of the three domains. For 2000 reading literacy was the major domain. In 2003 and 2006 the major domains will be mathematical literacy and scientific literacy respectively. In PISA 2000 Australia was amongst the highest performers in all three domains. In both reading and mathematical literacy, Australia was (statistically) significantly outperformed by only one country (Finland in the case of reading and Japan in maths), in scientific literacy students from only two countries, Japan and Korea, significantly outperformed our students. </para><para>As the incidence of giftedness can be assumed to be similar from country to country, it is valuable to know that the results of Australia's top-performing students compare extremely well.

The Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) was introduced to assist in removing barriers to investment in education, training and skills development and thereby increase participation in postgraduate studies. Universities' preliminary estimates for 2002 suggest the number of fee-paying non-research postgraduate students has increased by over 20 per cent this year. Further, the Commonwealth has encouraged universities to allocate more HECS-liable subsidised places to non-research postgraduate study, particularly in areas such as education and nursing. The universities' response to this initiative will be monitored closely.</para><para>The Commonwealth Department of Education, Science and Training (formerly the Commonwealth Department of Education, Training and Youth Affairs) does not collect statistics that would enable it to report on the profile of postgraduate studies in gifted education over the past five years. Therefore it is not possible to determine if a correlation exists between participation specifically in such study and higher education funding policy generally. The monitoring of participation in postgraduate study, via the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) will continue, as under the previous regime, to be at a more general level. This is because monitoring the effects of PELS on the profile of postgraduate studies in gifted education and in every other field of study at the same level of detail would require universities to provide considerably more detailed information than at present and this would be inconsistent with the policy of looking at ways of reducing the reporting requirements of universities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 13</inline></para><para>The Committee RECOMMENDS that:</para><para>The Commonwealth should fund targeted postgraduate places for gifted education studies.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Government does not support this recommendation.

The principal source of Commonwealth funding is General Recurrent Grants. Additional targeted assistance is provided for those students with the greatest need. </para><para>The Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes (SAISO) Programme is the major Commonwealth targeted funding programme. It is aimed at students educationally disadvantaged in terms of their educational participation and learning outcomes, particularly literacy and numeracy outcomes. Specifically the focus is on support for students with disabilities and students not performing satisfactorily in literacy and numeracy. The guidelines for the programme reflect the intent of the programme that educational disadvantage may be associated with a range of factors such as disability, a language background other than English, Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander background, low socio-economic background and learning difficulties. </para><para>In this context, the Commonwealth does not support amending the guidelines for the SAISO Programme to specifically include gifted and talented students as a target group in their own right, and regardless of their educational outcomes. Such a change would dilute funding which is already in high demand, and change the nature and focus of the programme.  </para><para>The Country Areas Programme (CAP) assists students disadvantaged by geographic isolation to have the opportunity to improve their educational opportunities and learning outcomes.

The agencies produce research of an international standard, the applications of which are valuable financially, socially and environmentally. </para><para>AIMS was established by the Australian Institute of Marine Science Act of 1972 in recognition of the growing importance of the marine sector to Australia, in particular tropical marine research in northern Australia. Much of AIMS' research is designed to build national marine research capacity and to meet the challenges of Australia's Oceans Policy, which provides an integrated strategy for the exploration and ecologically sustainable utilisation of marine natural resources. </para><para>The planned outcome of AIMS' research is âenhanced scientific knowledge supporting the protection and sustainable development of Australia's marine resources. Areas identified as research priorities include the sustainable development of aquaculture industries and the exploitation of marine genetic resources for pharmaceutical and commercial use. Both these priority areas present outstanding opportunities for commercialisation of products or technologies.</para><para>ANSTO is a body corporate established by the Commonwealth Government through the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation Act of 1987 to provide the broad range of expertise needed to support Australia's interests in nuclear science and technology.</para><para>In addition to operating major national facilities such as the HIFAR nuclear reactor at Lucas Heights and the Medical Cyclatron at the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Sydney, ANSTO supports medicine, science, industry and agriculture through the development and application of nuclear-based technology and associated capabilities.</para><para>In the past AIMS' and ANSTO's commercialisation efforts have focused on developing technologies that clearly fit within their areas of specialisation. However, they have both recently developed technologies that have significant applications outside their areas of specialisation that have attracted considerable Australian and international interest.</para><para>The Commonwealth Government's innovation strategy, Backing Australia's Ability, has clearly acknowledged the importance of achieving greater commercial application of research from universities and public sector research agencies. It promotes strengthened research linkages between public sector science and industry, providing specific assistance to take promising research to the stage of commercial viability. </para><para>This is being supported by the provision of $78.7 million over five years as pre-seed funding to help commercialise public sector research, starting from 2001. Assistance through the fund will be available to public sector research agencies such as AIMS and ANSTO, as well as universities, to take proposals to a venture capital ready stage.</para><para>Backing Australia's Ability identified the need to examine barriers to the commercialisation of government-funded research. As part of its work on this matter, the CSIRO, AIMS and ANSTO Acts were examined to ensure that they do not inhibit the commercialisation of research developed by these agencies. The Australian Government Solicitor (AGS) found that both AIMS' and ANSTO's legislation was most restrictive in this context, imposing commercialisation restrictions.</para><para>Examples can be given of instances where AIMS current legislation excludes it from significant commercialisation opportunities. One such example is AIMS' inability to take up a shareholding in the spin-off venture to market the seafood test kit technology that they developed in collaboration with James Cook University. </para><para>The kit uses a new method to test shellfish for the presence of a toxin that causes food poisoning. It may also be applicable for determining the presence of toxic algal blooms in freshwater bodies. If so, this invention could find an even larger market and more lucrative market. However, AIMS is presently excluded from such exploitation of its intellectual capital as the AIMS Act clearly does not permit AIMS to engage in development and commercialisation of non-marine applications of marine science and technology.</para><para>It is also apparent that doubts under the current legislation about AIMS inability to produce goods and to participate in the development of marine technology and to sell that technology for profit is discouraging venture capitalists from investing in AIMS inventions and technologies. This is highly undesirable for the community as it limits the potential return on the Commonwealth's investment in marine research and development and restricts access to useful new products. </para><para>The bill will give AIMS significantly greater scope to commercialise its discoveries. Firstly, it will allow AIMS to engage in the development and commercialisation of marine and non-marine applications of marine science and technology.</para><para>Secondly, the bill will remove restrictions that would limit AIMS' ability to engage in commercial production and marketing of products incorporating the results of its research and development activities. </para><para>Thirdly, the bill will give AIMS and its related companies the power to borrow money to finance their commercial activities and give AIMS the power to make loans to its related companies and, with the approval of the Finance Minister, to provide guarantees for the benefit of associated companies of the Institute. Consequently, AIMS will be able to pursue business opportunities that have been put on hold by restrictions in the Act as it presently stands.</para><para>The bill will also increase AIMS' level of responsibility and accountability consistent with the intent of the Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act in relation to contracts and intellectual property management. This means that AIMS will be able to sign contracts valued at over $100,000 to a level of $1 million, without Ministerial approval. These amendments will decrease the administrative burden from the growing number of activities that currently require Ministerial approval and reflect increased accountability required of the AIMS' Council by the CAC Act. AIMS would continue to keep the Minister informed of activities relating to contracts and the transfer of intellectual property.  </para><para>The bill also includes minor technical changes to the AIMS Act that bring it into line with legislation covering other research agencies.</para><para>Amendments to the ANSTO Act are also required to facilitate the commercialisation of non-nuclear technologies with significant potential and to promote greater collaboration between ANSTO and users of ANSTO's technologies.</para><para>In pursuing its role in nuclear science and technology, ANSTO has made discoveries with important non-nuclear applications that are waiting to be commercialised. For example, ANSTO in collaboration with CSIRO and industry partners has developed environmental management technologies relevant to the mining industry through its Sulfide Solutions Research Project. This technology is important in addressing the world-wide problem of acid mine drainage and offers the prospect of sustainable environmental and financial benefits.</para><para>Another example is a technique for remediation of arsenic-based waste and water that carries arsenic compounds, which ANSTO has developed in conjunction with CRC partners. </para><para>To permit the commercialisation of such technologies, the bill will allow the agency to engage in the development and commercialisation of both nuclear and non-nuclear applications of nuclear science and technology.</para><para>With the development of the ANSTO Technology Park at Lucas Heights, high technology companies are taking advantage of the on-site expertise and access to world-class scientific facilities. The Technology Park would like to develop relationships with companies who have specialist technical and research synergies with ANSTO by enabling the companies to move to Lucas Heights, close to the source of this expertise. </para><para>The bill will clarify ANSTO's ability to construct and lease buildings to a third party. This will provide additional certainty as to ANSTO's capacity to pursue development of the Technology Park, through building and leasing those buildings to companies adjacent to the site. The Technology Park is an extension of ANSTO's business profile and is viewed by ANSTO as an important part of their business operations.</para><para>Finally, the bill will bring the ANSTO Act into line with the Science and Industry Research Act 1949, which is the CSIRO's enabling legislation. This means that the agency will be able to enter into a contract that is more than the threshold of $5 million set in the ANSTO Act, if a higher amount is prescribed by the regulations. This will lessen the administrative processes related to finalising contracts, as Ministerial approval will be required less frequently.</para><para>In summary, it is imperative that the AIMS and ANSTO Acts be amended so that the growing range of commercial activities of these research agencies may be fully exploited and in doing so, are fully supported by providing funds and infrastructure. Other minor changes will lessen the administrative demands on the agencies and the Government. </para><para>It is a matter of significant national interest that AIMS and ANSTO have the opportunity to fully commercialise the technologies they have developed. This will help them to contribute to the triple bottom lineâgrowth in income and employment, social well-being and a more sustainable environment. </para><para>I commend the bill to the Chamber.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Buckland</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>WORKPLACE RELATIONS AMENDMENT REGULATIONS 2001 (NO. 2)</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3096</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Motion for Disallowance</title><page.no>3096</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>3096</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Workplace Relations Amendment Regulations 2001 (No. 2), as contained in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 323 and made under the Workplace Relations Act 1996, be disallowed.</para></motion><para>Congratulations on your election to your position, Mr President. I have not yet had a chance to congratulate you personally but, as a Tasmanian colleague, I wish you all the best.</para><para>The purpose of this motion is to disallow regulations that would prevent casual employees from applying for unfair dismissal until they have been employed for more than 12 months. In 1996, the Howard government amended the existing regulation to exclude casual employees employed for less than 12 months from the termination of employment provisions. Labor moved to disallow that regulation because it was concerned that it would promote further casualisation of the work force, as employers would be encouraged to employ casuals for up to 12 months at a time in order to avoid their obligations with respect to termination of employment. Labor also took the view that the effective creation of a probationary period of 12 months struck against the general understanding of what is regarded as a short period of employment under the Workplace Relations Act. </para><para>The Democrats, after reaching an agreement with former Minister Reith, refused to disallow the regulation but promised to reassess their position after seeing the operation of the regulation in practice. Frankly, that was one of a number of cop-outs at the time. We believed that the Democrats had left young Australian workers high and dry, without adequate protections in the workplace. The Democrats today have another chance to stand up for the basic rights of casual employees, a growing proportion of the work force throughout Australia. That opportunity has arisen because, in late 2001, the Federal Court declared the casual employment regulation invalid because it went beyond the power conferred by the act. On 6 December 2001, the current minister, Mr Abbott, made a regulation reinstating the 12-month exclusion.</para><para>Labor believes that we need to recognise that the nature of the workplace is changing. Over recent years we have seen an increasing casualisation of the work force, with a corresponding decline in job security. The government should recognise this by reconsidering its view that casual workers for less than a year deserve no protection at all against unfair dismissal. Let me emphasise that: no protection at all against unfair dismissal. Under the current law, a regular casual who has served as a good and loyal employee for 11 months can be dismissed without even a reason being given. In our view, casual employees deserve better protection than that. For these reasons, Labor proposes that the period of exclusion for casual employees should be no greater than six months and that employees and employers should be able to come to an agreement on a lesser period of exclusion if it suits them. Six months is more than enough time for an employer to decide whether or not a casual employee is working out.</para><para>Very briefly, when we talk about casual employment we are not talking about a person being employed for the odd hour here or there over a lengthy time, maybe employed for a few hours one week and for no hours the next week, then employed for a month and then not employed for a month. We are talking about a very substantial proportion of casual employees who are misnamed `permanent casual' but are more aptly named `regular casuals'. It is very common across a range of industries for these employees to be employed on a roster. They might be employed for 20, 30 or 40 hours a weekâin fact, more than 40 hours a week in some casesâon a regular roster month in, month out and year in, year out. In a number of states there are long service leave provisions which apply to casual employees. So-called casual employees are covered by long service leave provisions.

I am pleased that the Australian Democrats will join the government to oppose the opposition's motion to disallow this important regulation. This regulation provides Australian businesses and their employees with certainty and the flexibility of short-term casual employment by restoring, as far as possible within the scope of the regulation making power of the Workplace Relations Act, the previous level of protection for business from dismissal claims by short-term casual employees. </para></talk.start><para>Last November, the Federal Court ruled invalid the regulations excluding short-term casual employees from making dismissal applications on the technical ground that they went further than allowed by the regulation making power in the Workplace Relations Act. The invalid regulations excluded casual employees from accessing termination of employment remedies unless they had been working for their employer on a regular and systematic basis for at least 12 months and had a reasonable expectation of continuing employment with that same employer. The government moved quickly to fill the gap and this regulation came into operation on 7 December last year. It excludes casual employees engaged by a particular employer over a 12-month period from accessing termination remedies. This is a narrower exclusion than the one contained in the invalid regulation and the government regards this as an interim measure only.</para><para>Provisions in the <inline ref="R1478">Workplace Relations Amendment (Fair Termination) Bill 2002</inline>, which is currently before the parliament, would restore the full scope of the short-term casual exemption. However, this regulation is necessary to ensure that an exclusion is in place pending the passage of that bill. If the government had failed to do this then employers could have been reluctant to hire casuals. This could have affected the ability of employers to do business and could have left those seeking casual work, such as working parents, without a job. I would also like to point out that this is particularly so in my own portfolio area of agriculture, where casual employment on a short-term basis is particularly important for employers attempting to operate an agricultural business.</para><para>This has been recognised by the Democrats, and I am able to inform the Senate that Minister Abbott has written to Senator Murray indicating that the government will emphasise the interim nature of this measure by inserting a two-year sunset clause into the regulation. It is important to note that the exclusion of short-term casual employees from termination of employment remedies is not new. A short-term casual exclusion was first introduced by the Labor government in 1994. That exclusion was for six months rather than 12 months; however, it is interesting to note that, on the reasoning of the Federal Court, the ALP's regulation would also have been found to be invalid. In 1996 the government extended the exclusion period from six months to 12 months; the casual exclusion remained otherwise unchanged. For more than a decade, then, Australian businesses have organised their employment practices around a short-term exclusion and it is important that they continue to be allowed to do so. The exclusion ensures that businesses have the flexibility that they need to hire short-term casuals without worrying about dismissal proceedings if it turns out that the employee is not permanently needed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>3098</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Australian Democrats have supported the workplace relations provisions and regulations that have been in place since 1996 and we feel that, in this area of determination of casuals, consistency would be of most assistance in the market. However, Labor, witnesses to the committees that have been hearing matters to do with workplace relations and the market itself indicate that there are some significant changes occurring in a dynamic labour market. Growth in casual employment has accelerated to reach 27 per cent of all employees. However, that may not be as relevant in the federal jurisdiction as some believe. For instance, the National Farmers Union, at the request of the committee, went away and had a look at how many of their casuals in New South Wales fell under the federal law and they found that 90 per cent of casuals fell under the state law. So in most cases the state law governs casuals, not the federal lawâbased, at least, on that judgment.</para></talk.start><para>What is the New South Wales period? It is six months. Labor would say that that proves the case. However, except for Victoria, which falls under federal law, the states vary very considerably in terms of access to unfair dismissal provisions. In Western Australia and Tasmania, casuals were not excluded at all from access to unfair dismissal provisions. I say `were' because Western Australia has recently changed its laws and I have not caught up with where it stands. Perhaps the opposition knows; I do not. As I said, in New South Wales at present the exclusion is for six months; in South Australia it is for nine months, and Queenslandâanother Labor state which recently changed its lawsâand the Commonwealth are both at 12 months. </para><para>Those differences, I think, constitute an argument for an agreed national-state approach to this issue so that the obvious uncertainty, inconsistency and lack of knowledge of rights on the sides of employers and employees can be addressed and reduced. I do not know what efforts Labor have made to try to get consistency among the states but I think that none has been made to date on this issue. That is unfortunate, because I think commonality across them all would be good.</para><para>The Democrats believe that the larger issue of the definition of casual employees and their conditions and bases of employment do deserve serious examination in view of the rapid growth of this less secure form of employment. That is why the minister's announcement is of particular importance. The minister has recognised that argument and has agreed that this matter will need to be revisited. On the basis of the two-year sunset clause, we are persuaded to stick to the position that we have always adopted: that the exclusion for 12 months continue to apply. Therefore we will not support your motion.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Sherry's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:26:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

<inline ref="R1474">Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002.</inline> The reason I refer to the title of the bill as `so-called' will become apparent later in my speech. At the outset it should be said that the Liberal government is doing nothing more than shadow-boxing, scaremongering and misleading the public with this bill. The shadow-boxing comes about because the courts and the Australian Industrial Relations Commission are yet to resolve whether bargaining fees are an industrial matter. If it is held they are not, the proposed laws become nothing more than a useless appendage to the act because provisions in certified agreements dealing with bargaining fees will have no legal force. So at this juncture the sensible course is to let the matter be decided by the independent umpire and, once the standing of bargaining fees is known with certainty, then that is the appropriate time for the parliament to visit this issue.</para></talk.start><para>The Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill represents yet another attempt by the Liberal government to dictate to employers and employees what matters they can agree upon in the workplace when it does not suit the agenda of the Liberal Party organisationâ and let us not forget the National Party. For all its rhetoric about allowing parties to negotiate the terms and conditions of their employment free of third party intervention, the Liberal-National government itself is quite prepared to intervene if parties seek agreement on a matter that undermines this government's relentless and hysterical campaign against trade unions and the working conditions of working Australians in general.  </para><para>The reasons advanced by the government for this bill are disingenuous. One only has to look at the title of the billâ`prohibition of compulsory union fees'âto see that this is a Liberal government that has contributed several entries to the dictionary of newspeak with the titles of its industrial relations legislation. The terms `more jobs, better pay', `fair dismissal' and `fair termination' come to mind. Once again, this is not a bill about compulsory union fees. That is borne out by the fact that the phrase does not appear once in the bill itself. So we have a title of a bill referring to compulsory union fees but nowhere does the title appear in any substance in any description within the legislation itself. </para><para>The bill itself speaks of bargaining services fees. Moreover, the definition of bargaining service fees in the bill specifically excludes union membership dues. So in fact the bill is not about union membership dues; it is about bargaining services fees. In this instance the title has the base purpose of creating a misleading impression that bargaining service fees are imposed by trade unions against the will of employees. This would scarcely be worth pointing out if the bill itself did not contain a prohibition against making false or misleading representations about a person's liability to pay a bargaining services fee when on this front the Liberal government is a serial offender. </para><para>It has become a repetitive but necessary task to remind the government how an enterprise agreement is made. All employees must have ready access to a proposed agreement for at least 14 days. An employer must take reasonable steps to ensure its terms are explained to employees. The agreement is voted on and cannot be certified unless a valid majority of employees have agreed to itâthat is, a bargaining services fee requires the democratic assent of employees. The government of course will say that there will be employees who will disagree with the clause and that those employees should not be bound by it. Yet with an enterprise agreement there will always be individuals who support some clauses and have misgivings about others. The same is true of an employee who is asked by an employer to sign an AWA, an Australian workplace agreement. The critical feature of an enterprise agreement is that a valid majority of employees have voted for it. </para><para>For all its claimed economic expertise, the Liberal government appears not to understand the realities of democratic agreement making in the workplace. It is not simply a feature of decision making in the workplace. For example, if you are a member of a strata body, you will have a say whether that body engages any professional services, and you will also have a vote. At the end of the day, however, you will be bound by the collective decision. The Liberal government has claimed that bargaining service fees offend principles of freedom of association. This appears to be a view unique to the Liberal government. The Liberal government was certainly unable to persuade the Australian Industrial Relations Commission, the independent umpire, of this view. It will be recalled that in the year 2000 the Employment Advocate applied to the commission to have bargaining service fees clauses removed from some 236 certified agreements on the basis that they contravened the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act. The commission at first instance, and on appeal, rejected that argument.</para><para>In his second reading speech, Minister Abbott characterised this rejection as a narrow legal decision based on the strict letter of the act. He also suggested that the government had exhausted the legal avenues to have these clauses removed from certified agreements. We have to wonder whether the Liberal government turned its mind to applying to the High Court for prerogative relief on the basis that the commission had erred in law. If indeed the commission had reached an erroneous conclusion about the freedom of association provisions in the act, one would have expected the Liberal government to have done so. Evidently the Liberal government realised that its position on bargaining fees was inconsistent with its own act. Let me re-emphasise that: the Liberal government's position is inconsistent with its own actâthe act that it pressed for so heavily back in 1996. So what did it do? It has decided to change its own law to suit its political crusade against trade unions. </para><para>The Liberal government's view that bargaining services fees contravene freedom of association principles is also not shared by the International Labour Organisation, which, it bears repeating, is a tripartite body. In 1994, the Freedom of Association Committee of the ILO reported that, under international law, clauses in collective agreements:</para><quote><para>May also require all workers, whether or not they are members of trade unions, to pay union dues or contributions without making union membership a condition of employment (agency shop) provided that they are the result of free negotiation between workers, organisations and employers.</para></quote><para>Consistent with international law, bargaining service fees are permitted in such countries as the United States, Canada, Switzerland, Israel and South Africa. They are widely recognised as a legitimate means by which employees may choose to contribute resources to the bargaining process without becoming a member of a union. The Australian government, by contrast, would like to deny Australian employees the opportunity to approve, by majority vote, bargaining fees which would ensure that their workplace has a better quality of industrial representation. </para><para>The Liberal government argues that its bill will not prevent employees from making voluntary contributions to unions who negotiate enterprise agreements on their behalf. This assertion is questionable. Proposed section 298SA provides:</para><quote><para>(1) An industrial association, or an officer or member of an industrial association, must not demand (whether orally or in writing) payment of a bargaining services fee ...</para></quote><para>`Demand' is defined to include:</para><quote><para>(a) purport to demand; and</para><para>(b) have the effect of demanding; and</para><para>(c) purport to have the effect of demanding.</para></quote><para>This provision is so broad it would effectively preclude a union from asking, in the politest possible way, for a voluntary contribution to the cost of bargaining. To the Liberal government's way of thinking, the fact that a union would have the temerity to make such a request, indicates that the union is hell bent on allegedly coercing employees to join its ranks. It is unfortunate that the Liberal government's profound hostility towards trade unions renders it unable to draft realistic and serious industrial legislation. But while the government claims its bill will not prevent employees from making voluntary contributions, it cannot deny that it will prevent them from choosing to do so in an enterprise agreement. This bill will prevent those doing so from choosing to do so in an enterprise agreement. The Liberal government has already told people what they can and cannot put in an award. Now it wants to tell them what they can and cannot put in an enterprise agreement drawn up under the Liberal government's own laws that passed this Senate.</para><para>In 1997, the Liberal government introduced into the act the concept of an objectionable provision. Up to now, an objectionable provision has been a term of an enterprise agreement that contravenes the freedom of association provisions of the act. This bill gives it a whole new meaning. It is simply a provision to which the Liberal Party objects. The Liberal government's objection to bargaining service fees amounts to no more than an ideological obsession with excluding trade unions from Australian workplaces. That approach does nothing to facilitate agreement making. Enterprise bargaining does not happen for free. If employees want to vote for an agreement that provides for the payment of a fee to underwrite the bargaining process, why should they be prevented by this Liberal government from doing so?</para><para>One can ask what the government's position would be if unions pursued members only agreements. Clearly, employees without the collective negotiating capacity of union membership would miss out. Heaven forbid, they might even then have the sense to join a union. That is this government's worst nightmare. Indeed, on 8 March the Employment Advocate applied to the Federal Court seeking the removal from several certified agreements of a clause providing insurance for union members only. In his media release, the Employment Advocate said that he:</para><quote><para>... views this provision as contrary to the act because it extends the benefit of insurance cover to employees who are union members instead of to all employees. </para></quote><para>Talk about wanting to have it both ways! If it is accepted that nonmembers should benefit from the collective outcomes negotiated by unions, is it fair to allow them a free ride on their fellow workers? Talk about contravening the principle of user-pays!</para><para>The Labor Party recognises that there are issues raised by bargaining service fees, particularly the quantum of the fees, which may require the attention of parliament, but those issues are best debated when the present legal status of bargaining service fees has been resolved. As I said at the beginning of my speech, the question of whether bargaining fees are an industrial matter is yet to be conclusively determined. It is a significant issue because the concept of a matter pertaining to the relationship of employer and employee is central to our federal industrial system. It has its origin in High Court jurisprudence on the conciliation and arbitration power in our Constitutionâa power that continues to underpin our system. It is an issue that parliament has traditionally left to our federal courts and the commission to address. That is because issues concerning parties in the workplace change over time.</para><para>In the 1980s a live issue was whether superannuation was an industrial issue. Ultimately, the High Court determined that it was. Now the live issues are things such as how you secure employment entitlements and how you fund enterprise bargaining. Yet the Howard Liberal government's approach is to strap on the ideological blinkers and ignore the independent commission and the courts by declaring all bargaining service fee clauses void. What is its justification for doing so? According to the Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, their continued presence in certified agreements lends them unwarranted legitimacy. That is not good enough. If we are to have a serious and informed debate about how bargaining service fees are to be regulated in Australia, it is appropriate to allow the courts to rule on their present status. The Howard Liberal government will just have to suppress its paranoia that employees will begin to pay greater attention to the efforts of trade unions in negotiating enterprise agreements on their behalf and become more favourably disposed towards them.</para><para>In summary, Labor will not support this bill as it is presented to the Senate. It undermines rather than facilitates agreement making at the enterprise level. It denies employees the right to agree collectively to fund enterprise bargaining through the payment of a bargaining services fee. It prejudges the outcome of court proceedings that bear upon the status of bargaining services fees in federal law and it forecloses a serious and informed debate about the best way to regulate bargaining service fees at the federal levelâ although, of course, depending on the amendments that are presented to the Senate, and I understand some will be presented by the Australian Democrats, I suspect that in the committee stage of this bill we will have an informed or at least a reasonably informed debate about the best way to regulate bargaining service fees at the federal level.</para><para>When the time comes for such a debate, and it may be later this evening, it is to be hoped that the Howard Liberal government will recognise that the Australian people expect more than worn out slogans bagging trade unions. Enterprise bargaining is central to our industrial system and Australia's economic future. This parliament should not stand in the way of employers' and employees' attempts to find the fairest and best way to fund the bargaining process.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>3103</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1474">Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002</inline>. This bill contains a mix of provisions. Its main aim is to prevent the collection of a fee for service from those who do not contribute to the costs of this service by means of their membership of a union. Whilst that may be its main aim, it is actually intended to prevent the compulsory collection of a fee for service because, in all that I have heard the minister say, he has not said that he opposes a contract that is lawfully entered into without duress and with full consent. The bill also makes illegal any coercive action against anyone who does not pay such a contribution, along with any attempt to encourage others to take such coercive action. It makes it illegal to misrepresent any person's liability to pay such a fee. </para></talk.start><para>The Democrats have long supported the idea that coercion in our industrial relations system and in our workplaces is wrong and should be made illegal. We have supported the existing Workplace Relations Act penalty regime and I will foreshadow that we are likely to support further strengthening of that where duress is a problem within the industrial relations system. The right to freely join or not join an industrial association has to be a cornerstone of a democratic workplace and union movement. It has to be a cornerstone of any advanced democracy. However, we have consistently opposed compulsory unionism. We also have on the record, and took to the last election, our policy that those who benefit from a service should make a contribution to its costs, all other things being equal.</para><para>Our Australian Democrats 2001 election issues sheet states:</para><quote><para>In assessing the industrial relations policies of both major parties in the Senate, we will apply and pursue the following principles [including] ... Support for freedom of association and the right to join or not join a union. We believe a strong case can be made out for non-members paying `fee for service' if they wish to work under conditions negotiated by a union.</para></quote><para>We support the rights of employees and employers to join or not to join registered organisations. We support the prohibition on duress, but fee-for-service issues can be separated from issues of freedom of association and a prohibition on duress, and our amendments chiefly or principally leave alone the government's increased attention to the issues of duress; rather, they pay attention to the issues of fee for service.</para><para>We think that fee for service that ensures that free riders contribute to the costs of benefits that they enjoy and freedom of association should be principles we support. I should say in passing that this tends to be a discussion about unions and employees. I have long been offended by the thought that two-thirds to three-quarters of businesses are not members of employer associations and free ride on the very hard work that those associations do.</para><para>There are two ways in which free riders can be required to face up to the decision not to contribute voluntarily to a service they benefit from. One is through measures that prevent them receiving the benefits that flow to those who have paid. However, and quite rightly, section 170MDA of the current Workplace Relations Act prevents a certified agreement from discriminating between unionists and non-unionists. That is an important principle on the grounds of nondiscrimination which we would fight to preserve. So it is not possible to make an agreement which states that those who do not pay will not receive the pay and conditions improvements in any agreement negotiated by a union. Therefore, it is not possible to prevent those benefits flowing to free riders.</para><para>The other way to catch free riders is to require those who receive the benefit to make a contribution to its costsâthat is, to allow the levy and collection of a bargaining fee. In most industrial instruments, that opportunity does not make itself available, so you really have to look for those industrial instruments which would make that possibility available. The challenge is to make this practicable without coercion or compulsory unionism and in a way where the fee and nature of the service are known up-front and the fee set is fair and is not just a union fee by another name. I think the great mistake made by those unions so far pursuing this issue is to peg a fee for service around the union fee itself. As we all know, a union fee covers many more services than just a bargaining service.</para><para>As we have noted in Senate committee reports on this issue, requiring fees to be agreed on an individual basis in advance by nonmembers who are advantaged by bargainingâa position which the government does not opposeâwill not necessarily overcome the free rider problem, as many free riders will still see it in their clear self-interest to refuse to give their consent in advance. Allowing workplaces to take a majority vote on agreements which include the provision to charge such a fee and then, where the majority vote in its support, permit its collection is not out of step with practice in other countries or out of step with our own party policy. It amounts not to compulsory unionism but to an appropriate contribution for a service received. It should be remembered that the whole question of bargaining fees only relates to collectively bargained enterprise agreements. Allowing the legal collection of a bargaining fee in this situation is a long way from compulsory unionism. It does not apply to awards and it does not apply to individual agreements. Some alarmists have suggested the effect of allowing any collection of bargaining fees under certified enterprise agreements will create a great deal of problems. I and my party are not convinced. </para><para>Currently, around 37 per cent of employees are covered by both federal and state registered enterprise agreements. The <inline ref="R1474">Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002</inline> does not affect state agreements and therefore will not affect a vast number of employees. Any provision in relation to a bargaining fee only applies in the circumstances of a federally registered collectively bargained agreement on which all employeesâunion and non-unionâvote. The agreement fails if there is not a majority in its favour. This means that only where a majority of employees support the levying of such a fee could it be charged. Employees not covered by collective agreements or by agreements where there is not majority support for a bargaining fee are in no danger of having to pay such a fee and remain covered by the Workplace Relations Act's strong protections of their right to freely choose whether to join a union or not and to be free of coercion. In that respect, I will draw senators' attention to the government provisions, which beef up that side of the act, and indeed to our own amendments, which also contribute to greater force in preventing coercion.</para><para>Those who overstate the reach and effect of bargaining fees under these very constrained circumstances do not do the debate any good service. Instead, they muddy the waters, mislead the community and may even assist people who wish to overstate the reach of any legal bargaining fee. Many countries deal with the free rider problem in industrial bargaining by allowing the collection of a bargaining fee under certain circumstances. I could not find the reference, but my memory is that in Spain something like 10 per cent of all employees are unionised but the unions receive a fee and effectively bargain for about 80 per cent of the work force.</para><para>In the United States, where collective agreements have to be reached, all members of the workplace must pay a fee to the union that negotiates an agreement. The United States is continually outlined in this chamber as a highly dynamic, extremely advanced capital market where modern practices lead to great outcomes in terms of wealth and wealth creation. The long history of United States industrial relations, which can hardly be held up as a regime that is soft on unions, supports the notion of contribution where service is enjoyed. That has always struck us as a fair principle where the right to freedom of association is also genuinely protected.</para><para>The issue of bargaining fees continues to be the subject of litigation in Australia. As a consequence, the government wish to legislate on this issue and we, as ever, are willing to consider the merits of their approach in the light of our own clear, published and longstanding policy. We will move a series of amendments to this bill which enact a set of principles. These principles include the legitimate levying and collection of a bargaining fee in certain circumstances, specifically where a majority have voted with full information in favour of the inclusion of such a fee in a collective agreement.</para><para>As everyone knows, we are great supporters of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission and we have preserved in our amendments the ability to refer to the commission, which must be satisfied that the fee is fair and reasonable. We will support penalties for misrepresentation about a person's liability to pay such a fee. We will also support penalties for coercive behaviour to collect illegal fees, along with a range of specific measures to allow the levy and collection of a permissible bargaining fee which prevents free riding. We think the following principles would make this practical: to provide that the Australian Industrial Relations Commission has the power to ensure that any permissible bargaining fee is fairly pitched and to make sure that employees know that they can access the AIRC on that basis; to ensure that any bargaining fee is known in advance; to require that the services provided in exchange for the bargaining fee are made clear to all employees; to ensure that the level of the bargaining fee and the methods of payment are explicit; to require that the fee wins the majority support of all employees in the workplace agreement by means of a secret ballot; and to ensure that the fee cannot be misrepresented without penalty. </para><para>If all these conditions were met, a bargaining fee would be permissible and could be included in collective agreements and apply to all beneficiaries of an agreement. It is not, however, in the nature of our amendments that all agreements have to include a bargaining fee: it is optional; it is dependent upon the parties to the agreement. I will be proposing amendments to allow a permissible fee along these lines, whilst also stiffening the treatment of false or misleading representations about fees. Without specific amendments such as these, my party would not be able to support a bill which outlaws any form of bargaining fee and runs contrary to the Australian Democrats' view that payment for services received is a fair principle to adopt. As everyone in this chamber knows and as everyone outside the chamber who is interested in industrial relations knows, for over five years I have pursued a campaign to find some means whereby fee for service can be part of the bargaining circumstance. As I have said before, I clearly believe that is a principle which would be desired by both employer and employee associations. I look forward to the committee debate where I will argue my amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3106</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to speak on this bill, the <inline ref="R1474">Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002</inline>, which is one of a number of bills considered by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Committee. The history of this goes back to changes in 1993, when the Keating government moved the system of industrial relations in this country from compulsory arbitration towards workplace agreements. The Howard government brought in the Workplace Relations Act in 1996, and this enshrined basic principles of freedom of association. What has happened in developments over recent years is that that principle of freedom of association has been trammelled by trade unions as they try to boost flagging membership. We have had the situation where the trade union membership, particularly in the private sector, has declined to the point in recent years where in many areas of the country it is running at 20 to 25 per cent. This is a considerable drop on previous periods of Australian history.</para></talk.start><para>On that basis, the trade union movement are trying to regain membership, and one of the very unfair ways in which they have tried to do this is through the imposition of bargaining fees in workplace agreements. The coalition is opposed in principle to this, because it goes against a fundamental tenet of liberalism: freedom of association. If you have a situation where someone is in a workplace and does not want to join a union and there is a union fee of about $300 but there is a workplace bargaining fee of $600 or $700, what are they going to do when confronted by that choice? Of course, a lot of people think that if they join the union it is only going to cost them half of what the bargaining fee is going to cost. So we have considerable objections to the way in which this system has evolved in recent years, and that is why it is necessary to bring in legislation to reinforce the basic principle of freedom of association and to stop these coercive fees being imposed on members of the work force who do not want to pay such fees or do not feel they really should. As I mentioned before, a very large percentage of the work force is not unionised, so the ramifications of this across a very large number of employees are quite considerable. Also, the cost to those people is quite considerable if all of a sudden they have to pay a fee of $700 which they do not feel they really should have to pay.</para><para>This bill was considered as one of five bills. We are now putting it back before the Senate. As for the history, since 1996 there have been a number of amendments to the original Workplace Relations Act put to this Senate and we have had Senate committee hearings. Those amendments since 1996, as we have tried to evolve the Workplace Relations Act, have generally been rejected. There have been some minor amendments accepted, but the frustrating position is that reasonable propositions that have been put and have gone to the Senate committee for inquiry have been rejected. In the latest round we have followed the principle of putting these up as specific pieces of legislation relating to a particular matter in industrial relations so we can focus on the particular issue. I would hope that members of the Senate, particularly the Democrats, would look at some of these provisions as being a reasonable evolution. If we had a situation where there was an unintended consequence from the original act, such as unions putting in these fees to try to keep up their membership, I would think a reasonable approach by reasonable people in this place, given that these fees are outrageously high and way ahead of the usual union fees, would be to accept such amendments. I live in hope, because we have seen in what is now the fourth attempt to amend the original act a rejection of reasonable sorts of amendments. This is despite a considerable amount of evidence in support of such amendments. </para><para>I will focus on the evidence that was presented to our committee, particularly in relation to the measure of compulsory bargaining fees. I will quote from some of the evidence. The Australian Industry Group put their concerns to the committee in the following way:</para><quote><para>... perhaps the most unfair aspect of the compulsory bargaining fee clauses currently being pursued by trade unions is that they restrict an individual's freedom of choice, and effectively operate by way of financial coercion toward non-union members.</para><para>Bargaining fees represent a mere financial variation of the closed shop, and thereby destroy individual freedom of choice.</para></quote><para>Similarly, the ACCI argued that the bill is necessary to the proper functioning of the act and the workplace relations system generally. They said:</para><quote><para>ACCI recognises that the freedom to join, or not to join, a trade union is a fundamental freedom which should be enjoyed by all people in a free and democratic society. It is for this reason that ACCI provided strong support to the introduction of freedom of association legislation in the original Workplace Relations Act 1996.</para><para>The coercive effect of bargaining services fees is at odds with the views of the Australian community which favour protecting the rights of employees to choose whether they wish to belong, or not belong, to a trade union.</para></quote><para>The committee also heard about bargaining fees that were in excess of the normal union fee and were imposed under agreements, suggestingâaccording to the evidenceâa coercive intent. One example was a fee charged by the CEPU. I quote from the evidence:</para><quote><para>The CEPU embarked upon a campaign to secure the payment of compulsory bargaining fees in the electrical contracting industry. After the CEPU applied significant industrial pressure to its members, the National Electrical Contractors Association (NECA) reached a pattern agreement with the CEPU which incorporated a clause prescribing a compulsory bargaining fee.</para></quote><para>Also, the Ai Group explained that, whatever the intent of the fees, the reality is that the choice between a bargaining fee and a disciplinary action meant no choice at all for non-union members. They said:</para><quote><para>Under the standard clause, an individual non-union member who does not wish to join the union is faced with a stark âchoiceâ: either pay the exorbitant âservice feeâ levied under the relevant certified agreement, or face the prospect of disciplinary action. Given the choice of a hefty service fee or disciplinary action (possibly including termination of employment), the individual non-unionist is driven towards taking out union membership. This is a draconian and unfair situation for an individual non-union member.</para></quote><para>This is why the government has moved to amend the legislation to bring it in line with the intent of the original act. <inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>3107</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1474">Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002</inline> and its effect on both Australia and Australia's workers. The most current economic reform programs around the world have a common originâ that is, the International Monetary Fund. Regardless of where economic reform programs are run, they are all similar in terms of initial conditions, imposed conditionalities, ideological orientations, implicit and explicit objectives and the impacts of the IMF program. One Nation's research indicates that many government policies are being driven by the IMF, an organisation with no independent evaluating body to systematically assess the effectiveness of its policies or its programs. The governor of the IMF for Australia is none other than the Treasurer, the Hon. Peter Costello. </para></talk.start><para>IMF economic reforms can be characterised by the following: forced privatisation; a fall in the standard of living; unemployment and retrenchment of workers; inflation and the phenomenon of rising prices; increased mortality with the mandatory removal of subsidies on health; fundamental challenges for democratic governance; deindustrialisation as economies are inundated with cheap foreign products; a reduction, due to privatisation and an invasion of foreign capitalists, in the number of nationals owning industries; a de facto loss of sovereignty; and challenges to trade unions and labour. It is this final characteristic that is of concern in relation to the debate on the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2002.</para><para>In 1999, the International Monetary Fund urged the Liberal-National coalition government to attack the trade unions' power, to address Australia's persistently high unemployment rate. In its analysis, the fund urged the federal government to address residual `inflexibilities in the wage bargaining system' which were probably caused by union power and the award system. According to the fund:</para><quote><para>Recent reforms to wage bargaining ... will help address the unemployment problem, but more fundamental reforms are likely to be required to achieve decisive progress in bringing unemployment down and improving wage flexibility.</para></quote><para>It suggested that `a more fundamental break from the past industrial relations ... systems may be desirable' to accelerate reductions in structural unemployment and improve Australia's growth prospects. This is not the first time the IMF has supported Australian workplace reforms. In Australia's 1998 articles of agreement, the IMF stated:</para><quote><para>Directors welcomed the government's efforts at labor market ... reform. Further reforms will be necessary, however ... In the labor market, reforms should focus on strengthening enterprise bargaining further, and reducing the role of awards and third parties in wage determination.</para></quote><para>In recent times, there has been an ebb in union power. Manufacturing is less important to the economy today. Globalisation lets companies locate their manufacturing anywhere in the world, diminishing the power of the domestic union movement, so why would the IMF wish to debilitate trade unions and derail organised labour? The reason is that unions serve as a rallying point for antiglobalist protests aimed at the IMF, the World Trade Organisation and the GATS agreement because unions will fight to preserve wages as opposed to allowing the market to set a minimum wage and therefore a minimum living standard.</para><para>The bill would amend the Workplace Relations Act 1996 to prevent unions and employers from demanding fees from nonmembers for bargaining services. The bill proscribes the insertion of `bargaining service fees' in a certified agreement. The government argues that bargaining feesâor a fee for service, as it is knownâis a form of compulsory unionism. The government wants certified agreements to become the norm, but it objects to facilitating the agreement making process through the provision of bargaining fees.</para><para>Non-union members benefit from union involvement in the bargaining process surrounding certified agreements. It should be noted that around 90 per cent of agreements certified under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 are made with unions. Enterprise bargaining is very resource intensive for the unions. The Australian Manufacturing Workers Union, for example, was party to 1,600 certified agreements expiring between 1 April 2000 and 31 August 2001 which required renegotiating. The Construction, Forestry, Mining and Energy Union estimates that, in the 15 months to March 2001, approximately 3,800 agreements had been concluded. In each case, the union must provide personnel to attend the workplace, often on many occasions, in order to assist employees in negotiations as well as in the drawing up of the agreement and its processing through the certification process in the commission. Compulsory unionism and compulsory union fees are completely different from a person contributing to the costs of bargaining. In bargaining, the paying person is a direct beneficiary of the bargaining process. People who pay a bargaining fee are not joining a union; they are paying a fee for a service. </para><para>The Workplace Relations Act 1996 provided for a recognition of the freedom to join or not to join an industrial association. The government says this bill seeks to protect the principle of freedom of association within the workplace. Thousands of certified agreements contain references to `bargaining agent's fees'. These require non-union members to bear a cost for union negotiations at their workplace. It is the government's position that that is tantamount to compulsory unionism. There have been several previous attempts to strike out bargaining fees from certified agreements. The minister noted in his second reading speech:</para><quote><para>... last year, a Full Bench of the Australian Industrial Relations Commission found bargaining fee clauses in certified agreements, despite their acknowledged coercive intent, do not contradict the strict letter of the freedom of association provisions of the Workplace Relations Act 1996. That application by the Employment Advocate exhausted the legal avenues to have these clauses removed from certified agreements.</para><para>A subsequent judgment of the Federal Court in a case involving Electrolux and the AWU suggests that bargaining service fee clauses are not enforceable under the Workplace Relations Act 1996 because they do not deal with a matter pertaining to the relationship between an employer and employees.</para></quote><para>Despite the rulings of the AIRC and the Federal Court, the government is determined to press ahead with its attempts to nullify bargaining fee clauses; hence the bill before the Senate.</para><para>The ACTU is strongly opposed to the passage of the Workplace Relations Amendment (Prohibition of Compulsory Union Fees) Bill 2001. The bill's title is misleading in that it has nothing to do with compulsory union fees, which are, and will remain, unlawful. In addition, although it purports to further freedom of association, this is not the case. The bill represents a further initiative by the coalition government to inhibit the operation of the collective bargaining system. By enacting section 89A of the Workplace Relations Act 1996, the government substantially restricts the scope of matters which the Industrial Relations Commission could include in awards. This bill continues on the same track in that it operates to prevent employers and unions and/or employees reaching agreement about a matter which is clearly related to the bargaining process.</para><para>The International Labour Organisation views bargaining fees as a valid issue for collective bargaining, with its Freedom of Association Committee stating:</para><quote><para>When legislation admits trade union security clauses such as the withholding of trade union dues from the wages of non-members benefiting from the conclusion of a collective agreement, those clauses should only take effect through collective agreements.</para></quote><para>The ILO's general survey explicitly states that bargaining fee provisions, when negotiated between unions and employers, are consistent with freedom of association principles. The minister argues that employees should not be liable to pay a fee that they have not individually agreed to prior to the service being provided. I indicate to the chamber that I have drafted provisional amendments that would allow the bargaining fees to continue, providing there is an agreement in place prior to the start of the collective bargaining process and that it is supported by a majority of people within that industry or within that employment, whether they are union members or not. The minister's argument might carry some weight if employees were in a position to reject the service, with the consequence being exclusion from the benefits of a collective agreement negotiated by a union. However, this is not the case. As noted previously, around 90 per cent of agreements certified under the act are made with unions.</para><para>The obligation which unions have to provide these services to members means that nonmembers employed in workplaces alongside the members also benefit. Stress can be caused in workplaces because of the perceived injustice of non-union members benefiting from the contributions and endeavours of unions and their members. With a government strongly wedded to the principle of user-pays and individual responsibility, union members can see no reason why they should be forced to subsidise benefits for non-unionists. That is a very fair argument. Fairness requires that employees who benefit from a service which cannot be denied to them by a union should pay their fair share, rather than be subsidised by fellow employees who are members of the union. </para><para>In conclusion, in line with the IMF's recommendations, the present government is focusing upon enterprise bargaining. There has been a reduction in the rights of unions and workers, and there has been a huge promotion, from a political and ideological point of view, of individualism over collectivism. The main goal of the IMF in pursuing labour market reforms is to address the issue of unemployment. However, an examination of Australia's unemployment rate indicates that unemployment has declined by just<inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic"></inline>0.3 per cent since 1999. This figure does not take into account massive hidden unemployment or the casualisation of the work force. The passage of this bill will further the IMF's objectives for economic reform in Australia.</para><para>In Mareeba, we have situations where, even through collective bargaining, the rights of workers are generally being diminished. It would be wrong of this chamber to pass this bill in its present form, because the government will, in actuality, place those people in an absolutely impossible situation. A very quick example is that members of our local government employed on road maintenance now have to travel three hours to an area that is designated as their workplace. They are no longer employed in their home town. They then have to travel another 1Â½ hours per day to their workplace. They were forced to accept their employment on the basis that they were only paid travel time one-way.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Abetz</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (SMALL BUSINESS PROTECTION) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3110</page.no><id.no>R1473</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3110</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 16 May, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Macdonald</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>3110</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1473">Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002</inline>.

These are matters best heard and resolved through the industrial relations tribunal system. The only analytical evidence supporting this bill, evidence that the government appears to be totally reliant upon, is a report by the Australian Law Reform Commission produced in May 1994. Not only are those recommendations eight years old but, importantly, the recommendations made referred to a completely different legal situation to that which exists today.</para><para>If we look more recently to August 1999, the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector reported on widening the powers of the ACCC to undertake representative actions. However, that report made no reference to small businesses being disadvantaged as a result of secondary boycotts. Labor holds firmly to the position that on matters other than industrial relations issues it supports the provision for the ACCC to conduct representative actions under the act. This is particularly in the circumstances where the costs of litigation and the associated legal complexity are beyond the ability of small businesses to seek legal redress.</para><para>Therefore, Labor supports the ACCC undertaking representative action, on behalf of small business, for a breach of the Trade Practices Act under the areas where the ACCC currently has an enforcement power and which are properly matters of trade practices law. However, Labor opposes this bill on the principle that secondary boycotts need to be considered and managed only as matters of industrial relations law. The simple consequences of operating industrial relations matters through trade practices law would promote an aggressive and less conciliatory approach to the management of industrial disputation. Thus, Labor opposes this bill. It does not serve small business well.  </para><para>What this bill really shows is that the government long ago ran out of good policy ideas on how to improve small business policy. Over the years, the government has consistently and persistently ignored the issues and interests of small business.

This must have consequences for small businesses. They are either paying higher fees to their accountant or are themselves facing the same difficulties.

I will happily take that interjection because, for once, especially in this last month, you are on the money: it is a very simple option. The GST liability is calculated by multiplying business turnover by this ratio. The simpler BAS option also provides a `safe harbour' from the potential costs arising from any tax audit. Currently, businesses being audited may have to justify every separate input tax credit claim and account for every separate taxable sale. That is what this `pro-small business' government has done to small businessâit has driven it to its knees, accounting for every transaction. But under the ratio method all that small business has to do is to show that all turnover has been disclosed. This is an example of the actions that the government should be bringing forward and focusing on.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>Small business also has other issues that this government is doing nothing about. Those issues include the soaring cost of public liability insurance and public indemnity insurance, the difficulties that small business has in getting big business to pay their invoices on time, the availability of skilled staff, access to business skills training, and tenancy laws. The government committed funds in the last budget to improve skill development and access to government services by small business. However, and sadly, according to answers I received from questions on notice taken at the last round of estimates, the small business assistance officer initiative is still being reviewedâmonths down the track. Further, no decision has yet been made finalising how the extra funds are to be employed. That is not good enough, Senator Abetz. Nor has the response by the government to the crisis in public liability insurance been good enough. The government's priorities are clearly wrong. The issues I have identified as of concern to small business are what the government and parliament should be devoting resources to, not the wedge politics attempted in this bill.</para><para>If the government really wanted to take some action on trade practices, it would join with Labor today in supporting the reforms to introduce criminal sanctions for the most extreme abuses of market power. But no, this government prefers instead to attack the ACCC and Professor Fels. The ACCC is there to ensure strong competitionâto protect consumers and small businessâand it should be supported in performing this function, not attacked and undermined by the Treasurer, the Prime Minister and a gaggle of other ministers. Further, if the government were genuinely interested in helping small business, it would act on the difficulties small business encounters in its dealings and commercial relationships with big business.</para><para>In 1997, the Joint Select Committee on the Retailing Sector, which is also referred to in the explanatory memorandum to this bill, reported that the issue of how small business fared in its dealings with big business was of great concern to it. Perhaps, Senator Abetz, you were on that committee at the time. In February 2002, the New South Wales Chamber of Commerce released its local business and regional affairs survey. The results revealed that, in regional New South Wales, 61 per cent thought that large firms misuse their market power and 67 per cent thought that the ACCC should have more power to halt anticompetitive conduct. However, the government remains silent on these findings. As this bill clearly shows, the government has lost touch with the concerns of small business. It has its ideological agenda, not what small business needs today. The government has no policies to help small business in this term, and it will not deal with the problems that are facing small business nowâmany problems that were created through inept decisions, or lack of action, by the government in its last term.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>3112</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1473">Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002</inline>.

I think they were originally introduced by a Labor government, and they certainly have been adapted and reinforced under the coalition.</para><para>Another major point to make is that the bill increases access to justice. The bill, whilst it will allow large business to plead with the ACCC to act for it, certainly has the potential to improve access to the existing law for small business and individuals. The question is how consistent is this bill's intention with the government's general approach to small business. The Baird committee had 10 unanimous recommendations, and they affected small business, but this government has introduced only five of themâin other words, it did not introduce half of them.</para><para>The next thing I want to say is that small businesses have been bangingânot knocking but bangingâon the door of the government for some time, asking it to address such issues as reversing the onus of proof in certain sections of the act, introducing the effects test and curbing the practices of big business through issues such as cease and desist orders or getting behind the corporate veil. I think one of the things the government is failing to do with the <inline ref="R1473">Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002</inline> is bring an integrated and consistent overall approach to the Senate with regard to what full protection small business should have. Personally, I would like to see this sort of bill integrated with the government's response to the Dawson committee, because when that occurs I think we will have exposed the true balance the government is going to strike between the needs of big business and small business.</para><para>In a minor act of provocation, I will foreshadow now a second reading amendment which asks the Senate to pay some attention to the concerns of small business with regard to the Trade Practices Act and to urge the Dawson review objectively to consider those issues. Why do I use the word `objectively'? It is because we all fear that they will have a subjective big business bias. I hope that I have made the point that if the government are going to address small business needs with regard to the Trade Practices Act we want to see a holistic approach which reflects the government's values. My second reading amendment will attempt to pick that up.</para><para>The prime purpose of the bill is to permit the ACCC to bring representative actions on behalf of people damaged by conduct in breach of the secondary boycott provisions in sections 45D and 45E of the TPA. It is supposed to work principally against unions that engage in secondary boycotts and it is supposed to work for those businesses or individuals that would be damaged by the boycott.</para><para>We think there are five or six pertinent elements. As I have said already, secondary boycotts as an issue of legislative note are not contentious in this place. They have long been a part of law, but that this bill will give small businesses and individuals greater access to the existing laws represents a positive. The bill, however, is highly unlikely to result in additional prosecutions. It mayâ and I stress `may'âact as a deterrent to excessive industrial action by some unions. At present, under the provisions of sections 45D and 45E, you are seeing a maximum four to five cases a year. You may introduce representative action in the belief that small business may feel empowered to go to the ACCC and say, `Hey, help us out here,' but if they feel intimidated in that environment they are still not going to go to the ACCC. So I just do not know how much real effect this is going to have.</para><para>On the political front, I assume that voting this down might be unpopular with small business but I am not too sure that they are very concerned. I have not had any of them banging on my door saying, `Please help me; I want representative action with regard to 45D and 45E.' I have heard them banging on my door saying, `Please help me; I want representative action against big business.' I hear that all the time. The bill could be seen as a symbolic assault on the power of unions as part of a broader anti-union agenda. I would hope that is not the government's motive. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âYou are too generous, Senator Murray.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>âIt is a fault of mine, Senator Conroy. Labor will remember with some annoyance that it was with Democrat support that the 1996 Workplace Relations Act transferred secondary boycotts out of the industrial relations legislation and moved them into the Trade Practices Act. In theory there is a danger that unions could be treated as anticompetitive cartels under the provisions of the Trade Practices Act but we all know that the TPA specifically excludes bargaining and employment related matters from its purview, so that is not an issue. The issue of small business with this government came most to the fore at the time of the waterfront dispute. But there is no evidence now that there is a widespread problem and I have not seen any business surveysâmaybe they are thereâsaying that this is a matter of concern to business in general. The <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>Presuming that one endorses the policy underlying sections 45D and 45E, the rationale for facilitating representative actions is compelling as they improve access to justice.</para></quote><para>If you accept that proposition, you have to ask: if that is desirable, will it have a significant consequence? Will small business use it? Will the ACCC act with regard to it? To make that judgment you must look back and see what has happened in the last year and a half with the previous bill which allowed representative action. The advice we have is that no action whatsoever has been taken. So, when I look at the access to justice issue, which I like, I do not see that it has an effect. But the symbolic effect is of some concern.</para><para>If the chamber were ever inclined to look at this issue with any real interest, the only possible improvementâand again it is picked up in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>âwould be to limit representative action to small business. I really do not want to see Shell or somebody else being able to go to the ACCC and argue for the benefits of this. Where do I rest on this bill? At this stage I am inclined, on behalf of the Democrats, to continue to join the ALP in their opposition. I remain open to hearing further argument but I do not think it is fair to lead the government on. I do not feel that you have made the case. If you were able to make it in debate that would interest me, but my approach at present is to leave this alone.

The bill proposes to amend section 87 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission, the ACCC, to bring representative actions in respect of contraventions of sections 45D and 45E of the Trade Practices Act. To commence my comments on the government's legislation, I note that there is inconsistency between the apparent short title of the bill and the proposed outcome. The bill is called the `Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill'. If one were to do nothing other than to read that heading one would assume that it was restricted to small business. However, this is not the case, and I will be seeking through the minister in the committee stage some extension on the actual scope of the bill itself. </para></talk.start><para>Section 45D of the act prohibits secondary boycotts by unions. It also prohibits contract arrangements or agreements which affect a supplier's acquisition of goods or services. At present under section 87 of the Trade Practices Act the ACCC can bring representative actions in respect of all of the contraventions of part IV of the Trade Practices Act, except for the two specific areas of 45D and 45Eâthat is, secondary boycotts.</para><para>What is a secondary boycott? A secondary boycott occurs where employees and their union take action which hinders or prevents their employer from acquiring goods or services from another person in circumstances where the action is designed to hurt the business of that other person. In either case, the other person is said to be subject to a secondary boycott. The Trade Practices Act 1974 prohibits secondary boycotts. Other provisions in the Trade Practices Act ensure the prohibition of secondary boycott actions is not weakened by collusion between firms and unions. The Trade Practices Act also prohibits both primary and secondary boycotts which affect overseas trade or commerce involving the movement of goods. Primary boycotts involve direct action by employees and their union against their employer, who is the target of the action. What are the effects of secondary boycotts? A secondary boycott which can effectively dry up the pipeline of basic goods and services for an employer because it happens to support a particular type of workplace arrangement is prohibited.</para><para>Currently, the act allows the ACCC to bring representative action for loss or damage due to contravention of the act, except where the matter involves boycott provisions. Currently, the ACCC can commence actions where boycotts affect competition or international trade, but not for loss or damage suffered by the targeted businesses. They can take action on the issue but they cannot deliver to the businesses that have been targeted the ability to recoup any of those losses or damage. This can often have the effect of giving larger businesses greater protection. Big businesses have the capacity to engage an in-house lawyer if they wish to take action in relation to secondary boycotts. Big businesses can also get around secondary boycotts because of the sort of buying power or market share they have. The government argue that small business cannot do that. They say that small businesses do not necessarily have the financial ability to engage a lawyer to take action under the Trade Practices Act. In reality that is, to a great degree, correct.</para><para>The reality is that in most cases small businesses are unable to avail themselves of the protection afforded under sections 45D and 45E of the act in relation to secondary boycotts. The bill would reverse this situation, allowing the ACCC to bring representative action on behalf of small businesses. This would also allow the ACCC in certain cases to come to the aid of small businesses that are actually facing secondary boycotts by other businesses as well. It is interesting to note that in 1997 approximately 18 cases proceeded to the Federal Court, and I believe that four of those actually involved business to business secondary boycotts. The balance of them, I believe, were a result of union action taken in relation to secondary boycotts.</para><para>In 1996, the government restored the secondary boycott provision of the Trade Practices Act as part of the workplace relations reforms. The Trade Practices Amendment (Fair Trading) Act 1998 prohibited unconscionable conduct by big business. Last year's <inline ref="R1111">Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2001</inline> enabled the ACCC to take representative action for breaches of the restrictive trading provision. But this bill, at that time, was amended by Labor and the Democrats to exclude sections 45D and 45E.</para><para>The ACCC is a well-resourced agency with an annual budget in excess of $73 million. The commission also has a litigation reserve of $10 million which it plans to build up to $20 million over the next few years. It operates under the 400-odd pages of legalese that make up the Trade Practices Act. Professor Allan Fels heads the ACCC. The Trade Practices Act is his bible and big business in some cases do not like the way he uses it. The big end of corporate Australia claim that they are being strangled by the ACCC's implementation of the Trade Practices Act, as does the small end of town, our small business industries. Both lay the blame in very different directions. The larger end of town blames the regulator or, in some cases more specifically, Professor Allan Fels. Smaller business tend to blame the big end of town. The ACCC is currently the subject of an investigation, the Dawson review, which will report in November this year. The ACCC has actually made a submission of more than 300 pages to that review. </para><para>Critics of the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill argue that the benefits of change for small business have been overstated. The ALP says that the ACCC has the ability to seek findings of fact, which significantly lower the financial burden of litigation for businesses. Furthermore, the ACCC itself has admitted that representative actions are very resource intensive and, as a consequence, the commission's ability to run many such cases each year is severely limited. This is borne out by the fact that the ACCC has not brought a single representative action under provisions of part IV of the act since it gained the power to do so in July 2001.</para><para>The government continually comments about the threat of an unlawful secondary boycott but has provided little more than anecdotal evidence of secondary boycotts and their impact upon small businesses. The government's current definition of small business depends to a large degree on what piece of legislation you are looking at. It can range from a number of fewer than 20 employees or a turnover of $20 million or, in some cases under some legislation, a small business is defined as a business with less than $2 million turnover.</para><para>Looking at this from Labor's position, the government has had a history of continually trying to slip into the Trade Practices Act powers that would enable the ACCC to become more involved in industrial relations matters. The ALP believes that these are best heard and resolved through the longstanding industrial relations law of the nation and our industrial tribunal system. Through this bill the government is trying to give the ACCC powers to act on industrial relations mattersâmatters for which the ACCC has no expertise and for which it would be quite unsuited given its current operations.</para><para>One Nation's position is that historically the party has been opposed to the ACCC and any expansion of powers for the commission. The party has seen the ACCC as a key body which has assisted in levelling the playing field resulting in the demise of small business and the increased dominance of multinational corporations within Australia.</para><para>The Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry's small business survey<inline font-style="italic"></inline>of May 2002 indicated that business taxes and government charges were the most important impediments to small business investmentâ and that was for that quarter. According to the survey, the top five constraints on investment for small business were: firstly, business taxes and government charges; secondly, insufficient retained earnings; thirdly, non-wage labour costs; fourthly, the availability of suitably qualified employees; and, fifthly, wage costs. Conversely, the top five constraints on investment for larger businesses were: firstly, insufficient demand; secondly, local competitionâand I go back to my point earlier and my concern in relation to this assisting big business and its ability to stifle or stamp out local competition. Their third constraint was state government regulations. The fourth constraint was non-wage labour costs and the fifth one was business taxes and government charges. In the latest survey the top constraint on small businesses is the availability of suitably qualified employees. Would the government better concern itself with reducing business taxes and government charges and therefore stimulate small businesses' ability to avail themselves of qualified employees?</para><para>In conclusion there are a number of questions that need to be asked in relation to this legislation. Firstly, is there a clear guarantee in the legislation that these changes will apply only to small business? Senator Murray raised this matter earlierâand I concur with him. I do not believe that there is a clear guarantee that the effects of this legislation will not be available to the big end of town. Secondly, how much will this provision cost the taxpayer in terms of funding for the ACCC to take representative action on behalf of small business? Through my office I asked for a briefing from the department in relation to this issue. To my amazement, the department was not even able to give me an indication of the budget that would be required for the ACCC to be able to carry out this function. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âIt is just a stunt.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name></talker><para>âTo some degree the Senate is being asked to sign a blank cheque for the ACCC, because we do not know what the costs of funding this would be. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Thirdly, could the taxpayers end up funding disputes via the ACCC for big business against unions? It would not be inconceivable that, if this legislation is passed in its present form, we could end up with a multinational corporation applying to the ACCC in relation to industrial action taken by either a small competitor, members of a union, or the union. I do not see at this stage any clarification or security within the legislation that could prevent that from coming to pass.</para><para>Fourthly, the government has been unable to provide any more than anecdotal evidence of the impact of secondary boycotts upon small business. The 1997 statistics that were provided by the department showed that only 18 cases at that point in time were as a result of secondary boycotts. </para><para>Fifthly, does big business have any existing power to take action against secondary boycotts through the ACCC other than in relation to international trade? At this point in time I do not believe they do, but this legislation has the possibility and the probability of delivering that. As I said earlier, what is the definition of `small business' under the act and which small businesses could apply to the ACCC for representative action? </para><para>These amendments, if passed by this chamber, would give stronger powers to the ACCC. They would enable the ACCC to represent small businesses when they suffer expenses and damages as a result of illegal secondary boycotts. The amendments, merely by being in place, would also reduce the number of unlawful secondary boycotts. Again, this will also have the effect of diminishing the power of the unions within the Australian workplace and their ability to represent the workers of Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3117</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis unfortunate debate, for which I need to thank senators as I provide the last speech in the second reading debate, confirms that the coalition is the only true champion of small business. The <inline ref="R1473">Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002</inline> proposes amendments to section 87 of the Trade Practices Act to allow the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission to bring representative actions in respect of contraventions of sections 45D and 45E of the act. Section 45D of the act prohibits secondary boycotts undertaken for the purpose of causing substantial loss or damage. Section 45E prohibits certain contracts, arrangements or understandings with organisations of employees which affect the supply or acquisition of goods or services. This government recognises that Australia's one million plus small businesses lack the economic power of large corporations to take action when they experience unfair treatment. This is particularly so in relation to secondary boycotts.</para></talk.start><para>I now respond to a matter that Senator Harris raised in his contribution to this debateâthat is, the ACCC taking on a representative action on behalf of big business, I think was Senator Harris's description. If you oppose their capacity to take actions with respect to all the other matters in the Trade Practices Act on behalf of the so-called big businesses, the question then arises: why would you single out the secondary boycott provisions for special treatment and say that the ACCC should be denied the capacity to do this, when the ACCC does have the power to do that for big business in relation to other aspects of the legislation? That is the real question on which honourable senators need to focus. Unfortunately, we have not been provided with an explanation as to why the ACCC should have these powers in relation to a whole gamut of matters other than the area of secondary boycotts. Of course, all contributors raised the issue of trade unions, but I will deal with that later. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>âLater!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>âYes, it will be later, Senator Conroyâso just sit there and wait. Without these amendments, small business will be effectively denied the full protection offered by the act and will continue to bear the costs incurred as a result of restrictive trade practices. The simple fact is that if a small business is confronted by such an action it will mean loss of cash flow, loss of business and, at the end of all that, to then ask a small business to seek to fund a legal action is to ask the impossible. As a result, you are giving the trade unions the capacityâand that is the example that has been used by speakers in this debate, but it goes wider than thatâto exert their economic power and influence to the detriment of small business. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I think small business owners in Queensland in particular, Senator Harris, would be aghast at the view of One Nation on this. They would also be aghast at the stance being taken by the Australian Democrats. The stance being taken by the Australian Labor Party will be of no surprise. While the Labor Party is having its internal debate about the 60-40 rule and whether it ought to be the 50-50 rule, the one thing the people of Australia know is that when it comes to policy the trade union movement does not have a 60 per cent say; they have a 100 per cent say, and they are willing to sacrifice small business on the altar of union expediency. It allows us to show ourselves to the Australian community as the champion of small business but, unfortunately, it is to the detriment of small business who are the employment generators in Australia today. Worst of all, many businesses are afraid to speak out about the impact of secondary boycotts for fear of further union reprisals.

Small business wants these amendments. It is very supportive of these amendments and the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Democrats and, it would appear, One Nation have turned their backs on this very important amendment and, as a result, on the small business sector. </para><para>The argument put forward by Senator Conroy on behalf of the Labor Party was that somehow this ought to be a workplace relations matter and not a trade practices matter. We say that this deals with a matter of unlawful restriction in trade. If a company or other organisation damages the trade of another company on behalf of a third party or refuses to sell to another company on behalf of a third party, it is a trade matter. This type of unlawful activity goes well beyond the relationship between an employer and their employees and is therefore outside the area of workplace relations. The government believes that no person or organisation, be they a business, union or other group, should be allowed to breach the trade practices provisions.</para><para>The Australian Democrats and the Labor Party should indicate to the Australian people and especially to the small business community and the people they employ why there should be these provisions in the Trade Practices Act. We know that if Labor had its way it would repeal the secondary boycott provisions holus-bolus but, apart from that, why would you have this legislation but then seek to ensure that it cannot really be enforced? The vast majority of small businesses simply do not have the capacity to take on the trade union movement in a legal case. If a request were made for security for costs or anything of that nature, it would be very difficult for a small business that had just suffered the huge economic consequences of a secondary boycott to try to overcome all that and also find the money to put a case up in the Federal Court. That would be beyond their capacity and beyond their means. That is why it is appropriate for the ACCC to be given the capacity to have the representative role that we are seeking. It is disappointing that the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats are so opposed to what is a very sensible proposition that is being put forward by the government.</para><para>In the short time remaining, allow me to provide the Senate with a couple of case studies. A building materials factory retrenches some of its employees. In response, the union forces a walkout of employees at another business which sells components to the first factory. The business has nothing to do with the factory's decision and there is nothing it can do to influence events. It is involved purely because it has an outside relationship with the factory that the union can use. Furthermore, the union knows that its actions are unlawful but knows that the business is unlikely to take any action against it. If the action goes on for several days the business will potentially lose thousands, if not tens of thousands, of dollars worth of trade. The business will suffer damage to its relationship with its own suppliers if the action brings on a credit squeeze. Once the action has ended, the business has no time or money to spend on pursuing a case through the courts. It would prefer to focus on repairing its operations and relationships with other companies. The business is also wary that the union might force another walkout. That is the scenario that the Australian Labor Party and the Democrats are willing to endorse, given their contributions this evening.</para><para>Here is another case study. Companies who are the victims of unlawful union secondary boycotts face the following unfortunate economic circumstances. Their employees are refused access to work sites. The companies themselves are in danger of losing contracts with their customers. Owners can lose their savings, be forced to take out overdrafts or forgo their own wages to cover the costs of lost trade. Unfortunately many companies feel that they have no option but to submit to the union's wishes or to face further losses. They feel so threatened that they do not want details of their cases to be made public in case this leads to even more disruption to their business. By the sounds of it, in that scenario the Australian Democrats and the Australian Labor Party would not want the ACCC to be able to come to the assistance of the small business. I think that is quite shameful. </para><para>Senator Conroy made a few comments in his contributionâalthough, I must say, he strayed off the topic somewhat, wanting to revisit GST roll-back, which I thought had been abandoned by the Australian Labor Party as a result of the last federal election. But, by the sounds of it, it may be back on the agenda and we will await that with great interest. We were also told about the extreme abuse of market powerâand, yes, that is a matter of concern for this government. But it seems that there is no such concern expressed by the Australian Labor Party in the event that those that endorse themânamely, the trade union movementâuse their market power and abuse it extremely to effect outcomes such as secondary boycotts. Senator Murray made a contributionâas usual on the one hand, yet on the other hand. I am sure in another life he would have made a very good lawyer.

To try to suggest that the Australian Labor Party were the architects of such visionary provisions is to really lift the Australian Labor Party to somewhere they do not deserve to be.

Minister, I think the nub of the issue is one that you went through in your summation during the second reading stage, where you talked specifically about the concept of having representative action and said that representative action would include in this piece of legislationâthe bill before the Senateâany business: it would be a small business or a large business. Of course, the idea behind representative action is to assist those who could otherwise not take representative action, and I think that the regulatory impact statement makes that very point, although in an unreasoned way it then comes to the view that it would be supported and representative action should then be taken. But I was wondering, given your earlier comments about the earlier operation of representative action, if it is your view that in all legislation under the Trade Practices Act representative action should be available without a caveat as to who could afford to pay. Is there any caveat that you then propose to say that only small businessâor any business for that matterâ should be able to propose to obtain it?

In relation to the very specific and limited bill that is before us, the issue is very clear. In relation to the one matter that Senator Harris raised and that I sought to respond to and must have misheard, for which I once again apologise: on the basis of this piece of legislation, which is the <inline ref="R1473">Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002</inline>, we see a very real need for the ACCC to be able to protect small businesses, whose financial circumstances are usually such that they cannot take on the might of bigger businesses or the trade union movement. Big business, at the end of the day, will not really worry whether this legislation gets through or not, because if they want to they have the financial capacity to take their actions anyway. Whilst I can understand the debating point Senator Ludwig is trying to make, he knows that in the real world big businesses have the financial capacity, should they so desire, and small businesses do not.

You do not name a potential act and then fail to define what it is that you mean in a title such as this. If this is for small business protection, ipso facto it is not for big business protection. The minister says, `Well, big business can look after itself.' If that is the case, let it look after itself, let it not have the ACCC looking after it.

But the fact is, if you give business an opportunity, through the ACCC, to get satisfaction under the measures in this legislationâagainst what I and the Greens maintain is the community interestâthen it is big business that will use that power; it is big business that will be active in looking through this legislation to give itself satisfaction. Small business has much greater difficulty. The ACCC cannot be expected to know what is on Senator Abetz's mind. That is a big problem for the ACCC; it has enough problems as it is. In legislation you must always be clear and precise about what you mean. If this is to protect small businessâ that is the government's titleâthen it must define what small business is, otherwise you are left to draw the conclusion that I drew when I looked at this legislation, which is that it is a con by the government in the interests of its big business supporters, benefactors and colleagues.

The two sections of the Trade Practices Act to which Senator Murray referred were only to come into being after the bill was passed, which was in 2001. There is a substantial lead time. Also, the mere capacity of the ACCC to bring a representative action is a huge disincentive to those that would seek to use their market powerâbe they a trade union or indeed any other organisation or businessâand, as a result, I would assume certain activities have been avoided because of the threat of the possibility of representative action being taken.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to Senator Conroy's contributionâand I note he has now absented himself from the chamberâI would like to indicate that one lesson I have learnt in politics in my relatively brief time is that, when you win, you do not gloat and, when you lose, you do not moan. When Senator Conroy gloats about a certain Tasmanian election result, I say good luck to himâbut I think the bigger prize is the federal parliament.

So I will wear as a badge of honour the accusation that I used my 20 minutes to argue and advocate for small business. I will indicate to the small business communities around Australia that I was criticised for spending my 20 minutes doing so, whereas someone else was more interested in running off in their bow tie to the Australian Industry Group dinner.</para><para>In relation to Senator Brown's contribution, I say that he may well be right.

It is just a pity that he did not use all those extra years that he has on me to acquaint himself with the provisions of the legislation, the charter under which the ACCC acts or its enforcement policy, because it includes as one of its important checkpoints whether parties can defend themselves from blatant conduct. Senator Brown may have been aware of that and hoped I was not, but I think it is more likely that he was not aware of that at all and therefore simply displayed his ignorance in relation to this matter.

As I understand it, even if the ACCC take representative action, they have to expose that small business to the public eye anyway. They have to say, `Look, here is the case. This is what happened to this person,' et cetera. There is no avoiding the public gaze through representative action. The small businesses would still be exposed as having been involved in actions, and if they were afraid of market consequences from being exposedâwhether there were representative actions or notâthey simply would not come forward.

This is borne out by the fact that the ACCC has not brought a representative action in relation to any of the other provisions of part IV since it gained that power in July 2001. Can the minister provide for the chamber any further information relating to how much it will cost the government for the ACCC to take representative action on behalf of small businesses? Will this become part of the additional commissioner's litigate reserve, and is this part of the reason why that reserve will have to be raised from $10 million to $20 million over the next few years? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>3125</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe federal government does not see that there will be any extra cost to the ACCC. The issue of resources that you raise is a fair and reasonable question, but at this stage the government has not decided to allocate further funding to the ACCC. However, we are hopeful that, if the legislation is passed, it will act as a substantial disincentive to people or organisations to act in particular way. The capacity of the ACCC to take representative actions arose in July 2001. Yes, representative actions are taxing on the resources of the ACCC. It is now August 2002âthat is, 13 months later. There is a long lead-in period and, as I understand it, it has to be for actions that occurred after July 2001. It did not have any retrospectivity, as I understand the legislation. It is doubtful that somebody behaved in a certain way on, say, 1 August 2001. Therefore, there has got to be a bit of a lead-in, then there will be a complaint and the ACCC will have to look at it. But the point that you make is a very fair one. Representative actions do consume a lot of resources and we, as a government, continually monitor the resources made available to the ACCC.</para></talk.start><para>Bill agreed to.</para><para>Bill reported without amendment; report adopted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>3125</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator ABETZ (TasmaniaâSpecial Minister of State) (8.59 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>Question put.</para><division><division.header><time.stamp>21:03:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The PresidentâSenator the Hon.

The Civil Marriage Celebrants Program was introduced in 1973 by the then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy. Prior to commencement of the program, couples had to choose between having their wedding at a church and having it in a registry office operated by the states and territories. Then Attorney-General Lionel Murphy's vision was that people who did not wish to be married in an orthodox religious setting should have the opportunity to be married in a dignified manner by a member of their community as an alternative to marriage in a registry office. In the early days, celebrants were selected based on recommendations made by members of parliament. This has been replaced in recent years by a policy of appointment to particular areas in response to a clearly identified community need based on data provided by the Australian Bureau of Statistics. That data is used to estimate the likely number of weddings conducted each year by marriage celebrants in any particular area and it is compared with data supplied by celebrants themselves.</para></talk.start><para>The program has consistently grown since its early beginnings due to the increasing demand for the services of civil celebrants and a corresponding fall in the demand for religious services and registry weddings, so much so that in 2001 more than half of all marriage ceremonies within Australia were conducted by civil marriage celebrants. This is a measure of the degree to which Australians have embraced the choice which civil marriage celebrants provide. Many celebrants have moved beyond their traditional area of marriage to make themselves available to lead other significant occasions such as births, funerals and comings-of-age. These occasions strengthen the bonds that hold families, friends and communities together. They are occasions on which we celebrate the higher attributes and the aspirations of people among our families, our circle of friends and our communities, or to recognise the contribution that one of our number has made during his or her lifetime. These are important occasions that, depending on the nature of the ceremony, can provide people with inspiration, the renewal of hope and, sometimes, even a sense of closure. In this way, civil celebrants have an important contribution to make to the life and, indeed, the health of the nation. </para><para>Just as celebrants have changed their practices in response to the expectations of the communities that they serve, it is appropriate that the Civil Marriage Celebrants Program move with the times. The current Attorney-General commenced a review of the marriage celebrants program in 1996. The review considered the opinions and experiences of marriage celebrants, celebrants organisations and the marrying couples who use celebrant services. A package of proposed reforms was developed and a consultation process was undertaken with marriage celebrants and other interested parties to finalise the changes to the marriage celebrants program. This was not an easy task, as there are not one but numerous celebrant representative bodies, each with its own views on the direction and appropriateness of the reforms.</para><para>As a result of that process, a number of positive changes were made to the proposals which the Attorney-General initially developed. The reforms are aimed at raising the professional standard for celebrant services provided by marriage celebrants appointed under the program. This will be achieved by the introduction of appropriate training which we underpin by a set of competency standards for all aspiring celebrants. Marriage celebrants will also be required to meet ongoing professional development requirements, similar to those required by other professions. The reforms will broaden and enhance the role of celebrants to include the provision of information on premarriage and other relationship services. Celebrants will not, however, be required to assume the role of a premarriage counsellor.</para><para>The reform will remove the current needs based system of authorisation. This will ensure that aspiring applicants with the appropriate skill and experience and who meet a fit and proper person test which is set out in legislation will be able to apply to become marriage celebrants. All new appointments will be based upon satisfying core competency standards. This will be achieved through the system of accreditation operating in the vocational education and training sector administered by the Australian National Training Authority. While opportunities for training currently exist for marriage celebrants, there is no current requirement for celebrants to have received formal training or to receive it on an ongoing basis. It is proposed that registered training organisations will develop the practical training course to be modelled on the accredited framework and that training will be available from a range of training providers.</para><para>Once an aspiring celebrant completes the training course, there will be an additional requirement to demonstrate to the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants that the fit and proper person criteria have been met. The criteria will include, but will not be limited to, that a celebrant must be of good standing in the community and determine whether there is an actual or potential conflict of interest between his or her proposed practice as a marriage celebrant and any other business or related interest. Existing celebrants will retain their current authorisation status and will not be required to demonstrate that they satisfy the new core competencies. They will have to satisfy the requirements of ongoing professional development. Appointments will continue to be made on a lifetime basis subject to celebrants satisfying the requirement of ongoing professional development and compliance with the code of practice.</para><para>All marriage celebrants will be required to complete ongoing professional development requirements. It is envisaged that no more than five to eight hours of ongoing professional development per year would be required for celebrants to keep their skills up to date. There will be a transition period of five years in the implementation of the revised basis of appointment. During this period the number of new celebrants authorised will be limited to a 10 per cent increase each year, based on the total number of authorised celebrants in the previous year.</para><para>A new Registrar of Marriage Celebrants will develop a mechanism for complaint handling. Celebrants will have a right to be advised of a complaint against them and to put whatever material they think appropriate to the registrar before a final decision on any sanction is made. Sanctions may include a requirement that further professional development be undertaken, the suspension of a celebrant for a given period of time andâ only as a last resortâthe revocation of authorisation. Decisions will be subject to review by the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. This mechanism replaces the current system of complaints handling, which has been criticised by some celebrants as lacking transparency. Accordingly, it is a positive development.</para><para>All marriage celebrants will be required to satisfy a code of practice, a copy of which has been publicly available for some time. The code covers matters such as requiring a celebrant to maintain a high standard of service and professional conduct, compliance with the Marriage Act 1961 and other laws, and a range of requirements for the conduct of marriage ceremonies. All celebrants will undergo a performance review every five years. Reviews may be based on a consideration of any complaints received, compliance with the code of practice and satisfaction of the requirements for ongoing professional development.</para><para>Despite consultation, existing celebrants have continued to express some concern about some aspects of the package of reforms. One frequently expressed concern is that the reforms will result in a substantial increase in the number of celebrants in the marketplace, which may put pressure on existing celebrants, particularly those people who have made a modest living from their practice. It would be disappointing if, as a result of the changes, existing celebrants with expertise, experience and the support of their communities found themselves unable to continue to practice. Labor will monitor the operation of the changes to the program in this regard. </para><para>Celebrants have also expressed concern about the conflict of interest provisions in the <inline ref="R1453">Marriage Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. Section 39C(2)(e) of the bill provides that the registrar, in determining whether to authorise a person as a celebrant, must take into account whether the person has an actual or potential conflict of interest between his or her practice or proposed practice as a marriage celebrant and his or her business interests or other interests. The Attorney-General has provided us with a copy of a letter from the assistant secretary of the Family Law Branch of the Attorney-General's Department to celebrant organisations, setting out the way in which the conflict of interest provisions are intended to operate. The letter states:</para><quote><para>While there appears to be some difference of opinion being asserted about the intent and interpretation of the provisions, we believe that the provisions do indeed work and will prevent precisely the sort of behaviour that appears to be causing unrest.</para><para>The provisions will prevent a person having a conflict of interest between his/her interests as a celebrant and his/her business and other interests. The âother interestsâ will clearly cover, for example, employment related interests.</para></quote><para>The letter goes on to point out that these conflict of interest provisions are standard provisions replicated in a number of pieces of Commonwealth legislation and that a similar provision has been in force for many years to determine an applicant's suitability for appointment as a marriage celebrant.</para><para>Ultimately it will be the responsibility of the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants to apply this test in a proper fashion. I trust that it will be applied in a way that is consistent with the approach outlined by the department. One day it may be possible for celebrants themselves to assume greater responsibility for the administration of the Civil Marriage Celebrants Program. This will only be possible if there is greater cooperation between organisations which represent celebrants. Celebrant organisations, such as the Australian Federation of Civil Celebrants, have for some years been working towards lifting standards of professionalism in the industry. However, the existing body of celebrants is viewed as not sufficiently cohesive to assume a coregulatory role. In the meantime, it is appropriate that administration of the program be the responsibility of the Registrar of Marriage Celebrants within the Attorney-General's Department.</para><para>The <inline ref="R1453">Marriage Amendment Bill 2002</inline> makes a number of other amendments to the Marriage Act. These deal mainly with matters involving changes to the notice of intention to marry under the act to make processes in relation to the form more flexible without interfering with the overall integrity of the notice. In particular, appropriately qualified overseas professionals will be able to witness the notice. Currently, only certain Australian qualified professionals and Australian consular officials are able to witness the notice. The process has a negative impact on overseas persons wishing to marry in Australia. The bill provides for guidelines to be developed to assist prescribed authorities charged with permitting the shortening of time between when a notice of intention to marry must be lodged and when a couple can marry. It also provides for overseas passports as well as birth certificates to be an acceptable form of identification for couples and removes redundant provisions in the act relating to marriages to be performed overseas by Australian consular officials.</para><para>As a whole, the changes both to the Civil Marriage Celebrants Program and to the Marriage Act will enhance the professionalism of civil celebrancy in Australia. They complement the moves that are already taking place within celebrant organisations to enhance the quality of service which celebrants offer to the community. The changes will also be of benefit to those Australians who in recent years have sought to be appointed as civil celebrants but have not been able to secure an appointment due to the idiosyncrasies of the current system of appointment. Most importantly, the changes will benefit those Australians who choose to marry by civil celebrant, as they will contribute to further raising the standards of civil celebrancy in Australia. I commend the bill to the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>3129</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak on the <inline ref="R1453">Marriage Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. The marriage celebrants program was established, as Senator Ludwig said quite rightly, over 25 years ago by the then Attorney-General, Lionel Murphy, providing an alternative for couples between a religious marriage ceremony and the registry office. The Australian Democrats are happy to be supporting the wide-ranging marriage celebrants reform proposals that have now emerged from a four-year review of the program. When the program was started in 1973, fewer than one couple in six chose a civil marriage and yet today over half of all marriage ceremonies in Australia are performed by civil celebrants. The program has developed in a fairly ad hoc way with celebrants being selected on the basis of recommendations by members of parliament to a quota system based on demonstrated need in the community and based on Australian Bureau of Statistics data.</para></talk.start><para>In 1996, the review of the marriage celebrants program was commenced, and the reforms that have emerged four years later are intended to improve the professional standards required of celebrants through appropriate training and ongoing professional development, and to ensure consistent quality service to couples engaging the services of celebrants. Celebrants will also have their role broadened to include information on premarriage and other relationship services.</para><para>Other initiatives in the bill include establishing a Registrar of Marriage Celebrants, which will develop a mechanism for complaint handling and maintain the list of registrations of marriage celebrants. There will also be a transition period of five years, during which time the number of celebrants will be limited to a 10 per cent increase each year, preventing a flood of new celebrants on the market.</para><para>There are a number of interesting issues which fall within the parameters of this discussion and which I would like to bring the Senate's attention to tonight. The first is the recognition that more and more people are choosing not to marry. The number of people willingly living in de facto relationships, whether of the same or opposite sex, has increased dramatically over the last few decades. So, while the government seems to think that amending the Marriage Act in relation to civil celebrants is a positive step forward, it fails to recognise the huge numbers of people for whom marriage has no attractionâwhether church based or done through civil celebrant processes. I think the government needs to broaden its legislative scope to recognise the great diversity in modern relationships with legislation that recognises and protects all long-term and consenting relationshipsâespecially those where children are involved. </para><para>I think too that we need to recognise the failures of marriage as an institution. As it stands, some 40 per cent of marriages end in divorce, with the number of second marriages breaking down at an even greater rate. These numbers seem to be slowly increasing. If we are to protect the institution of marriage, then we need to do much more than just tinker at the edges with reform relating to civil celebrants. We need to look at foundations, and the expectations of those entering and involved in marriage. We need to look at the social and economic pressures on marriage that may be responsible for or contribute to marriage breakdown rates and, perhaps far more importantly, we need to look at premarriage counselling in more comprehensive and effective ways. But the same is true I think of those people in de facto relationships. I do not believe that people in de facto relationships should be regarded as lesser beings or as being in lesser relationships by virtue of their not being married.</para><para>The ongoing conflict at times between state and federal laws also means that relationship recognition can be unnecessarily complex. While the states have jurisdiction over de facto relationships, including many same-sex de facto relationships, the Commonwealth has sole jurisdiction over marriage by virtue of the Marriage Act 1961. Now 40 years old, the Marriage Act is not reflective of contemporary relationships and not reflective of modern Australia. For example, some 60 per cent of couples these days live together before marryingâmore than double the number that did so just 20 years ago. However, most children are still born to married couples and most children still live in what we consider a traditional nuclear family. That said, it is clear that the typical family is changing. Recent studies show that couples without children will overtake those with children in the next 14 years. </para><para>The laws around marriage and human relationships have for the most part not kept up with the realities of Australian life. This results in discrimination and inequities and is most prominent in areas such as de facto relationships, same-sex relationships and the failure to recognise intersex and transgender Australians. The issue of rightsâor lack of themâfor transgendered people to marry has recently been cause for the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, to intervene through the courts in the matter known simply as the Kevin and Jennifer case.</para><para>On 12 October 2001 Justice Chisholm of the Family Court of Australia found that a post-operative female to male transsexual had validly married. In what was a test case for transsexual marriage in Australia, the court found that contemporary society had moved ahead of the law and its definition of what constitutes a man in the context of marriage law. The Marriage Act has been interpreted by common law to mean that a marriage is only valid between a manâmale at birthâand a female. In his conclusions the judge noted:</para><quote><para>There is no rule or presumption that the question whether a person is a man or a woman for the purposes of marriage law is to be determined by reference to circumstances at the time of birth.</para></quote><para>I believe the Family Court's decision to recognise the marriage between Kevin and Jennifer is light years ahead of the federal government and federal law. The Marriage Act must be updated to reflect both domestic and international contemporary understanding and acceptance of transsexual rights and contemporary adult relationships.</para><para>The Marriage Act must also be updated to take into account advances in medical knowledge since 1961. The judge's findings and lengthy judgment reflect upon these advances. For example, of particular interest is the evidence that recent discoveries have overturned our traditional understanding of transsexuality. It is understood that the traditional understanding that transsexuals are biologically of one sex but psychologically of another, is mistaken. In fact, as the judgment stated:</para><quote><para>... the argument is that transsexuals are as much biologically intersex as our understanding of other intersex cases are today. </para></quote><para>Expert evidence also declares that a person's self-perception and the perception of others is the best available guide to a person's sex.</para><para>Interestingly, the medical knowledge surrounding intersex conditions is also new since 1961. Intersex conditions refer to people born with reproductive organs and/or sex chromosomes that are not exclusively male or female. We now understand that there are many circumstances in which a male who at birth had female ovaries, chromosomes and genitals and was at that time deemed to be a female child may nevertheless be a man physiologically and psychologically. The same applies to a baby who is recognised by genitalia as a male child at the time of birth but through gender identity or other chromosomal factors later becomes female.</para><para>In the 1960s and beyond, the medical community performed surgery very early in an infant's life in an effort to make the child clearly male or female. Today there is so much more awareness of intersex conditions with some estimates suggesting that as many as one in 2,000 newborns have such a condition. When compared to the incidence of cystic fibrosis, which is estimated to be one in 2,500, it would appear that intersex conditions are far more common than one may think.</para><para>Just last week on 10 August, the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian</inline> reported the dilemma faced by Chris Somers, an intersex person who has been raised as a man and who wishes to marry his girlfriend and have that marriage legally recognised. Doctors have certified that Chris Somers is a 47XXY intersex person who has physiological and psychological characteristics associated with both genders. The failure of the legislature to bring our laws up to date with contemporary society and medical knowledge is having real effects on real people in our society. It should not be left to the courts to lead that change. Yet, sadly, a spokesperson for the Attorney said recently that `change was not on the radar screen' and that `there was no reason to contemplate change with respect to intersex people'. The result is a cruel and irrational situation. </para><para>Mr Tony Briffa from the Androgen Support Group in Victoria has said in reply that, until the marriage issue is addressed, intersex people run the risk that their marriage might not be recognised later in key areas such as property, insurance, and medical powers of attorney. Greater understanding and recognition of modern societal expectations would allow not only for the explicit recognition of the right of a transsexual or intersex person to marry but also for same sex couples to tie the knot. Same sex marriages are now recognised in the Netherlands, in several other European countries and in the US state of Vermont, and official recognition of the union of same sex couples is available in a number of other jurisdictions around the world. This raises the interesting question of overseas same sex marriages and what that might mean for Australian law. </para><para>Indeed, two newspaper articles recently drew attention to the fact that courts could interpret gay and lesbian marriages as legally valid unions under our own Marriage Act. It was reported that one of Australia's top jurists, former Family Court judge and leading Sydney academic Peter Nygh, recently deceased, had advised the government that the Marriage Act contained a clause that would allow overseas same sex marriages to be recognised by courts. In the same way that the Family Court found that the community had moved light years ahead in its acceptance of transsexuals marriages, it may be left to the courts to take the legislative lead in same sex marriage. But it should not go unnoticed that the Senate has the opportunity here, as we debate these proposals and amendments to the Marriage Act, to make those changes. Indeed, Australia's failure to recognise the union of same sex couples is now the subject of a case before the United Nations. An Australian man, whose same sex partner was a war veteran, is taking the federal government and the Department of Veterans' Affairs to the UN alleging discrimination after he was refused a pension as the same sex partner of a deceased Second World War veteran. As it stands, all states and territories have moved to legally recognise to varying degrees same sex relationships within those jurisdictions, or at least have given notice of intention to do so.</para><para>However, reform is needed at a federal level because the effect of the Marriage Act 1961 and section 109 of the Constitution is that the Commonwealth has exclusive jurisdiction over the formation of marriages in Australia. This means that, while most states have gone some way to removing discrimination against same sex couples and transgendered people, the law must be amended at a federal level to formalise those changes and complete them. A failure to do so means that the UN appeals will remain the last resort for people trying to change the law, as we saw in Tasmania in 1989. The absurdity of this came home to me last year when I appeared before the Senate inquiry into recruitment and retention issues facing the Australian Defence Forces. I questioned Major General Willis over the failure of the ADF to provide married quarters and other benefits to ADF personnel and the failure to have a process whereby the same sex partner of an ADF member could be provided with counselling or even compensation in the event that their partner was killed or injured. I asked Major General Willis how this discrimination against gay and lesbian members of the ADF fitted with the ADF's stated policy of non-discrimination and equity. I was told that homophobia and gay and lesbian discrimination was not tolerated in the ADF but that the Marriage Act 1961 and the Sex Discrimination Act 1984 was prescribed in a way that gave the ADF no alternative other than to exercise this discrimination. It is a ridiculous catch-22 situation.</para><para>The Australian Democrats' Sexuality and Gender Status Bill, which has been on the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> for seven years but ignored by successive governments since its introduction, would ensure that all people, including people with a sexual or gender identity different from the majority, have the right to equality under the law. Until it is debated and the Marriage Act is amended, people will continue to look to the courts, both domestic and international, to fight for their relationships to be recognised. </para><para>In supporting this bill, we Democrats are also keen to explore the issues surrounding same sex and intersex marriage and relationships and propose some amendments to the bill to that effect. This includes exploring the notion that same sex couples married overseas ought to have legal recognition here in Australia but, more importantly, that same sex couples and people of intersex status should not be denied access to marriage rites at the very least through some kind of legal recognition in a civil marriage structure in a way already adopted by several other countries. Marriage ought not to be part of a hierarchy to the detriment of other relationships. It can be an important part of our societal make-up, but it should not be used as a tool to discriminate against people and relationships that do not fit an often unspoken but religious agenda.</para><para>Ideally, I think we need a broad ranging and comprehensive Senate or parliamentary inquiry into the nature and structure of contemporary Australian relationships and a thorough analysis of what law reform is needed to respond to thatânot as social engineering to force a particular model or relationship on people in accordance with a church agenda or ideological framework, but in a way that acknowledges and reflects relationships as they truly are and provides a safe legal framework in which they can be protected most especially where the raising of children is involved. If the government is serious about cutting the divorce rate, I think it first has to acknowledge that unrealistic and inadequate frameworks for marriage may well be a contributing factor in many cases. Likewise, there may be many more marriages and many more long-term relationships if all Australian citizens were offered the same opportunities as some others so that all long-term committed couples could marry regardless of sexuality or gender. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>3132</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1453">Marriage Amendment Bill 2002</inline> is a relatively small bill but nonetheless a very important one. It is the culmination of a four-year process that began in 1997 and it caters for the Civil Marriage Celebrants Programâa very important program of some 25 years standing which provides a choice for those people who do not necessarily want a religious ceremony in order to get married but all the same want to have a dignified and meaningful alternative to a registry office wedding. To that extent I commend this bill to the Senate. </para></talk.start><para>When the program was lodged in 1973, fewer than one couple in six chose a civil marriage. Today, over half of all marriage ceremonies within Australia are conducted by civil marriage celebrants. Celebrants, both civil and religious, have been at the forefront of a major social change in only one generation and their important role has long been underestimated. The growing demand for civil ceremonies has resulted in a steady increase in the numbers of authorised celebrants and an even greater increase in interest in the profession of celebrancy, with inquiries from people wishing to become a marriage celebrant running at approximately 3,000 a year.</para><para>Since the program commenced, however, the process for authorising marriage celebrants has developed in an ad hoc way and reform of the program is long overdue. Given that marriage will be one of the most, if not the most, significant commitments couples will make during their lifetime, they deserve to be able to choose the right celebrant according to their own personal preferences and, of course, they have to be assured of thoroughly professional service. The overarching catalyst for reforming the program is to ensure that couples intending to marry have wide access to thoroughly professional marriage celebrants. This philosophy and intent behind the reform process is one the government shares with the celebrant community. The bill demonstrates that the government has listened to and acted upon the concerns of the celebrant community. This is evident most particularly in the inclusion of a five-year transitional period during which there will be a cap on the appointments of marriage celebrants. </para><para>The development of the reform package has been a long and, at times, difficult process. Throughout the process the celebrant community has remained engaged and, in the main, very constructive in its approach to what the government had in mind. The celebrant community has recognised the need for change and responded appropriately. Reform of the marriage celebrants program to satisfy the community of the quality and integrity of the program into the future is critical and this package of amendments will be fundamental to ensuring that outcome. The reform of the marriage celebrants program will enable the profession of celebrancy to develop and flourish into what is clearly an expanding future. I reiterate that this bill, albeit a small bill, is a very important one for all Australians, particularly those who are contemplating marriage. I thank honourable senators for their contribution and I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>3133</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Billâby leaveâtaken as a whole. </para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3133</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, page 12 (after line 28), after item 18, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">18A  After section 23B</inline></para><para>Insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">23C  Same sex marriages permitted</inline></para><quote><para>		For the avoidance of doubt, nothing in this or any other Act prevents the marriage of any two persons solely on the grounds of their sex.</para><para>(2)	Schedule 1, page 12 (after line 28), after item 18, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">18B  Subsection 45(2)</inline></para><para>After âto be my lawful wedded wife (<inline font-weight="bold">or</inline> husband)â insert â(<inline font-weight="bold">or</inline> partner)â.</para><para>(3)	Schedule 1, page 12 (after line 28), after item 18, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">18C  Subsection 46(1)</inline></para><para>Omit âis the union of a man and a womanâ, substitute âis the union of two personsâ.</para></quote><para>The amendments come to the core of what I was talking about in my speech on the second reading. If I were to encapsulate it in a sentence, what this would do is permit the legal marriage of same sex partnersâwe are talking about gay and lesbian relationships. Chair, you may not be aware that most states and territoriesâincluding, astonishingly, my own home state very recentlyâhave passed legislation of varying adequacyâsome states are very good and others poorâwhich legally recognise same sex relationships, ending an extraordinary raft of discrimination against them which occurs under state law. They can include things like wills and estates, hospital visitations, superannuation and other issues, which can get particularly very messy when children are involved. </para><para>The difficulty we have often in recognising relationships and legislatively protecting them is the conflict we so often get in not just this area of law but other areas of law between Commonwealth and state jurisdiction and Commonwealth and state powers. So while in all states and territories there is some form of legal recognition of same sex relationships or a commitment by those state and territory governments to do so in their current terms, we have no such commitment from the current government and no such indication more broadly from this parliament that that area of discrimination will be fixed up at a Commonwealth level. This is not the first time I have mentioned that and I hope I do not have to keep mentioning it for too much longer. The lack of legal binding recognition of same sex relationships at a Commonwealth level results in some very real discrimination and some very real pain, and I would like to talk about some of those incidents.</para><para>I spoke briefly about the discrimination in the defence forces. I think Senator Ray was the minister when the ban was lifted in 1992. There is no longer a prohibition on lesbian and gay people serving in the armed forces. That was a very welcome and long overdue event which is celebrated 10 years later. Despite that reform, there is still no legal recognition for same sex couples within the defence forces and that causes some particularly acute problems, one of which springs to mind. If a soldier is killed or injured overseas, for his partnerâor her partner, I am not too sure about the level to which females are involved in overseas conflictânot only is there no explicit recognition of the partner in terms of notifying them of injury or death, but there is no death or injury compensation provided to the remaining partner nor is there any reversionary pension where that might apply. That is really an appalling situation when we are asking gay and lesbian ADF personnel to commit to the same level as their heterosexual counterpartsâwhich they do. </para><para>Superannuation is very much a thorny issue about which we have had some debate in this chamber in terms of the discrimination that continues to occur in that area. The current situation, particularly in the Commonwealth Public Service, is that there is no automatic death benefit provision for a surviving same sex partner and there is a specific prohibition on any reversionary pension. That applies not only to lesbian and gay people working for the Commonwealth Public Service, of whom there are thousands, but also to the way in which corporations operate under the Superannuation Act as administered by the Commonwealth.</para><para>Social security is another area of concern. Ironically it is often pointed to as an area where gay and lesbian people benefit. Because of the explicit failure of Commonwealth governments not to recognise same sex relationships, we had the extraordinary situation where one member of a same sex couple was working full time but the partner was in receipt of unemployment benefits to the maximum amount because they were considered to be two single people. Ironically, I found myself in that situation when I was in my senator-elect period and I was pilloried for it. I was asked on Perth radio how I could be in receipt of the full amount of unemployment benefits when I was such a strong advocate for equality for same sex couples, given that my partner was then working full time. The answer to that is simple: until such time that we have equality right across the board in all areas of rights and responsibilities, I fail to see why I should show any compensation. That is the case for all lesbian and gay people in that scenario.</para><para>As an advocate of equality, I recognise that reforming the law would mean that many same sex couples would suddenly experience disadvantage under the social security provisions, but that is how it ought to be if you are going to have equality. I should add, however, that there are also other areas of Commonwealth social security in which same sex couples are discriminated against. For example, I understand that funeral or bereavement benefits are paid if a couple are unemployed and one dies, but that a funeral benefit is not paid to a surviving same sex partner.</para><para>Curiously, there is one area of Commonwealth law which, in an unspoken way, does recognise same sex relationships and that is in respect of relocation expenses. For example, if a member of the Commonwealth Public Service who works for a particular department is in a long-term same sex relationship and he or she is moved interstate, their partner will also be collocated with them at the taxpayers' cost as if it were a heterosexual de facto relationship. That is a positive step, but that kind of progress is not echoed right across the board and we find other areas where discrimination continues. You find it in Veterans' Affairs, the defence forces and in industrial relations. Interestingly, the Workplace Relations Act 1996 provides that you cannot have unfair dismissalâit is either unfair or unlawful dismissal, I am not sure whichâon the grounds of sexuality. A protection is built into the system so that gay and lesbian people cannot be sacked if their employer happens to find out that they may be lesbian or gay. However, that protection does not extend to other areas of discrimination, including the refusal to hire somebody on the basis of their sexuality. That remains lawful, as does refusing to promote somebody. The protection that is built in in a small way in industrial relations does not carry right across the board.</para><para>The area of compensation and insurance which often blends into superannuation is also an ongoing issue and it remains unfixed. Ultimately, the best wayâand I think the only appropriate and adequate wayâto address all those issues in one fell swoop is to provide for the formal legal recognition of same sex relationships. The bill before us today provides us with the opportunity to do just that with the passage of these amendments. </para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>3135</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>âOrder!

You have just got the Swans hat-trickâthey have won their last two gamesâand you have won the presidency. I am sure there will be rejoicing at the SGC next weekend.</para></talk.start><para>I want to start tonight by once again saying that the ABC radio coverage of a big sporting eventâthat is, the Commonwealth Gamesâwas a major success. Good professional commentary, with the stress on timeliness, kept everyone well informed. ABC radio coverage of sport has remained consistently first-class whereas ABC television coverage of sport is just limited to niche markets and the reason for that is pretty obvious: it is very expensive to buy sporting programs and the ABC simply cannot compete with the commercial networks.</para><para>It is recognised that programming decisions are the right of the ABC management and not of the executive or this parliament. However, this should not inhibit members of parliament from reflecting the views of their constituents. Every now and then what one might term the ABC's cultural snobbishness gets the better part of their judgment. A number of years ago, the ABC had the program <inline font-style="italic">The Could Have Beens</inline> on Saturday mornings. It rated well and it was doing really well. It was axed for reasons of fiscal rectitude and went on to be a massive success on another commercial radio station We got all sorts of excuses at the time as to why it was not continued and we heard recently that the program <inline font-style="italic">When Saturday Comes </inline>is due for the hatchet.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">When Saturday Comes</inline> is a two-hour football review with a variety of innovative and entertaining features. It seems to have a particular appeal for female listeners. The highlight of every show is hearing from the coaches in the outer and all their knockabout views on tactics. That is a really humorous section but it is not the only one that is quite innovative. So what do we now hear? The ABC is not going to renew it. We are going to have some more lifestyle programs put in its place. All right, maybe sport is covered extensively in Australian society. Maybe too muchâwho knows? But so too are lifestyle issues.</para><para>Currently we get five ABC stations beaming into Melbourne. We have PNN to cover the news. We have loud music on Triple JâI could not tell you where it is on the dial, but I am glad it is there for the younger people in society. We have Classic FM playing a variety of music, and we have Radio National catering to every esoteric cultural group on the earthâand it rates a little less than Silver Top Taxis in terms of listening audience. Then we have the fifth stationâthe old 3LO, now renamed 744 ABC Melbourne. I suppose we paid some consultants a pretty hefty fee to change its name.</para><para>But what we get on a Saturday morning now, from seven o'clock through to 10 o'clock before <inline font-style="italic">When Saturday Comes</inline>, is a variety of lifestyle programs. We get home renovationsâa matter of intense disinterest for me. We then get share trading. If you looked at my pecuniary register, you would realise I am not too interested in that. We get half an hour on pets. I know how to throw the moggy out at night; I do not need any further advice. We get half an hour on gardeningâanother thrilling subject. That is what we have at the momentâa whole series, 2Â½ hours, on lifestyle trivia. I put up with that; I do not mind that. What is missing on a Saturday morning is then picked up by ABC Radio on a Sunday morning. There we get news on films, restaurant reviews, the latest concerts and all the other things that we from the latte glitterati really love and lap up. So why do we want another lifestyle program on what should be a gateway to a day of sport in Melbourne? Sports <inline font-style="italic">Grandstand</inline> from 12 to six o'clock has been a massive success, and having Francis Leach's <inline font-style="italic">When Saturday Comes</inline> as a lead-in can only further enhance this. What a tragedy it will be if this gets shunted off to commercial radio a la <inline font-style="italic">The Could Have Beens</inline>. </para><para>It might be argued that the program does not rate well enoughâhardly a first for the ABC. If that is to be a criterion, we had better get the axe out right now. I made the decision to speak out in protest on this many weeks ago, but subsequent to that I noticed there was an excellent article in the <inline font-style="italic">Green Guide</inline> of the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline>. What did we learn from that? Actually, ratings are going gang busters for <inline font-style="italic">When Saturday Comes</inline>. It is actually highly competitive with any commercial competitor. We then read the views of the manager of the ABC in Melbourne. He is looking at the over-40s demographic, he tells us. That is why we are going to have lifestyle programs. Well, I am over 40 and I want my 8c a day back. At the moment, I love these lifestyle programs being on between seven and 10, because it drives me out of the house. I go off on my exercise walk. I go down to Prahran Marketâdown to Russo's the greengrocers or to Claringbold's for the fish. It gets me out and about. Then I just get home in time to turn on Francis Leach and listen to two hours of football while her indoors is giving me instructions as to what to do.</para><para>It is a tragedy that this is happening. But I tell you what has really gotten me incensed: to hear the manager quoted in the green pages saying all this decision is based on focus groups. There is nothing more worthless than focus groups. I know a lot of political apparatchiks are rapt in them, but they are greatly and grossly overrated in their effectiveness because of the internal dynamics of groups getting together. In conclusion, on behalf of my constituentsâand there are a few of them about; all party voters, I might say, as they do not vote for me individuallyâI want to make a demand that the ABC come to their senses and that they restore this program for next year and the year after. It will wear out its welcome mat sooner or later. I cannot make such a demand on the minister. It is not up to him to intervene in programming matters, but I do call on Minister Alston to come out and support me. If he does not, I hope Mrs Alston gets him working on home improvementsâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>âGardening.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>âpicking up tips from the new lifestyle program.

But I do hope he will join me in at least making representationsâwe cannot direct the ABC; we can only cajole itâfor the return of <inline font-style="italic">When Saturday Comes</inline>.

It is, as you said today, a great honour and an honour for the state that you represent. I rise tonight to represent the anger of Australia's sugar cane growers, particularly those in Queensland, who are struggling to make ends meet. They are up against corrupted world markets, a worsening drought, a low commodity price and now they are up against a federal government too cynical and a minister too incompetent to assist them.</para></talk.start><para>In stark contrast to the Howard government, federal Labor acknowledges the importance of the sugar industry to the wellbeing of Australiaânot only in terms of the healthy nature of the fundamental produce but also, and more importantly, in the contribution sugar makes to the Australian economy and particularly the economy of Queensland. Eighty-five per cent of our sugar produce is exported annually and this makes our producers amongst the most efficient in the world, unduly exposed to the vagaries and injustice of corrupted world markets. Labor recognises that there are around 6,500 individual Australian farming enterprises, mostly farming families, which depend on sugar for their income. We know that there are many more regional families who rely on sugar and its $1.3 billion income for their livelihood through secondary and related industries. We recognise the contribution that sugar has made to nation building, providing jobs for thousands of workers, many of them immigrants who have come to this country to make it what it is today. </para><para>During the winter recess I visited sugar-growing areas of Queensland. I had previously visited these regions in April to gain a first-hand view of the problems facing the industry. My return visit was to gain an on the ground reaction to the Hildebrand recommendations. It was made very clear to me during this second visit that many growers need immediate help to put food on their table. After visiting the cane growers of Queensland, I attended shadow cabinet in Darwin, where my colleagues approved the first phase of Labor's plan for the sugar industry. Labor's plan is based on a small number of central tenets. Firstly, the industry in its current form is unsustainable due to the international environment, and efficient Australian cane farmers should not be blamed for the state of their industry, a state caused by the weather, international pressures and an indifferent federal government. Secondly, cane growers, through initiatives such as the Compass program, have recognised the importance of the natural environment, particularly the Great Barrier Reef, both in terms of heritage and tourism values. Thirdly, although cane-farming families have a proud tradition of independence, after four bad years many are now at their financial wits' end and are in need of immediate financial support to run their homes and feed their families. A responsible and compassionate federal government would provide the necessary support immediately. Fourthly, a responsible federal government also has a role to play in assisting cane growers to restructure their industry for ongoing and long-term sustainability, both economically and environmentally.</para><para>That is why the package approved by Labor's shadow cabinet in Darwin called for the Howard government to immediately make funds available to provide income support to cane-farming families. Our plan also calls on the Howard government to immediately make exit packages and re-establishment grants available to those sugar-growing families who, having stuck it out as long as possible, are now eligible and ready to leave the industry. Farming businesses that are viable in the long term but cash strapped for now should be offered business support measures equivalent to those currently available under the exceptional circumstances program. Ethanol has been talked about as the potential saviour of the Australian sugar industry, and the debate continues to rage over whether this is the case. The Howard government must therefore immediately form a task force with the industry and state governments to explore the potential of ethanol as a viable, sustainable and environmentally friendly addition to the sugar industry.</para><para>Governments need to do more than just throw money at a problem in the hope that it will go away. This is particularly so with the sugar industry, which openly commits itself to further change and improvement in return for government support. It is our view that such support is an investment in the industry and the large tracts of regional Australia it supports, rather than a handout. Matching the industry's commitment to change should be a Howard government commitment to improving export market access for our sugar farmers. I again remind the government, especially in the light of Mr Downer's near destruction of the $800 million Iraqi wheat market, that the industry and Labor expect the government to do better in terms of international trade, and that we expect the Howard government to ensure that sugar has a place in any free trade agreement with the USA and in any other international or WTO negotiations.</para><para>A story in today's <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> suggests that the industry will have to wait for Mr Truss to respond to what is clearly a crisis. Mr Truss has had the Hildebrand report since June. There is now mounting evidence that Mr Truss is an ineffectual advocate for rural Australia amongst his Liberal colleagues, whether it be the Howard tories or the urban dandies of the Costello camp. This would further explain why Mr Truss is following his old pattern: blaming the fact that he has to negotiate with the Queensland government for the delays in his sugar package, as he has done in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>. Again he is blaming state governments for his inability, just as he blames them for the uncertainty farmers face over exceptional circumstances drought relief. In a statement today, Mr Truss said of the Hildebrand report that `the government is now considering its response as a matter of urgency'. </para><para>Let me assure Mr Truss that thousands of families that rely on sugar thought this was a matter of urgency way back in June when Clive Hildebrand reported to the government on time. It is inexcusable that Mr Truss dithers on this urgent matter, as he has done on so many others such as drought relief and the US beef quota. The sugar industry may not be important to the Melbourne based Liberals but it should be to a National Party MP such as Mr Truss and it certainly is to thousands of regional Australian families. Labor know how important the sugar industry is to farmers, their families and communities. That is why we developed the first phase of our plan and released it publicly in a timely fashion. That is why we will continue to develop policy for the future of a vital sugar industry. It is time the minister stood up for Australian farmers in the cabinet room. I call on Mr Truss to release his response to the Hildebrand report immediately after the next cabinet meeting.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Institute of Sport: Gungahlin Drive Extension</title><page.no>3138</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3138</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to raise a matter of great importance for both ACT residents and the Australian sporting community. The issue is the proposed Gungahlin Drive extension in the ACT. The ACT Labor government originally announced their favoured route for the Gungahlin Drive extension on 20 June this year. The road proposal is an integral part of the ACT government's overall planning vision to service the transport needs of the rapidly growing Gungahlin population. On 20 June this year the full detail of the Gungahlin Drive extension was put forward to the people of the ACT. The Gungahlin Drive extension is not a new planning issue for the ACT. In fact, it has been under consideration for a very long time. As early as 1918 Walter Burley Griffin identified the need for a transport link very similar to where the proposed road is planned to be located.</para></talk.start><para>The current plans have been on the table since the early 1960s, when town planners realised that an effective road link to Gungahlin would be required as the national capital's population expanded. A transport corridor for the Gungahlin Drive extension was originally identified before the Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport were built at the Bruce precinct. In 1991, the Joint Parliamentary Committee on the Australian Capital Territory ratified the need for this road link. In 1997, several routes were examined as part of the John Dedman Parkway preliminary assessment. Out of this process, two proposed alignments emerged as the only viable choices. The first is the so-called eastern option, which would run on the O'Connor Ridge side of the Australian Institute of Sport side of Bruce. The second proposal is the western route, which would run through a corridor on the western side of the Australian Institute of Sport.</para><para>When these two options were first mooted, a number of studies were undertaken, including engineering feasibility, environmental impacts, and noise and pollution impacts. After careful and considered investigation, the ACT Labor Party went to the ACT Legislative Assembly election last October with a clear commitment to pursue the western option and not construct a road through the O'Connor Ridge. ACT residents supported the western option and the Labor Party was subsequently elected with the biggest swing since self-government. Despite overwhelming community support, especially from the almost 100,000 people who reside in Gungahlin, the coalition government and their ACT Liberal mates appear to have decided to block this proposed development. The Australian Sports Commission is complicit in this campaign to stop the road being built. Now the minister for territories, Wilson Tuckey, has weighed into this issue. Mr Tuckey, in his typical sledgehammer style, is trying to prevent the ACT government from delivering a much needed transport link to the residents of Gungahlin. As the ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, rightly asked: who in Canberra voted for Tuckey or the NCA, the AIS or the Sports Commission? What right do these people have to determine whether Gungahlin residents get the road access to their homes that they need and deserve? Mr Tuckey is interfering in this proposed development. Like Senator Kemp, the minister for sport, he is showing nothing but contempt for the people of Canberra. </para><para>The Sports Commission has already demonstrated its intransigence and its unwillingness to negotiate with the ACT government in good faith and with an open mind. We now have the spectre of the Liberal Party, both federally and locally, trying to intimidate and politically blackmail the ACT government. Minister Kemp and his mates in the ACT assembly have claimed that the AIS will pack up and move elsewhere if the western route proceeds. This is a crude form of political blackmail, and nothing could be more ludicrous. This is about Liberal bullying, because the local Liberals were crushingly defeated at the Territory election and now they are looking for an issue with which to get some kind of traction. Now we have the Liberals saying, `If this road is built, then the future of the AIS is in doubt.' We expect this type of thuggery from Minister Tuckey, but I am deeply concerned that the Sports Commission has aligned itself with the Liberals so overtly over this issue.</para><para>In November 2001, the CEO of the Sports Commission, Mr Mark Peters, wrote to the ACT Chief Minister, Jon Stanhope, saying that he would not comment publicly on this matter, yet that is exactly what Mr Peters has gone ahead and done. Long before the proposed alignment had even been finalisedâ and, remember, that was only on 20 June this yearâthe Sports Commission was releasing documents purporting to show the impact of the road and the location of the road in relation to the AIS site. I believe that there are genuine concerns about the impact of the Gungahlin Drive extension on the AIS site in Bruce and that they should be addressed; nevertheless, it was incumbent on the Sports Commission and the AIS to raise these matters in the appropriate manner and in appropriate fora. Mr Peters chose not to contact me, nor did he express to me any concerns about the Gungahlin extension.</para><para>Mr Peters admitted at Senate estimates earlier this year that there was a period of eight months during which the Sports Commission made no formal expressions to the ACT Labor Party, the ACT Liberal Party or the Greens. Later, on 22 February, Mr Peters wrote an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> in which he asserted that the western route would come within 75 metres of the AIS. An erroneous map was provided showing the alleged route virtually bisecting the AIS, when in truth the road alignment is conceivably some 200 metres away from the AIS and, as we now know, will be sunk between five and seven metres below the surface of the ground. The Sports Commission also did not mention that an environmental impact statement had yet to be completed. As the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline> pointed out in an editorial on 21 February, the Sports Commission and the AIS indulged in hyperbole and exaggeration. `What did the AIS expect?' asked the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>. Did it seriously imagine that an ACT election could be fought, with policies positioned and cemented and commitments given, and that afterwards it could politely ask that the federal government do its bidding? The obvious conclusion is yes, that is exactly what it expected.</para><para>I recently went out to the AIS site to hear their concerns. Their concerns about the road involved potential noise and pollution, and, as I said before, those concerns need to be addressed. I believe, however, that the ACT government has seriously tried to meet all the issues raised by both the Sports Commission and the Institute of Sport. First, construction of the road will not begin until after training for the Athens Olympics is over. Second, any noise impact will be addressed through the comprehensive Unisearch noise study and the design of the road. Third, an environmental health assessment and an air quality study are currently under way to make sure this happens. Finally, the road will be constructed five to seven metres below the surface and about 200 metres away from the AIS. These measures demonstrate that the ACT government is negotiating in good faith. It also demonstrates that the AIS has the capacity and the opportunity to accept those points of compromise with the ACT government and come to an agreement so that both the AIS and the road have a mutual future. I want to take this opportunity to urge the Liberal Party and the Sports Commission to stop playing petty politics with sport and with the institute, and I urge them to work with the ACT government to build this much needed transport link. </para><para>It is not very often in this place that something like sportâwhich is something we are all involved in in some way or other, or about which at least we are passionate in our support of whatever team is a current successâcomes up. People involved in the Sports Commission in particular tend to rise above partisan politics. I was very disappointed to see the role that Mr Peters, in particular, played in relation to this issue about the Gungahlin Drive link. Clearly, there was significant contact between him and the local Liberal ACT assembly members and there was a concerted effort to get political mileage out of this issue. I believe that sport, and the Australian Institute of Sport in particular, should be above politics. This particular incident will hopefully go down in history as something that they regret. Hopefully, we will see the new road, the western route, builtâand at the same time see the continuing fantastic success of the Australian Institute of Sport here in Canberra.</para><para><inline

Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>Past practice in answering questions of this nature has been for Defence to provide the daily, or hourly, full-cost recovery rate for ADF assets. </para><para>The full-cost recovery rate methodology is used to calculate the recovery or waiver costs of using a particular asset, usually when Defence is asked to perform a non-Defence activity. A comprehensive set of cost factors, including management overheads, capital costs and depreciation, salaries and accrued superannuation, is used to calculate the recovery rate. In other words, the rate includes all the embedded costs that Defence would be paying whether or not the assets had been deployed on operations.</para><para>The underlying assumption in recent questions and debate, that the full cost recovery rate can be extrapolated to estimate the costs of operations is, quite simply, misleading.</para><para>The true cost to the taxpayer of undertaking additional operations is the net additional cost. The net additional cost of a particular asset in an operation, in terms of extra fuel, rations and allowances, would depend on the particular operation. It also would take account of the offsets within its overall budget Defence would make in absorbing some of that cost; for example, cancelling or postponing exercises or seeking additional efficiencies to help offset the additional costs. </para><para>The net additional cost approach outlined above is consistent with the approach taken by successive Governments in providing supplementation to the Defence budget for operations - for example, the Gulf War and peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Rwanda. It is the method that this Government intends to continue to use for its own costings and to employ when answering questions about the costs of operations for purposes of more accurate debate.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Aviation: Sports Aviation</title><page.no>3144</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 28)</subtitle><id.no>28</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3144</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	(a) When did the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) enter into a formal agreement with the sports aviation sector in relation to the administration of sports aviation and; (b) when did that agreement come into effect. </para><para>(2)	Can a copy of that agreement be provided. </para><para>(3)	Did that agreement impose conditions on the sports aviation sector in relation to the maintenance of ultralight aircraft; if so: (a) what were those conditions; and (b) were they provided in a technical manual that required the approval of the CAA; if so (i) when was the manual approved, and (ii) can a copy be provided. </para><para>(4)	(a) When did the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) enter into an agreement with the Australian Ultralight Federation in relation to the administration of sports aviation; and (b) when did that agreement come into effect. </para><para>(5)	Can a copy of that agreement be provided. </para><para>(6)	Did that agreement impose conditions on the sports aviation sector in relation to the maintenance of ultralight aircraft; if so (a) what were those conditions; and (b) were they provided in a technical manual that required the approval of CASA; if so, (i) when was the manual approved, and (ii) can a copy be provided.  </para><para>(7)	 Since the first sports aviation technical manual was approved: (a) on how many occasions has the manual been amended; (b) when was each amendment made; (c) on each occasion who initiated the amendment; and (d) what was the nature of each amendment. </para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3145</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	(2) and (3) The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) did not enter into a formal agreement with the sports aviation sector in relation to the administration of sports aviation.  </para><para>The arrangements whereby sports aviation bodies are administered were put in place before the CAA was established.  </para><para>In August 1983 the Government decided that aviation organisations, which undertook administrative functions on behalf of the Department of Aviation, should be directly funded from Department of Aviation appropriations. </para><para>Prior to this decision, the Gliding Federation of Australia and the Royal Federation of Aero Clubs of Australia (amongst others) received a `Grant-in-Aid' from the Government, administered by the Office of the Special Minister of State within the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet. </para><para>At various times since 1984, this funding has been reviewed, most notably in 1992 when it was proposed that the payments would be phased out over three years. In 1994, it was agreed that the CAA would continue to contract certain administrative functions to sports administrating bodies. </para><para>In 1999, the Board of the Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA) agreed that funding would continue to be allocated to sports administering bodies, and reaffirmed its policy of contracting these functions to responsible administering organisations. </para><para>The mechanism used to achieve this is an annual contract, whereby each organisation agrees to undertake certain administrative functions on behalf of CASA for which it receives a partial payment of costs incurred, and certain services for which it receives no financial support. </para><para>Each funded organisation receives an offer letter with the contract, and is required to account for the previous year's activity. </para><para>(4)	The Department of Aviation entered into an agreement with the Australian Ultralight Federation (AUF) in relation to the administration of ultralight aircraft in 1984.

A suitable method of plant establishment in the trash remains an important gap of high priority for soil conservation in the whole sugarcane crop cycle. In ratoon crops, a trash blanket effectively protects the soil surface. This project aims to use trash in a minimum tillage planting technique to reduce soil erosion in the plant crop. Three innovative implements will be trialed by an existing Action Learning Group of dedicated growers. The expected outcome of reduced soil erosion will have enormous rural and urban public benefits by contributing to sustainable land-use, river quality, Great Barrier Reef habitat and a healthier environment. With little modification the method should be applicable to sugarcane throughout Australia.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>South Johnstone</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>9,800</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Revegetation of Farm Drains for Sediment Control in the Lower Herbert</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>The planting of a range of native grasses, shrubs and trees at strategic locations along drains in order to control the movement of sediments, reduce downstream impacts and overcome landholder concerns about vegetation management in drains.</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Ingham</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>28,900</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Lagoon Creek Catchment Rehabilitation and Best Management Practices</para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>This project will entail a creek rehabilitation project combined with the adoption of best management practices for surrounding land uses in order to improve water quality, fish habitat and riverine condition in the Lagoon Creek Catchment.

These schedule delay figures do not include the contractual 8 month schedule contingency, negotiated under the original contract, to facilitate operational flexibility and allows for delivery of the ships from the production phase before liquidated damages can be invoked. ADI is confident it can effectively replan its schedule to contain the schedule slippage to the 18 month window.</para><para>(2)	On the basis of current arrangements:</para><para>(a)	The first ship, HMAS Sydney (FFG03), will commence its upgrade in the last quarter of 2003.</para><para>(b)	The last ship, HMAS Newcastle (FFG06), will complete in the first half of 2008.</para><para>(3)	The latest estimate of the costs associated with the delays is $55.14M(AUS) at base date figures. To minimise and contain these costs ADI has re-organised its subcontract arrangements and is taking greater responsibility for Combat System design and integration. </para><para>(4)	Questions of liability are yet to be resolved.</para><para>(5)	(a)	The current schedule slippage delays capability and maintainability improvement by the period of the delay. </para><para>(b)	FFG is currently capable anti-air and Anti-ship missile systems, a 76mm gun, and torpedo tubes and is further enhanced through addition of Seahawk helicopters and Nulka anti-missile decoy. FFG's capability to counter a range of anti-ship air defence threats and emerging submarine threats is limited, however, this is why Defence proceeded with the upgrade program.</para><para>(c)	The current FFG is sufficiently capable to deal with the likely threat environment in the Persian Gulf. Should this environment change, this would be reviewed in the ordinary course.</para><para>(7)	(a)	The additional cost of the continued maintenance of the existing combat system will be the normal operating cost of keeping the system operational for the period of the delay.</para><para>(b)	As these costs are normal maintenance costs the Government will be responsible for them. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Capital Works Projects</title><page.no>3192</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 328)</subtitle><id.no>328</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3192</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 16 May 2002:</para></talk.start><para>With reference to the Defence Annual Report which notes that in the 2000-01 financial year, the Government made a decision to accelerate $190 million of capital works projects:</para><para>(1)	What projects were funded as a result of this decision; (b) what funding was allocated to each project; and (c) where the project involved a base facility, what was the name of the facility.</para><para>(2)	When was the decision to accelerate this funding made.</para><para>(3)	Why was this funding accelerated.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3192</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Expenditure increases in 2000-01 were related to requirements across the entire Capital Budget as opposed to any individual project or activities. </para><para>(2)	The decisions were taken in the context of the close of the 2000-01 financial year.</para><para>(3)	The decision to accelerate funding was largely driven by cost pressures associated with the depreciation of the Australian Dollar.

(b) what are the legislative changes that have been made which enable deductibility to be a discretionary allowance; and (c) as the usual settlement process is that the Commissioner may concede items as deductible where there is doubt or ambiguity, what are the provisions in legislation which enable the Commissioner to allow deductions for amounts that are not deductible where (as in the Budplan case) that doubt and ambiguity was removed both by the Federal Court ruling and the plaintiffs' failure to appeal.</para><para>(12)	As a consequence of the Commissioner's decision to tie the settlement offer to cash contributions made rather than a fixed percentage of either the original deduction claimed or the resulting amended assessment: is it the case that several thousand investors in film projects are returned to virtually the same financial position (some are given a further deferral) they held when they commenced the alleged tax mischief; if so, why has the Commissioner decided to disadvantage a large group of taxpayers in such a way whilst advantaging the remainder to a significant extent.</para><para>(13)	Given that the first report of the Economics References Committee inquiry into mass-marketed tax effective investments documented serious failings in the ATO management of the legislation affecting these projects and the way the ATO went about auditing promoters, drawing conclusions, advising taxpayers, amending their assessments and attempting to collect disputed tax: (a) will the ATO take account of its mishandling (at whatever stage of the process) and offer further settlement allowances to bring the matter to a close in a fairer and more equitable manner;

and (b) why does the current level of settlement offered not include any allowance for ATO mishandling.</para><para>(15)	(a) Is it the case that in September-October 2001 Deputy Commissioner Peter Smith received legal advice from the Australian Government Solicitor that the Commissioner could not exclude one or more taxpayers (the Budplan plaintiffs) from a global settlement offer;

(b) is he prepared to compensate them for this breach; and (c) if this has been considered, what is the estimated cost of such a remedy.</para><para>(22)	Is the Commissioner prepared to accept a responsibility for this breach by reducing the amount of the settlement offer.</para><para>(23)	Given the serious nature of these outstanding issues, as well as pending court decisions and cases already listed for hearing in June 2002, will the Commissioner immediately suspend the deadline for acceptance of the settlement offer until these matters are resolved.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3200</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) to (4)  The Commissioner of Taxation advises me that he expects a large number of investors to take up the settlement offer. At close of business on 5 June 2002, 31 670 signed settlement deeds had been received in the Tax Office, representing approximately 56% of the number of deeds issued. The Commissioner expects many more investors to settle by the deadline of 21 June 2002.</para><para>Breakdowns of figures into levels of settlement (sic) or film and other schemes are not available.</para><para>(5)	The Commissioner is unable to estimate the cost associated with processing each individual deed.</para><para>(6)	Investors are already receiving amended assessments reflecting settlement agreements. How long it will take to process all settlement deeds depends on the numbers received; however the Tax Office aims to have the majority of amended assessments issued by the end of October.</para><para>(7)	102 ATO staff are, or will be, involved in the settlement process, with actual numbers at any one time depending on demand. The work includes staffing the Helpline, checking and processing deeds and issuing assessments. Some of these staff are also working on other tasks.</para><para>(8)	No. The Commissioner believes that the present offer is fair and reasonable. </para><para>(9)	No such estimates have been made.  </para><para>(10)	The Commissioner advises that, as far as is possible, he will assist an investor who defaults to continue a payment arrangement. Depending on the investor's individual circumstances, the Commissioner may consider more affordable re-payments, or allowing a variation to take cash flow difficulties into account.</para><para>(11)	The Commissioner has wide powers which enable him to settle taxation disputes, and advice was received from senior counsel confirming that it is open to the Commissioner to settle on these terms. It is noted that the settlement terms were announced before the Budplan decision was handed down.</para><para>(12)	The Commissioner does not accept the proposition that investors in film schemes will be returned to virtually the same financial position as they were before they entered into the scheme. Under the settlement, investors are only entitled to a deduction for interest actually paid on funds borrowed to invest in the scheme. It follows that investors will be financially worse off than if they had not entered into the scheme. </para><para>(13)	The terms of the settlement offer were determined by the ATO after taking into account all the relevant circumstances, including those referred to in reports of the Senate Economics References Committee. No estimates of liability to pay compensation have been deemed to be necessary.</para><para>(14)	See above. Note also that the administration of the tax law is a matter for the Commissioner and the Minister does not have the capacity to instruct or direct the ATO.</para><para>(15)	The Commissioner received advice that the settlement offer could not discriminate between taxpayers with regard to primary tax. In fact, all eligible investors are offered a deduction for the actual cash outlaid.</para><para>(16)	Not applicable.</para><para>(17)	Tax agents, advisers, and financial planners can apply to have their eligibility for remission of penalties and interest considered on a case by case basis. Section 16 of the Income Tax Assessment Act 1936 precludes the ATO from giving this sort of information to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission. </para><para>(18) and (19)  The settlement offer is directed at investors who lacked full knowledge of the tax system and the arrangements they were entering into; were subject to aggressive and sophisticated marketing techniques; had a generally good tax record and typically took advice from people who could have been expected to foresee the tax risks. Tax agents, advisers and planners do not always meet these criteria.</para><para>(20)	The Government is in the process of developing a proposal to enhance the type and range of sanctions needed to tackle promoters of tax avoidance schemes.</para><para>(21) and (22)  The Ombudsman found a breach of the Taxpayers' Charter in relation to the Main Camp case, where the ATO failed to fully explain its decision to investors. Acting on the Ombudsman's finding, since November 2000 the ATO has provided investors with more information about the reasons for decisions, particularly in relation to the application of Part IVA. Further remedial action is not considered to be warranted. </para><para>(23)	The Commissioner announced on 27 May 2002 that he would extend the period available for making a settlement offer until 21 June 2002. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Capital Projects</title><page.no>3201</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 334)</subtitle><id.no>334</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3201</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 20 May 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Can the Minister confirm that in the 2002-03 Defence Budget $150 million of capital projects were deferred into the 2003-04 financial year.</para><para>(2)	Can a list be provided of the capital projects affected by this decision.</para><para>(3)	For each project, can the following information be provided: (a) the name of the project; (b) a brief description of the project; (c) the savings gained by the delay; (d) the extent of the delay, for example 12 months; (e) whether a contract had been signed with a contractor for this project; (f) if a contract has been signed, the name of the organisation that has been contracted; and (g) if a contract has not been signed, the stage the project has reached (for example, tender released, tender chosen).</para><para>(4)	If there are projects where a contract has been signed, can the Minister indicate how the delay will be allowed under the contract and whether there is any cost arising to the Commonwealth as a result of the delay. </para><para>(5)	If there are projects where a successful bidder has been chosen, can the Minister indicate whether the Commonwealth will be liable, given the expectations of the bidder, for any damages because of the delay. </para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3202</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Yes.</para><para>(2)	and (3) Defence has undertaken an initial assessment of the indicative measures that would be required to accommodate this re-scheduling of expenditure.

A comprehensive set of cost factors, including management overheads, capital costs and depreciation, salaries and accrued superannuation, is used to calculate the recovery rate. In other words, the rate includes all the embedded costs that Defence would be paying whether or not the assets had been deployed on operations.</para><para>The underlying assumption in recent questions and debate, that the full cost recovery rate can be extrapolated to estimate the costs of operations is, quite simply, misleading.</para><para>The true cost to the taxpayer of undertaking additional operations is the net additional cost. The net additional cost of a particular asset in an operation, in terms of extra fuel, rations and allowances, would depend on the particular operation. It also would take account of the offsets within its overall budget Defence would make in absorbing some of that cost; for example, cancelling or postponing exercises or seeking additional efficiencies to help offset the additional costs.</para><para>The net additional cost approach outlined above is consistent with the approach taken by successive Governments in providing supplementation to the Defence budget for operations - for example, the Gulf War and peacekeeping operations in Somalia and Rwanda. It is the method that this Government intends to continue to use for its own costings and to employ when answering questions about the costs of operations for purposes of more accurate debate.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Salt Ash Weapons Range</title><page.no>3207</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 345)</subtitle><id.no>345</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3207</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 23 May 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Have any Hawk lead-in fighters commenced training operations at RAAF Williamtown or the Salt Ash Weapons Range (SAWR) yet;

Environment Australia and Parks Australia North in the Northern Territory publicise visa requirements on their web-site and in the written guidelines that accompany permits to film in the parks. Park staff have been provided with details of visa requirements, training in how to check visas and asked to contact nominated DIMIA staff if they have doubts about the appropriateness of a visa. </para><para>(b) No directions have been given as all enforcement of visa requirements is undertaken by DIMIA staff. </para><para>(c) and (d) Statistical information of this type is not available although DIMIA staff in the Northern Territory report that the incidence of abuse in this area is low.

The key factors negotiated in any co-production include: </para><para>(9)	Creative ownership of the project, such as who developed the idea and who will be creatively responsible for the production;</para><para>(10)	Creative approval rights;</para><para>(11)	Financial contribution of each party;</para><para>(12)	Value of rights granted to each party;</para><para>(13)	Equity shares;</para><para>(14)	Recoupment of investment/s or equity; and</para><para>(15)	Share of net profit.</para><para>Overseas broadcasters entering into a co-production agreement with the ABC will not, in the majority of cases, put together their own team of production personnel to travel to Australia. Generally, the ABC as the domestic broadcaster will supply the production team and produce the program on behalf of the co-production partners. This is the most economic and practical approach for all parties and the rationale for the parties to enter into a co-production agreement.</para><para>There are exceptional cases where the ABC does not have creative ownership of a project being filmed in Australia and is a minority financial partner. In these circumstances, the ABC will contribute some production personnel. In addition, all film and tape stock is purchased in Australia and film processing and transferring takes place locally.</para><para>In relation to part (a), as stated above, the ABC will provide the production personnel for the majority of documentary co-productions produced in Australia. </para><para>In relation to part (b), net profits (`export earnings') are generally shared between the co-production parties in proportion to their respective financial contributions to the production budget of the co-production. </para><para>In relation to part (c), copyright ownership is generally shared in the same proportion as each party's financial contribution to the production budget of the co-production.</para><para>(2)	No. The ABC has a long history of providing opportunities for Australian productions. The ABC provides the most comprehensive Australian documentary output of any Australian broadcaster, commissioning approximately sixty hours of documentary programs annually, including natural history, arts and social documentaries. The ABC regularly enters into co-production agreements with Australian producers.

These conditions are leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) and primary polycythaemia rubra vera if their clinical onset is within 25 years of first visiting the sites. </para><para>Following the release of the initial NRPB Report in 1988, multiple myeloma was included as a condition which could be accepted as a matter of course on the basis of presence at nuclear test detonations.

Any exploration in close proximity to the Park is extremely unlikely and would only be allowed, if at all, under strict environmental control.â Mr Griffiths' Press Release then stated that exploration was warranted in a number of sedimentary basins outside the Park boundaries. He also stated that detailed consideration would be given to the conditions under which permits in these basins would be granted, in consultation with the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Authority. Prime Minister Bob Hawke reiterated the Government's views in an address to the National Press Club on 19 July 1990.

The 1999 Franklin Survey obtained 1700 line-km of seismic data, and took seabed gravity cores and dredge samples as well as seabed photographs. This was published by the Australian Geological Survey Organisation in Aus.Geo News, 1999, 53: 5, 8.</para><para>(4)	Yes. It is a key safety provision under Ocean Drilling Program guidelines that drilling sites must not be located on any structure with the potential to contain oil or gas reservoirs as these would be a hazard to drilling. These guidelines are contained in the JOIDES Journal Volume 18, Special Issue No. 7, October 1992 - Ocean Drilling Program Guidelines for Pollution Prevention and Safety.</para><para>(5)	Yes. But in reality, the quality, spacing, and depth penetration of the seismic data obtained, whilst sufficient to site the shallow ODP wells, was not of a standard that would be of interest to petroleum explorers. The seabed cores and dredge samples obtained by the site survey would be all but useless as indicators of petroleum prospectivity.</para><para>(6)	The Australian Geological Survey Organisation committed to the Franklin Survey in its 1998/99 Work Program, which was finalised in June 1998.</para><para>(7)	The Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) satellite data purchased by Geoscience Australia offshore Queensland are currently being interpreted by a contractor, and no results are yet available to answer this question.
