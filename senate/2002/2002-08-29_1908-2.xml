follows</inline>—</para><para>This report considers four individual pieces of legislation originally proposed in 2000—three Private Senators' Bills, two introduced by Senator Andrew Murray and one by Senator the Hon John Faulkner, and the provisions of a Private Member's Bill introduced by the Hon Mr Kim Beazley MP. The bills cluster around the core themes of probity in public affairs and public confidence in the institutions of government. They relate, in particular, to the standards expected of parliamentarians, ministers and, in some instances, their staff, in exercising their official duties, to the accessing of parliamentary benefits and to the conduct of advertising campaigns. </para><para>The broad object of the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 [2002] is that the Commonwealth Parliament should take responsibility for establishing its own standards of conduct and adopt an ethics regime for members and ministers that would have as its cornerstone a workable and enforceable code of conduct. </para><para>The Committee supports this object and the proposed establishment of a joint parliamentary committee to develop a code of conduct and establish mechanisms to set and monitor standards of behaviour. It does not believe, however, that legislation is required at the outset. Instead, it considers that a more logical and workable approach would be to develop an ethics regime incorporating separate codes of conduct for parliamentarians and ministers and then to consider the need for legislation to ensure their enforcement. </para><para>The Committee considers that commitment from members of parliament to a code of conduct and a willingness to see it succeed are essential precursors to this process. It is only with the commitment of the Prime Minister of the day in conjunction with the Leader of the Opposition that the effective development, implementation and enforcement of a code of conduct could work. The Committee supports establishment of a joint committee to facilitate dialogue and as an appropriate body to draft a code of conduct. </para><para>It also supports, in principle, the appointment of a Commissioner for Ministerial and Parliamentary Ethics to develop and implement an education program for members of parliament about ethics in public life and to advise them on the proposed code of conduct. </para><para>While supporting the proposed advisory role, the Committee has difficulties with the investigative role that is also proposed for the Commissioner. It is concerned about:</para><para>·	whether it is appropriate for an independent Commissioner to adjudicate on the conduct of members of parliament; </para><para>·	the potential conflict of interest for the Commissioner in advising on, and investigating breaches of, the code of conduct; </para><para>·	the absence of review or appeal provisions for decisions by the Commissioner; and</para><para>·	the need for adequate recognition of the unique positions of ministers and the Prime Minister in Australia's system of government. </para><para>The Committee recommends that Parliament establish a joint parliamentary committee to inquire into and develop a code of conduct for members of parliament for adoption by both Houses of Parliament. It further recommends that the Committee draft a separate code of conduct for ministers. This should include a code of practice for the making of government appointments by ministers, and should take account of the position held by the executive in the Commonwealth parliamentary system of government.</para><para>The Committee fully supports the intention of the Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements Bill 2000 [No. 2] to put in place measures that would promote transparency and accountability in the use of parliamentary entitlements and allowances through adequate monitoring and scrutiny. It is not convinced, however, that an independent Auditor of Parliamentary Allowances and Entitlements should be established in the first instance, and recommends that the Bill not proceed in its current form.  </para><para>The Committee considers that there are opportunities within the current framework to improve accountability in the use of parliamentary entitlements. These would not only assist members of parliament to observe the rules governing the use of their benefits, but also provide the public with information on the nature of the entitlements, on how they are used and for what purposes. </para><para>The Committee considers that the Auditor-General could be given a more active role in auditing the use of parliamentary entitlements. In addition, the Committee considers that the Government could take steps to: </para><para>·	improve and simplify guidelines on entitlements and their use;</para><para>·	clarify and improve information available to members of parliament to enable them to better account for expenditure;</para><para>·	improve levels of disclosure by publicly reporting more comprehensive statistics on the costs and patterns of expenditure on parliamentary entitlements; </para><para>·	undertake regular internal audit and review of the system administering parliamentary entitlements; and</para><para>·	report back to Parliament on progress made in implementing measures identified in ANAO reports on parliamentary entitlements. </para><para>The Electoral Amendment (Political Honesty) Bill 2000 [2002] proposes amending the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 to prohibit the printing, publication or distribution of misleading electoral advertising. The Committee considers it irrefutable that statements made to voters should, as far as possible, be accurate and not misleading, in order that voters can make informed decisions when casting their votes. Whether and how this should be subject to formal regulation rather than relying on the political process is, however, more controversial. </para><para>The Committee's main concerns centre on the practical implications of the Bill. It concluded that further consideration of several issues was needed before the Bill proceeds or is reintroduced in an amended form. These include:</para><para>·	the proposal to regulate political advertising in an election period but not other strategies by which political parties seek to persuade voters to support them; </para><para>·	the need to ensure a prompt response to complaints; </para><para>·	the need to prevent misuse of the legislation for the purposes of achieving political advantage; </para><para>·	the proposal for criminal rather than civil remedies for breaches of the Act; and </para><para>·	the extent to which it is appropriate to seek to regulate political discussion. </para><para>The Committee considers that the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters could take a more active role in scrutinising political advertising during election campaigns. While no penalty would result from this process, the resultant public exposure of impropriety in a JSCEM report could have the effect of changing undesirable practices. </para><para>The Committee's chief concern with Part 2 of the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 [2002] is the role and function of the proposed Government Publicity Committee. Among the problems with this proposed model is the potential for the offices of the Auditor-General and the Ombudsman, as members of the committee, to become embroiled in political controversy. Such an outcome would be counter productive, particularly if it were to undermine the confidence of both the public and the Parliament in the impartiality and independence of both offices.</para><para>Other difficulties with the proposed Government Publicity Committee include: </para><para>·	the mechanism for appointing the third member of the Committee;</para><para>·	the Ombudsman's uncertain jurisdiction in relation to Commonwealth contractors;</para><para>·	the unlimited power of delegation proposed for the Ombudsman and Auditor-General;</para><para>·	the lack of a review mechanism for committee decisions; and</para><para>·	constitutional issues regarding the proper role of the courts in relation to the proposed committee's decisions.</para><para>The Committee therefore does not support the introduction of Part 2 of the Charter of Political Honesty Bill 2000 [2002]. </para><para>The Committee heard more serious concerns regarding the Government Advertising (Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill 2000. These referred, in particular, to the proposed creation of a serious criminal offence defined by reference to vague and uncertain guidelines, and the appropriateness of the courts traversing matters which are essentially political in nature. For these reasons, the Committee also opposes the introduction of the Government Advertising (Objectivity, Fairness and Accountability) Bill 2000. </para><para>The Committee considers, however, that regulation of the political content of government advertising must be improved, in the face of public criticism. It found that the present guidelines on government advertising offer no guidance to departments or ministers on the avoidance of political content in government advertising campaigns. </para><para>Under the present system, the ministry itself (through the Ministerial Committee on Government Communications) determines what constitutes responsible use of the ministerial office in relation to government advertising, and decisions about content and presentation style rest with the Executive. </para><para>As a minimum the Committee considers that the Guidelines for Australian Government Information Activities: Principles and Procedures should include a clear statement of the fundamental principle that government information programs should not be, or be liable to misrepresentation as being, party political. </para><para>Further, the Committee is not persuaded that amending guidelines for government agencies alone will provide sufficient safeguards against the expenditure of public funds on advertising that promotes party political interests. It accepts that these are essentially political matters and that, consequently, it is for Parliament as a whole to examine, decide and issue detailed guidelines on what is appropriate. </para><para>Therefore, while not supporting the two bills on government advertising, the Committee considers it would be appropriate for this matter to be referred to the proposed Parliamentary Joint Standing Committee on a Code of Conduct for Ministers and Other Members of Parliament, for further consideration and development of appropriate guidelines. The guidelines proposed by the Auditor-General and the JCPAA, in combination with evidence received during this inquiry, should be used as a basis for developing a detailed set of standards. </para><para>I should like to thank my fellow committee members who have worked on these bills for their constructive approach to issues that are complex but central to the democratic system which we serve and strive to promote. I should also like to thank the legion of Senate committee staff who, during the 39th Parliament and this Parliament, have assisted the committee's deliberations on these bills and preparation of its report. </para><para>I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>RESEARCH AGENCIES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3951</page.no><id.no>R1529</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee</title><page.no>3951</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>3951</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Chair of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee, Senator Tierney, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the Research Agencies Legislation Amendment Bill 2002 and submissions received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>3951</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>3951</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator HILL (South Australia—Leader of the Government in the Senate) (9.37 a.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That intervening business be postponed until after consideration of government business order of the day No. 2 (Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002 and a related bill).</para></motion><para>Question agreed to. </para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION FUNDING AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3951</page.no><id.no>R1568</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>HIGHER EDUCATION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1448</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3951</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 28 August, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Troeth</inline>:</para><motion><para>That these bills be now read a second time.</para></motion><para><inline font-style="italic">(Quorum formed)</inline></para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>3951</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1568">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1448">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002</inline>. This government's record in relation to higher education has been abysmal in ensuring that the higher education area has received enough funding. They have not been able to ensure that the rate and type of funding for higher education has been maintained. When we look at the debacle in funding for government schools and non-government schools we find that the government are unable to ensure that education is well supported in this country and that they have not been able to turn their minds at all well to progressing the matter.  </para></talk.start><para>The government have dealt with higher education poorly. Let us look at what they should be doing. They need to consider, as Senator Carr has indicated a number of times in this chamber, both the current funding and the recurrent funding for higher education in the short to medium term to ensure that there are places for our students in universities and that there are places for all of the faculties— for law and the higher sciences, including research and development. However, they need to ensure not only that those at the higher end of the market of the educational institutions are looked after but also that funding is dispersed across all of the education institutions so that Australia can enjoy diversity of educational outcomes and that there are sufficient places not only in law, medicine and the higher sciences but also in the social sciences. It is imperative that these matters are progressed and dealt with. </para><para>This government has not been able to deal with these matters in an effective and logical manner. We should be able to look at the government's record and say, `Has it been able to distribute the funds well?' Clearly, the answer is no. The government has not been able to deal with this higher education area in the required manner. On the other hand, the Liberal Party comes up with a think tank on a whole range of areas, but it does not look at the real needs of universities, the needs of the students, the needs of professors and the teachers within the universities to ensure that we rank higher in terms of our university status across the country. Australia is not maintaining its position as it should; it is slipping globally. Australian universities, as I understand, have slipped in the ranking of national and international prestige, and it is not good enough. This government should take heed and ensure that the ranking of Australian universities does not slip, that it is not put in jeopardy by this government and that the education institutions have standing both nationally and internationally to ensure that the educational outcomes are effective and meaningful and also relevant to business needs, relevant to research and development needs and relevant to a raft of social and economic imperatives. Instead, we find that this government is really failing students, teachers and professors in the higher education area.</para><para>The higher education bill is, as I have said, a funding amendment bill. That gives us the opportunity to talk about this issue and at least to encourage this government to deal with higher education in a more meaningful and exact way. What we find, however, is that they are not doing that. It is extremely disappointing to me as a Queenslander to find that the international standing of the Queensland University of Technology— which is based in Brisbane and is an excellent university; I studied both a Bachelor of Business in part and a Bachelor of Laws at that university—may slip. If this government's funding is not continued and not supported, and if these matters are not addressed in a proper and appropriate way, then institutions such as that, which have world and critical acclaim, may slip. That would not be good enough. The University of Queensland is also an excellent place for higher learning, research and development. This government has to understand and accept that this issue does need to be addressed in a meaningful and appropriate way to ensure that that university maintains its world-leading status in the higher learning area.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>3952</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the legislation before the Senate, the <inline ref="R1448">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002</inline> and the <inline ref="R1568">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. In doing so, I recognise that there are many members of this parliament, and indeed many members of this Senate, who have been the beneficiaries of the great higher education system that has existed in this country, particularly since the Whitlam era of the 1970s. If one cares to look at the <inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Handbook</inline> and look at the tertiary qualifications of many members of parliament, one will find that many of them obtained their tertiary qualifications following the great changes made to our tertiary education system by Gough Whitlam's government.  </para></talk.start><para>It is an interesting fact that if you go through the list of the Howard government ministry, dominated as we know by lawyers—around 70 per cent or more of the frontbench are lawyers; I stand to be corrected as to the actual figure but it certainly is of that magnitude—many of those ministers obtained their tertiary qualifications under the free university education system introduced by Gough Whitlam. It is ironic that those persons, who obtained their qualifications as a result of the great system of free tertiary education introduced by Gough Whitlam, are now part of a government that has consistently, since 1996, sought to undermine those great social changes in tertiary education brought about by a previous Labor government. I will come back to what this government has done to tertiary education in the six-odd years that it has been in government. </para><para>I acknowledge that I was a beneficiary of the tertiary education system and the changes brought about by the Whitlam government when I was fortunate enough to study at university in the 1970s and, again, in the 1980s. That was a time when Gough Whitlam, under his magnificent government, ensured that access to tertiary education would be based upon equity—not on privilege, not on how much money your family had, but on equity. It recognised that talented young people in this country, no matter what socioeconomic background they came from, should be able to leave school and go on to obtain the necessary tertiary qualifications. As I said, if you go through the list of ministers of this government you will find many of them were direct beneficiaries of those great education reforms. </para><para>But what do we see today? We see a higher education system that is almost in crisis, because what has this government done since it came to office? One of the first things it did when it came to office in 1996, with its slash and burn fetish that it had for the government's budget, was to cut over $3 billion from universities. We can all remember Senator Vanstone, who was then the minister for education and at that time in the cabinet, adopting an approach to finding cuts in education which was like that of Tom Collins in the novel <inline font-style="italic">Such is Life</inline>—`Pick a number, any number; 10 per cent sounds okay. We will cut education funding by 10 per cent.' `Such is life,' as Tom Collins said. Unfortunately, for the lives of many students since then it has got tougher and tougher. Indeed it has become impossible for many young people to access higher education in this country today.</para><para>Funding in the amount of $3 billion has been cut from universities. TAFE funding has been cut by $240 million. The amount of HECS repayments collected has increased. Funding in the amount of $170 million has been slashed from rural and regional universities, at a time when rural and regional Australia has been under increasing pressure because of the decline in the agricultural export base of this country. There have also been other pressures on rural and regional areas.</para><para>One of the great things that rural and regional Australia had going for it was the regional universities that were established and supported by the previous Labor governments under Bob Hawke and Paul Keating. We put regional universities on the map. We raised their status and ensured that new facilities were built. One of the great pleasures I had when we were in government was attending the opening of the Southern Cross University campus at Coffs Harbour. What did this government do to rural and regional Australia? It took $170 million from those universities. You have to wonder where the National Party was when those decisions were being made. </para><para>There have been huge cuts and neglect in the area of research investment. Indeed, the Chief Scientist on one occasion condemned this government's approach, because we were the only advanced Western nation in which investment in R&amp;D was going backwards. </para><para>That is the situation that has occurred in higher education under this government over the last six years. It is a disgrace that ministers of this government who were the beneficiaries of the great Labor education reforms, as I said, who were able to obtain their university degrees largely at no cost to themselves, are now putting an ever increasing cost burden on students and the families of children who wish to attend university. </para><para>Recently, it has emerged that people in Australia pay amongst the highest study costs in the world. An international comparison of tuition fees and living expenses conducted by the International Comparative Higher Education Finance and Accessibility Project has found that Australian students and their families pay more to attend public university than students in Britain, the United States, Europe, New Zealand and Japan. Indeed, as the Deputy Leader of the Opposition and shadow minister for education, Jenny Macklin, has pointed out, since 1996 the contribution that Australian students make to the cost of their education has risen by 85 per cent. I repeat: there has been an 85 per cent increase in the costs that Australian students and their families have to bear in order to obtain an education.</para><para>One has to ask the question: what is it that motivates a government in this day and age, when education is increasingly important not just to students seeking to obtain qualifications and subsequent employment but to the very future of our nation, to attack the higher education system? Frankly, I have never been able to fathom it, other than to believe that this government, in its slashing and burning of government programs and, wherever possible, shifting the focus to user pays and the private sector, does not see any distinction between education policy and any other area of public policy. We see it in health, where it promotes the private sector and cuts funding to public hospitals. It props up private health insurance funds to the tune of billions of dollars while doing nothing about the decrease in bulk-billing. Equally, we are seeing this policy in the area of public education and tertiary education.</para><para>That brings me to this specific legislation. Whilst a number of the matters contained in these bills are not necessarily controversial, there is one proposal in particular about which the opposition is greatly concerned— that is, the proposal contained in the <inline ref="R1568">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> to extend the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, PELS, to four additional higher education providers. This is a controversial move because at this time the government is in the midst of a wide ranging inquiry into the provision of higher education in this country. What is of great concern is that the measure contained in this bill which extends that scheme to four additional education providers that do not currently come within the ambit of the scheme could potentially pre-empt the outcome of the inquiry. The government has failed to provide adequate reasons for its decision. I want to quote from the minority report of the Labor senators on the inquiry into this bill conducted by the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee. The minority report states:</para><quote><para>One measure, however, has potentially profound implications for the future of higher education financing policy in Australia: the proposal to extend access to the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme (PELS) to four additional higher education providers that are not currently listed on Table A or Table B of <inline font-style="italic">HEFA</inline>'s Section Four.</para><para>The threshold issue here is the Government's declared rationale in singling out these four institutions for favoured treatment in access to PELS, especially in the light of the current inquiry underway in higher education. This wide-ranging Commonwealth Government inquiry is considering, among other matters, the desirability of, and possible mechanisms for providing public subsidies to the 80 or 90 private providers of higher education in Australia. In this context, it is argued by Labor senators that a decision to extend access to the public subsidy inherent in PELS to a select group of private providers should be carefully considered: many stakeholder groups in the higher education sector have argued that such a move would pre-empt the outcome of the current review and, notwithstanding contrary possible outcomes to that process, would pave the way for future extension of Commonwealth subsidies to private higher education institutions.</para></quote><para>I will interpose there. Our concern here is that, in the midst of its overall and wide ranging inquiry, this government is pre-empting the outcome of that inquiry by taking a decision through the bill to specifically provide access to the public subsidy that is contained within the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to a limited number—four— of private higher education providers. Further, this excellent minority report of the Labor senators states: </para><quote><para>The Government in its report identifies a number of issues that have arisen in the context of the current Inquiry. The first is the question of whether or not public subsidies should be provided to private higher education providers. In this Minority Report by Labor Senators it will be argued, first, that clear evidence has been presented to the Committee to the effect that a public subsidy is attached to the provision of access to PELS. If access to this scheme is made available to the four private providers listed in this context in the current bill, then it follows that these providers, as well as their postgraduate students availing themselves of PELS, will benefit from a significant taxpayer subsidy.</para><para>In public policy, a foundation principle is this: where public subsidies are provided, there must be public accountability.</para><para>It will be argued that these four providers are not currently subject to a level of public scrutiny and accountability arrangements that is comparable with the requirements attached to public subsidies going to public higher education institutions. This matter is also identified in the Government's report. In addition, these providers are not subject to the same legal regime in areas such as discrimination and industrial relations.</para></quote><para>It is a lengthy quote, but it is an excellent summary of the concerns that the opposition has about this legislation. If honourable senators take the time to read the rest of the minority report, it outlines in some detail the basis for the findings that I have just referred to.</para><para>To sum up, one of the major concerns we have with this legislation is that through this bill this government is, firstly, potentially pre-empting the outcome of its own wide ranging public inquiry into higher education. The fact that it is making decisions like that during the midst of a full inquiry raises a serious concern about its approach to higher education funding. Secondly, this bill extends the operation of a public subsidy which is contained within the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme to a select and discrete group of private higher education providers. Thirdly—and this is the particularly important point—these four providers do not have the same public scrutiny and accountability requirements placed upon them as those that are placed upon public and other institutions that receive access to the funding under PELS. These four providers are not subject to the same legal requirements that apply to other institutions in areas such as discrimination and industrial relations.</para><para>When you put all that together, once more you see this government's bias towards the private sector. I do not say that the private sector in education or in the health industry should not be supported; the opposition have never said that. But what we do say is that the primary responsibility of government is to the public sector. It should not be undermining the public sector in education as it has been doing for six years, and at the same time it should not be providing special consideration to private providers.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3955</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In speaking to the <inline ref="RI568">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, there are a number of areas that I would like to address. I will make some specific comments about the bill, but first I would like to point out that higher education in Australia finds itself in dire straits, a result of sustained cuts and poorly allocated resources by the coalition government. This government has shown its contempt for the value of higher education and the contribution to society that higher education makes, and so it should be stated that any proposed legislation or amendments from the government in this area need to be treated with suspicion and examined carefully lest, Honourable Senators, we be unwitting accomplices in a further degeneration of such a key sector of our society.</para></talk.start><para>The importance of higher education to society cannot be underestimated. The ALP has always recognised that an educated and skilled population brings social and economic benefits to all areas of the community. An educated population is a prosperous one, and so higher education must be made accessible to the whole community so that all can benefit. Unfortunately, this view is not shared by the current government. Since 1996 we have witnessed an endless stream of cuts to the funding of all tertiary institutions, a misallocation of ever decreasing resources and, perhaps more insidiously, a commitment to the privatisation of the higher education sector.</para><para>The litmus test of an effective and efficient higher education sector is how widely accessible it is to the community and whether the educational services provided are of the highest quality. Privatisation, along with the continual decrease in funding, has ensured that this government has failed both fundamental aspects of the test that I have just outlined. Let me refer to the first budget of this government in 1996. In 1996, several hundred million dollars were cut in one stroke from higher education funding. Since then—six years later—not a lot has changed. Cumulatively $3 billion has been slashed from the sector, the HECS liability for all students has increased, the HECS repayment thresholds have decreased, and research and development funding has also decreased. Not only are undergraduate students suffering from these cuts; those students who want to go into postgraduate study find that there are scant resources available to them. </para><para>But the problems run even deeper than these appalling cuts to government funding that I have just referred to. The coalition has also forced universities to accept fee paying students, a situation that has resulted in those with the ready cash often being prioritised in their entry to university over those who need to rely on HECS to study. Universities have started reorganising their operations to attract such full fee paying students, those students being, of course, more lucrative to the institutions than those that depend on HECS to attend to study. The peripheral costs imposed on students also continue to increase. Universities now rely on ancillary fees as a source of income. Youth Allowance and Austudy and Abstudy payments continue to be insufficient to support students. As a consequence, students have to work long hours as casuals or part-time employees to be able to afford to attend university and to support themselves.</para><para>During my time as a lecturer at the University of Adelaide, over a period of eight years I witnessed departments, schools and faculties wilt under these funding pressures. I had students coming to me and begging for leniency over their study because they could not make ends meet without working far too many hours. I taught students a degree that was being devalued and undermined by the lack of resources that the university could dedicate to it. All this was because the government penny-pinched with higher education. In fact, the University of Adelaide, my former employer, serves as a good example of how higher education is being eroded by the government's funding arrangements. This university, regarded as being a prestigious `sandstone university' with a proud history in law, medicine and the liberal arts, has been forced to cut these once fundamental courses and now actively pursues the private dollar in the areas of science and engineering to balance its budget. In fact, it now draws only slightly more than 40 per cent of its total income from public funding—and, after all, it is a public university.</para><para>We all know that a tertiary education brings long-term benefits to the community, yet it is equally true that failing to provide accessible quality tertiary education for the community brings long-term costs. These long-term costs are now starting to be recognised by groups around the country. Research organisations constantly call for more funding and only recently, as my Labor colleague Tanya Plibersek pointed out last week in the House of Representatives, scientists highlighted, during National Science Week last week, the impending social costs which will result from the government's myopia over higher education funding. The cuts to science funding will not be noticed this year or even next year, but the deeper cuts will be noticed in years to come.</para><para>To my mind, the bill that we have before us today, the Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002, does nothing at all to address any of the higher education sector issues that I have briefly been mentioning. Instead, it will further erode the accessibility of our education system. My concerns with the bill revolve around two major areas. First, it sets a precedent for other private institutions beyond the four institutions named in the legislation to seek access to the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme, or PELS, and ultimately to other public funds. Secondly, the legislation does not include any measures to ensure that the private providers meet quality assurance and accountability levels comparable with those of public institutions. </para><para>The four private institutions included in this legislation—Bond University, Melbourne College of Divinity, Tabor College and the Christian Heritage College—are just four of over 80 private higher education providers in Australia. The legislation outlines very little by way of specification as to why these four institutions were chosen. The government has said little on why these specific four were chosen. In his second reading speech, the minister indicated:</para><quote><para>The extension of PELS to these four institutions levels the playing field for competition in fee-paying postgraduate coursework degrees and further extends opportunities for institutions to provide and students to undertake fee-paying postgraduate coursework.</para></quote><para>Yet what the minister does not say is that the courses offered at these four institutions are not exclusive; other institutions also offer equivalent courses. The government has no real reasons for selecting these four institutions above others. The real agenda of this government is to establish a precedent for further extending public funds to other private institutions. What the minister really wants is a playing field where only the rich are kicking goals and the rest of society, the people most in need of accessible education, are reduced to watching from the sidelines. Pretty soon, they will not even be able to get through the stadium gates.</para><para>The other major concern that I have with this legislation is the lack of accountability and quality assurance measures that these institutions are submitted to. Currently, these private institutions are not subject to the same scrutiny over their policies or outcomes. The <inline ref="R1568">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> will allow them access to public funding; therefore, it should also include measures that ensure accountability and reporting processes that are consistent with public universities. Similarly, this legislation should ensure that the quality of the courses undertaken at the private institutions matches those of public universities. I am not in any way suggesting that the quality standards are currently below those of public universities, but simply that regulation is needed to ensure that money is not simply being thrown at private providers whose standards may not be the same as those of public universities.</para><para>My Senate colleagues Senator Carr and Senator Crossin have articulated amendments which I believe will strengthen the quality assurance, accountability and reporting requirements of the four providers as stated in the minority report of the Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee on this piece of legislation. I urge members to support these amendments. The state of higher education in this country is in disarray, and all this government can do is put up shoddy, ad hoc legislation like this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>3957</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise also to speak on the <inline ref="R1568">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, which is a bill that reflects this government's ideological creep towards not so much a user-pays model as a students-and-their-parents pay model for higher education funding. The arrival of the higher education system at this end point, so desired by those opposite, will further entrench the sons and daughters of the privileged in their positions in society via a university education at the expense of the disadvantaged who, since the days of the Whitlam government, have enjoyed the ability to take higher education, regardless of their social or economic circumstances. The Howard government's ideologically driven model for higher education will impact particularly on rural students who, as we know from the work of Professor Margaret Alston, grow up in households which enjoy an average income considerably below the national average.</para></talk.start><para>As the previous speaker, Senator Kirk, said, and I am sure others have said, this bill provides for the extension of the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme—PELS as it is known——to four additional institutions: Bond University, Melbourne College of Divinity, Tabor College in Adelaide, South Australia, and the Christian Heritage College. This gives students at these institutions access to postgraduate study loans on the same basis as other students, but it does not make the institutions eligible for public funding. The bill updates the funding amounts provided for in the <inline ref="R1448">Higher Education Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002</inline>. It also provides additional funding for the establishment of a graduate diploma in environment and planning at the University of Tasmania, with six associated scholarships. The bill adjusts funding levels in the Higher Education Funding Act and the Australian Research Council Act 2001 to permit the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU access to the funding schemes of the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. Finally, the bill provides for an additional funding cap for the Australian Research Council competitive research schemes in 2006, consistent with the current budget forward estimates so that the minister can approve ARC grants for a period of four years. There is also a technical amendment to correct previous drafting errors in HEFA. </para><para>I note that, even in that regard, the financial commitment to university operations has been reduced by $14 million through an allowance for the revision of the estimates of the HECS repayments receipts for the year. I endorse Senator Carr's comments in this regard that this characterises a record of negligence by this government, continued by the current minister. I endorse the comments that Senator Carr makes about Mr Nelson going around the country and pretending to be the friend of universities, while actually championing the cause of harming the sector. The claim that the government is putting less money into the system because there is more private money coming into the system is based on the assumption that I started with, and that is that students and their parents are paying more. The government is therefore trying to redistribute responsibility for the funding of education away from the public purse, away from government, and on to students in a way that will see a rapid and dramatic increase in the cost of higher education for students and their parents. We know that the government is actively pursuing the prospect of extending the real rate of interest of HECS. One wonders what that will cost students.</para><para>I want to focus my attention on one particular area in which this government's funding—or lack of it—for the higher education sector is impacting on rural communities and particularly on the veterinary sector. I noted in question time yesterday that Senator Ian Macdonald thought he would make a couple of cheap points on the basis of the launch of the opposition's discussion paper on rural veterinarians and a stronger livestock industry. To obtain what he thought was a cheap point, he chose to misrepresent what we are actually saying in relation to this sector. You see, we are trying to make a very serious point about a problem which will face a very valuable sector of the Australian economy. Senator Macdonald said that I had claimed that there was a lack of students wanting to be vets. In fact, that is not what I said: I said there was a lack of students willing or able to take up livestock practice, due largely to education funding cuts by the Howard government. There is quite a difference, but one would have to say that Senator Macdonald never let the facts get in the way of a cheap laugh.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Eggleston</name></talker><para>—That's not fair!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8O6</name.id><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name></talker><para>—That is quite fair. In fact, Senator, that is exactly what he was trying to do, as I have just demonstrated, because he said that I said there was a lack of students wanting to be vets when the reality is that there are so few places and the scores are so high that the students who are likely to be vets and who want to be in livestock practices cannot get in. That is the reality.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What do we know about the veterinary sector? Firstly, we know that, over all, undergraduate enrolments are increasing but, according to the deans of various universities, students are coming from the cities. Studies have shown that, if a student comes from a rural background, after 10 years they are twice as likely to remain in rural practice. We also know that postgraduate enrolments in this area have fallen steadily over the last five years, and that is an area that this bill is trying to enhance. But in the veterinary sector—a sector which the minister himself said yesterday attracts people who have to get a score higher than the score necessary to get into medicine—the number of students seeking to go into postgraduate enrolments is falling. One would have thought, given the student body that these students are being drawn from, and given their scholastic achievements, that you would not see a fall and that you would actually see an increase as the number of students who try to get into these courses drove the scores even higher because there are so few places. </para><para>We also find that one in five students in these courses is there on a fee-paying basis as an overseas student. These are required, of course, in order to fund the vet schools in the absence of adequate Commonwealth funding. I think one has to assume the majority of overseas students go home to practise. We only graduate about 300 students per year, and that is including overseas students. But, based on the average—there are 2,476 rural vets at the moment, according to information that I have been able to gather, and their average age is about 50—we need around 165 graduates a year going into rural practices just to hold the numbers. This is not for any improvement but just to hold the numbers.</para><para>So we see the opposition presenting a serious attempt to create discussion in a policy area which, frankly, is suffering because of this government's lack of financial commitment to a very important sector of the economy. What has this government done? It made some promises at the last election: it pledged to address the problem by holding an industry workshop and conducting an inquiry into the problems of the industry, based on the outcome of the workshop; and it put forward a proposal to have bonded scholarships valued at the princely sum of $2 million over five years. We had a workshop in February this year. It made some proposals after significant delays by the Prime Minister's office which caused much frustration to industry participants. The study that was promised is at last under way. However, its report, originally expected by the industry in August—obviously, that is not going to happen—has fallen back to November, a delay that I think is fully attributable to the Prime Minister's apparent opinion that this was not an issue of national import and a testament to the impotence of the agriculture minister in regard to his cabinet colleagues. So that is the sort of problem we have. When we looked at the issue of bonded scholarships, promised at budget estimates earlier this year when I asked questions of the government about precisely what they were doing with regard to the model that they would use to apply the promised $2 million over five years, they were still working on it. Six months after the election, they had no idea what they were going to do.</para><para>Of course, yesterday we saw some criticism of the opposition in this area again by Senator Macdonald. His response to the part of our discussion paper where we talk about training more vets to help with postborder protection was that it was worth a chuckle because it would take staff away from the front line. Secondly, he said that postborder protection is in fact a measure that is the responsibility of the state government. Of course, it is a function of this government's mantra that everything is the state's responsibility that he says that, but the fact of the matter is that the lack of vets generally, whether it is a state or federal responsibility, means that we cannot have an adequate postborder security function in terms of monitoring and controlling disease once it has passed our borders. During the foot-and-mouth outbreak in the United Kingdom, the United Kingdom imported vets from all over the world to deal with its problems. A lot of Australian vets went to the United Kingdom, where they earned much better money than they do here. The problem is that some of those vets will not come back.</para><para>If we do not have an adequate program to train veterinary surgeons who are likely to work in rural and regional Australia, then industries which leverage billions of dollars of exports for this country will be denied the opportunity to maintain their relative disease-free status and the probability of the introduction of dangerous diseases and the spread of existing diseases will be heightened. That is why this is a very serious area and why the way that this government funds higher education is a very important issue for rural Australia and the veterinary community. That is why Senator Macdonald's cheap shot yesterday—which, as I said earlier, did not accurately reflect our policy decision— was quite irresponsible. It was quite irresponsible because he was trying to belittle a serious attempt at policy discussion in this country on an area which impacts on a significant part of the rural economy. </para><para>In relation to our discussion document, I was visited in my office earlier this week by Professor Reuben Rose, Dean of the Faculty of Veterinary Science from the University of Sydney, and Professor Lonnie King, Dean of the College of Veterinary Medicine from Michigan State University. Both gentlemen congratulated the opposition on having made a serious attempt to canvass a proper discussion of an important policy area which is relevant to rural communities. It is not just relevant to Australia. Professor King indicated that these are the sorts of issues that need to be discussed, and are being discussed, in his own country and that there are other issues which he is prepared to assist with, in terms of expanding a proper policy on the development of veterinary science resources for the livestock industries in this country.</para><para>I come back to this piece of legislation. It is, yet again, a model in which this government seeks to go down the line of transferring responsibility away from the public purse and onto the private purse—and therefore onto students and parents, driving away from university people who are not financially well-endowed enough to afford it. It is said in relation to veterinary science that about 80 per cent of the students who attend the faculty at Sydney University live on the North Shore of Sydney. What is the chance that a significant number of those young people will decide to set up their practices in rural Australia? Studies show—this is not my opinion—that that is not very likely. We now have a model where there are a limited number of places. Demand is driven by the number of people who want to get into those places. Those who do not have the scores, and who can afford to, can pay. Those who do not get the scores, but have the aptitude and the ability to complete the course and are likely to work in the livestock industries—an important economic sector for this country— cannot get into Sydney University. They cannot afford to go there; their parents cannot afford to pay for them.</para><para>Who is missing out? They are missing out, but the country is also missing out. The country is missing out because, as our ageing rural veterinary population retires, we will not have the replacements for them. That is why we are pursuing a serious set of policy discussions. We want to have a proper policy on this. The government made some promises before the last election. They have been very tardy in delivering on those but, frankly, the information that we are gathering indicates that that very limited response will not be enough to correct the problem that this country will face. So I am very pleased to see that we have the serious attention of the real players in this sector. The cheap political points from Senator Macdonald will disappear, as they were destined to, within a day or two. The reality is that we will have a policy which has the support of the business sectors in rural Australia and the education sector, and maybe the government will eventually have to pick it up.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>3960</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Universities have been able to rely on a strong and undiminished commitment of public funding from the government. Both Commonwealth funding and places are increasing over the forthcoming triennium. The government is also currently delivering a significant injection of funding through the Backing Australia's Ability initiative and other measures. The benefits of that package are already being enjoyed by universities. In total, Backing Australia's Ability commits an additional $3 billion over five years for science, research and innovation. It includes an additional $1.5 billion for the university sector. The government's policies in recent years have facilitated the transition from a highly dependent sector to one that is more independent of government, having a broader funding base, greater flexibility and more autonomy.</para></talk.start><para>However, as senators are aware, the government is committed to a review of higher education to examine ways in which we can build on the strengths of the sector, increase diversity and recognise the special role of institutions. The Crossroads paper includes a frank discussion of some of the options available in Australia. These options are now open for debate. A well-educated and skilled work force that embraces lifelong learning is essential for Australia's economic growth. As part of its commitment to lifelong learning, the government announced the Postgraduate Education Loans Scheme in 2001 as part of Backing Australia's Ability. The scheme, which commenced in 2002, encourages extended participation in education and helps Australians update their skills and acquire new skills. The <inline ref="R1568">Higher Education Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> provides for the extension of PELS to four additional institutions: Bond University, Melbourne College of Divinity, Tabor College and Christian Heritage College. </para><para>This measure fulfils an election commitment of the government and was announced in the budget. It gives students at these institutions access to postgraduate study loans on the same basis as other students but does not make the institutions eligible for public funding. We estimate that some 2,200 students will benefit over the next four years. A new graduate diploma in environment and planning at the University of Tasmania will advance the cause of environmental sustainability by helping to address the growing demand for professionals versed in the complexities of integrated social, economic and environmental planning. The course will also allow Tasmanians interested in local environmental planning issues to stay in Tasmania rather than having to relocate to the mainland.</para><para>These bills will assist institutions to streamline their administration. We are proposing to simplify the acquittal requirements for Commonwealth grants so that universities will not have to comply with different requirements for different types of grants. The requirement for institutions to send a notice of liability to overseas fee-paying students will be removed under the bills. There is currently no requirement to send liability notices to domestic fee payers. The government think it is best left to each institution to determine such administrative processes. We are also proposing to streamline the administration of ARC grants and the provision of expert advice to the ARC board. The minister will be able to formally approve research grants for a period of four years rather than the two currently allowed by the act, thus reducing the amount of paperwork involved in administering grants and also providing certainty to grant holders.</para><para>The ARC board will be able to create advisory committees—other than those specifically involved in advising on funding allocations—without the approval of the minister, thus streamlining the processes for the ARC board to acquire expert advice. The bills will permit the Institute of Advanced Studies at the Australian National University to access the competitive funding schemes of the Australian Research Council and the National Health and Medical Research Council. The measure is part of the ongoing efforts of this government to create a more strategic and internationally competitive research system in Australia. The bills provide for internal transfer of funding amounts between sections of HEFA that will enable the Institute of Advanced Studies at the ANU to participate in the government's performance-based block research funding schemes. This is also an important step in building a more integrated and competitive higher education research system.</para><para>The bills contain a number of technical amendments. Funding amounts are varied to reflect revised estimates for HECS liabilities. This variation has no effect on the level of funding provided to institutions. Funding for the Commonwealth's contribution to superannuation costs is increased in line with revised estimates of the Commonwealth superannuation liability, and provision is made for an advance of operating grants to the University of Adelaide and subsequent repayments. Minor technical amendments to the bills change two sections of HEFA to reflect changes in taxation legislation. They amend the name of Batchelor Institute of Indigenous Tertiary Education in schedule 1, which is currently listed as Batchelor College. They also remedy two minor drafting errors in HEFA.

How is it that the government has undertaken this process of extensive review when it has effectively pre-empted this process by the introduction of this legislation?

The commitment to extend PELS to these four institutions was made prior to the review being announced. The measure does not extend government funding beyond current institutions but it does extend opportunities and increase student choice. The issue of access to loans for higher education students enrolled in other private higher education institutions will be considered as part of the government's current higher education review. This will ensure that the issue is considered in a broader policy and funding framework.

So, if you are suggesting that somehow they were led to believe that not only would they get PELS but they would get access to a range of other entitlements, that was certainly not so and we did not give them any such basis for thinking that.

The questions by Senator Carr, seeking reasons for and explanations of some of what has been put forward, are very important. As my Democrat colleagues Senator Stott Despoja and Senator Allison have made clear in relation to this bill, the Democrats as a whole are opposed to extending PELS to the four private institutions that have just been mentioned. As senators would know, Democrat amendments aimed at removing these provisions have been circulated. I note that others have also prepared amendments with similar intent.</para></talk.start><para>Obviously, discussing the ALP amendments beforehand gives us an idea of the state of those sections that we are seeking to remove, whether or not they will be in an amended form. I am making it clear that the ultimate desire of the Democrats is to remove these provisions altogether. However, it is appropriate to put on the record that the Democrats will be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Carr, to at least introduce some greater degree of accountability in relation to the provisions that are here. A lot of questions need to be asked and more information needs to be gained from the minister in the committee stage. That, of course, is what the committee stage is about.</para><para>One of the major concerns that the Democrats have with this bill is that it pre-empts the minister's own review of higher education—the Crossroads review—and on procedural grounds alone I think there is good reason to reject these provisions. It is bizarre, in my view, to think that the extension of PELS to these four private institutions could be considered as anything but a significant policy precedent to extend public funding to private providers. Despite the minister, Dr Nelson, claiming he wants a mature and comprehensive debate, it appears to the Democrats to be difficult to believe he is serious when these sorts of changes are being put forward before the minister's own review has been completed. </para><para>There is a lot of misinformation or misuse of information in this debate. One example is Dr Nelson's claim that one university offers 167 courses but that 96 have fewer than five students enrolled. This is held up as the sort of inefficiency that needs to be eliminated before additional funding can be considered. On the face of it he seems to have a point, but course enrolments are inadequate indicators of efficiency because they tell us nothing about the real cost of staff to student ratios, for instance. Administratively, it is the aggregate of subjects that students need to complete. The number of subjects that you need to complete per course varies a lot but it can range well up into the twenties for an average degree. While some courses are quite prescriptive as to what subjects need to be taken, most are flexible. Having that range of choice for students, including those offered by different faculties, is crucial in maximising not just student choice but the value of the degree and the effectiveness of it.</para><para>There has been an explosion in courses offered to students in recent years, for a variety of reasons, including the identification of niche markets to attract fee-paying students. But the primary reason has been the desire of students to have greater recognition of specialisations than can be revealed in generic titles such as Bachelor of Business or Bachelor of Arts. There are a number of ways to respond to this demand. One is to offer course titles that identify specialisations. These days if you go to any university web site, you will see literally hundreds of so-called badged courses which offer, for example, a Bachelor of Business (Tourism and Finance), which is very different from a Bachelor of Business (Science and Technology) or a Bachelor of Business (Journalism and Politics). While there are some administrative costs in offering a multiplicity of courses, the real costs occur at student level and that is where questions of efficient delivery, such as staff to student ratios, are relevant. One subject can often include students from a range of courses, both postgraduate and undergraduate, and flexibility allows many courses to be offered from the same pool of subjects. If we use the half-truths of the measure that has been put forward repeatedly to paint a picture of inefficiency that is used to justify action, it can actually reduce the ability of universities to offer flexibility to attract students in the first place.</para><para>There are significant issues that need to be acknowledged, let alone addressed, as part of that. From the Democrats' point of view those sorts of issues need to be brought out into the open. They are relevant, as the number of students in the courses—for example, at Tabor College and the Christian Heritage College—demonstrates the poverty of the government's justification for these provisions in the legislation. We do need to get out information—for example, how many postgraduate courses some of these colleges have in education and how many graduate entry education students come forth. Those sorts of things need to be brought out into the open as part of ensuring an informed debate and an informed decision on these particular provisions in the legislation. We might explore those things a bit further when we get to the Democrats' amendments. At this stage I indicate again the Democrats' support for the group of amendments moved by Senator Carr.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3965</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the Democrats for their indication of support on this matter.

It is a huge advantage to those institutions. As a result of this measure, these institutions will be able to secure a significant market advantage over and above their competitors. Contrary to your concerns about what you refer to as my `bile', I am concerned about the principles of the market operating fairly. I think it is important, Minister, that you, as the great advocate for the free enterprise system, appreciate the implications of providing a market advantage to a couple of colleges over and above the 80 or 90 that are currently operating in the market. I am trying to establish the reason for this, and I have not had an explanation other than that you are going to provide specialist assistance to this college because it trains teachers.  </para></talk.start><para>I ask the question: how many teachers? I am told, `Don't know. You find that out.' We are also told that a postgraduate program such as this is not the primary qualification for teachers—it is an additional qualification; having a postgraduate subsidy provided to people who we say are the primary focus is an undergraduate program. Minister, I put it to you—because you have got an army of public servants and I would trust you to check this basic information—that there is one student enrolled in postgraduate teaching at Tabor College. Can you confirm that? </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>3967</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not know why you hate the thought of teachers getting postgraduate qualifications.

I ask you to get advice on that because you have very able assistants there and I am sure that they can tell you that information. If they have not already, you would have to ask yourself why not. I come back to the point of all of this: what is the criteria on which these particular colleges have been singled out for assistance by the government? Why have they been given a market advantage? We have yet to hear an explanation other than that they are providing services for teachers—the sole service, I think you said at one point in this discussion today. </para></talk.start><para>The fact remains: that is not true. Both of these colleges operate in states where there are many providers of training for teachers. They are direct competitors for other religious groups, for instance—other faith based colleges. Why are you providing assistance to these two in that regard? We have yet to hear an explanation other than this: that it was an election commitment. If the policies of the department in terms of funding are being determined as a result of election commitments, so be it. But it would be interesting to know what the public rationale was for the expenditure of this money. The spending of this money—$18 million now in terms of this bill, with huge potential down the line—the government is now saying is all subject to further review as part of the Crossroads review. We know already that the private providers are saying they want access to this as well. They want a level playing field. So I ask, Minister, if the criteria were solely a political determination—and all we have heard so far is that it was a political determination as a result of a secret arrangement with the Liberal Party—then I think we are entitled to know that, and we can assess the merits of it. But we are talking about the expenditure of public funds and we have got to know what the criteria are. It is simply pathetic to suggest that you are providing `opportunities' to some people to get postgraduate qualifications. </para><para>I am a supporter of teachers getting postgraduate qualifications. I made the point to you, Minister, that I have got a few of my own. I make the point to you though: shouldn't it be on the basis of some equity? Should it not be on the basis of a rational public policy assessment? We have not heard that. All we have heard is that there was a political deal done by this government. Furthermore, it was put to me before that the minister was confident that the government would only ever tell the truth on these matters and would never dishonour its commitments and it was said to me that I had misunderstood it. Let me quote a submission from the principal of Tabor College in South Australia. He said:</para><quote><para>On behalf of our organisation, I would like to express support of the provisions made in the bill. At the same time I wish to point out that the provisions made in the bill fall considerably short of the promises made in then Minister David Kemp's pre-election Policy Release, where he said:</para></quote><para>A re-elected Government will provide more students with access to higher education that targets their specific needs by placing several other teacher training institutions in the same position as the University of Notre Dame ... </para><para>The application of this principle would provide concrete assistance and a more level playing field for those in the community who establish alternative institutions to meet their needs. It would also provide a potentially sounder and more equitable base to assure the supply of suitably qualified teachers in private schools with a religious mission. </para><para>A third Howard Government will provide the same arrangements as apply currently to the University of Notre Dame to Bond University, the Melbourne College of Divinity, Christian Heritage College and Tabor College by including them within the framework of the Higher Education Act 1988 (HEFA) while maintaining their ability to have fee-paying students.</para><para>That is crystal clear. I do not think I could misunderstand that. What Dr Kemp told those colleges was that they were going to get access to the full box and dice. Is that the government's policy? Is that the real policy we are being asked to consider here? Is it the real policy of this government to provide not just these colleges with the full box and dice of public funding and all its aspects but also the 80 or 90 other private providers knocking on the door, not to mention those amongst the 4,000 RTOs—registered training organisations, Minister, if you are not familiar with the term—that are also seeking to provide higher education services? Are we saying that is the full implication of this policy or is this government saying, `No, it is just this limited number, and that's it'? What the documents suggest is that you today, Minister, have misled this chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3968</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The media release put out by Dr Kemp on 31 October seems to be the one that Senator Carr is relying on.

I know that is a bit arcane for Senator Carr, but it is worth absorbing—and I can see why he is concerned about it.

If Senator Carr says he is all in favour of teachers undertaking postgraduate studies, does he mean at their own expense entirely or does he want them to be aided and assisted by having access to a PELS loan?  </para><para>If, on the other hand, he is in favour of PELS but he wants it extended much more broadly then he should be in favour of at least it being extended to two significant training institutions. He can then run the usual political precedent line, and when he puts in his detailed submissions to the Crossroads inquiry he can argue that this is a foot in the door and that it ought to be extended much more broadly.

I will address my remarks through you. Chair, could you explain to the minister that the concept of no underlying impact on the cash balance is, in fact, a reference to the cost of the HECS program—and that is what we are talking about here. Under the government's accounting conventions, this is of course turned on its head so that the HECS debt becomes an asset and the subsidy—which is the cost to the budget of HECS—is treated in exactly the opposite way it would be in any other form of financial consideration. We can measure this. What is the cost of the subsidy in HECS—because you brought the HECS issue up? We know what the cost of the subsidy is, because if we were to apply a real rate of interest to this we would establish what the cost of the subsidy is. </para></talk.start><para>I asked the department this question. Minister, do you know what the answer is? It is $1 billion. What we are talking about is that if the current arrangements had a real rate of interest applied to them it would be $1 billion. That is the framework in which we are talking about the underlying cash balance. When the minister claims this special qualification in the press release, he is talking about a level of subsidy of that dimension. The point I relied on is what the colleges themselves claim, based on their submission to the Senate inquiry. I am not quoting any press release. I am not seeking to misquote anyone. I am simply asserting what the documents are. They have been presented to the Senate by one of these colleges, but the government has let them down. </para><para>The reason I raise this matter is that I am trying to establish the full implications of the government's policies. It is not even an issue of whether or not one is opposed to PELS; you know full well, Minister, that the Labor Party voted for the bill last year. You know full well that that is the case, so there is no point in running down that particular burrow. The question that is now before us is: what is the cost implication of this measure? The colleges themselves say that you have basically dudded them. The private providers right across the board say they want access to this particular measure. They say they think there is an unfair market advantage here. I am trying to establish from you, Minister, what criteria were used by the government to select these particular colleges which will get a substantial market advantage by this measure. I think it is a perfectly reasonable question. We have yet to hear the answer.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>3970</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Carr seems to adopt at face value a claim which really amounts to saying that the four institutions believe they were promised access to HECS. That is fundamentally not so, and there is nothing that you can point to that gives comfort to that proposition. When you read the press release and the election commitment, you see that they both make it plain. Maybe the problem arises because both Senator Carr and the institutions concerned just skimmed over that sentence. Obviously, Senator Carr had never seen it until I drew it to his attention. It is quite likely that the institutions concerned did not fully understand what it meant. If they did, then clearly they are just overstating their case, but if they did not understand it, then now is the time to explain it.</para></talk.start><para>Under accepted accounting practice, the actual amount loaned to students is treated as a financial asset and therefore does not impact on Commonwealth expenses.

This is estimated to be $18.7 million over four years.</para><para>With respect to the claim, disingenuous or otherwise, that somehow they were promised HECS as well as PELS, there was a very clear and conscious decision made by the government not to promise HECS, and we reflected that in both the media release and the election commitment.

The reason we are opposing this extension is that it is a public subsidy. It is another example of this government taking money out of the public purse and giving it to these private providers. As is the case with so many of our essential services—and education, of course, is a key essential service to our society—it is only through public provision that we can ensure that there is equitable access to an essential service like education. </para></talk.start><para>I welcome the opportunity to have this debate about the flaws in the government's proposal to extend PELS to these private institutions. We have heard the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts talk today about how he does not perceive that this extension of the scheme to these four private institutions is an opening of the floodgates for the 80 to 90 private providers who would like access to PELS.</para><para>I point out to the minister that, when these organisations appeared before the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education Legislation Committee and talked about how they would like access to PELS, they also stated that they would like access to HECS. So these private providers were saying not only that they would like to see the government open the floodgates a little further and allow them access to PELS but also that they would like to have access to HECS. Of course, further pressure would be applied to our public institutions and our public universities if we opened these floodgates and allowed the private providers access not only to PELS but also to HECS. This is clearly a direction in which the private providers are requesting the government to head. Certainly, we have seen from the government's moves on a range of other measures that it is prepared to listen to the private providers in whatever industry it may be to ensure that they also get access to government subsidies. </para><para>This leads us into the international debate on the General Agreement on Trade in Services. We know that this government, at the next round of negotiations at the World Trade Organisation, will seek to trade away a variety of our public services. We do not know for certain whether public education is at the top of the list, but certainly the introduction into the parliament of bills like this, in which the government seeks to extend public subsidies to private providers, gives us an indication of the direction in which it would like to head, not only in relation to higher education but in relation to a number of other public services for which the minister who is in the chamber is responsible.</para><para>That is the reason why the Greens have proposed an amendment to this piece of legislation to exclude all references to the extension of PELS to private providers. There are aspects of the bill which other senators have already talked about to which the Greens are not opposed, but we are opposed to taking that money from the public purse and giving it to these private institutions. As senators know, we have a range of other amendments on the table for discussion. The Greens recognise in particular that the amendments we are considering seek to bring in greater regulation of these private institutions. The Greens obviously will support further regulation of these private institutions, but we do believe that we need to take that further step, and bringing in greater regulation of private institutions does not take away from the fact that the core purpose of this bill is to take public money and give it to these private providers. So whilst we recognise that greater regulation of private institutions is an improvement, and we will support measures which go down that path, we point out that the Greens do not believe this takes away from the central tenet of this legislation.</para><para>So far this morning, we have had the minister speaking about the opportunity for senators in this chamber to have input into the Crossroads review. It is pertinent that the minister points out that we are in the midst of the Crossroads review—a review about funding arrangements for higher education— because that is of course where this debate relating to the extension of PELS should appropriately be discussed. We have had these arguments put previously to the government to say that when you look at an overall review, as you are selling the Crossroads review to be, it is pertinent to have everything open for discussion.</para><para>Yet we see this bill before parliament and the government are saying, `Let's extend PELS. Let's give this public subsidy to these private institutions now because we made an election promise. But don't let that interfere with the overall holistic review that we are doing of higher education at the moment and, if senators would like to make submissions to the Crossroads review, please feel free to go ahead.' Dare I suggest that it would be appropriate that the government put forward submissions to extend PELS to these private institutions as a part of the Crossroads review. If it is good enough for other senators to put their points forward during the Crossroads review, why is it not good enough for the government to also follow a process that they themselves have set up?</para><para>The other issue I would like to raise in relation to this bill and the extension to these particular private providers draws back to the reason why the Greens support public education. It is only through public education, where you get people together in an environment regardless of their religion or their ability to pay, that they can learn to be part of the tolerant and cohesive society and community that the Greens are committed to ensuring that we have in Australia. I am by no means casting aspersions on these particular institutions, but if we allow this to extend to these private institutions—who do set standards as to who can attend their institutions, depending on their ability to pay, religion, gender or whatever it may be—we are opening up these public subsidies to private institutions that do not provide the same quality public education that our own public institutions provide by allowing everyone to access that service, that quality education. </para><para>There is a range of issues that the government need to answer in terms of coming forward with this proposal to extend PELS to these private institutions. Particularly, I would like to ask the minister: why do the government choose to devalue public education in the way that they are doing at the moment through this bill? Why are the government extending public subsidies to these private institutions, making it so much easier for them to then try to outcompete the public institutions in the education marketplace? These public institutions can provide us with the quality public education that helps to build the cohesive and tolerant society that we would like to see here in Australia and that the government have articulated that they would also like to see, whilst of course the evidence for that has been greatly lacking, particularly in the last two years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>3972</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was asked, I think more in a rhetorical fashion than anything else, why are we devaluing public education.

That is the nature of this particular matter with regard to the very substantial amounts of money involved and they are clearly the issues that the government's Crossroads review is contemplating, as the minister said today.

Therefore, is it not the case that the criteria that have been selected here—the politically selective approach that has been taken here—may well have significant implications?

But can I go back to the more important issue, because Senator Carr seems now to be pretty excited about this billion dollar subsidy. There is a fundamental difference between the way HECS operates and the way PELS operates. HECS involves a 25 per cent discount if you pay the fee up-front, and that does affect the underlying cash balance. There is an implicit interest rate subsidy in relation to both HECS and PELS, and I am sure Senator Carr appreciates how that works, because the nominal level of interest rates prevailing in the marketplace is likely to be higher than the CPI rate. As a result they are getting a slight discount. </para></talk.start><para>That implicit interest rate subsidy does not affect the underlying cash balance, and that is why that press release that was put out by Dr Kemp made it plain that the arrangements to apply would not have an impact upon the underlying cash balance. So if you have any degree of financial literacy then you understand that you are not getting HECS; you are getting PELS. Why I say there is no point of distinction between the press release and the election commitment is that they both effectively make it plain that this is a commitment in relation to PELS and not HECS. The election commitment says:</para><quote><para>This means students at Bond University, the Melbourne College of Divinity, Christian Heritage College and Tabor College will be eligible for PELS loans for non-research postgraduate study.</para></quote><para>I have to say that I think it is highly disingenuous to argue that somehow you can still claim that the government were implicitly promising access to HECS. That cannot be so. Whatever legal issue or semantic approach you might like to take, the fact is that we baldly state there that you are eligible for PELS; we make no such suggestion in relation to HECS. It has been made plain to them that they were not getting HECS, and the original press release also makes it plain that the arrangements would have no impact on the underlying cash balance.

You have been asked to argue a case which is clearly not true. Notre Dame has HECS places. The commitment was as to `the same position as the University of Notre Dame'. The point is that that has quite a significant impact on the cash balance, as you have acknowledged. Furthermore, the real rate of interest subsidy of $1 billion—that is the cost of this on current HECS—would indeed, if it were changed, have a significant impact, and that is what you are discussing right now within the government. That is absolutely at the core of the considerations of the Crossroads review.

If he did, then he would not have this problem. I know why he is terminally confused; he has demonstrated that in this chamber for 10 years. So let me just take him once again to a non-selective reading of the election commitment from which he has just quoted selectively. He talked about it referring to several other teacher training institutions in the same position as the University of Notre Dame. It then goes on at quite some length to spell out, to provide more detail on, a general proposition. What that clearly means when you read the document is that it was being made plain that the institutions would be placed in the same position as the University of Notre Dame in respect of PELS.

Perhaps the minister could clarify for the Senate that this is exactly what the government's legislation seeks to do in extending PELS to these universities: it is providing public money to the students for the express purpose of them passing it on to these private institutions.

In theory, students could borrow money for a whole range of activities. In respect of this, they get a loan and they repay it, but they repay it only on a CPI basis rather than on a full interest rate basis.

Although, of course, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, things like, `We won't further privatise the Commonwealth Bank' or `We've got l-a-w law tax cuts' are not sacred on that side of the chamber. An election commitment is generally a pretty solemn statement. So if you were one of those four institutions and you read this document and it tells you that you will be eligible for PELS, what would you say to yourself? You would say, `Gosh, we wanted HECS.'

You would be told that you are not getting HECS.</para></talk.start><para>This argument is post-election. You say `bush lawyers'; I think it is sophistry at its worst.

I suspect that what has really happened here is that they have made it plain to Senator Carr that they were a bit disappointed, there was some general language, and he has made up the rest of the script. No self-respecting institution could point to that paragraph and say that that, in any shape or form, gave them a basis for believing that they were promised HECS. They might be very disappointed—they probably were from day one—but there cannot be any basis for them believing, genuinely, that they were going to get HECS prior to the election and finding out later that they had been dudded. What has happened, of course, is that Senator Carr has sought to manufacture a political argument which is transparently nonsense and, as a result, we are relying on the documentation. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>3976</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— We are trying to make some progress here.

That is quite a serious issue. It occurs all too often in education. The states are only too happy to agree to educational institutions having access to Commonwealth money. They do not have to worry about these issues of quality assurance in the direct political sense through their parliaments or in the broader sense, because the Commonwealth has to pick up the tab.

You have state Labor governments right around Australia. Senator Carr is saying that they are not to be trusted. That is pretty helpful, given that Senator Carr claims to control Victoria. What he is really doing is expressing a vote of no confidence in Mary Delahunty. More importantly, there is a longstanding agreement by which higher education is a shared responsibility between the Commonwealth and the states and territories. One of the areas for which the states and territories have clear, unequivocal responsibility is the recognition and accreditation of higher education providers and courses. Under these proposed amendments, reference to the responsibility of the states and territories to accredit the higher education institutions of non-self-accrediting institutions would be deleted and replaced with a requirement for the Commonwealth to satisfy itself that courses meet the quality criteria. This is not only a wasteful duplication, it also blatantly contradicts the Commonwealth-state agreement on higher education.</para></talk.start><para>What really makes me quake in my shoes is the realisation that it is not ultimately an independent process at all. It is a matter of the minister being satisfied that a course meets the quality criteria, based on advice. The minister does not have to take any notice of an independent panel. Imagine if you had Senator Carr running the show at Commonwealth level. He would have the imperial right to decide who is in and who is out. That is about the worst form of accreditation I could ever imagine. If he were proposing some sort of arms-length independent arrangement, at least there would be some intellectual rigour—apart from the fact that it is a blatant contradiction of the federal-state agreements and a vote of no confidence in his state Labor colleagues. But the notion that one individual, the minister of the day, should be able to make a judgment about accreditation leaves it wide open to all sorts of subjective assessments and all the paybacks that you would ever want. You can just imagine Senator Carr making promises in the lead-up to the election about who gets what: `Don't worry about the independent panel process. I don't have to take any notice of that. I make the decision.' That is what he is proposing to replace the existing Commonwealth-state arrangement with, and I would have thought that any self-respecting state Labor government should be out there complaining bitterly about that. It does not really need the Commonwealth to point out the idiocy of that approach.

Minister, in relation to your comments about self-accrediting institutions, it is true that the Melbourne College of Divinity and Bond University are self-accrediting bodies. But what is the government's understanding of those institutions in relation to their reporting and academic requirements? For example, is the government not concerned about the fact that Bond and MCD are not required to have an academic board? Does this not suggest that they are somewhat less rigorous in both their academic and reporting arrangements? I would like to hear the government's perspective on those two institutions in particular, given that the minister has jumped up and said that they are self-accrediting bodies. We know that they are not on either list A or list B of the HEFA, but we would like to hear the government's perspective on those reporting and academic requirements.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>3979</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In relation to the second matter, I understand they are self-accrediting institutions under the legislation and there is no requirement for them to have an academic board. On that basis, presumably, they are simply complying with the statutory obligations. As far as the other matter is concerned, Senator Stott Despoja is quite right in saying that the New South Wales government has moved to enshrine the national protocols in legislation, but the Commonwealth is satisfied with the progress being made by the other states and territories. Even prior to consideration of the national protocols, we were satisfied with the accreditation processes that were in place. I think the onus is really on those who argue that the current arrangements are inadequate and that, somehow, Senator Carr's approach is superior. In the first instance, you need to show us the deficiencies which you contend are in the existing arrangements, because we are satisfied that the states and territories are properly discharging their responsibilities and we have no reason to think that they will not continue to do so.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>3979</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to clarify Senator Carr's answer to my question about the expert panel.

I accept the thrust of what you were saying about the nature of this government but I would not accept it about the prospects of a Labor government, which will of course occur after the next election. What we are interested in is the immediate period, and that is the point that you are going to. That is why we say it is a disallowable instrument—that is, if you are not satisfied with the processes that come forward, there will be an opportunity through this chamber to do something about that.</para></talk.start><para>Can I also say this: the way you are presenting the ministerial discretion in these matters is somewhat limited to the extent that that is the form that occurs throughout the current act. Ministers have to make judgments about the nature of regulations, which are then subject to disallowance in this place—that is the method by which reporting requirements are placed on universities, for instance. There is a whole series of measures by which the minister determines what is appropriate in terms of reporting requirements. That is the nature of operating grant arrangements over and above the base formula. That is the basis on which student fees might well be set with regard to a range of programs. So, in those three areas, this measure is consistent with the formulation of the current legislation. </para><para>The minister suggested that we have to demonstrate that there is some inadequacy in the way in which the state departments of education operate in higher education. Frankly, anyone who knows anything about this would not be making that statement, because, quite clearly, in the years since the Commonwealth assumed responsibilities for funding of higher education, the states have reduced their capacity with regard to the administration of universities and higher education providers. We have noticed this again and again through the proceedings of the Senate education committee.</para><para>I asked a question before about the dates on which the accreditation processes were undertaken in the states in regard to the two colleges that are being mentioned here. The government could not tell us this important information. If the investigations were undertaken before the national protocols were signed in June 2002, I think it was, the current framework would not apply. I note that New South Wales is implementing the protocols in legislation and that Victoria and Queensland are on the way to do it. </para><para>I also note this: the government in its recent discussion paper proposed undermining those very protocols by suggesting that there should be a change in the nature of the universities themselves and undermining the basic definition of a university. So it is pretty important that these questions be attended to and that they be placed in some legislative form to provide some security on those matters, because that currently is not the situation and it is quite clear that this government is challenging them. I would not be surprised if the states were, in part, to follow its lead on occasions. I trust that that will not be the case—I know that in regard to Minister Kosky, with whom I have discussed this matter directly, there is a very strong commitment to the protocols. How that translates into administrative practice is another matter altogether.</para><para>I come back to the question about the dates; the government cannot tell me when these assessments were made. Perhaps they can tell me this: in the assessments undertaken in South Australia, was any assessment made of these colleges and the regulations in regard to vocational education institutions or higher education institutions?

We want to ensure not only that the expert panel is operating in a way that ensures quality for these private institutions but also, given the comments from the minister with regard to ministerial discretion and perhaps the need not to listen to the expert panel, that we look at pursuing those options in terms of how the expert panel is set up. Whilst recognising that the expert panel does provide some improvement and some additional regulation for these private institutions, we would like the opportunity to discuss further the options for putting forward a framework in which this expert panel would operate.

I thought that is what would happen. You will have an opportunity to look at these amendments in great detail. I understand that you are supporting the principle of them, and I appreciate that, and I thank the Greens for their support in that regard.</para></talk.start><para>What we are seeking to do here, of course, is to find a mechanism where we can improve the level of planning for public expenditure and the establishment of a proper process for public information about the institutions that are seeking access to public subsidies. We are trying to improve the level of quality assurance and, of course, accountability. We are not saying that these should be the subject of exactly the same criteria as public institutions; we are saying that they should be consistent with that approach. That is the nature of the amendments that you see before you. Consideration of the bill is not likely to be concluded prior to the break at 12.45 p.m. so there will be an opportunity for you to study the issues in more detail.</para><para>I have yet to hear from the government when the assessments of Tabor College are to be actually undertaken by the South Australian government. Is it possible for the government to give us any advice on that issue? I think it is an important one when dealing with these questions. What concerns us is not so much organisations like Bond University or the Melbourne College of Divinity. While there are differences in the way in which they are structured, it is explicit in the way in which their operations occur, particularly in the case of the Melbourne College of Divinity where there are separate arrangements for their theological studies from those that are occurring with the Melbourne University, which has an overriding association with that college. </para><para>The two providers that concern us more are the non-self-accrediting institutions. That is why we need a vehicle such as is being proposed here. We need a body of independent expert advice that cannot be stood over by the minister, that will provide advice to the parliament through its reports, and that will provide an opportunity for the parliament to disallow decisions by ministers. I do not for a moment concede that you are trying to provide regulation in the depth that would prevent a minister from exercising discretion on some of these matters. There are occasions when that is required. I do not think any government could legitimately say that it would not at times feel the need to exercise that. I am not suggesting for a moment that that would be a change in the policy that we would pursue. There are occasions when it is necessary, in public interest terms, for governments to make decisions. There are questions about the discretion with regard to public funds that need to be considered in these matters. But there also needs to be a policy framework that is understood, that is consistent and that does not allow for prejudicial action to be taken without due process. That is what concerns me about the current approach the government is pursuing.</para><para>We have a situation where these particular colleges have courses running which are not self-accredited. They have to be accredited by other people. We have considerable concern about the way in which that process was undertaken to establish that these particular institutions met the criteria that one would normally expect from a higher education institution.

The advice that I have been given is that they were accredited against vocational education standards, not higher education standards.

Two of them concern technical adjustments to the legislation affecting war widows— namely, bringing into line the provision of backdating so that widows are not disadvantaged when they transfer to the income support supplement from Centrelink benefits and, secondly, the regularisation of an oversight in the original drafting affecting the inclusion of a non-pensioner's partner's income in the means test. Both of these are straightforward and are supported by the opposition. The key issue in relation to the bill, however, is the proposal to index the income support supplement—otherwise known as the `frozen rate'—as well as the service pension paid to war widows in their own right as veterans. In addressing the issues, I would also like to explore and set out for the benefit of the Senate—and for the veteran community— some of the issues within the policy framework for war widows. I do this deliberately because it seems to me that policy in relation to widows is pretty ad hoc and is full of inconsistencies and inequity. </para></talk.start><para>Let me say at the outset that I do not propose to retrace the full history of the war widows pension, but some perspective is necessary to explain why we have come to this proposal today and to correct the cheap political shot of the Minister for Veterans' Affairs at the time of the introduction of the bill—namely, that this bill will `end Labor's freeze on the war widows income support supplement' and `end Labor's unfair treatment of our special war widows'. This is pretty rich coming from this government, whose term with respect to the veterans portfolio has seen a total stagnation of policy and a process of stalling and avoidance in the face of growing discontent within the veteran community. It also clearly demonstrates the policy vacuum we are facing with the Howard government on veterans policy because there is not the slightest inkling evident that this proposal forms part of any context with or overall view on war widows.</para><para>By way of brief background, the war widows pension was first provided for in the War Pensions Act 1914. It seems that it may have been paid as compensation for war loss and not as income support or as income maintenance, which were available under the Old Age and Invalids Act 1908; hence the pension has never been subject to any means test. Nevertheless, dependence on the veteran has long been the test. This, of course, is a test of financial support, not one of emotional or personal loss. It is, in fact, the single biggest confounding issue which pervades policy on war widows pensions and it is one which this government has compounded rather than simplified, which I will address later.</para><para>As recorded in the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline> on this matter, there has been much debate about the appropriate level of the war widows pension. It is interesting to note that until 1952 it was linked to the rate of pay of the rank of the deceased veteran. The standard rate was introduced in 1972, but there has been continuing controversy about the rationale for the payment of pensions to widows, the linkage with the social security systems of income support and other allowances, the existence of a few myths and legends, and the overall pragmatic view taken regardless of principle and policy that everything depends on the budget at the end of the day. The latter, it would seem, is the only common factor when considering all the idiosyncrasies of the war widows pension. It continues to this very day with the Howard government's own special anomalies—as it likes to call them. </para><para>The policy with respect to war widows entitlements is very complex. It is also confusing, contradictory and unfair—all of which is the product of years of ad hockery. Let me give the Senate some examples by turning to compensation, income support or recognition. Although many assert that the war widows pension is compensation for the loss of a loved one, this is not clear. I suggest that we may be splitting hairs somewhat. It certainly is compensation for personal loss, but it is also compensation for loss of income earning capacity of the deceased veteran— or, by another description, income support. Originally, it was both. But changes over the years seem to have been driven more by the economic factor rather than the non-economic factor.</para><para>Certainly, if we look at subsequent policy formulation, we see that it has been treated as income support—firstly, because it was cancelled on remarriage, which ended dependency and, secondly, because the current government changed the indexation to match the policy applying to the age pension—that is, indexation by CPI or 25 per cent of MTAWE, whichever is the lesser. This form of indexation is, as far as I am aware, restricted to income support pensions so that they keep pace with the standard of living, as opposed to CPI, which applies to allowances and compensation, which are indexed by CPI only to keep pace with the cost of living. Yet it remains tax free and is not means tested— millionaires are fully entitled to claim—both of which are taken as signs that the pension is a right as a form of recognition for personal loss.</para><para>The decision in 1986 to limit widows' access to the war widows pension as well as the full rate of social security benefits, although expressed as a budget saving initiative, clearly was motivated by the notion that the widows pension was indeed a substantial form of income support, and that access to other forms of income support benefits should be limited—hence the frozen rate, as it is termed, and now the ISS, as it has become. From that time forward, widows were unable to access a range of income support benefits available under the Social Security Act, including the Jobsearch allowance, Newstart, sickness allowance or other special benefits.</para><para>I turn to dependency and marriage. Notwithstanding the above comments, and consistent with the attitude that the widows pension is a right, the cancellation of the pension on remarriage was removed prospectively in 1984 and retrospectively last year. Yet you do not have to be legally married: if you establish that there was a marriage-like relationship, that will suffice. However, separation is not a disqualification for legal marriage but it is for nonlegal relationships. So not only do we have complete policy confusion and contradiction as to the purpose of the war widows pension, but also we have substantial inconsistency and unfairness. </para><para>We also have a conundrum to which there are quite a few widows who want an answer, because despite remarriage no longer being a disqualification, a widow is still not entitled to claim if she remarried prior to 1984 and never claimed, or if an application had been formally rejected on the grounds of remarriage prior to 1984. That is, the widow must have been in receipt of payment as a war widow to have it restored. If you had a claim rejected or never applied, there is nothing to restore.</para><para>Divorce results in immediate termination of eligibility. This, of course, produces the very common situation of a long suffering woman who divorces her veteran husband, perhaps after many difficult years of marriage, sometimes for her own safety, only to find that it is the veteran's new partner who is entitled to the full pension on his death. Yet if she had simply separated, her right would have been preserved. As I understand it, this can result in two widows pensions being paid—one to the original separated wife and the other to any new de facto partner. </para><para>The notion of dependency also applies to children and, as we know, there is attached to the widows pension what is called a `domestic allowance' of $25 which, as I understand it, had its origins as a payment for children. It is not indexed but it has survived whether or not there are children being cared for. Because of this it is regarded by many as an intrinsic part of the war widows pension but, due to its history, it is treated separately and is not indexed. In the interests of simplification it would be better integrated into the whole pension and indexed. Certainly, in the face of family payments also available from Centrelink, it would seem to be a total anachronism in policy terms but it has nevertheless survived.</para><para>It is a great pity that the policy construct for war widows is so difficult because Australia as a nation has always honoured and respected the pain and loss of a loved one in war, and we have always honoured the promise to care for those left behind, commensurate with the values of the time. Those values, of course, have not changed but community circumstances have. The circumstances of 1914-18, which set the war widows pension in place, are simply no longer relevant. We do have a modern scheme, the Military Compensation Scheme, which does reflect these circumstances but, because of dual eligibility in limited circumstances, the two schemes interact, and interact badly. There are a number of issues here to which I will return in due course.</para><para>Having made that comment in passing, and having set out some of the factual background, let me return to the primary purpose of the bill—the indexation of the ISS. Whatever the intent may have been in 1986 to terminate war widows' access to social security benefits, and to freeze the rate then being paid, it is clear that unrestricted access to two streams of benefits—one from the VEA and the other from the Social Security Act—was difficult to justify in policy terms or in budgetary terms, simply because it contained an element of dual payment.</para><para>There should be no doubt, however, that we on this side fully support the notion that war widows are entitled to a level of compensation and support, in the event of the loss of their partner in the defence of the nation, over and above their peers, most of whom are on the age pension. This has been longstanding community policy, regardless of the fact that the probability of death from war-caused injuries diminishes rapidly with time, to a level now where many widows who are unsuccessful in establishing war causation feel aggrieved. It is clear now, though, that with the passing of time the difference between those war widows without extensive other income and their age pension peers is now an appropriate one and that indexation in the manner proposed in the bill is also appropriate. It is for that reason that Labor supports the bill. </para><para>Although incomplete, for reasons I will mention in a moment, it is in part also good policy. It reflects the respect and care promised to veterans that their loved ones would be looked after but does not treat them purely as an element within the welfare field. It recognises war widows as a special category of Australians to whom we all owe a debt and with a fixed additional benefit over their age/widowed peers. The decision not to amend the Social Security Act in the same way, and to thereby transfer widows to the Department of Veterans' Affairs, is similarly supported. We agree that wherever possible veterans should be serviced in a holistic way by the one responsible agency. Our support for this bill, however, should not be taken as an indication that all is well in the matter of care for war widows. There are some outstanding issues which need attending to.</para><para>The first, which has long been an issue for Legacy and the War Widows Guild, is the inclusion of rent assistance within the frozen rate. There are approximately 8,800 war widows renting privately and 4,300 renting publicly, with an unknown number not in receipt of income support whose accommodation details are unknown. Those renting privately, unlike anyone else in the community in comparable financial circumstances, can get no rent assistance at all. If we accept, as we do, that the erosion of the value of the ISS has now declined to a level where the combined value of the ISS and the war widows pension appropriately reflects the status of widows, the continuing inclusion of rent assistance within it becomes a new anomaly—to use the government's own hackneyed descriptor. What is more, it affects and discriminates against the most needy.</para><para>Then there is the nonpayment of ISS to widows who live overseas. Why they should be selected for such special discrimination is unknown, but there would seem to be little justification for it, except as a money saving device. Next, I repeat the point that I have made to most of the annual congresses of ex-service organisations in the last two months: namely, the plight of veterans' widows who are under 57 years of age and have no children. It is amazing that the needs of these women have gone unattended for so long when, in the last six years, over $2½ billion has been added to the veterans budget.</para><para>Take the case of a widow of a TPI who, we can assume, has cared for her husband for the term of their marriage—in some cases with accompanying harmful behaviour— with a long dependence on veterans benefits and has therefore been unable to accumulate savings and own a house or many other material assets of value and who, on his death, would be entitled only to the war widows pension and unable to get even Newstart from Centrelink. Such a person's income would fall from a joint value in excess of $1,400 per fortnight to just $446 per fortnight, and she would lose her concession card as well. It is ironic that, if she were in good health, she would in fact be $20 per fortnight better off if she did not seek the widows pension and the gold card but accepted the service pension at the single rate, rent assistance and Newstart, even with its harsh means test.</para><para>There may be up to 1,600 widows in this category and, no doubt, a reasonable proportion will fit the example I have just cited. Yes, they may have the gold card, but it is of no value if they healthy and it certainly does not buy the groceries. I mention this example not only because a small number of widows are doing it tougher than all of the others but also because it shows just how complex the issues are, simply because no attempt has ever been made to make the war widows pension mesh properly with the social security system.</para><para>The key point, though, is that this bill before us today effectively reverses the approach taken in 1986, which we should agree ought to be applied to all of the other limitations imposed at that time. For example, why should a young, healthy widow, with or without children, be precluded from access to Newstart and all the supporting training programs that go with it? Why should she be denied access to these other benefits simply because she is a war widow who, we now accept as a result of this bill, is entitled to a fixed means test benefit over and above that paid to her peers? This bill would have been an ideal opportunity to have done so and, if my numbers are right, it would cost very little—possibly less than the mobile phone bill for the Department of Veterans' Affairs. </para><para>Earlier in this speech I raised the question of whether we, as a parliament, could continue to consider the maze of complexity surrounding the war widows pension against the needs of women in modern society, and I suggested that it might be timely to draw a line to `grandmother' the existing policy, especially given that there is a modern equivalent. As I understand the government's proposal for a new single military compensation scheme, due to the differences between the two schemes and the differing values of the VEA pension and the MCRS lump sum, particularly for the younger widows, a choice ought to be offered on which widows could decide, on receipt of financial advice, depending on their financial circumstances.</para><para>As we know, lump sums are very attractive to young widows, as they provide the capital for them to re-establish their lives. But by choosing the lump sum over a pension they may, over their life, lose out simply because the pension, as a tax free, indexed and non-means tested benefit, is worth more. This is not a fair choice and, given the grudging acceptance now being given by the government to structured settlements, the question must now surely be why the new military compensation scheme cannot also offer a benefit with perhaps a minimum pension to provide ongoing income support and prevent dissipation as well as a lump sum, with the mix to be negotiated on financial advice but at the same time using actuarial advice to ensure that the benefit taken is no less than that currently available.</para><para>I make this suggestion in clear recognition that the government is in the throes of drafting a new scheme but also in recognition that what I have said today clearly illustrates that the continuation of the current war widows pension under the VEA is simply not viable, particularly for the new generation of the ADF. It is full of injustice for those currently entitled and simply should not be extended. Moreover it is of the utmost importance, when considering the form of war widows benefit in the future, that the policy rationale be stated clearly and in terms consistent with the totality of veterans policy and with an eye to the social security safety net as well. The government must clearly delineate those portions which are compensatory for loss and those which are of an income support nature, based on the current superannuation scheme. As one homogeneous scheme, linkages with the VEA and all of the offsetting which now bedevils ex-service personnel and veterans must be avoided at all costs. The opposition supports the bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>3989</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Bishop for his comments and his support for the Minister for Veterans' Affairs, Mrs Vale, and the work she is doing.

It is worth noting that the Veterans' Entitlements Act is a very complex and difficult piece of legislation to come to grips with simply because it effectively contains over 80 years of law dealing with the care and recognition of veterans throughout a period of enormous change in Australian society. In this period we have had two major world conflagrations, the second of which saw Australia attacked directly for the first time, with mass mobilisation. Since then we have served with the United Nations in Korea and the British during the Malayan crisis, in the Indonesian confrontation, and with the US in Vietnam, the Gulf and now Afghanistan. We have also joined with the UN in a wide range of peacekeeping missions all around the world, the last of which has been in East Timor. </para></talk.start><para>In this time, society has changed enormously, and you do not have to look very far in the veterans jurisdiction to find examples of discriminatory or contradictory policies which appear to have arisen more by budgetary considerations than by any principle of equity or consistency. Because of this complexity, it is therefore not the least bit surprising that from time to time we are presented with amendments such as those in this bill which are corrections to outcomes unforeseen at the time of the original legislation. In fact, one could well conclude that it is time that we drew a line and started again, which I understand the government is planning by the drafting of a new military compensation scheme. But the trouble is that the current act will continue to operate while ever there are people alive with entitlements granted by it. No doubt, we will continue to see complex amendments coming into the parliament to fix an unintended shortcoming or, more to the point, to provide consistency with the Social Security Act where there seems to be a capacity to overlook the linkages with the Veterans' Entitlements Act far too often.</para><para>Going beyond the context of the bill then, its provisions are largely of the nature I have described, although I must say that they are so numerous and detailed that it is almost impossible to make reference to all of them. In the majority of amendments the changes proposed are of a purely technical nature and are necessary to clarify or to make terminology consistent. In some cases there have been oversights where people have been affected unintentionally and, so again, corrections need to be made. It is worth noting that in some cases the bureaucracy does seem to be able to manage by way of ex gratia payments or simply by turning a blind eye. For this reason alone, the law needs to be corrected, though this is long overdue. We have no quibble with this type of amendment, and so I will not go through the detail as it is set out in the explanatory memorandum.</para><para>Before proceeding to make some specific remarks on a few items in the bill, however, I wish to make a point about the government's attitude to this legislation and, indeed, to other legislation where ministers' second reading speeches and explanatory memorandums seem to regard the legislative process as a rubber stamp—that it is all too complex to explain and that any policy implications should be swept under the carpet and ignored. This bill is a good case in point because there are a number of serious policy and administrative issues which are simply not referred to.</para><para>The first policy issue arises, in fact, with the very first amendment proposed in this bill, as set out in schedule 1, which deals with changes to the income support supplement for war widows and widowers. These amendments, in essence, are simply to correct drafting omissions made at the time the income support supplement was legislated, both in the Social Security Act and in the Veterans' Entitlements Act, in that the policy being applied at the time was that war widows' access to social security benefits was severely limited. Those in payment for the ISS thereafter were to have no access to benefits, including the disability support pension, unemployment benefits—now known as Newstart—or any other benefit. All rates payable at the time were frozen.</para><para>We have no quibble with the need to make sure that the intended policy is correctly provided for in the legislation—and hence this long list of drafting amendments—but what we must make clear right now is that the policy itself is flawed and is, in fact, being reversed in part by other legislation currently before the parliament. Here I refer to the <inline ref="R1576">Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment (2002 Budget Measures) Bill 2002</inline>, which was dealt with just a few moments ago. Yet nowhere in the minister's second reading speech for either bill is this referred to—nor is mention made that the second bill effectively reverses in part the policy basis of the ISS as it was introduced.</para><para>Whatever the reasons behind the 1986 amendments which have brought us to this bill today, we in the Labor Party agree that war widows enjoy a traditional place in Australian veterans law whereby their unique loss is worthy of recognition, in addition to their separate needs for support from the social security system. It should be noted, however, that in supporting the bill we also agree with the government that, given the history of the war widows pension and the linkage with the social security system, there should be a trade-off when it comes to income support. It is not appropriate that war widows should have full access to both. </para><para>However, there is more to it than this because this bill seeks to alter only one part of the suite of 1986 measures. In short, we can see no logical reason why war widows in receipt of a war widows pension, which recognises the death of their husband due to war-caused injury or disease, should not be able to access benefits other than the ISS, particularly Newstart with which comes access to training and the work force. We accept it should be fully means tested, but to change only part of the 1986 policy, as indexation of the ISS does, is to continue the attitude that war widows should have no access to any other program. This is, in fact, a penalty for all war widows under the age of 57 and should not be tolerated.</para><para>Putting that major point of criticism aside, however, we accept that, for technical reasons alone, the amendments in schedules 1 and 2 of the bill are necessary to correctly express this flawed policy in the Social Security Act and the Social Security (Administration) Act. Schedule 3 of the bill amending the Aged Care (Consequential Provisions) Act also contains technical amendments to definitions of `in care', which are supported and therefore need no elaboration beyond that set out in the explanatory memorandum. Schedule 4 contains a minor amendment worthy of note in that it corrects an earlier amendment providing for the removal of rent assistance to those sharing public housing which is already subsidised. This effectively closes that loophole and is supported, as it was in the first instance. Schedule 5 also makes a minor amendment to give effect to an earlier amendment transferring carers' allowances from the VEA to the Social Security Act. This amendment corrects another misdescription to allow that to happen and is similarly supported. Schedule 6 contains a wide range of technical amendments to correct previous misdescriptions, invalid references and incorrect expressions. These do not warrant further comment.</para><para>There are no policy implications except on two specific matters which I need to mention. The first of these is item 51, which corrects an inconsistency within the VEA whereby third-party compensation paid to a widow is treated differently within two separate sections of the act, in that there is a difference in the way the cause of death is described. The original provision of the act was that, where there is a third-party settlement to a widow for the death of her husband—for example, from a car accident—the widow's pension was offset in full or in part. A later amendment to another section incorrectly limited this offset to a death which was defence caused. This clearly was inconsistent and contrary to policy, and so now needs to be rectified.</para><para>The second is a provision to be inserted into a number of sections of the act, allowing for the easier incorporation of non-legislative external documents or other delegated legislation into statutory instruments governing the operation of some benefit schemes in the VEA. I refer here specifically to items 20, 55, 59, 63, 66 and 68. These amendments provide that changes made in external instruments will flow through automatically to the VEA where relevant thus avoiding the need for separate regulatory processes on every occasion. </para><para>This may seem to be a practical proposal to reduce the amount of work and the need for subordinate legislation, but my concerns are twofold. First, this is a device with little precedent, yet it has not been acknowledged at all in the minister's second reading speech, nor is it dealt with adequately in the explanatory memorandum. At face value these amendments appear vague, referring to external documents `existing from time to time' and to those which might `not yet exist'. In terms of the scrutiny of delegated legislation the parliament must in every instance be aware of and approve, even by default, changes to regulation and delegated authority, particularly for budgetary consequences, and also ensure that policy is not being altered by stealth. Second, the automatic provision for flow-on from one instrument or external document to another within the Veterans' portfolio is something to be watched carefully. I draw the attention of the clerks and the Regulations and Ordinances Committee to this matter for ongoing scrutiny and consideration. Accordingly, I seek leave to have incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the specific advice provided to me by the minister, dated 23 April 2002, as a matter of record. </para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows—</inline></para><para>MINISTER FOR VETERANS' AFFAIRS</para><para>MINISTER ASSISTING THE MINISTER FOR DEFENCE</para><para>Senator Mark Bishop</para><para>Shadow Minister for Veterans' Affairs Parliament House</para><para>CANBERRA ACT 2600</para><para>Dear Senator Bishop</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (No. 1) 2002</inline></para><para>I refer to the meeting on 12 April 2002 between our advisers and departmental officers that included a discussion about the above Bill.

The purpose of this Paper is to provide additional information on a number of clauses contained in the Veterans' Affairs Legislation Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 (`the Bill'). Those clauses have already been explained in the Explanatory Memorandum that accompanies the Bill.</para><para>2. The impetus for this document arose out of concerns being expressed by the veteran community about the clauses in question. It is anticipated that this document will be widely published to all interested parties in an attempt to address any concerns and to ensure that any debate is fully informed.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">What clauses are we talking about?</inline></para><para>3. The clauses in the Bill that have apparently given rise to some concern can loosely be described as “Incorporation by Reference” provisions. There are seven of these clauses in the Bill. They all have the same purpose which is to enable certain Instruments made under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 (`the VEA') to be able to incorporate documents in force from time to time.</para><para>4. The clauses involved are all contained in Schedule 6 to the Bill and involve:</para><para>·	item 20—which amends section 29 of the VEA which deals with the “Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions”;</para><para>·	item 55—which amends section 90 of the VEA which deals with the “Treatment Principles”;</para><para>·	item 58—which amends section 90A of the VEA which deals with the “Repatriation Private Patient Principles”;</para><para>·	item 59—which amends section 91 of the VEA which deals with the “Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme”;</para><para>·	item 63—which amends section 105 of the VEA which deals with the “Vehicle Assistance Scheme”;</para><para>·	item 66—which amends section 115B of the VEA which deals with the “Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme”; and</para><para>·	item 68—which amends section 117 of the VEA which deals with the “Veterans' Children Education Scheme”.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Why do we want to incorporate documents into Instruments?</inline></para><para>5. Usually legislation is self-contained and set out in one text. But if all the relevant aspects of a piece of legislation were contained in the one document it could become unwieldy and virtually impossible to use. To overcome these problems it is often convenient to set out brief items in the body of the legislation and refer to the more detailed items as being contained in other documents. This practice is known as incorporation by reference.</para><para>6. An example of the above practice is where other legislation is referred to in the primary document. For example, the “Treatment Principles” made under section 90 of the VEA incorporate by reference the Medicare Benefits Schedule made under the Health Insurance Act 1973. A further example is where an Australian Standard is being referred to in legislation. The relevant legislation will say that an object or good is to comply with AS 12345, but the legislation will not contain the full text of the Australian Standard because it is voluminous. The document containing the detailed requirements of the standard will not be included in the legislation.</para><para>7. By referring to other documents in the main body of the legislation, the legal principle is that these other documents then become incorporated by reference into the main body of the legislation and become part of the legislation. This is a standard legislative procedure that is utilised in many pieces of legislation and is currently used in Instruments made under the VEA.</para><para>8. However, while it is permissible for Instruments to incorporate documents by reference, there is a rule that, generally speaking, such external documents are “frozen in time”. Thus, if an Instrument refers to Australian Standard 12345 then only the terms of that Standard as they existed at the time the relevant Instrument was made are incorporated into the Instrument. This results in any subsequent amendment to the Standard not being part of the Instrument. In order to make the amended Standard part of the Instrument, the Instrument would need to be amended to refer to the new amended Standard. The rule governing the incorporation of documents into Instruments is contained in section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 (`the AIA')</para><para>9. The primary reason for the rule relating to the incorporation of documents is that the law should be certain and if Instruments refer to documents that keep changing then those affected by the Instrument might have difficulty in learning of those changes (see Chapters 22 and 24 in “Delegated Legislation in Australia” by Pearce and Argument, 2”d Edition, Butterworths).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The rule in the AIA can be very inconvenient in some circumstances</inline></para><para>10. The AIA recognises that the rule can operate negatively and hinder effective administration so it provides an override mechanism. It allows for a Statute to provide that an Instrument made under the Statute can incorporate documents in force from time to time (ie. amended) and that is what is proposed to be done to the VEA by this Bill. Put simply, the purpose of the provisions of the Bill under discussion is to override section 49A of the AIA which prohibits Instruments from incorporating non-legislative documents in force from time to time.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Will veterans be disadvantaged in any way?</inline></para><para>11. Veterans will NOT be disadvantaged by these provisions. Repatriation Law is not regulatory law in the sense that the activities of veterans are regulated. Rather; Repatriation Law mainly regulates the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA) and the Repatriation Commission in their dealings with veterans meaning that Repatriation Law is more an internal-working tool for DVA/Commission than a body of rules that veterans must observe. Thus, if an incorporated document is amended and becomes part of an Instrument, it is highly unlikely that a veteran will be disadvantaged in some way because he or she does not have immediate access to the changed document.</para><para>12. In addition, the invariable practice of both DVA and the Commission is to ensure that information relating to eligibility and entitlements is widely published. Accordingly, if the Instrument was to include a reference to a document that was not widely available, DVA would undertake to make the document available through either an office of the Department or through the Department's Internet Site.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">What about service providers?</inline></para><para>13. Unlike veterans, service providers are regulated by Repatriation Law and would need to know about changes to incorporated documents. However, it is not envisaged that any difficulties will arise in this regard and this assumption is based on current DVA arrangements. Under these arrangements, service providers are notified promptly of any changes that affect them and the system works well. This is particularly the case as most service providers also have contractual obligations with DVA and the Commission. These contracts and service agreements contain mechanisms for the notification and variation of the terms of the agreements. Unless these mechanisms are complied with, any such variation would not be legally effective. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">How could the public generally be aware of changed incorporated documents?</inline></para><para>14.A11 of DVA's legislation, including Instruments, are available on the DVA Internet Home Page and consideration is being given to providing links on that page to documents incorporated in DVA Instruments so that a member of the public will always have access to a changed incorporated document.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">What other pieces of legislation incorporate documents in force from time to time?</inline></para><para>15. Other legislation which enables the incorporation of non-legislative documents that are in force from time to time include:</para><para>·	Public Service Act 1999 (section 23)</para><para>·	Radiocommunications Act 1992 (section 314A)</para><para>·	Telecommunications Act 1997 (section 589)</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">What are the VEA Instruments that will incorporate documents in force from time to time?</inline></para><para>16. Only the following seven Instruments identified in the Bill will be able to incorporate non-legislative documents in force from time to time. These Instruments are all made by the Commission, approved by the Minister and are required to be tabled before both Houses of the Parliament. The Instruments are:</para><para>·	The Guide to the Assessment of Rates of Veterans' Pensions made under section 29 of the VEA;</para><para>·	The Treatment Principles made under section 90 of the VEA;</para><para>·	The Repatriation Private Patient Principles made under section 90A of the VEA;</para><para>·	The Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme made under section 91 of the VEA;</para><para>·	The Vehicle Assistance Scheme made under section 105 of the VEA; </para><para>·	The Veterans' Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme made under section 115B of the VEA; and</para><para>·	The Veterans' Children Education Scheme made under section 117 of the VEA.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">What sort of documents will be incorporated from time to time in these Instruments?</inline></para><para>17. At present it is envisaged that only two of the abovementioned Instruments will incorporate non-legislative documents in force from time to time. However, it is considered that the other Instruments should also have that facility to incorporate such documents.</para><para>18. The two Instruments that are currently proposed to incorporate documents in force from time to time are the Treatment Principles and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>19. The Treatment Principles are intended to incorporate at least the following documents as in force from time to time:</para><para>·	the American Psychiatric Association's Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, being the standard for assessing post-traumatic stress disorder. Paragraph 2.4.2A currently only incorporates the 4h Edition;</para><para>·	Memorandum of Understanding between the Commonwealth, the Repatriation Commission and the Australian Medical Association Ltd setting out, among other things, doctor's fees. Currently only the MOU of 10 December 1995 is incorporated;</para><para>·	Notes for Local Medical Officers setting out the terms for doctors' contracts with the Repatriation Commission. Currently only the Notes of December 1995 are incorporated (see paragraph 4.1.2);</para><para>·	Dental Officer Scheme setting out the terms for dentists' contracts with the Repatriation Commission. Currently only the conditions in force at 1 June 1993 are incorporated (see paragraph 5.1.2);</para><para>·	Dental Schedules setting out the dental services that may be provided to veterans etc (see paragraph 5.2.1);</para><para>·	Guidelines for the Provision of Community Nursing Care which contain the standards of care to be provided. Currently only the Guidelines in force at 1 May 2001 are incorporated (see paragraphs 7.3.2 and 7.3.5);</para><para>·	The Schedule of Prescribable Items for optometrical services (see paragraph 7.4.2);</para><para>·	Rehabilitation Appliance Schedule setting out the appliances that may be provided to veterans etc to assist with their rehabilitation;</para><para>·	The Schedule of Prescribable Items for visual aids (see paragraph 11.4.1);</para><para>20. The Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is intended to incorporate at least the following documents as in force from time to time:</para><para>·	Schedule of Pharmaceutical Benefits for Approved Pharmacists and Medical Practitioners dated 1 February 2002 setting out, among other things, notices to doctors and pharmacists; </para><para>·	Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Schedule dated 1 February 2002 setting out the Pharmaceutical Benefits that may be prescribed and supplied to veterans etc.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">How would the Instruments refer to the incorporated documents?</inline></para><para>21. It is envisaged that the Treatment Principles and the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme would be amended in a manner similar to that described in Attachment A. In essence, the incorporated document would need to be identified with sufficient certainty to enable each document and its contents to be readily identified.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">How do you incorporate a document that “does not yet exist”?</inline></para><para>22. This power would be used to incorporate a draft or interim document before it has been formally made. For example, in relation to Australian Standards, there is a process that must by followed before a new Standard is said to formally exist. Interim Standards can exist that are yet to be formally made by Standards Australia. Similarly, in relation to the Medicare Benefits Schedule, DVA has been made aware of some recommendations made by the Medicare Benefits Advisory Committee to amend the Medicare Benefits Schedule to include a new item. The Commission may wish to include the new item for treatment to veterans prior to its inclusion in the Medicare Benefits Schedule. The terms of the proposed amendment contained in the Bill would enable this to be actioned.</para><para>23. The common law rules relating to “uncertainty” impact on the exercise of this power. Clearly the Commission could not make an Instrument that referred to a document that could not be identified or the terms of which could not be ascertained. The incorporated document would need to be identified with some degree of detail and be made available to the public. This would be achieved through either direct publication by DVA or via the DVA Internet Site.</para><para>Conclusion</para><para>24. The circumstances involving the relevant DVA Instruments are such that it is appropriate for the rule in section 49A of the Acts Interpretation Act 1901 to be overridden. Those circumstances being:</para><para>·	the need to provide new services to veterans quickly without having to amend the relevant Instrument to refer to an updated incorporated document;</para><para>·	the fact that Repatriation Law does not regulate the activities of veterans etc meaning that they are unlikely to be disadvantaged by not being aware of changed incorporated documents;</para><para>·	the effective arrangements in place for informing service-providers (who are regulated by Repatriation Law) of changed incorporated documents; and</para><para>·	the proposal to publicise incorporated documents on DVA's Internet Site.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Further queries</inline></para><para>25.

The Australian Democrats will not be opposing the <inline ref="R1531">Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety (Licence Charges) Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. We acknowledge that this bill confirms the practice of the last three years—that Commonwealth agencies, including CSIRO, the Australian National University and ANSTO, are liable for licence charges imposed by ARPANSA. However, while the Democrats will accede to the government's request that this legislation be treated as non-controversial, the bill does draw attention to some issues on which my colleague Senator Allison and I would like to briefly touch.</para></talk.start><para>In 1998 ARPANSA was given the responsibility for regulating and licensing nuclear installations and radiation sources. However, we are aware that a number of agencies have raised concerns—directly with us and with others—that the regulatory process has become more bureaucratic and legalistic and that the technical capacity has diminished. It has been put to us that in some instances licence costs have risen five- to tenfold. I think we all recognise that when the regulator is expected to charge licences at full cost recovery there may be a perception of a conflict of interest between information sought and charges determined.</para><para>I also understand that there may be deficiencies in timely processing of licences such that some activities may be carried out while technically unlicensed due to delays. There are delays, in some instances, of up to two years in the processing of licensing applications or renewals. I am sure that the minister and all members of the chamber would be concerned to hear that due to such delays you actually have processes being undertaken while licences have not been approved. Of course, it can be expected that organisations that are regulated may not be entirely happy in all circumstances with the regulator. I suspect that is a fact of life. Nevertheless, we do not believe that these concerns are trivial, because they are being voiced by organisations that we consider are quite credible. </para><para>I doubt that anyone in this chamber would dispute the need for careful regulation of nuclear and radiation facilities, practices, research and development. Obviously, that is something that the Australian Democrats have expressed concerns about on many occasions over the years. It is worth remembering that the object of the act, of ARPANSA, is to protect the health and safety of people and to protect the environment from harmful effects of radiation—all good objectives. In view of these concerns, and also because this regulatory framework has been in place for some years now, the Democrats believe that it is appropriate for a cool-headed examination of ARPANSA's licensing processes.</para><para>There are, of course, a number of options available to the Senate, including, for instance, a referral to a committee. Before the government gasps at that suggestion, I will say that on balance the Democrats believe a better option, a good option, is to request that the Australian National Audit Office audit ARPANSA's licensing processes. We are confident, and I am sure that all in this chamber would be confident, that the ANAO's professional and independent eye is well suited for such an examination. Accordingly, I move the second reading amendment standing in my name and urge all senators to support the amendment:</para><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para></quote><para>“but the Senate notes concerns with the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency's licensing processes and requests the Australian National Audit Office audit the agency's:</para><para>(a)	process and method of determining licence applications; </para><para>(b)	scheduling and renewing;</para><para>(c)	setting of licence charges;</para><para>(d)	extent of unlicensed activities resulting from delays in licence processing; and</para><para>(e)	the impact of delays, if any, on research and development in Australia.</para><para>The amendment essentially asks for ARPANSA's licensing processes to be audited by the ANAO.

The opposition will support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Stott Despoja today. Perhaps I should briefly explain why that is the case. The matters that she raises go to the issue of ARPANSA's role in the licensing processes, which of course has a direct impact on the Lucas Heights reactor. A construction licence has been granted for that reactor, and it will of course require an operating licence. The second reading amendment expresses an opinion that ARPANSA should not issue an operating licence until such time as there has been a resolution of the issue of the storage of intermediate level nuclear waste generated by the reactor itself.</para></talk.start><para>The nature of ARPANSA is that it is an independent statutory authority, and therefore I think it is inappropriate that there be an approach whereby a prescription in those terms be issued by this chamber. However, it is important to note that Dr John Loy, the CEO of ARPANSA, has recently indicated that, in his view, there should not be an operating licence granted for the new reactor at Lucas Heights until there has been substantial progress towards the resolution of the waste issue. That is an entirely appropriate response. Dr Loy's statements are absolutely consistent with his general responsibilities in regard to the health and safety of the people of this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—Senator Allison, are you standing on a point of order?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, it is not exactly a point of order, but I did want to point out to Senator Carr that I think he is speaking on the second second reading amendment, on mine.

I have the wrong Democrat senator moving the amendment. I understand that that could be a difficulty at this time. I indicate my support for the amendment that I have been referring to. As this is so-called non-controversial legislation, I am anxious to deal with some other matters as well. We are supporting the amendment on the basis that we acknowledge that ARPANSA is an independent statutory authority and that the chief executive officer has indicated his concern about the failure to deal with the waste issue. We are concerned that there are substantial matters to be resolved. The recent dispute in South Australia with the South Australian government highlights the difficulties in regard to the lower level waste, let alone the questions that are now emerging about the failure of the federal government to have a nuclear waste strategy across Australia. So on those bases we accept the amendment.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—What are you doing with Senator Stott Despoja's amendment?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—It would be a good idea if I actually had a look at it before I tell you that.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Well, that means you're agin it; so that's good.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>—I thought you told us you would be supporting it.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESI-DENT</name></talker><para>—We cannot do business like this.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>—Senator Stott Despoja, the opposition will be supporting that amendment.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>3999</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think Senator Carr has made most of the remarks that I would have made on behalf of the Democrats. I did intend to be very brief, in any case. The first of my amendments should be familiar to the ALP, since I think it was the opposition that raised it in the first place. It is important that the government listen to the chief executive officer of ARPANSA and that we have some idea of how we are going to deal with the spent fuel, how we are going to turn it into reasonable waste form. As Senator Carr says, this government's strategy on waste with regard to Lucas Heights is pretty much a shambles. That, in our view, should all have been dealt with well before we got to the point of granting a construction licence or anything else on Lucas Heights. </para></talk.start><para>Clearly, we have a proposal from the government for low level waste which is not accepted by the state government in South Australia and is certainly contrary to the Democrats' view of what should happen with low level waste. So we again use this opportunity to point out to the government that this is not good practice and we would like to see a strategy put in place that we can all agree with. The safety, storage and transportation of nuclear materials associated with the new reactor need to be resolved. The Democrats very much want to see the government resolve those matters before operating licences are issued. I do not think we can make that point more strongly than we have done in the past. This is an important second reading amendment, and I urge senators to support it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—Senator Allison, I understand you are foreshadowing your amendment, to be discussed after Senator Stott Despoja's amendment.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name></talker><para>—I will not make any further remarks on my amendment and I will move it at the appropriate time.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>3999</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I can understand the philosophical bent of the movers of the two amendments and of Senator Carr and some of his colleagues, and it is all very interesting in a debating, chatty sort of way. But this bill is actually about the collection of fees and charges from Commonwealth agencies that ARPANSA regulates. Other issues are not really relevant to this bill even though they might, as I say, be interesting for a debate or chat at some time. Consequently, the government will not support either of the second reading amendments.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Stott Despoja's amendment requests the Australian National Audit Office to audit ARPANSA's licensing processes. The government is of the view that the basis for this proposal is flawed. ARPANSA received some 137 applications for licences, 80 of these were made during the first few months of operation of the new regulatory system, and 109 licences have now been issued. Given this licensing workload, priorities needed to be applied to the consideration of licence applications. The government considers that these priorities were decided fairly and appropriately. The government also considers that the level of ARPANSA's fees reflects its policy of full cost recovery. This approach is realistic, and I emphasise that it is what was expected when the ARPANSA bill was passed by the parliament. Given that the basis for this audit proposal is flawed, the government cannot support the second reading amendment. However, this is not to say that the government does not support the scrutiny of the processes of regulatory bodies such as ARPANSA. The government does not object to the ANAO undertaking an audit of ARPANSA in the future if the Audit Office identifies the need for such an audit.</para><para>The government also opposes the second reading amendment to be moved by Senator Allison. The amendment seeks to interfere with ARPANSA's regulatory oversight of the replacement research reactor. The licensing process used by the CEO of ARPANSA to consider matters such as those raised in the amendment was actually agreed to by the Senate when it passed the ARPANSA act. We see that the Democrats are now not prepared to accept the decision made under the act, and I regret to say that the Labor Party appears to be in the same position. As the Senate is aware, the CEO of ARPANSA has issued a facility licence for the construction of the replacement research reactor. The CEO gave consideration to the issues of spent fuel management and radioactive waste management in reaching his decision to issue the licences. </para><para>Consistent with the regulatory approach taken in the act, these issues will continue to be monitored and considered by the CEO of ARPANSA as and when necessary. I emphasise that this bill simply involves minor clarification of the powers of ARPANSA to collect fees and charges, and I commend the bill to the Senate. I indicate that, because of time constraints, we will not be dividing on the second reading amendments but, again, I emphasise that the government opposes both of them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—The question is that the second reading amendment moved by Senator Stott Despoja be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>4000</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move the Democrats second reading amendment, as circulated on sheet 2538:</para></talk.start><quote><para>At the end of the motion, add:</para></quote><para>“but the Senate:</para><para>(a)	notes the view of the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Agency (ARPANSA) that arrangements for taking the spent fuel and turning it into a reasonable waste form needs to be absolutely clear before the new reactor at Lucas Heights commences operations, and there needs to be clear progress on siting a store for the waste that returns to Australia; and</para><para>(b)	is of the opinion that until all matters relating to safety, storage and transportation of nuclear materials associated with the new reactor at Lucas Heights are resolved, no operating licence related to the new reactor at Lucas Heights should be issued by the agency”.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Original question, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>4000</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill passed through its remaining stages without amendment or debate.</para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>PLANT BREEDER'S RIGHTS AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4000</page.no><id.no>S347</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4000</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 13 March, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Patterson</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>4000</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The purpose of the <inline ref="S347">Plant Breeder's Rights Amendment Bill 2002</inline> is to amend the Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 to clarify the rights of plant breeders in certain circumstances where public interest restrictions are imposed. The provisions of the bill also enhance the access of breeders to the Plant Breeder's Rights Scheme and improve the administration of the act and the scheme.</para></talk.start><para>While the opposition supports the bill, I will seek clarification on a number of points in the committee stage of the debate. I have advised the minister of the issues I wish to raise. The amendments contained in this bill are predominantly administrative and include a significant clarification to section 18 of the act. Section 11 of the act establishes the right of breeders to disallow certain acts of production and other activities in relation to a plant variety. Section 18 was designed to acknowledge public interest concerns regarding the limitations that breeders can place on the use of their propagating material. For example, it is not in the public interest to allow breeders to prevent the making of food staples such as bread from grain. However, the current section 18 has been interpreted such that it has denied plant breeders the right to deny any normal commercial activity in respect of their propagating material. This was not the intention of the legislation and, accordingly, the bill provides for the deletion of section 18 and the insertion of a new section that allows for certain defined public interest restrictions.</para><para>The new provisions provide that a breeder is able to exercise his or her right of authorisation of acts under section 11 except where the right is restricted by Commonwealth, state or territory legislation. Where such restrictions apply, equitable remuneration must be paid to the breeder—a provision that is consistent with Australia's obligations under the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 1991. The bill also clarifies the power of the minister under section 49 to impose conditions on existing and proposed breeders' rights on public interest grounds. The Plant Breeder's Rights Act 1994 is based on Australia's membership of the International Convention for the Protection of New Varieties of Plants 1991. This is a United Nations multilateral agreement establishing an internationally harmonised regime for exclusive intellectual property relating to new plant varieties. The act is a form of patent legislation that coexists with other laws. The evolution of this legislation commenced in the 1970s and has been the subject of public debate over many years. The Fraser government attempted to push a plant varieties scheme through the parliament in 1981. That scheme was considered deficient. It was left to the Senate to work through many of the unresolved issues—a situation not unfamiliar to senators under the current coalition government. </para><para>The issue of plant breeders' rights was then the subject of an exhaustive inquiry by the then Senate Standing Committee on Natural Resources, the committee handing down its report in May 1984. It recommended that a plant varieties rights scheme be established and that legislation be drafted to conform with the 1978 UN convention relating to new varieties of plants. The committee also recommended that the then Department of Primary Industries closely examine all the evidence that was critical of the original bill. The end result of that proper and exhaustive process was the enactment of the Plant Variety Rights Act 1987. That act enabled plant breeders to apply for and receive proprietary rights for new varieties of plants they developed. It was designed to stimulate plant breeding in Australia for both our domestic industries and export.</para><para>Despite the exhaustive consultation that preceded the passage of this legislation through the parliament, significant uncertainty about the impact of the scheme remained in some sections of the community. Concerns remained about the impact on the developing world, management of worldwide plant genetic resources, the ownership of essential food resources, market structures and basic consumer interests. There is a not dissimilar debate under way in relation to the use of genetically modified organisms in agriculture. While there is a general view that the potential benefits of GMOs are considerable, there is significant concern that the potential risk of GMO use might outweigh those benefits. I will come back to the matter of GMO policy and the mismanagement of the issue by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Warren Truss, shortly.</para><para>Proprietary rights are designed to provide plant breeders, both public and private, with a means of recouping some of the development costs incurred in the breeding of new plant varieties. Plant breeders' rights are exclusive commercial rights to a registered variety of seed and are a form of intellectual property similar to patents and copyright. The Plant Breeder's Rights Scheme seeks to encourage innovation and give innovators legal protection from commercial exploitation of their products by other parties. It is an essential protection for an industry that drives domestic industry development and generates export income of $100 million per annum. Ongoing innovation in the seeds industry, driving the development and commercialisation of new seed varieties, is the key to sustaining our major rural industries. We must innovate or perish.</para><para>The recently formed Australian Seeds Authority is a nonprofit organisation established to manage seed certification and accreditation in Australia. The establishment of the Australian Seeds Authority is an important step in the evolution of the Australian seed industry and will underpin development of this emerging rural industry. In addition to seed certification, the Australian Seeds Authority is responsible for matters relating to international seed trade and the development and implementation of an industry-wide quality assurance system. I acknowledge the work of the Grains Council of Australia, the Seed Industry Association of Australia, state governments and the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry in its establishment.</para><para>A few weeks ago, I described the Howard government as `genetically uncoordinated' in its approach to the regulation of gene technology. The Gene Technology Regulator is currently considering applications for the commercial release of GM canola. It is not appropriate for me to use this debate to comment on matters before the regulator, but I do want to note the inconsistent approach of the government to matters of seed technology management. Last year, the minister for agriculture announced a three-year project to examine the feasibility of segregating GM products across supply chains. The problem for Mr Truss and Australian agriculture is that this issue needs to be addressed long before Mr Truss's study delivers any findings. While Mr Truss pretends this matter can wait until long after he has been removed from his portfolio, state governments, industry and the community must grapple with these complex issues now. In this respect, I want to commend the Gene Technology Grains Committee for the work it has done in developing draft guidelines on the incorporation of GM technology into Australian farming systems. The Plant Breeder's Rights Scheme was introduced to promote investment, innovation and development in the Australian seed industry. The leadership demonstrated by previous governments in this area ought to be replicated in the area of gene technology today. </para><para>I have some questions relating to the impact of Australia's international treaty obligations on the Australian seed industry, questions that go to the heart of the regime managed by the Plant Breeder's Rights Act as amended by the bill before the Senate. My questions concern the decision taken by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, to sign the International Treaty on Plant Genetic Resources for Food and Agriculture at the UN food and agriculture summit on world hunger in Rome this year. Can the minister advise whether this treaty requires Australian farmers to pay the United Nations a share of profits from crops grown from seeds stored in a global seed bank? Does the treaty establish a worldwide seed saver network designed to protect biodiversity and give developing countries access to new seed varieties? As the government refused to sign this treaty between 1996 and 2001, what was the basis of Mr Truss's change of mind in June this year? According to an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 10 June this year, the minister had a number of concerns about the transfer of genetic assets under the treaty but decided it was better to be involved to protect Australia's interests. Can the minister advise the Senate of the details of those concerns?</para><para>The same press article reported that the United States and Japan have refused to become parties to the treaty. Has the minister made himself aware of the position of the United States and Japan and, if so, what is the position of these major seed technology innovators? It appears that decisions will be made by the United States and Japan about a range of seed technology issues outside the architecture of the treaty. Clearly, Australia's involvement in the consideration of these issues by the United States and Japan will be limited. Can the minister explain the decision making processes under the treaty and the opportunities for signatories to have input into those processes?</para><para>I am also interested in the treaty's royalty program. I understand that, at the time of signing the treaty, the royalty details were not established. Have the details of the royalties and how they will be distributed yet been determined? If so, what are the details? Mr Truss is reported as saying that Australian plant breeders will profit from the new system because they can access foreign crops from the seed bank. I assume that they will have to pay for that access and I seek advice on how that access will work. I trust that the minister at the table who responds to the second reading debate—whoever it is—will assist me in better understanding the operation of Australia's seed technology regime by seeking answers to the queries that I have raised.</para><para>However, I am pleased to indicate Labor's support for improvements to the Plant Breeder's Rights Act that will clarify breeders' rights, enhance access to the Plant Breeder's Rights Scheme and improve its administration. I have previously foreshadowed my desire to seek clarification on some technical aspects of the amendments and I will do so at the next stage of the debate. I am advised that the Australian Democrats are proposing some amendments to the bill. We have not yet had an opportunity to see the detail of those amendments, but we will consider them when they are available. </para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Macdonald</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SPACE ACTIVITIES AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>4003</page.no><id.no>R1472</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>4003</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed from 19 June, on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ian Campbell</inline>:</para><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>4003</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, I understood that there were to be speakers, but no-one seems to be interested.

He would have also told the Senate about the work that the squadron is doing, because, as I recall it, I set that out in the answer to him. There is considerable work in relation to the development of the aircraft—most of which are now already at Nowra—and the fitting of the various weapon systems and so forth. I would best suggest that he visits the establishment and speaks to the military personnel that are engaged in doing that work.

As he would be aware, I have already asked him for authority to visit the centre. But the question remains: why do we have an operational squadron without access to any helicopters in which to fly? It seems a pretty basic question that the minister has not answered. Minister, I would also like you to confirm that the government has withheld only $720,000 out of a contract of $800 million to Kaman. Is this the government's version of getting tough with the supplier when they have clearly failed to deliver in accordance with the $1 billion contract? Surely withholding only $720,000 is not putting the sort of pressure on that will give some value to taxpayers over this highly bungled contract.

In relation to the contracts, I remind the Senate that, although delivery is very late, the contract is still within budget. What we have been able to do, however, is renegotiate the payment schedule to better reflect the degree of capability that has been delivered.

It is not the sort of thing that the Labor Party should be associated with but I am sure they will be in due course. You have these three people putting out a release yesterday saying, `We're going to go out and ask people whether they're in favour of privatisation.' They are not actually going to ask them, `Are you in favour of privatisation if they ensure that service levels are maintained, if they ensure that it remains in Australian ownership and if they make adequate provision for future technologies to be available?'—in other words, a whole range of very important questions which cannot be separated from privatisation. That is an ideological question: are you in favour of privatisation? But if you say, as we did in 1996, `You'll get a billion dollar Natural Heritage Trust fund out of it,' then the equation is completely different— and similarly with all of the provisions that we have made. Just to show you how absurd their press release was, they attached to it a list of various countries in the OECD and where they stood on privatisation. What you found was the US, the UK, Canada, Mexico and New Zealand all fully privatised, Finland committed to full privatisation, and Ireland and Italy with less than five per cent government ownership. What does that tell you? All the countries that are prospering have got fully privatised telecommunications carriers. The US have never had anything other than privately owned telecommunications carriers, yet they invented the universal service obligation.

Australia is doing very well in the context of the gap between male and female full-time wages. It is something that I think all Australians would be interested in, and particularly women. The OECD economic outlook for 2002 shows Australia having one of the narrowest gaps between male and female full-time wages— namely, an eight per cent gap, compared with a 21 per cent gap in the United States and, apparently, in Switzerland. This is very good news. The report makes some other points with respect to women in the work force, and particularly notes that Australian women's employment rates are comparatively lower when they have children. That, of course, raises the issue of the work and family balance. That invites me to comment on this government's record in relation to work and families.

It is a very good example of the success of the government's policy of active engagement with industry and taxpayers about the design of new tax laws and legislation, and it indicates that the government not only listens but also acts on the views expressed in the community.

It is a package which delivers benefits to families because this government understands the very great needs that families have in this country. Of course, it is a tax law. We expect everyone to comply with the tax law, and we expect that, if there has been an overpayment, arrangements will be made to pay it back.</para></talk.start></continue><para>One of the things that has been quite diverting in the debate over the last few days is: what exactly is the Labor Party suggesting should happen in respect of family tax benefits? The Labor Party has not had a tax policy since 1993. The last we heard from the Labor Party on any tax policy of any sort that might have benefited families was l-a-w tax cuts—and we all know what happened with that. Promises were made but not delivered. So the question of the family tax package is not only one where numbers of benefits are delivered to Australian families who need them, it is a tax policy which is designed to make sure that, where there is an overpayment, it is paid back and, where there is an underpayment, the payment is topped up. It is a policy which is entirely defensible, as is the government's approach to whether or not there need to be further steps taken in relation to entity taxation. This matter is under consultation. While we have not yet received a report from the Board of Taxation and it would not be appropriate for me to pre-empt what advice the government might receive from the Board of Taxation—or indeed what the government might do in relation to that advice—there is a role to pinpoint in a more focused way where there may be abuses of the tax system that will take into account the legitimate use of trusts in appropriate cases.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4008</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator GEORGE CAMPBELL</name><name.id>NB5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

Although Senator George Campbell is wrong again, it gives me a great opportunity to talk about some of the ways in which this government has cracked down on tax avoidance. It was the coalition that was prepared to go to the people on the issue of GST and tax reform. GST itself is an anti-avoidance measure. A broad based, multistage GST is harder to avoid than a single-stage sales tax, especially when combined with no ABN withholding regime. The result is that we are now in a much better position when it comes to targeting activity in the black economy. But the GST and the ABN were only part of our plans. There are strong anti-avoidance elements of the new business tax measures. For instance, there are measures to limit avoidance through the exploitation of non-commercial losses and limitation on deductions for prepayment.

If I recall what the Treasurer said in relation to monitoring of fees, it was that the RBA would monitor these reforms. The reform of credit cards is aimed at ensuring that the costs of credit card services are borne by those who use them, rather than being borne disproportionately by credit card holders who use revolving lines of credit, merchants who accept credit cards for payment and the community as a whole, including consumers who do not use credit. The Treasurer said that the RBA would monitor these reforms and it would deliver the introduction of a transparent and cost based system for setting interchange fees, and that should result in nearly a 40 per cent reduction in average interchange fees in Australia. If the RBA were to do nothing, the cost of providing the card placement system would be around $1 billion per annum— more after five years than would be the case if the reforms are implemented.</para></talk.start><para>Consumers should ultimately benefit from these changes through a reduction in the general level of prices. The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission and the Australian Securities and Investments Commission are both keeping a watching brief over issues to ensure that there is adequate information disclosure for both consumers and merchants. This is to ensure that merchants are fully informed of their responsibilities and do not abuse their power, that consumers' rights remain fully protected and that there is no collusion between merchants regarding the level of surcharge that applies. The RBA also believes that it would be desirable if the reform of interchange fees on debit cards used in EFTPOS transactions were to take place at the same time as that of credit cards. This is a key reform of the Australian payments system including credit cards. It was a key recommendation of the Wallis report. The government supported this recommendation and provided the RBA with legislative powers to ensure the stability, efficiency and competitiveness of the payment system, such as credit cards. There is absolutely no reason to think that the RBA will not be able to adequately monitor how this reform is implemented and how all of the players involved, including the ANZ, behave.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4010</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It was not that the government was not interested in the issue of artificially reopening the mouth; the way I expressed it was that, if there is a choice between investing in the longer term or the shorter term, I would take the investment in the longer term. Basically, we need to address the causes of the problem rather than try and apply a bandaid solution. Having said that, the situation may be so critical that a bandaid solution has to be applied because there is simply not the time. It is not just a question of money to restore the health of the Murray system; it is also a question of complexity and time. If there is not the time, maybe the bandaid will have to be applied.</para></talk.start><para>But, as I have said, if there were the option, I would prefer to see the public investment going into overcoming the causes of the problem. The causes of the problem have been overallocation of water; insufficient water flowing through the system to keep the natural system healthy; inappropriate land use; and overclearing of land in certain places, particularly across the western side of the Great Dividing Range. A whole range of different reasons have culminated in the outcome that we are now experiencing. As I recall, the results of the last ministerial meeting of the Murray-Darling Basin Commission did include allocations for water that would have a beneficial effect upon flow in the lower parts of the river, but that has to be implemented. It is one thing to make a policy decision but it requires the cooperation of all of the eastern states and the Commonwealth to be implemented in practice.</para><para>There also has to be sufficient time to enable it to work in practice. Whose responsibility is it? I think that, whilst natural resource management is primarily the responsibility of the states, this is a national problem. The Commonwealth has accepted its responsibility and would be part of a national solution. It has done so in terms of providing leadership and the scientific input that is necessary for identifying the causes of the problem; it has done so in terms of better practices in agricultural management; and in many ways it will continue to be a contributor towards a better outcome.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4011</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

This government is committed to enhancing competition and information disclosure in the financial sector to ensure that bank fees and charges are kept to the absolute minimum necessary and that consumers are able to make well-informed decisions. That is what it is all about. Through the Financial Services Reform Act, the government introduced a both harmonised and improved regulatory regime for consumer protection and disclosure in the financial services industry. As you would all know, the reforms have been in place since March this year and they ensure effective disclosure to consumers at the point of sale of a financial product, as well as ongoing product disclosure, so that consumers can make comparisons and make up their own minds about what financial institution they are going to do business with.</para></talk.start><para>RBA figures released in a bulletin last year found that, while aggregate bank fees have continued to grow strongly, reductions in net interest margins in recent years have exceeded the increases in the banks' fee income. There are a number of initiatives under way that have been examining bank fee disclosure issues. That is in marked contrast, of course, to Labor's policy on banks. The policy that Senator Conroy took to the election seemed to be to bundle up something from the ABA and to run out and release it about three hours before the ABA released their policy. It seemed to be a great exercise in plagiarism, as best I could tell.</para><para>On 26 June this year, ASIC released a disclosure guide on what constitutes good fee disclosure practices on transaction accounts offered by banks, credit unions and building societies, and on 26 March 2001 the ABA announced a proposed industry standard for a basic banking account, specifying the minimum basic level of service fee for the holders of Commonwealth government pensioner, health care and seniors concession cards. In addition, the RBA recently reported that most banks provide a basic account with low or no fees. The Parliamentary Joint Statutory Committee on Corporations and Securities has released a report on bank fees on both electronic and telephone transactions. </para><para>Of course, the government will continue to work with banks and to encourage competition in the financial services sector. As we previously said, and as the Treasurer has said, we will consider acting if there is any evidence of anticompetitive practices by the banks in their dealings either with the small business sector or indeed with other consumers. To date the government have not received any evidence to warrant an ASIC investigation into the lending practices of banks towards small business. The government will continue to work with the industry sector to ensure that bank fees are transparent, that consumers have choice and that banks continue to offer a range of products so that consumers can choose where they want to bank.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4013</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

That was done and we have responded to that report in conjunction with the Royal College of Pathologists of Australasia, the Australian Association of Pathology Practices and the National Association of Testing Authorities.

Some of these changes will include the establishment of an improved early warning system to identify a poorly performing laboratory as soon as problems arise. The current review, action and appeal processes will be speeded up while still providing for natural justice so that laboratories can continue to be eligible for Medicare benefits while they are appealing an adverse decision by the National Association of Testing Authorities. The changes will enable spot checks of laboratories, whereas before NATA or the HIC had to give a week's notice. We thought that it was important that we had spot checks, especially for laboratories where there was concern. Finally, we will establish a public notification system on the Internet to record the accreditation status of pathology laboratories so that doctors will have access to information to know whether a laboratory is under question. These reforms will ensure that we maintain our place as a world leader in quality assurance in our pathology laboratories.

Is that his essential proposition? There are always going to be some disparities in numbers. Is he really objecting strongly, and therefore wants a cutback in funding for schools? If he is, let us hear about it. If he is saying that there ought to be more money for universities then, presumably, given his ideological bent, it is all going to have to come from government funding—in other words, from taxpayers—because he is no doubt opposed to any other ways in which students might be encouraged, such as loans. We take the view that as long as sufficient funds are available to maintain the university sector then that sector will continue to prosper. The review process, I think, is predicated on the basis that the current arrangements are probably unsustainable in the longer term and now is a very appropriate time to review them. But it has been made quite clear today by the Labor Party that they are all in favour of the government giving money to particular preference groups and of course punishing those that they disapprove of. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Detention Centres</title><page.no>4015</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>4015</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Ellison, the Minister representing the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs.

The Minister has made no secret of the fact that there are challenges facing the higher education sector.

It's just a shame that the Opposition does not want to be part of this review process.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Operating result of the sector</inline></para><para>The financial position of the higher education sector remains strong. The sector operating result has been improving in the past two years. The figures quoted by Senator Carr are no secret— these are publicly available in a number of forms, through institutions' annual reports and the Higher Education Triennium Report. After declining from $555 million in 1997 to $287 million in 1999, the aggregate operating result has increased remarkably with figures of $320 million in 2000 and preliminary figures of $464 million in 2001.</para><para>It should be noted that the comparison of four year averages of the operating result to that of a single year can be very misleading. Universities, like any other organisations, may report operating deficits from time to time, and comparing the operating result for one year with another or even with averages do not provide adequate information of a university's financial health.

Of course, right in the middle of that crisis is the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone. Today in question time, as she has tried to do in every other question time, she sought to defend the family payments system which the government introduced as part of the GST. What sort of a system is it that slugs families with significant debts when those families do the right thing and immediately advise Centrelink of their changed earnings? Centrelink requires people receiving family payments to advise them when their circumstances change. Many families are doing that; they are complying with those requirements, yet they are incurring large debts at the end of the financial year— amounts which are being taken out of their tax refunds without any notice.</para><para>The minister might adopt the approach of smearing individuals who find themselves in these situations through no fault of their own, but the fact remains that these families do everything the government asks of them—they follow the advice of the government and Centrelink—and they are still facing financial difficulties. This would not be a problem, Mr Deputy President—and I congratulate you on your appointment to the position; I think this is the first opportunity I have had to do so—if the minister actually understood the system and then took steps to fix it. But Senator Vanstone does not understand the system and she has no willingness really to fix it.</para><para>Let us ask the question: who designed the system? You would think that it was designed by officials of the department administered by the minister, the Department of Family and Community Services, who are people—you would think—who would understand what is happening in the international arena with regard to family policy. But, of course, that was not the case. This system was designed by the Treasury boffins who were responsible for putting together the GST and the ANTS package. The Treasurer's tax reform task force dreamed up and developed this system. Belatedly, one person was seconded to that task force from the Department of Family and Community Services to have an input, but it was too little too late. We now have a situation where this policy suits the budgetary and financial interests of this government and makes the families pay the price. Currently, as we know, there are some 650,000 families in this country who have incurred debt.</para><para>The average debt per family is $850. We have a total of half a billion dollars of debt just for this year alone. The minister says that this is not really a significant problem. But I remind the minister that this is more than one in every three families. Surely the minister is not trying to suggest that all of these families are trying to manipulate or defraud the system. Of course they are not. But this minister, in answers to questions in this chamber, paints pictures of people who may deliberately delay informing Centrelink of their changed circumstances and who are somehow seeking to gain some benefit upfront and then pay it off at a slower rate. </para><para>The system is not working, and it is not working because—notwithstanding the requirements on families to provide the information to Centrelink, which they do—Centrelink and this minister cannot get their act together and administer the system properly. The compliance figures provided by Centrelink show, for instance, in comparing this system with that of the previous family allowance system, that in 1999-2000 only 51,832 debts were detected. That compares with some 757,000 under this current system. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>4018</page.no><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name><name.id>008W7</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy President, I also have not had the opportunity to address you in your new capacity, so may I lend my congratulations to you on your election. I wish to take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, to the questions asked of her by Senator Conroy concerning entity taxation. The proposition asserted by Senator Conroy's questions in criticism of the government's policy on entity taxation could hardly have been more misconceived. The government, after an extensive process of consultation with small business, with tax experts and, in particular, with the government's own Board of Taxation, withdrew its original exposure draft bill on entity taxation so as to enable the Board of Taxation to have another look at the matter and to recommend approaches to the taxation of trusts that did not have a deleterious effect on small businesses and on other commercial entities which operate through trust structures.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Conroy, as the shadow minister for financial services and regulations, should perhaps have known better. But the fact is that the vast majority of Australian small businesses, in particular—though not exclusively—businesses in primary industries, conduct their affairs through trusts, and there is absolutely nothing invidious about that. But Senator Conroy comfortably settled back into the old class war rhetoric in his question suggesting that any business that carries on its business through a trust structure was involved in some sort of tax avoidance. </para><para>As you know, the most common way in which small businesses in this country are financed is by families that borrow against their own assets, against the family home, in order to provide the working capital for that business, and then they conduct that business through a corporate trustee. Commonly the members of the family are the directors of the corporate trustee and income received by the corporate trustee on behalf of the business is then distributed to shareholders and to family members. That is the way in which family businesses have conducted their affairs in Australia from time immemorial. It is almost universally the structure through which family farms and primary producers conduct their small businesses, and it is very commonly—although not universally—the way in which small businesses operated by tradespeople and small retailers and small venture capitalists conduct their business.</para><para>Yet to hear Senator Conroy and the tone of his question to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, you would think that it is a mode of tax avoidance. It is nothing of the sort. It has never been suggested by the Commissioner of Taxation or by the Board of Taxation that that is otherwise than an entirely legitimate way to structure a business, an entirely legitimate way in which to distribute income received by that business to those concerned and, in particular, where it is a family business, to distribute income to family members.</para><para>Where is the proposal at the moment? Let me tell you. After the original exposure draft was reviewed the stakeholders had a look at it and it was not proceeded with. The matter went back to the Board of Taxation. The Board of Taxation, having recommended that the bill not proceed in its then existing form, is currently engaged on a report to the government on the taxation of trusts, and that report will be received soon. The main point of the report, we expect, is that it will recommend a crackdown on specific species of avoidance that may be engaged in by corporate trustees that conduct businesses and are the point at which taxation is levied rather than adopt a one size fits all model which will impact adversely on all forms of small businesses which conduct their affairs through a corporate trustee. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>4018</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to take note of the answers given by the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone. One thing that concerns me about this debate as it has unfolded is the way the government, and the minister in particular, seem to believe the propaganda which they have been running along this line. They would like to have us think that the people who are in receipt of this benefit are wallowing in money and are receiving this benefit so that they can save money to take overseas holidays or buy a second house or a second car. The recipients of this benefit need this money to meet their day-to-day living commitments. They are people who live from day to day and week to week. They need this benefit to meet the most basic of bills and to survive in our community on the most basic of living standards. We have a system which deprives people, at the one time in a year when they get their tax cheque, of an opportunity to use that money to pay for some of the things that they need, whether it be the payment of school fees or whether it be to replace household appliances. Attempts to justify this stripping are clearly false.  </para></talk.start><para>Last year, the minister argued that there ought not to be this stripping of tax returns. In fact, the minister waived up to $1,000 per recipient if there was an incorrect calculation of the benefit—and, of course, at that time there was an election in the wind. So what has happened in 12 months? What was happening then was clearly a `cash for votes' situation where the government saw the need to be generous in their terms. They wanted to be reasonable and they thought that it was proper for people not to have their tax cheques stripped in this manner at that time. But the election comes and goes and what we see then is a government returning to their mean policies and trying to, again, take this money from some of the people who need it.</para><para>It is extraordinary that the minister would suggest—as she did on <inline font-style="italic">Lateline </inline>on Tuesday night—that $500 is really not that much money for a family. How out of touch can the minister possibly be? It may not be much money to the minister but to many families who live day to day it is an enormous amount of money. It can put petrol in the car for a number of months; it can pay their car registration. The system punishes people who in fact follow the rules. It is a flawed system and a system that fails to recognise the realities of life for low-income families. People find it very difficult to calculate in advance their total income for the year. It is a difficult process when we have in our community increasing part-time employment and the casualisation of labour. It is immensely difficult for people at the low-income end to determine what their income is going to be for the whole year. As Senator Collins rightly pointed out yesterday, under a Labor government there was the ability to have a variation of 10 per cent when calculating those amounts. That took a lot of people out of the unfortunate situation in which people are forced to be at the present time. </para><para>The minister's own department has admitted that only 77,000 families claim these payments through the tax system. The other 1.9 million claim it as a fortnightly benefit through Centrelink. Why do they do this? Because they need the money on a fortnightly basis to raise their kids. This point was made amply clear by Ms Helene Weston-Davey on ABC news last night—and she was right. The system punishes families even when they follow the rules. It does not give support to families when they need it. As Ms Weston-Davey said, what was she supposed to do—ring the minister and ask for $50 a week when she wasn't working at the start of the year and needed the money to feed her kids? This government expects these families to have a psychic ability that allows them to predict future increases in income due to overtime or increases in their base salary. It is simply not good enough. This system should be designed to provide welfare, not work against people as is happening now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>4019</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—What we have seen today in question time and during question time on previous days is ample evidence of the lack of leadership in the Australian Labor Party and an absolute lack of any policies from the Australian Labor Party—in fact, not only a lack of policies but total confusion.

I got a copy of the 2002 Kaman calendar the other day. In January they have a photo of the New Zealand helicopters, which were bought at the same time as Australia's helicopters and are in service. Guess what is in April? In April there is the nonexistent Australian helicopter. Why is it in April? It is an April 1st joke. The Australian helicopter: $900 million—paid for, not delivered. The Egyptians have got theirs. The New Zealanders have got theirs. We are the only ones who cannot buy a helicopter. We pay out good money but we cannot buy a helicopter. We deserve better answers as to why we have got a squadron and a service facility but we do not have helicopters.

All but one of the fleet are there in their hangar being worked on in terms of, as I said in question time today, the completion of the systems and preparation for their operational roles by, in effect, about half a squadron of naval personnel. They are there for the specific purpose of ensuring that, when the full system capability is completed and they can be taken by Navy, they can become immediately operational. In fact, we are hopeful—I know senators would want to know this—that we will be able to take them at an earlier date and commence training without their full capabilities. That will depend upon the next critical assessment of the systems integration, which will take place in about March of next year.</para></talk.start><para>What Senator Evans did not say is that what went wrong with this contract was basically that a major subcontractor responsible for the systems integration failed to deliver.

The government were more interested in ensuring that the contract got put back in order with new subcontractors in order that the full capability would be delivered.</para><para>We recognise that it will be delivered late, which is actually not all that unusual with military contracts, but we still want the helicopters with their full capabilities, because that is what is needed to enhance the Anzac frigates. As Senator Evans knows, they will be equipped with both Penguin missiles and torpedoes, they will have state-of-the-art capabilities and, in effect, they will be new aircraft. They certainly have some parts of the original aircraft structure but they have been substantially rebuilt with all new systems, new engines and so on, which is also not unusual for procurement of military assets.</para><para>They are an aircraft that are smaller than the Seahawks. They have advantages that the Seahawks do not have. They will have armaments that the Seahawks do not have. They will be an extremely capable aircraft and Navy is still enthusiastic about the prospect of including them within the fleet. The government ensured that new subcontractors were put in place to overcome the systems problems. It renegotiated the contract so that payments now better reflect the state of development of the asset. As I said, all but one of the aircraft have been delivered to Nowra and are being worked on by the Navy squadron that has been put down there for that specific purpose.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—Have you or have you not taken delivery of them?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—Navy people are working on those aircraft as we sit here in this chamber.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—Who owns the helicopters?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—We have paid quite a lot of money.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—You said you had not taken delivery of them.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—There are a number of formal steps that are still to be taken and the Navy is in the process of further development of the assets.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—You said you had not taken delivery of them; now you are saying you have.

Last Tuesday morning the Senate committee made a decision, following the coroner's handing down of a decision in his matter, to reinitiate the inquiry. Senator Heffernan is reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Burnie</inline><inline font-style="italic">Advocate</inline> of 28 August as saying that the committee:</para><quote><para>... had met privately yesterday—</para></quote><para>that is, Tuesday—</para><quote><para>and would be likely to hold a hearing at a yet to be determined location in the near future.</para></quote><para>And:</para><quote><para>... it would be up to the committee to decide how far to take its inquiries.</para></quote><para>Naturally, my comment was recorded as this, as reported in the minister's press release:</para><quote><para>It is intended from discussions I've had so far—</para></quote><para>including discussions with the committee's secretariat and the chair—</para><motion><para>that hearings will commence with an examination of AusSAR.</para></motion><para>That is a statement of fact.

It took nine paragraphs for Mr Anderson to acknowledge the coroner's findings in respect of his agency's failings, and he did so in two dismissive sentences. He is the minister responsible for AusSAR and was so at the time the crew of the <inline font-style="italic">Margaret</inline> J lost their lives, and he is the minister now responsible for improving AusSAR's internal performance and its relationship with state search and rescue agencies.

I remind the Senate that the committee comprises senators from three parties represented in this chamber and is chaired by Senator Heffernan, the senior government member on the committee.

It was not our intention in the Senate to enter into debate upon it, because we assumed that it would have the unanimous support of the chamber and what was important was the message it conveyed; in other words, it was not the sort of motion that required an argument to support it. That is still my view. However, an amendment has been circulated by the Australian Democrats, arguing that the last three paragraphs should be removed. In other words, the Australian Democrats are not prepared to confirm Australia's `continued commitment to the war against terrorism', are not prepared to reiterate support `for the comprehensive range of enhancements to domestic counter-terrorist arrangements enacted by this parliament' and are not prepared to endorse `the Australian government's continuing efforts to improve cooperation on counter-terrorism with other governments in our region'. I have to say that I do find that response extraordinary. I know that the Australian Democrats are going through a difficult period, but that they would come in here and seek to send a different message on those three critical elements I really do find amazing. I hope that at least the position as formally put by the Australian Democrats is not supported by the sensible half of the Australian Democrats.</para><para>It is an event that changed the world. It was a horrific event, as I said. Its enormity was overwhelming. The huge loss of innocent life; the heroic rescue efforts—all those events have had a profound effect upon the international community as a whole. What has also been extraordinary is the way in which the international community has come together to respond as effectively as possible in an effort to avoid a recurrence of that event. Australia, along with other countries, has been prepared to stand and take the risk, to contribute to the fight against those who would bring terror, and to contribute to a safer world and, therefore, to a safer Australia. I take this opportunity to commend all the Australian forces who have served, and who continue to serve, in the war against terrorism. It is unfortunately the case that we now know that the networks of terrorism have spread more widely than was appreciated a year ago, and that therefore the war to defeat terrorism will be both long and difficult. Nevertheless, it is a challenge that we have no choice but to take up in order, as I said, to provide for the safety of our people. Today we express our condolences again to the families of all those who lost their lives and recommit ourselves to the challenge of contributing to a safer world by effectively responding to this scourge until it is ultimately defeated. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>4025</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion before the chair on behalf of the opposition.

The opposition's position has been clear and principled. We are determined to ensure that Australia and the international community are safeguarded from terrorism. In doing that, we note that the right balance must be struck between taking effective measures against terrorists and preserving Australia's hard-won democratic rights and freedoms. I do not forget, and I hope no-one in this parliament and in this country forgets, that on September 11 ordinary people going about their ordinary daily lives were killed. It is appropriate that we remember them, especially the 10 Australians who were amongst those who were killed on September 11. I, too, am disappointed that this motion cannot find unanimous support in the Senate today, but I can say that on behalf of the opposition I commend the motion.

We Democrats agree wholeheartedly that all people should enjoy peace and security in their days and in their lives. We express our repugnance for those who employ terror and violence against innocent people and we convey our genuine sympathy to the government and people of the United States for the horrific attacks last year on September 11.

We are very disappointed that the government has tacked onto this motion of remembrance an endorsement of their own domestic counter-terrorist legislation, which has been and remains highly contentious, and much of which the Democrats opposed at the time. </para><para>For we Democrats, the motion as it stands now is provocative. Putting forward a motion asking us to express sympathy and at the same time to express support for legislation which the government knows full well that we have opposed places us in an invidious situation. The <inline ref="R1516">Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> was opposed by us, largely because it created a proscription regime and criminalised certain activity in relation to terrorist organisations. The <inline ref="R1485">Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002</inline> was also opposed by us. It created an offence directed at those who provide or collect funds with the intention that they be used to facilitate terrorist activities, and we expressed concern at the time about the definition of terrorism which was being used. We supported the <inline ref="R1487">Criminal Code Amendment (Suppression of Terrorist Bombings) Bill 2002</inline>.</para><para>We opposed the <inline ref="R1514">Border Security Legislation Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. That bill amends the Customs Act 1901 and four other acts to increase Customs' powers at airports by allowing Customs officers to patrol airports, increasing restricted areas and allowing Customs officers to remove people from those areas. We argued strongly in committee, and through the committee process, why we were opposed to that. The <inline ref="R1481">Telecommunications Interception Legislation Amendment Bill 2002</inline> is also highly contentious, and the government still proposes to address the issue of email, voice mail and SMS messaging to be accessed by authorities without warrant. This is highly controversial legislation and it is well known by the government that we do not and will not support that. So, while it is absolutely appropriate to express our commitment to peace, our sadness and our sympathy to the US over the attacks of September 11—that is fine—to include in that a pat on the back for the Australian government is unnecessary and in poor taste. It is the equivalent of sending a sympathy card to someone that says, `We're very sorry about your loss—and, by the way, the Howard government's doing a great job.' The Australian Democrats support the motion in remembrance of September 11, certainly, but we oppose the inclusion of the sections endorsing the government's actions and containing words that speak of a continued commitment to war.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>4026</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to put on the record the Greens' support for the amendment that is currently before the chamber. The Australian Greens, as other members of this chamber have expressed themselves to be, were appalled by the events of September 11 and we wholeheartedly lend our support to the first four points of the motion put forward by the government today. We are not, however, in a position to be able to support points (e), (f) and (g) of the government's motion. We see point (e), confirming Australia's continued commitment to the war against terrorism, as a potential backdoor avenue for this government to support any extension of the war on terrorism that we know is currently controlled by the United States. We see this as a step backward from the government's commitment to have public debate within this chamber about any involvement of Australian troops in any war on Iraq as part of an extension of this so-called war on terrorism.</para></talk.start><para>We are also surprised that the Australian Labor Party has chosen to support point (f) of this motion which seeks to reiterate:</para><quote><para>... support for the comprehensive range of enhancements to domestic counter-terrorist arrangements enacted by this Parliament ...</para></quote><para>We have noted recently with pleasure the comments that have come from the Australian Labor Party to say that they will be blocking the ASIO legislation when it comes before this Senate, so we are somewhat surprised to hear the Australian Labor Party supporting the comprehensive range of enhancements being proposed by this government to deal with counter-terrorism measures. </para><para>We are also unable to support point (g) of this motion, which looks to improving cooperation on counter-terrorism with other governments in the region. Clearly, we need to work with other governments in the region on a range of issues, but when we look at pieces of legislation like Malaysia's Internal Security Act and compare that with the antiterrorism measures that this government has put in place, we see that our own government has been prepared to go further than the Malaysian Internal Security Act. That act in fact allows people detained under it to have access to a lawyer and to have the right to silence, which are elements not contained in the government's ASIO legislation which is yet to come before this chamber. So, whilst the Greens are able to give our wholehearted support to points (a) to (d) of this motion, and we commend the government for bringing on a motion which commemorates, and sends our condolences to the victims of, September 11, we are not in a position to be able to support the further extension of the war on terrorism or the government's own ASIO legislation.

As one of the few— and I think it is a fortunate few, and, frankly, the fewer the better—people left in parliament who have experienced war, I do not like the beating of war drums. I am really nervous about it and I am nervous of the climate of warmongering, which we have addressed elsewhere.

We should be leaders taking the moral high ground on that, and never those who might be considered to be less acquainted with civil liberties. Frankly, (f) is extremely offensive. I laud the members of the Liberal Party, the Labor Party, our own party and others in the Senate for the wonderful fight they put up to make those antiterrorism bills less offensive on the civil libertarian front. I would have preferred that item (f) was qualified to recognise that kind of approach. However, I expect this amendment to go down. I want the Senate to be aware that, in the event of the amendment being lost, I will give my full support to the full motion, because I believe that condolence and respect for what happened is greater than the points I will make about domestic politics.

Furthermore, the government and the opposition have agreed that there should not be a debate, and the government, at least, is showing some annoyance that there is one on this important issue. I find that somewhat reprehensible as well.</para></talk.start><para>In this place we are accustomed to working together, and the Democrats are always prepared to be cooperative, but we do like to be asked if there is not to be a debate. It would have been quite good of the government to have told us that that was what they wished and given us an opportunity to indicate what was wrong with this motion. I recall that last year much the same kind of motion was put to us. It was an impossible choice in a condolence motion which we all very much wanted to support. I remember that debate being highly emotional and of great difficulty for people like myself who could never support a motion in this place that calls for going to war against anything or anyone. Australia is not at war, and I very much hope that it does not find itself in that position.</para><para>Does (e) confirm Australia's continued commitment to the war in Iraq? Is that a war against terrorism? I am not quite sure. Was the war in Afghanistan a war against terrorism? I did not support that either. For that reason, there is no chance of my supporting this motion, even though I very much want to extend my condolences to the people who were so affected by the events of September 11. Again, it has been said at this end of the chamber that we were presented with a fait accompli. You should not be surprised that this end of the chamber would wish to debate a matter. It is not exactly a gag, but it is important. The government should expect us to complain when it tries to put up a motion which we can only half support. I join with my colleagues in urging the government to withdraw (e), (f) and (g). Let us have that vote separately. I think that that would be a fair and honourable way to proceed. As Senator Murphy says, (e), (f) and (g) are not relevant to (a), (b), (c) and (d). Let us deal with those two matters separately so that those of us in this chamber who want to extend our condolences and remember, 12 months on, the events of September 11, can do so.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Greig's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>16:12:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

The response from Senator Coonan reads:</para></talk.start><quote><para>On 2 October 2001, the government released for public consultation an issues paper titled `Options for Improving the Safety of Superannuation'. The paper identifies various measures that might be implemented to ensure that the prudential framework for superannuation is as effective as it should be and provides the level of safety expected for the superannuation savings of Australians.</para><para>The Superannuation Working Group was requested by cabinet to undertake the consultation process in relation to the issues paper and to report to government by the end of March 2002. The report has been received by the government and is being examined and considered. The report itself and any measures the government may propose to implement to improve prudential safety of superannuation will be considered by cabinet. At this stage, the report is clearly part of the deliberative process of government.</para><para>I accept the need for the Senate to access certain information if it is to perform its proper functions. I understand and believe in the important principles of transparent democracy and accountability. I am also aware of my responsibilities as a minister and the need to consider whether disclosure of information would be contrary to the public interest. There is a balance to be struck which properly addresses the tension between these competing principles.</para><para>Having considered these principles and responsibilities in the circumstances at hand, I have determined, on balance, that it is not in the public interest for the Superannuation Working Group report to be laid on the table at this time. However, I can inform the Senate that I expect to make the Superannuation Working Group report, as well as the government's response, publicly available after the deliberative processes of the government are complete.</para><para>Governments of different persuasions have sought many times in this parliament, in the interest of good governance, to protect the confidentiality of documents that form part of the deliberative process of government. As former Senator Gareth Evans told this chamber in December 1993: `The truth of the matter is that executive governments from time immemorial have claimed some degree—not a complete degree—of immunity from scrutiny of their internal processes in order to enable decision making to take place in an orderly way, and allow communications to pass between ministers and policy issues to be addressed in a way that is not necessarily the subject of intense public scrutiny at the time that that decision making process is still under way.' After careful consideration, I believe that it is not appropriate for the report of the Superannuation Working Group to be released at this stage, prior to its consideration by the cabinet.</para><para>The government is committed to and encourages consultation and debate. Good policy making benefits from input from those with a genuine interest in achieving good outcomes. The original issues paper was released by the government and underwent a comprehensive consultation process. Submissions to the Superannuation Working Group were also made public. When the deliberative processes of the government are complete, it is, as I said, my expectation that the report will be released. I believe my decision in this matter is consistent with the past practices of this government and the conduct of the previous Labor government.</para></quote></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>4030</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Reports: Government Responses</title><page.no>4030</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>4030</page.no><name role="metadata">Troeth, Sen Judith</name><name role="display">Senator TROETH</name><name.id>GX5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— I present two government responses to committee reports as listed on today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline> at item 14.

The Government does not consider there is any compelling reason to alter it. </para><para>The ABC Act requires non-executive Directors other than the staff-elected director to be appointed by the Governor-General for a period not exceeding 5 years. Under section 12(5) of the ABC Act, a person may not be appointed to the Board:</para><para>“unless he or she appears to the Governor-General to be suitable for appointment because of having had experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting services or in communications or management, because of having expertise in financial or technical matters, or because of having cultural or other interests relevant to the oversight of a public organization engaged in the provision of broadcasting services.”</para><para>The Chair's report fails to support the statement that there is a “widespread public perception” that ABC Board appointments are made on the basis of political affiliations. The Government notes that the majority of submissions to the inquiry were form letters from members of the Friends of the ABC and may not be representative of the wider community.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline></para><para>The Chair strongly recommends the retention of the staff-elected director</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Agreed.</inline></para><para>There has been no consideration of the removal of the position of staff-elected director. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3</inline></para><para>The Chair recommends that appointees to the ABC Board should have a demonstrated commitment to the principles of public broadcasting.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Not agreed.</inline></para><para>Under section 12(5) of the ABC Act, a person may not be appointed to the Board:</para><para>“unless he or she appears to the Governor-General to be suitable for appointment because of having had experience in connection with the provision of broadcasting services or in communications or management, because of having expertise in financial or technical matters, or because of having cultural or other interests relevant to the oversight of a public organization engaged in the provision of broadcasting services.”</para><para>It is not clear from the Chair's recommendation how a “demonstrated commitment to the principles of public broadcasting” would be satisfied. The willingness to serve on the ABC Board is in itself demonstration of a commitment to public broadcasting. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4</inline></para><para>The Chair recommends, in relation to the ABC National Advisory Council:</para><para>·	that the Board appoint a member to perform a National Advisory Council liaison function.</para><para>·	That the ABC Advisory Council shall meet four times per year at times which reflect the schedule of the ABC Board</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Not agreed.</inline></para><para>Under section 11(9) of the ABC Act, the ABC Board determines the manner in which an Advisory Council is to perform its functions and the procedure relating to meetings of that Advisory Council.

The Minister receives letters recommending potential Board members on a year-round basis and therefore is aware of a wide field of potential candidates.</para><para>The Minister seeks agreement from potential Directors to be nominated for appointment before they are recommended to the Governor-General. Requiring the Minister to approve only those who have put forward formal applications may exclude some excellent candidates. </para><para>Requiring Board members to disclose political affiliations presents a privacy issue, especially as section 12(5) of the ABC Act does not make political affiliations a relevant criterion for appointments. It is also not clear how “political affiliations” is defined nor what period of time should be covered by a disclosure. The declaration of political affiliations may have the reverse effect to that predicted by the Chair, by bringing the issue of affiliation to the fore in the consideration of any candidate for the Board and providing a basis to discriminate against candidates.</para><para>Advertising ABC Board vacancies and requiring applications would lead to a large number of applications and would require a significant commitment of resources to process and assess. The Government believes this commitment of resources to be unnecessary, considering the processes described above which are currently in place. The Minister has the option of advertising for candidates if he or she feels that there is not a sufficient pool of candidates. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9</inline></para><para>The Chair recommends that:</para><para>·	an independent selection panel shortlist applications, and forward a list of at least two candidates to the Minister, together with the candidates' applications and declarations of political affiliation.</para><para>·	the shortlist of candidates, together with a summary of their qualifications against the selection criteria and their statement of political affiliation, be public.</para><para>·	the Minister should not be obliged to select any of the candidates recommended by the selection panel. However, the Minister must not select a candidate who has not first been scrutinised by the independent selection panel.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Not agreed.</inline></para><para>The Government believes that this recommendation would create a cumbersome process which, as discussed in the Labor Senators' minority report, undermines the concept of Ministerial accountability to Parliament. A number of issues surrounding this recommendation are not clear, for example the manner in which the “independent selection panel” would be convened or how privacy issues regarding the publication of candidates' applications would be addressed.</para><para>This recommendation would implement a selection process significantly different from that for other Government bodies. There is no convincing rationale for this difference in the report.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10</inline></para><para>The Chair recommends that:</para><para>·	at the first meeting of the ABC Board every year, the Board shall elect a Chair and Deputy Chair.</para><para>·	the ABC Board shall hold a public Annual General Meeting, at which all Board members shall be present.</para><para>·	The ABC Board shall publish greater information in relation to their activities, including summaries of Board Minutes. This may be achieved via publication on the ABC Board website.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Not agreed.</inline></para><para>The first part of this recommendation develops an unworkable and potentially damaging model for the operation of the ABC Board. The requirement for an annual election of the Chair is potentially divisive and destabilising, with no clear benefits. </para><para>The Government has committed to encouraging the ABC to be more responsive to the needs and views of its audiences, particularly in relation to content and programming matters. However, the ABC is already accountable to Parliament through its annual reports and appearances before Senate Committees and the Senate Estimates process. The Government does not consider the introduction of another layer of accountability, as outlined in the second part of the recommendation, through an annual general meeting, would enhance the transparency and accountability of the ABC beyond its current level. </para><para>The publication of ABC Board minutes, even in summary form, as suggested in the third part of the recommendation, has the potential to be damaging to the ABC. Given the ABC operates in a highly competitive broadcasting environment, commercial confidentiality is at times necessary and, in particular, in relation to commercial links with external parties. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 11</inline></para><para>This recommendation covers the legislative changes required to give effect to a model implementing the previous recommendations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Not agreed.</inline></para><para>As the Government does not support any of the recommendations made by the Chair, it does not believe there is any requirement for legislative change.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Report by Government Senators</inline></para><para>The Government supports the views expressed in the Government Senators' report. In particular the Government supports the view that the inquiry has not clearly established that there is a problem with the current approach to Board appointments, nor that there is a strong argument for differentiating the method of appointing ABC Board Directors from the approach taken for other Commonwealth agencies.</para><para>The Government also agrees with the doubts expressed by the Government Senators regarding the representative nature of most of the submissions received by the inquiry.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Report by Labor Senators</inline></para><para>The Government notes that the Labor Senators have pointed out that it is not clear that any changes to the appointment system would remove the perceived problem of politicisation. The Government does not agree with the Labor Senators' assertion that more investigation of options is required, as no clear case for the need for change is put forward.</para><para>The Government agrees with a number of the criticisms of the Chair's report which are advanced by the Labor Senators, although it disagrees with the need for the establishment of selection criteria. The criteria suggested by the Labor Senators, such as “breadth of vision”, are vague and subjective and their use would not, in the Government's opinion, enhance the selection process for ABC Board members.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Additional Comments by Senator Bob Brown, Australian Greens</inline></para><para>Most of the recommendations in Senator Brown's comments are dealt with above.</para><para>With respect to Senator Brown's recommendation that the British model of appointment should be adopted to appoint ABC Board Directors, the Government notes that there continues to be criticism of the politicisation of the BBC Board. The Government does not consider that the UK model offers particular advantages to the ABC.</para><para>The Government also does not see any reason to change the current staff representation on the ABC Board.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO REPORT 42 OF THE JOINT STANDING COMMITTEE ON TREATIES</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">“Who's Afraid of the WTO?

The Government response to these recommendations is provided below.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">EVALUATION OF SOCIO-ECONOMIC IMPACTS OF TRADE</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government commission multi-disciplinary research to evaluate the socio-economic impact of trade liberalisation in Australia since the conclusion of the Uruguay Round in 1994 (paragraph 1.96).</inline></para><para>The Government shares the Committee's view that it is important to provide assessments of the actual results of trade liberalisation in explaining to the wider community the benefits of these policies. </para><para>As noted in the Committee's Report, the Government has undertaken studies that demonstrate how trade generates wealth, creates employment, raises living standards, provides consumers with access to high quality products and provides business with a source of new ideas and innovation. Those analyses have, for example, estimated the proportion of jobs in Australia as a whole, and in regional areas, that depend on trade; and demonstrated that exporting firms on average afford their employees significantly better wages and conditions than non-exporting firms. </para><para>The Government will continue to explore ways of undertaking such evaluations to enable the public to make better informed assessments of the benefits of trade and the impact of trade liberalisation. As part of this effort, ABARE and other relevant Government agencies will continue to use their economic modelling tools to analyse trade liberalisation initiatives, including sector specific initiatives such as agricultural trade reform. </para><para>However, it should be noted that retrospective quantitative analyses isolating the total economic impact of trade liberalisation over a given period would be a complex matter. To attempt to differentiate the impact of trade liberalisation since 1994 from other factors, such as currency movements, ongoing structural reforms to the Australian economy and the Asian economic crisis would be both difficult and expensive. This notwithstanding, the overall consensus of most studies is that removing trade barriers globally, including in Australia, lifts living standards and delivers gains for Australia and the world economy. This conclusion holds across a wide range of assumptions about national economic behaviour and model types. </para><para>Recommendation 2</para><para>STRUCTURAL ADJUSTMENT</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that prior to entering any future WTO commitments, the Commonwealth Government assess whether structural adjustment measures are available and appropriate to alleviate any adverse socio-economic impacts of such actions (paragraph 1.115).</inline></para><para>Structural adjustment considerations are a key part of the Government's economic and employment policies. In addition, industry consultations are an important element of the Government's approach to trade negotiations and the implications on Australian industry of any new WTO commitments would be fully taken into account in establishing negotiating objectives. In this context, the need for any structural assistance measures would be fully assessed by the Government. </para><para>Changes flowing from multilateral trade negotiations, such as phased tariff reductions, are by their nature unlikely to lead to rapid adjustment consequences. Changes have generally occurred over a period of time, allowing industry adjustment to take place gradually rather than rapidly and unexpectedly. Also, it is important to consider the net benefits from trade agreements in terms of increased access to export markets that may offset any negative impacts on particular sectors. </para><para>It should also be noted that, in recognition of the fact that increased trade liberalisation necessitates economic change, WTO rules do not limit a government's capacity to provide genuine structural adjustment support. </para><para>The Government has introduced sector specific programs to assist with structural adjustment associated with tariff reductions and other changes to border protection. The $750 million Post-2000 Assistance Package for the Textile Clothing and Footwear (TCF) industry, for example, is aimed at increasing the international competitiveness of Australia's TCF industry and includes support for restructuring activities in TCF-dependent regional communities. In agriculture also, Australia provides structural adjustment assistance. Such programs include Farmbis, Farm Help (formerly the Farm Family Restart Program) and the Dairy Industry Adjustment Package (DIAP). One program within the DIAP is the Dairy Regional Adjustment Programme (Dairy RAP), which assists dairy-dependent communities by supporting business investment and community infrastructure development.</para><para>More broadly, the government addresses labour market disadvantage through funding Job Network, a network of community, private and public providers which deliver employment services in Australia in areas such as job matching, job-search training, intensive assistance for the most disadvantaged unemployed, and the New Enterprise Incentive Scheme. The Government also funds a number of other general labour market and regional assistance programs which assist the unemployed and other disadvantaged people, including Work for the Dole projects, Community Development Employment Projects and the Regional Assistance Programme.</para><para>Recommendation 3</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">COMMUNITY INFORMATION</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade review all existing Commonwealth Government community information programs about international trade to ensure that the facts of trade liberalisation and the World Trade Organisation are addressed in a coordinated and well-targeted manner. Specifically, the Minister should:</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">ensure that such programs present consistent messages across the whole of government</inline>;</para><para><inline font-style="italic">ensure that such programs are delivered in a way that reaches their target audiences;</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">work with State and Territory governments and industry groups to develop complementary programs and to maximise the impact and reach of such programs; and</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">encourage industry sectors to undertake their own education programs in coordination with government trade information initiatives (paragraph 2.83).</inline></para><para>The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT) has been assessing ways of enhancing coordination of information activities on international trade, and to improving the targeting of messages. An important step in this direction has been the establishment in the Department's Trade Development Division of a new Trade Advocacy and Outreach Section to strengthen and sharpen the focus of the Government's promotion of the benefits of trade to the Australian community. The Minister for Trade announced the creation of this new unit on 29 November 2001 as one of a number of measures to strengthen and sharpen the resources dedicated to trade policy within DFAT. The Trade Advocacy and Outreach Section will address the issues raised in the recommendation and report to the Minister on further steps to enhance community information programs.</para><para>The Government already consults extensively with State and Territory governments and with industry groups on promoting the benefits of trade. Enhanced cooperation in this area has been discussed both in the National Trade Consultations and at meetings of the Trade Policy Advisory Council. The Government will continue to develop information programs cooperatively with State and Territory governments and with business. </para><para>Recommendation 4</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">AUDIT OF INTERNET SITE</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade ensure that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade undertake an audit of its WTO internet site, with a view to improving access to information about the benefits of trade liberalisation, the role of the WTO system, dispute cases, and ongoing negotiations (paragraph 2.91).</inline></para><para>These recommendations are consistent with recent changes already implemented by the DFAT. The Department undertook a thorough audit and updating of the trade related information on the DFAT website in the first half of 2001. The trade material was enhanced and revamped through the design of a new `trade portal', which has made the site considerably easier to access. The portal provides a single entry point on trade issues from the website's home page. It arranges material according to integrated and readily comprehensible themes (e.g. country, industry sector, issue). The section on the WTO, explaining its role as well as the state of negotiations and dispute cases, has also been streamlined. There is a wide array of material on the benefits of trade liberalisation under the section on trade policy and the benefits of trade, including a sub-section on trade and regional Australia. </para><para>Recommendation 5</para><para>COMMUNITY REPRESENTATION AT WTO MINISTERIAL MEETINGS</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government invite NGO members of the WTO Advisory Group to participate as community representatives on the official Australian delegation to the WTO Ministerial Meeting in Doha in November 2001 (paragraph 2.118).</inline></para><para>Prior to the release of the Committee's report, the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, extended an invitation to all WTO Advisory Group members to join Australia's official delegation for Doha in June 2001.

The Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade and its Trade Sub-Committee already has a mandate to review and examine developments in the international trade environment and Australia's trade policies. The Government would welcome increased scrutiny by the JSCFADT of its trade policy priorities, including the WTO.</para><para>It should also be noted that the Minister for Trade reports annually to Parliament on trade policy through the Trade Objectives and Outcomes Statement (TOOS). The Statement presents a comprehensive account of the Government's trade efforts affecting all markets and sectors over the past year and its objectives for the coming year. This includes its approach to new trade agreements and initiatives, opportunities for trade expansion, and trade negotiation positions developed by the Government. The Government would welcome more discussion in Parliament, including by relevant Committees, of the policies and programs outlined in the Statement.</para><para>Recommendation 7</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">ANNUAL REVIEW OF WTO POLICY</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the proposed Joint Standing Committee on Trade Liberalisation undertake an annual review of Australia's WTO policy, including negotiating positions, current or proposed dispute cases, compliance, and structural adjustment (paragraph 2.130).</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The same considerations would apply as for recommendation 6. The Government would welcome regular debate on and scrutiny of Australia's policy towards the WTO either by the JSCFADT or otherwise in Parliament, but does not believe creation of a separate Committee is necessary for this purpose. </inline></para><para>Recommendation 8</para><para>OFFICE OF TRADE ADVOCATE</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that an Office of Trade Advocate be established within the portfolio of Foreign Affairs and Trade. The Office of Trade Advocate should have responsibility for:</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">community education programs about trade liberalisation and the WTO;</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">supporting the development of proposed WTO negotiating positions, including consultation with Sectoral Advisory Committees (recommendation 9);</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">management of Australia's participation in WTO dispute cases, including the use of private sector legal practitioners where appropriate (recommendation 10);</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">promoting access for small and medium-sized Australian industries to the Government's WTO disputes enquiry point;</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">consultation mechanisms with State/Territory governments (recommendation 16); and</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">assessment of new structural adjustment and other industry assistance programs to ensure their compliance with WTO Agreements (paragraph 2.181).</inline></para><para>DFAT recently strengthened and restructured the resources within the Department dedicated to trade policy and negotiations. The measures announced by the Minister for Trade, Mr Vaile, on 29 November 2001, noted above in response to Recommendation 3, included the establishment of an Office of Trade Negotiations with responsibility for all aspects of Australia's trade negotiations including the recently launched round of WTO multilateral trade negotiations and bilateral trade initiatives such as the ongoing free trade agreement negotiations with Singapore. </para><para>This initiative is in line with broader efforts to strengthen overall staff resources devoted to trade policy work in the Department, which have been boosted by 27 per cent over the last three years. The consolidation of strengthened staff resources in an integrated Office of Trade Negotiations with responsibility for the full range of Australia's trade negotiating agenda will increase the effectiveness of Australia's work in this important area. The number of senior level negotiators in Canberra and Geneva has also been boosted substantially.</para><para>The Office of Trade Negotiations will also continue to pursue vigorously Australia's trade rights through the WTO dispute settlement system. DFAT strengthened its capacity to handle dispute settlement activity through the creation of a WTO Trade Law Branch at the beginning of 2001. The WTO Trade Law Branch is part of the new Office of Trade Negotiations.</para><para>The WTO Trade Law Branch, and the Department more generally, engage very actively in dialogue with exporters and industry groups to ensure they are aware of their WTO rights as well as the full range of WTO issues. For example, Meat and Livestock Australia—which was closely involved in both the US/lamb and ROK/beef disputes in the WTO—endorsed the Department's approach of creating and leading task forces for the management of disputes as an effective way of bringing together the specialised WTO expertise of the Department with the market knowledge of the industry to advance Australian interests. The WTO Trade Law Branch will also continue to seek to raise awareness among small and medium-sized enterprises of the opportunity they have to access WTO remedies for market access difficulties. The Department is examining ways to make the WTO disputes enquiry point more accessible to SMEs, and will continue to highlight that there are no fees for officials' services when accessing the enquiry point. </para><para>The Minister for Trade also announced on 29 November 2001 the establishment of the Trade Development Division within DFAT. This division will be responsible for Australia's regional trade strategy through APEC, the development of a closer economic partnership with ASEAN, trade finance and economic issues, and the development of new bilateral and regional trade initiatives such as the recently commenced scoping study on a free trade agreement with Thailand. As noted in response to Recommendation 3, Trade Development Division will include the new Trade Advocacy and Outreach Section, which will strengthen and sharpen the focus of the Government's promotion of the benefits of trade to the Australian community, including community education programs about trade liberalisation and the WTO.</para><para>Both the Office of Trade Negotiations and Trade Development Division will be closely involved in consultative mechanisms with the States and Territories and with industry groups. This includes the Trade Policy Advisory Committee, the National Trade Consultations and the WTO Advisory Group. In addition, the Government will be seeking to enhance consultative mechanisms with specific industry sectors that have an interest in the WTO or bilateral trade negotiations. </para><para>In addition to the trade policy work undertaken by the Office of Trade Negotiations and the Trade Development Division, the Department's four geographic divisions and global network of overseas posts will continue to place a high priority on trade policy issues including pursuing vigorously bilateral market access initiatives on behalf of Australian business.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SECTORAL ADVISORY COMMITTEES</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade establish a series of sectoral advisory committees on multilateral trade, to include representatives from all major Australian exporting industries.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The committees should also provide for consultations with representatives of environment, labour, human rights and community groups, when such issues are material to their deliberations.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The sectoral advisory committees should meet at least biannually and prepare reports to the Trade Minister on sectoral priorities for Australia's trade policy, WTO negotiations and issues of WTO compliance (paragraph 2.226).</inline></para><para>The Government recognises that, now a new WTO Round has been agreed, enhanced consultation with industry, other community groups and State Governments is a key priority. Active consideration is being given to the most appropriate structure. As noted in response to Recommendation 8, the Government will be seeking to enhance consultative mechanisms with specific industry sectors that have an interest in the WTO or bilateral trade negotiations. Some of these mechanisms are already in place (e.g. with respect to agriculture), and the Government will be engaging with the relevant sectoral bodies to examine whether or how to strengthen existing consultative processes. There may be a need to establish new bodies for other sectors, now that the WTO round is under way. Such consultative bodies will perform the role of sectoral advisory committees of the kind outlined in the Committee's recommendation. </para><para>As noted above, the Government already has a range of formal and informal consultation channels on WTO-related issues, notably the Trade Policy Advisory Council, the Agricultural Trade Consultative Group and the WTO Advisory Group. The latter includes representatives from industry, community NGOs, academics and the union movement, and is the peak industry/NGO consultative body on WTO-related matters. Its role in providing the Government with expert advice on Australia's interests relevant to the WTO will take on new importance during the course of a round. DFAT also conducts separate regular consultations with NGO groups interested in trade issues. The National Trade Consultations also provide an opportunity for industry and States/Territories to put forward views on trade policy priorities.</para><para>The Senior Executive of DFAT also holds regular meetings with heads of industry associations to discuss trade policy issues. The Department's Market Access Facilitators provide another channel for close contact with exporting industries.</para><para>Austrade also consults broadly with representatives from key industry sectors through its Export Advisory Panels (EAP). The Panels have provided guidance and advice to key industry players on the strategic approaches Austrade has adopted to assist Australian companies pursue international business in their industry sectors. At present there are five panels covering the industry sectors of agribusiness, automotive, ICT, infrastructure and mining. </para><para>The officials-level Standing Committee on Treaties (SCOT) provides an additional mechanism for regular Commonwealth-State consultations on trade issues. </para><para>Recommendation 10</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">EXPERT LEGAL PANELS</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade establish a WTO advisory panel of legal advisers with trade expertise from the private profession and from academia. The legal advisory panel would:</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">provide advice about the WTO compliance of domestic policies and programs, associated risks and in relation to breaches and possible dispute actions by Member countries; and</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">constitute a panel of legal experts in trade issues upon which the Government can draw to supplement and augment the resources of Commonwealth agencies, when required (paragraph 2.227).</inline></para><para>The Department believes the establishment of a separate advisory panel, with the range of functions proposed by the Committee, would have a number of limitations. First, and particularly in relation to compliance issues, there is a need to avoid potential conflicts of interest and confidentiality issues, including at Cabinet and commercial level. Advice on compliance typically requires a considerable amount of detail to be provided on, for example, the financial and other aspects of specific projects in order to assess fully the WTO implications, and this requires strict confidentiality provisions. </para><para>A second, and related, point is that the provision of WTO legal advice is an ongoing process and one that is often carried out within very tight timeframes. It could be both expensive and time-consuming to have such matters referred to an external panel for consideration. In the compliance area, for example, advice is often provided in parallel with the development of a specific program or project over a lengthy period of time. The Department encourages this approach to ensure that WTO issues are addressed as part of the program/project design. The involvement of a panel of legal experts in such cases could inhibit this process and divert Departmental resources away from core functions. </para><para>A third issue concerns the importance of ensuring that trade law services are provided within a broader policy context. A feature of the current arrangements is the integration of legal advice with policy advice and recommendations. This reflects the reality of the trade law field, including Australia's broader policy objectives in the WTO. But the main aim in this approach is to ensure that advice to Ministers reflects fully Australia's national interests. It would appear unlikely that an advisory panel of the kind proposed would be able to present a similar national interest perspective. </para><para>Finally, the expert panel proposal appears to have arisen in part from a perception that the Commonwealth's trade law resources need to be augmented. This fails to recognise fully the expansion in the resources dedicated to WTO legal work in DFAT. As outlined in Recommendation 8, DFAT established the WTO Trade Law Branch at the beginning of 2001 to strengthen the Department's legal capacity with regard to WTO dispute settlement and compliance. The WTO Trade Law Branch draws on the assistance of a wide range of agencies depending on the subject matter. That includes policy and technical expertise from agencies such as Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry Australia and the Australian Customs Service. In addition, advice is also sought from the Attorney-General's Department on international legal issues. </para><para>In general, the Department<inline font-style="italic"></inline>is supportive of other agencies, companies or industry groups engaging external WTO legal expertise and will maintain its existing practice of working with such advisers to achieve outcomes that are in Australia's overall national interest. The Department also keeps open the possibility of seeking external legal advice on a case-by-case basis. </para><para>Recommendation 11</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">LEGAL PROFESSIONAL PARTICIPATION</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that Minister for Trade examine the feasibility of a secondment program between private practice lawyers and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The secondment program should allow at least two lawyers from private practice to spend a period of rotation in DFAT, and conversely for two DFAT officials to spend a period of rotation in private legal practice; in order to broaden their understanding of the operations of the dispute settlement system and the demand for private sector advice on WTO compliance and risk management (paragraph 2.228).</inline></para><para>These recommendations are consistent with current practice. DFAT supports the objective of broadening and deepening understanding of the WTO dispute settlement system in the private sector. A lawyer from a private legal firm was seconded to the WTO Trade Law Branch for a short term assignment in 2001 and a DFAT officer will take up a secondment with a legal firm in 2002. The Department is looking at the possibility of further secondments.</para><para>Recommendation 12</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">AGRICULTURE</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government take a leadership role, acting with like-minded countries, to advance agricultural trade reform through the Cairns Group and with developing countries, to push for a new negotiating round in the WTO and to seek improved market access opportunities for Australia's agriculture and food industries (paragraph 2.273).</inline></para><para>These recommendations are consistent with current policy practice. Australia's leadership of the Cairns Group contributed in no small measure to the ambitious mandate on agriculture in the Ministerial Declaration agreed at the WTO Ministerial Conference in Doha. This was an excellent result for Australia. The Government fully intends that Australia continues its leadership role and expand and enhance its outreach activities with like-minded and developing countries.</para><para>The Doha Declaration committed WTO Members to ambitious negotiations in the three key areas of agricultural reform: substantial improvements in market access; reductions of, with a view to phasing out, all forms of export subsidies; and substantial reductions in trade-distorting domestic support. Throughout the meeting in Doha, the Cairns Group, chaired by Trade Minister Vaile, performed strongly and cohesively in pushing for the inclusion of these negotiating objectives. We have worked closely with key developing countries, including Egypt, India, Pakistan and Kenya, to highlight the benefits of agricultural trade reform by conducting and participating in regional seminars, inviting influential Ministers to Cairns Group meetings and supporting our overseas missions in outreach activities. The Cairns Group also worked closely with the United States in the lead-up to Doha and US Trade Representative Zoellick and Secretary of Agriculture Veneman attended the Cairns Group Ministerial meeting in Uruguay in October 2001.</para><para>In addition to negotiating stronger rules for agricultural trade through the agriculture negotiations, the recent WTO accession negotiations for China and Taiwan will provide new market access opportunities for Australia's agriculture and food industries. The Government will continue to pursue market access opportunities bilaterally and through the negotiations of free trade agreements and trade and investment facilitation agreements currently under consideration. </para><para>Recommendation 13</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">DISPUTE SETTLEMENT UNDERSTANDING</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government take a proactive role in review of the Dispute Settlement Understanding, in particular:</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">to advocate a more responsive timeframe for compliance and enforcement; and</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">to identify opportunities for more effective use of the mediation and conciliation provided in Article 5 of the Dispute Settlement Understanding to assist with appropriate and timely compliance with rulings (paragraph 2.293).</inline></para><para>These recommendations are consistent with current practice. Australia is taking an active role in the review of the Dispute Settlement Understanding (DSU). The main issues relate to the authorisation, exercise and surveillance of retaliation rights and compliance. What constitutes a reasonable timeframe for compliance and enforcement will vary according to circumstances. Problems with timeframes frequently relate less to the implementation period than to the duration of the litigation period. </para><para>Australia has an interest in ensuring that timeframes for the conduct of dispute proceedings and for implementation are fair and equitable. It should be noted that in some instances, reductions in procedural timeframes for litigation could disadvantage Australian companies with an interest in a particular dispute, for example if such proposals were to deny rights of appeal or limit Australia's capacity to pursue its interests in a case effectively. At the same time, shorter timeframes for resolution are possible if the parties to a dispute agree on a basis for settlement.</para><para>Australia supports bilateral resolution as the most expeditious means of dispute resolution. Wherever feasible, the Government will continue to seek a mutually acceptable resolution to complaints as an alternative to legally adjudicated processes in the WTO. The Government is also ready to consider the arbitration alternatives of the DSU, such as those of Article 5 and 25. Recourse to such alternatives, however, requires agreement between the parties to a dispute, which may not always be forthcoming.</para><para>Recommendation 14</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">QUARANTINE</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government, in consultation with State and Territory governments and the community:</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">develop written policy guidelines and operational procedures that describe Australia's `Appropriate Level of Protection' for quarantine; and</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">that the guidelines involve benchmarks for determination of environmental factors and the application of the Precautionary Principle (paragraph 2.326).</inline></para><para>The current Biosecurity Australia Guidelines for Import Risk Analysis provide a practical approach for AFFA officers, risk analysts and stakeholders to the application of risk management against Australia's Appropriate Level of Protection (ALOP). This is done using a risk estimation matrix which has been adapted from the Australia-New Zealand Standard on risk management.</para><para>Although Australia's existing ALOP statement has been confirmed by a WTO dispute settlement panel as being sufficiently detailed to meet our obligations under the SPS Agreement, the Commonwealth is examining with the State and Territory Governments the possibility of developing a more detailed statement on ALOP.</para><para>The Government believes, however, that there is no need to refer to the precautionary principle when describing Australia's ALOP which already incorporates a cautious and highly conservative approach. The recommendation, and the discussion in the Report, does not take into account the difference between exercising precaution (as reflected in Australia's ALOP) and invoking the precautionary principle.</para><para>Separately, the Commonwealth's Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and its associated regulations and administration already include guidelines on the application of the precautionary principle. Biosecurity Australia and Environment Australia work together to ensure that protection of the environment is appropriately addressed in animal and plant import risk analyses, including through shared assessments of weediness and pest potential. These issues were also the subject of considerable discussion in relation to the risk assessments undertaken by the Gene Technology Regulator (who issues licences for all uses of GMOs). </para><para>Recommendation 15 </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">WTO COMPLIANCE</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade (in consultation with other relevant Ministers) devise a WTO compliance checklist to be used by all Ministers and their officials when developing new industry support programs (paragraph 2.356).</inline></para><para>This recommendation is consistent with current practice. DFAT has provided, and makes readily available, an outline of current WTO rules relating to subsidies and investment incentives. This outline provides details on measures that would be inconsistent with WTO obligations. It also provides guidance on WTO jurisprudence and the types of factors that are typically examined by WTO dispute settlement panels in determining whether industry support measures constitute prohibited subsidies. DFAT also conducts seminars tailored to deal with issues relating to subsidies, investment incentives and other compliance issues.</para><para>Recommendation 16</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">COMMONWEALTH/STATE CONSULTATIONS</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Minister for Trade ensure that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade places a high priority on consulting with State and Territory Governments on trade related matters. The relationship between the Commonwealth and State governments should involve:</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">regular, at least annual, ministerial level meetings;</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">inclusion of State and Territory representatives on WTO consultation taskforces, where special understanding or expertise can be brought to bear; and</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-style="italic">inclusion of State and Territory representatives on official WTO delegations, where special understanding or expertise can be brought to bear and where there is a willingness on the part of the State or Territory governments to recognise over-riding international obligations (paragraph 2.370).</inline></para><para>The high priority the Government places on consulting with State/Territory Governments is reflected by existing regular consultation on trade matters, principally through the National Trade Consultation process, where Ministers meet annually and senior officials meet twice yearly intersessionally, as well as through ongoing bilateral discussions on specific issues. State/Territory Government representatives had the opportunity to put forward views on the WTO during consultations held in capital cities in June/July 2001. Some State/Territory agencies have established inter-departmental committees to coordinate exchanges with the Commonwealth on WTO-related issues. As part of its Parliamentary obligations, the Government consults with State/Territory Governments in preparing responses to all Parliamentary Committees, including the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties.</para><para>DFAT proposes to continue its practice of including State/Territory government representatives on WTO dispute task forces, if requested. In WTO disputes involving a complaint against a State/Territory measure, the Department would also continue to invite State/Territory government representative/s to join the official delegation to WTO dispute hearings. </para><para>The Government will examine the merits of including State and Territory representatives on official WTO delegations, in cases where special understanding or expertise can be brought to bear<inline font-style="italic">, </inline>and where meeting arrangements make this practical.</para><para>Recommendation 17</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">TRADE, ENVIRONMENT AND MULTI-LATERAL ENVIRONMENT AGREEMENTS</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government use its position on the WTO Committee on Trade and Environment (CTE) to urge the CTE to bring forward clear proposals for resolution of the issue of potential conflicts in obligations under different multilateral agreements (paragraph 3.110).</inline></para><para>WTO Ministers agreed at Doha to negotiations on the relationship between WTO rules and specific trade obligations in multilateral environment agreements (MEAs). Ministers also agreed to negotiate on procedures for regular information exchange between MEA Secretariats and relevant WTO committees. Australia will be participating in these negotiations with a view to supporting practical measures for advancing trade and environmental policy priorities, while guarding against outcomes that could lead to trade protectionist measures. </para><para>The question of the coherence between the provisions of MEAs and WTO obligations is a complex one. The exceptions language in the GATT/WTO (Article XX of GATT 1994), which applies to environmental measures, has been interpreted by a number of dispute settlement panels and the Appellate Body. Overall, the WTO dispute settlement system has shown itself capable of taking into account appropriate environmental concerns.</para><para>Recommendation 18 </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">REGIONAL TRADE AGREEMENTS</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government ensure that Australia continues to actively participate on the WTO Committee on Regional Trade Agreements, and pursue Regional Trade Agreements that will result in enhanced market access and broader economic gains for Australia if those benefits cannot be advanced expeditiously through other mechanisms (paragraph 3.134).</inline></para><para>These recommendations are consistent with current policy. The Government will continue to participate actively in the WTO's Committee on Regional Trade Agreements (CRTA). The CRTA has a key role to play in ensuring the transparency of regional trade agreements (RTAs) and promoting their strict adherence to WTO rules. This function is likely to grow in importance with the proliferation of RTAs around the world and it is in Australia's interest that the potential for trade diversion arising from these agreements be kept to a minimum. The Government welcomes the decision taken by WTO Ministers in Doha to undertake negotiations aimed at clarifying and improving disciplines and procedures under the WTO rules on RTAs. The Government will take an active part in these negotiations.</para><para>The Government also agrees with the Committee's recommendation that Australia pursue RTAs that result in better market access for Australia. The Government pursues an integrated multilateral, regional and bilateral approach to trade policy and it is the Government's policy to consider RTAs if they would deliver substantial gains to Australia that could not be achieved in a similar timeframe by other means. Furthermore, the Government believes that RTAs that are comprehensive in scope and coverage can complement our wider multilateral objectives. Consistent with this policy, the Government is currently pursuing a number of regional trade initiatives including negotiations with Singapore for an FTA, a joint scoping study on a possible FTA with Thailand, a possible FTA with the US, continuing work on a Closer Economic Partnership between AFTA and CER, and separate initiatives with Korea and Japan to strengthen economic relations. </para><para>Recommendation 19</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">DEVELOPING COUNTRIES</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth Government through its membership of the Cairns Group identify barriers to participation of developing countries in the WTO, and develop strategies as appropriate to assist developing countries to make full use of the WTO and the DSU to further their trading interests (paragraph 3.178).</inline></para><para>This recommendation is consistent with current policy. Australia, as chair of the Cairns Group, has been leading the Group's outreach activities to developing countries. The Cairns Group, 14 members of which are developing countries, has assisted other developing countries enhance their participation in the WTO agriculture negotiations, and further their trading interests through the agricultural reform agenda. This has been done through technical assistance, seminars and information-sharing.</para><para>Australia is also active in discussions within the WTO to ensure that the needs of developing countries are adequately addressed and is involved in a range of initiatives providing technical assistance and capacity building to developing countries to support their participation in the WTO and to gain benefits from trade.

WTO Member countries in the Asia/Pacific region have been active participants in the WTO dispute settlement system since its establishment in 1995. These countries have not shown any unwillingness to participate in disputes because of the need to travel to Geneva. Creation of a separate WTO regional centre could also duplicate a substantial range of training and capacity building programs to assist developing countries provided through APEC and bilateral and multilateral aid programs, including through Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC), the Association of South East Asian Nations (ASEAN) and the Commonwealth Trade and Investment Access Facility (TIAF).  </para><para>In response to the needs of developing countries, and particularly non-resident members, the WTO has enhanced the design and delivery of its technical assistance and capacity building programs. At the 4th Ministerial Conference, members also agreed to develop work programs to examine issues relating to the trade of small economies. Economic and technical cooperation activities in APEC also assist members address structural, policy and administrative bottlenecks and establish the conditions for growth and development. For example, through the APEC Support Program, Australia has supported small, high-impact activities by Australian Government departments and statutory authorities aimed at enhancing developing member economy participation in APEC.

This committee reported in September last year and it has taken the minister a year to decide to reject all of its recommendations for change. The Democrats initiated this inquiry into ABC board appointments because of the serious concern about the politicisation of ABC board appointments. During Labor's 13 years in office, they made 26 board appointments, which included a former Labor Premier, a former disendorsed Liberal senator and minister, four trade union activists, four advisers to Labor governments and the Labor Party's former party pollster. These appointments were so blatant that the then shadow minister, one Senator Alston, in 1994 said:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That will come as a great disappointment to all those who are looking to the government to take this opportunity to make appointments to the board on the basis of merit and to boost the community standing and reputation of the ABC ... This blatant board stacking exercise endangers the independence and integrity of the ABC and has the potential to do grave danger to Australia's international reputation. </para></motion><para>My, how things change. The ABC's historian, Professor Ken Ingliss, has told this committee:</para><quote><para>Most of the directors appointed since the Howard government took office have been formally or informally identifiable as supporters of the Coalition ... In the narrow sense of party political appointments of people known to be close or sympathetic to the government of the day, I think there is more of that now than there has been at any time between 1983 and 1995.</para></quote><para>It is worth noting that the current ABC board includes Michael Kroger, a former Victorian Liberal president; Ross McLean, a former Liberal federal MP; Donald McDonald, a friend of the Prime Minister; Judith Sloan, a long-time conservative adviser to Liberal governments; and Leith Boully, a former Country Liberal Party member. Until recently, its managing director was a former Young Liberals president, Jonathan Shier. In anyone's language it is hard to describe such a board as `genuine and impartial', to use Senator Alston's 1994 benchmark.</para><para>The committee chair's report made some excellent recommendations to overcome the bias inherent in ABC appointments. It recommends that board appointments be based on merit and transparency, that directors be expected to have a commitment to public broadcasting, that formal selection criteria be developed, that vacancies be advertised, that an independent selection panel shortlist applicants, that political affiliations be declared and that the chair be elected by the board rather than be appointed by the minister. This package of reforms broadly follows a practice put in place by the British government.</para><para>Unbelievably, the minister has rejected all of these recommendations, arguing that it would create a `cumbersome process' and that `there is no compelling reason to alter it'. Yes, I agree: it will be a more cumbersome process than a minister getting on the phone to some Liberal Party hack and offering an ABC board sinecure. But it will be a better process. Yes, of course, the minister would see no compelling reason to change the process when he has done more than any other minister in history to stack the ABC board with political mates. This government has also, remember, cut the ABC's funding by $55 million. It attacks its independence at every opportunity and it stacks its board with mates just to make sure.</para><para>Where does Labor stand in all this? Senator Bishop's report saw merit in selection criteria and the advertising of vacancies, he called for further investigation into the merits of alternative processes for selecting appointments and he called for an increase of funding as `the most important means of ensuring the independence of the ABC'. More recently in May, shadow minister Lindsay Tanner said, `Labor will be exploring means of improving the ABC board appointments process to end the appointment of political stooges to the ABC board.' Let us hope that, unlike Senator Alston, Labor's spokesman carries that commitment into government. The ABC is an Australian institution and it needs the best possible leaders to fulfil its role impartially and in the public interest. The Democrats will continue to agitate for an ABC that represents all of us, not just the Liberal Party's chosen few.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>4043</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to continue my remarks later in relation to the government's response to the Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Above Board?

This is our Review of Auditor-General's Reports for the first, second and third quarters of 2001-2002. Of the 38 audit reports reviewed, the Committee selected four for further examination.</para><para>Mr President, the Committee held a public hearing on Friday, 31 May 2002 to discuss these ANAO Reports with the relevant Commonwealth agencies. I will briefly discuss issues in each of the selected reports in turn.</para><para>Audit Report No. 3 focused on the operation of the Australian Taxation Office's (ATO) administration of taxation rulings. The audit found that the processes for the production of public rulings of high technical quality operated effectively overall but the collection, analysis and use of performance information could be enhanced in some areas. The audit also noted that the administrative processes for private rulings had operated poorly in many respects.</para><para>The Committee acknowledges the complex taxation matters dealt with and the rigorous review and approval processes employed by the ATO in issuing its public rulings. The Committee encourages the ATO to continue to improve its processes to enhance the clarity and content of public rulings.</para><para>The Committee considers that the ATO will have to monitor and assess the effectiveness and efficiency of procedures it has implemented to control the production of Private Binding Rulings and to ensure their quality.</para><para>Audit Report No 4 focussed on the sale of nine properties in seven case studies, with a total value of $619 m, and considered whether the property sale represented value for money to the Commonwealth.</para><para>While the Committee accepts that the differing views of the ANAO and DOFA as to the effectiveness of the properties sale are derived from differing policy perspectives on the matter, greater attention should have been paid to providing the Government with ongoing advice about the hurdle rate, especially as the economic factors were changing rapidly. In addition, DOFA should be considering the whole-of-life costs and benefits for each property to ensure that the Commonwealth achieves best value for money and actions taken are in its best interests.  </para><para>The Committee endorses the audit suggestion that sale management better practices identified in Audit Report No. 4 should be applied to future Commonwealth property sales, including the forthcoming scheduled major sales at CSIRO and in the Defence portfolio.</para><para>When examining ANAO's Report No. 30, 1999-2000 Examination of the Federation Cultural and Heritage Projects Program, the Committee made two recommendations regarding grant programs. In particular the Committee recommended that all applicants, successful or otherwise, should be notified of the decision as soon as possible in writing and that those who were unsuccessful should be advised of relevant appeal processes and provided with guidance for improving subsequent applications.</para><para>The Committee was therefore concerned to find, when reviewing Audit Report No. 11, Administration of the Federation Fund Program, 2001-2002, that the time gap between decisions and announcements in the Major Projects program varied markedly. Having reviewed the audit report and considered the evidence presented, the Committee believes that the Federation Fund program would have been better managed from the start if a Commonwealth agency had been formally assigned a coordinating role and given monitoring responsibilities before actual applications were sought. Such coordination would have facilitated better sharing of experience and expertise across administering departments for the Federation Fund program.</para><para>Audit Report No 22 reviewed a number of agencies to determine whether organisations were managing security clearance and vetting processes effectively and efficiently and in accordance with Commonwealth policy and the Protective Security Manual (PSM) 2000.</para><para>The audit found considerable scope for improvement. All but one of the organisations reviewed had a large number of security clearances overdue for review, few organisations had an up-to-date protective security risk management assessment and none had effectively integrated risk assessments into personnel security arrangements. The audit also found that effective information management systems were not in place to support personnel security in some organisations, and in most organisations, insufficient resources were allocated to the personnel security function to maintain new clearance requirements as well as clearance reviews.</para><para>The Committee recommends that all agencies allocate the resources necessary to bring their security clearance processes in line with the requirements of the Protective Security Manual, and that all agencies make the necessary changes to the Human Resource Management Information System to support management reporting in relation to security clearances and appropriate access to security clearance information.</para><para>May I conclude, Mr President, by thanking on behalf of the Committee, the witnesses who contributed their time and expertise to the Committee's review process. </para><para>I am also indebted to my colleagues on the Committee who have dedicated their time and effort to reviewing these Auditor-General's reports. As well, I would like to thank the members of the secretariat who were involved in the inquiries. </para><para>Mr President, I commend the Report to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>4045</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>—Order!

This issue has been raised by the opposition on a number of occasions in question time this week.</para><para>We are aware that the Minister for Health and Ageing has been provided with the figures for the June 2002 quarter in relation to the level of bulk-billing of GP services. We understand that the minister has indeed had that information for some time. The minister has not taken any steps at all prior to question time this week, or indeed during this week's sitting of the parliament, to publicly release those figures. The minister has not taken any opportunity—opportunities that have been given to her on a number of occasions in question time in this Senate—to make a statement about what is happening with bulk-billing in this country. Of course, we ask: why not? Why hasn't the minister been prepared to go public, either through this parliament or in the public arena through the media, with a media release or a press conference? Why hasn't the minister been prepared to tell the people the facts about bulk-billing?</para><para>There are two possibilities. The first possibility is that she is not, or has not been, aware of what has been happening with bulk-billing rates. The second possibility is that she has been aware, or she has now become aware during the last couple of days, since the opposition has been able to raise this in question time, but is so ashamed of what those figures will reveal that she does not have the courage to take the step publicly of releasing those figures and commenting upon them.</para><para>Let me deal with the first scenario—that is, the minister has not been aware of the situation. In question time on Tuesday of this week, Senator Patterson was asked specific questions as to whether or not she had seen the bulk-billing statistics for the June quarter of this year. Further, she was asked why they still had not been released. Senator Patterson, in what has become her standard approach to answering questions in question time, refused to answer the question. She stood up in this chamber and waffled on about the health industry, Medicare and bulk-billing—she mentioned bulk-billing—but she never answered the specific questions as to whether she had seen the figures, which apparently were in her office, and as to why she had not released them. When you read in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the minister's answers to the questions we asked on Tuesday, you can only come to the conclusion that at that stage she really was not sure whether or not she had seen the figures. She frankly either did not know or could not remember.</para><para>In answer to a subsequent question which she was asked on Tuesday during question time, the minister stated that the figures would be released at the end of this month. In her answer she said that the figures come from the Health Insurance Commission about six weeks after the end of the quarter, but in the June quarter—presumably because it is the end of the financial year—it may take up to eight weeks and therefore the figures are going to come out at the end of this month. The end of this month is this Saturday. </para><para>So, in the period between the first questions, which were asked of the minister by Senator Collins, and the second questions, which were asked by Senator Crossin, the minister must have suddenly remembered something or obtained some advice from her office or department because she was able to at least try to provide some information to the Senate about what had happened to these figures. But, of course, she did not specifically answer the question as to whether she had seen the figures. I will quote what the minister actually said in answer to the supplementary question from Senator Crossin on Tuesday, who asked:</para><quote><para>Can the minister confirm that has she has seen the June figures?</para></quote><para>Senator Patterson replied:</para><quote><para>Senator Crossin would not know—and most probably will never know ...</para></quote><para>I interpose here to say that this is the sort of smear and insult that you get from the minister when she cannot answer a question: she attacks the person asking the question. She went on: </para><quote><para>... the amount of material that comes into a minister's office. I cannot tell her every single brief that has come in. I am not going to mislead parliament and say that I have not seen those figures yet, but I believe that I have not seen those figures or that minute.</para></quote><para>Here is a minister who does not know what is going on in her own office; she does not know what papers are going across her desk. As she said, she did not want to mislead the parliament, and she earns a tick for that—of course she should never mislead the parliament—but she said she could not say whether she had seen the figures or not. She said `I believe that I have not seen those figures'.</para><para>On the next day, Wednesday, further questions were asked of Senator Patterson. By this time she had had 24 hours to try and get her act together and no doubt, correctly assuming that she would get some further questions on this very important issue, she had tried to do a bit of homework. On Wednesday, in answer to questions about this issue, she ran the line that she did not think it was really her role to release the figures. Her response was that those figures are collected by the Health Insurance Commission and they may be provided to her as the minister—obviously they have to be provided to her as the minister; it just goes without saying, as it is part of the responsibility of the minister and part of the obligation of the Health Insurance Commission. The minister's attitude was that she might get the figures but all she had to do was just note them and have a look at them. On the previous day, she did not know whether she had actually seen them or not or whether she had had a look at them, but by Wednesday she was saying that her role as minister is to just note them and that it is really up to the Health Insurance Commission to release the figures at some point in time.</para><para>But then she had a brain explosion. She tried to go on the offensive and attacked me in response to a speech that I had made following question time on Tuesday. She was no doubt thinking that the best form of defence, particularly when you cannot defend yourself, is to try and go on the attack. I will quote directly from <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> the minister's response to specific questions from Senator Crossin as to why the minister had not released the figures:</para><quote><para>Senator Forshaw said yesterday:</para><para>Those figures have been sitting on the minister's desk for—</para><para>now we understand—</para><para>some weeks, and the minister has refused and declined to make them publicly available.</para></quote><para>So she quoted me, and she went on to say:</para><quote><para>I do not know whether Senator Forshaw sits in my office when I am not there and goes through all the things on my desk. I presume he does not. I hope he does not, or I will get the AFP in to find out why he is in my office.</para></quote><para>What sort of irrational response is this from a minister of the government in this important area of health? She attacked me and asked if I had been in her office. She does not know! Of course the minister does not know. I can assure the minister I have not been in her office. I cannot get into her office because former Minister Wooldridge is probably in her office sitting at her desk and using her computer! This is a minister who did not know that the disgraced former Minister for Health and Aged Care, Michael Wooldridge, who took a retainer from an organisation that he tried to give money to just before he finished his stint as minister for health in the parliament, had been accessing her office and accessing his own emails in the minister's office. </para><para>The one thing that was true about the minister's response was that she does not know what is going on her office. The people of this country know what is going on with Medicare and bulk-billing, and they know that the government is trying by stealth to implement the strategy that it has always had, which is to undermine Medicare. As I stated in my speech the other day, it was the current Prime Minister who, back in 1987 when he was in the opposition, said:</para><quote><para>We will be proposing changes to Medicare which amount to its de facto dismantling ... we'll pull it right apart.</para></quote><para>And I emphasis the words `de facto dismantling', because that is what is happening. This is an under-the-table attempt to undermine and destroy Medicare. John Howard in 1987 also said:</para><quote><para>The second thing we'll do is get rid of the bulk-billing system. It's an absolute rort.</para></quote><para>What an attitude! The current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, the Liberal Party and the National Party woke up one day, after having lost a few elections, to the fact that Medicare is well liked by the Australian community and that they will never vote for a political party that sets out to destroy it. So when the Liberal Party and the National Party finally got desperate enough they ditched their opposition to Medicare—at least publicly. They said, `We understand the people support Medicare, so we will now support Medicare.' I am not sure whether they ever said, `We will never, ever get rid of Medicare,' but they certainly made it clear to the people that they supported Medicare. But since they achieved office in 1996 their policies have led to the decline of bulk-billing and to a threat to the public health system in this country, particularly to Medicare.</para><para>Bulk-billing is a central part of Medicare. It is fundamental to it, and it is overwhelmingly supported by Australians. When Labor introduced Medicare in 1984 the percentage of bulk-billing by GPs started in the low 50s. Over time, as doctors came to appreciate that patients supported the bulk-billing system, the proportion of GP services which were bulk-billed increased steadily. However, since 1996 it has become harder for a person in the community to see a bulk-billing doctor and it has become more expensive for individual Australians and their families to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill. The rate of bulk-billing by GPs peaked at more than 80 per cent around the time the Howard government came to office. Under Labor, when it was first introduced in 1983 by the Hawke government, bulk-billing had gone from around 50 per cent initially through to around 80 per cent. Currently, 74.5 per cent of GP services are bulk-billed. That is a decline of six percentage points, and it is trending downwards.</para><para>In some electorates there have been substantial declines in bulk-billing, particularly in the last couple of years. At the same time, we have a huge increase in the average copayment for a person visiting a GP. It has increased from $8.32 in 1996 to $11.80 today. That is an increase of 41.8 per cent. In recent times, due to the crisis in indemnity health insurance, GPs' and doctors' fees have gone up substantially. Because of the way the bulk-billing system works, until the scheduled fee is increased the Medicare rebate does not increase. So the copayment that has to be paid by a patient visiting a doctor who does not bulk-bill is getting higher and higher. This is affecting many families—families on low incomes and particularly families in rural and regional Australia—and it is a double whammy, because not only are the numbers of doctors who are prepared to bulk-bill decreasing but also the costs that people have to pay to GPs are increasing.</para><para>As I said earlier, the two options were either that the minister did not know what these figures were or that the minister did know what these figures were but was too ashamed to release them. It could be both. It does not really matter, because what is clear is that the minister is incompetent. I guarantee that if these figures had shown an increase in bulk-billing this minister would have been out there taking every opportunity to claim that the government's health policies were working. Minister Patterson would have been out there like former Minister Herron—who I notice is in the chamber today, probably to make his final speech— trying to claim credit for some increase in bulk-billing. But of course it has not occurred. It is trending the other way. So the minister has taken the step of shutting up and hoping that nobody would notice the problem. </para><para>The government has done nothing about trying to deal with the problem of the reduction in bulk-billing and the increase in GP costs. At the same time, they have thrown $2 billion into the private health insurance industry to try and increase the level of private health insurance. Minister Herron will probably get up and claim credit for that. Day after day we had to listen to those speeches, and we did see a small increase in private health insurance. But it has come at a massive financial cost: $2 billion through the rebate for private health insurance. It has not stopped the private health insurance premiums going up, and as they go up the level of the rebate goes up. The dollar figure goes up because it is a fixed 30 per cent. This does not happen with bulk-billing. It is about time this government focused back on public health, focused back on endeavouring to support Medicare, support bulk-billing, and focused on doing something to address this crisis. This minister will not; it is about time the Prime Minister appointed a minister who will.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>4049</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam Acting Deputy President, you will forgive me if I have a case of deja vu in the sense that when I was on the other side of the chamber I delivered a speech almost identical to that of Senator Forshaw—I think I was 12 years younger and about the same age as Senator Forshaw might be now.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator Forshaw</name></talker><para>—It was a great speech.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name></talker><para>—He gave me an in because he said, `It was a great speech.'

The result is a public hospital system that is overcrowded and underfunded, while resources in private hospitals are under-used. Waiting lists for elective surgery—particularly in Victoria and New South Wales—have lengthened dramatically. On top of this, many privately insured patients occupy public beds. In 1989 privately insured patients occupied 25 per cent of the total acute patient bed days in public hospitals. Inevitably, this has affected all public hospital patients and those waiting to be public hospital patients.</para><para>Under Medicare, health insurance has become a luxury.

Just as members of this Senate have experienced in their own lifetimes the significant advances in communication, television, computers, facsimile machines and satellites, we in medicine have seen even more dramatic advances—computerised tomography (CT) x-ray, ultrasound scanning, magnetic resonance imaging, renal, liver and cardiac transplantation, ear implants, joint and lens replacement and coronary artery surgery, to name but a few.</para></quote><para>And this I found prophetic:</para><quote><para>Genetic engineering is on track for the future.</para><para>While the increase in life expectancy has primarily come from the virtual elimination of infectious diseases and alteration in lifestyle, there is no doubt that the quality of life has been enormously enhanced by these procedures. The effect on health care expenditure has been dramatic. The use of ultrasound and CT scanning has doubled every two years. In 1983 there were 75 CT units in Australia. Today there are 230.</para></quote><para>That was in 1990. I checked the figures today and, in 2002, there are approximately 400 CT units and 120 MRI scanners in Australia. So the prophecy has come true.</para><para>As I mentioned, 12 years ago I gave a similar sort of speech to Senator Forshaw's. What has happened? Let us look at what has happened in the intervening six years that we have been in government. We have improved Medicare. I was sorry to hear Senator Forshaw talk about former Minister Wooldridge, because there will be one great monument to Michael Wooldridge—the increase in the immunisation rate of Australia's children. In 1995, 53 per cent of Australia's children were fully immunised, and it is now over 90 per cent. The increase was entirely due to the direct action of Michael Wooldridge. It was an incredible thing for him to do because it was achieved at his own urging. I pay tribute to him. It will be a memorial to him, whatever else might have occurred.</para><para>That rate of immunisation occurred due to the inaction of the former Labor government. They were talking this rhetoric about figures and numbers without understanding what was occurring on the ground, without having a real appreciation of what was more important than talking about bulk-billing and Medicare, but I will come to that in a moment. I want to continue, so I will revert to my speech and read out, in response to Senator Forshaw, a final point that I want to speak about this afternoon. I said then:</para><quote><para>... the continuing cost burden of pharmaceuticals must be addressed. The high price of some of the life saving wonder drugs of the 1940s led Australian governments of both political parties to develop schemes to provide free or subsidised drugs. The pharmaceutical benefits scheme (PBS) was the final version. In 1982 total expenditure was $688m. In 1990-91 it is estimated that the cost will exceed $1.5 billion ...</para></quote><para>If we could only see what has occurred since then. I said then:</para><quote><para>The recent Budget announcements do not address the long-term consequences of these cost increases.</para></quote><para>We then had six long years of Labor's inactivity. What was Labor's record in that six years? It failed to deliver meaningful solutions to rural health. It allowed a decline in rural health services and an exodus of GPs from rural and regional Australia. Labor failed to immunise Australia's children, as I mentioned, and that immunisation rate of 53 per cent was well below that of China, Algeria, Laos and Vietnam under Labor. What a record. You cannot be proud of that, Senator Forshaw. Labor failed to adequately fund the public hospital system. In its 13 years in government, there were these long public hospital lists that I alluded to—an ever-increasing pressure on the Medicare system.</para><para>Labor failed to improve Indigenous health, which is one of the things that I helped Michael Wooldridge tackle. In 1996, the National Aboriginal Health Strategy had collapsed and the health of Indigenous Australians was poorer than it had been in 1983. I am not blaming the Labor Party for that; I would not pretend that it was entirely due to that. I see Senator McLucas is here, and she is aware of the fact that it is something that has been taken up by Noel Pearson and, I understand, Patrick Dodson and Peter Yu. The symbolism of all that stuff is not doing anything about Aboriginal health. Until Aboriginal people understand that they must stop smoking, that they must stop drinking to excess and that they must exercise, we will not see fundamental improvements. Those three Indigenous leaders that I mentioned are recognising that too, rather than talking about other things. </para><para>I think it was Noel Pearson who said, `Genocide is occurring today in the Aboriginal people because of the social consequences of the past.' I do not disagree with that. Back in 1996, when I went to over 300 communities and asked what was occurring there, before I even tackled anything, I enunciated what the Aboriginal people in the communities were telling me—not the people who were living off the cause rather than for it. It is interesting that what has now become the cry from the Aboriginal communities themselves by these so-called leaders was not recognised at the time. I recall—and I am sorry for waxing lyrical about this— when I went to the first ATSIC board meeting and asked them what they were doing about family violence. It was not called `domestic violence' in Aboriginal communities; it was `family violence' because it affected the uncles and the aunties and the grandparents as well. The response from the ATSIC board of commissioners was, `What family violence?' I just found that incredible. I pointed out to them that at that time I was actually treating, at the Mater Hospital in Brisbane where we looked after the Aboriginal people of Brisbane, three women in one ward who had been smashed up, one who was later murdered and another who died on the operating table—and I was told that it did not exist.</para><para>But that is behind us, and I am pleased to see that the issue is now being taken up and addressed by the community leaders themselves. I am pleased to tell you that this Friday night, in Brisbane, Bonnie Robertson— who has had no recognition from any other group in the Australian community—will be awarded the inaugural Bennelong Society Medal for her contribution to bringing to the forefront the status of violence against women in Aboriginal communities in her groundbreaking report, and we will be awarding certificates of appreciation from the Bennelong Society to the 42 women who contributed to that report.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLucas</name></talker><para>—And are you funding them to come down from Cape York Peninsula?

As I mentioned before, for the 13 years that Labor was in government, 65 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. By March 1996, this proportion had plummeted to below 34 per cent, even though former health minister Graham Richardson had warned in 1993 that, if private coverage fell below 40 per cent, the entire health system would be in danger of collapsing. In Labor's last five years in office, private health insurance premiums were increasing by an average of eight per cent per year.</para><para>The decline in private health insurance coverage placed unsustainable pressures on the public system and, if left to continue, would have required the building of two large hospitals each year solely to cope with the increase in public demand. Following the introduction of Medicare in 1984, Labor increased the Medicare levy in December 1985, again in July 1993 and once again in 1995. The Medicare levy increases achieved little for the health care system, as Australians moved away from the private sector to the public system, placing an increasing burden on the public hospitals.</para><para>We have improved Medicare, immunised Australia's children, substantially increased funding to the states for public hospitals and taken the pressure off the system by restoring the balance through our initiatives in private health care—and we have given people choice. We have given people a choice to access the public hospital system or, alternatively, the private health care system, which is now affordable. When we were elected in 1996, we took measures that are still coming to fruition and, despite their success, we will maintain our vigilance and continue our hard work to ensure, for example, that our children are protected against other life-threatening but preventable diseases. We are delivering on our commitment to strengthen Medicare. </para><para>Importantly, we are increasing funding to the public hospital system, and under the current Australian health care agreements with the states and territories we are investing another $32 billion in public hospitals over five years—an increase on Labor's previous agreement of 28 per cent, or a massive $7 billion. A cornerstone of our commitment to Medicare has been restoring the balance to our health care system—and we were obviously left with a broken system. Labor's ideological and senseless opposition to private health care—and they are still voicing that rhetoric against private health care—put Medicare and our public hospital system under extreme and unsustainable pressures. I will now refer to the statements about bulk-billing—as if that is going to make an enormous difference one way or the other!</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>VW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name></talker><para>—Senator Forshaw must be aware that chanting a mantra about the percentage of bulk-billing is not going to affect things on the ground.

Going back to 1995, the last full year of the Labor government, $5.7 billion was spent on Medicare services. The most recent data shows that over $7.3 billion has been invested in Medicare by this government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>In the last full year of the Labor government, only 188 million Medicare services were provided. The most recent data shows that 214 million Medicare services were provided—14 per cent more Medicare services provided to Australians each year under the coalition. Commonwealth expenditure on general practice—including Medicare rebates, the Practice Incentive Program and general practice immunisation incentives— will have increased by around 24 per cent in the four years leading up to and including 2002-03. In 1998-99 it was $2.554 billion; in 2002-03 it will be an estimated $3.174 billion, which equals a $620 million, or 24 per cent, increase.</para><para>I want to mention the emphasis that we place on the important matter of bulk-billing performance and put it in perspective. In the December 1995 quarter, under Labor, the national bulk-bill rate was 70.9 per cent. In the March 2002 quarter, under this government, the national bulk-bill rate was 70.5 per cent—a drop of 0.4 per cent. That is hardly a dramatic fall, and this is the rhetoric we are getting—as if the end of the world were nigh because we have had a drop of 0.4 per cent.</para><para>The opposition are attempting to say that this government has a secret agenda to demolish Medicare, and I suggest that they compare the facts before they speak any further. I urge the opposition to start coming up with ideas on the way forward, rather than being locked in the rhetoric of the past. That was the rhetoric that was used 12 years ago—by me, I admit, from the other side of the chamber. The Labor Party have not changed in 12 years. They have no ideas; they are chanting the mantra of bulk-billing—there has been a drop of 0.4 per cent—and they are still locked into that. The opposition made assertions, for example, that Senator Patterson's office and I were deliberately withholding information and that the June quarter Medicare performance statistics had been sitting on the desk for weeks.

We are increasingly concerned about the decline in the rate of bulk-billing under the current government. The Minister for Health and Ageing has acknowledged that the June quarter figures from the Health Insurance Commission show that the number of doctors who will bulk-bill continues to fall. At the same time, we are seeing a steady increase in the average copayment or cost to patient of a visit to a doctor. This cost has gone up 40 per cent since 1996. It is becoming harder to find a bulk-billing doctor and more expensive to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill. Doctors are moving out of areas where there are high numbers of disadvantaged patients.</para><para>General practitioners play a vital coordination and primary care role in Australia's health care system. The current fee payment systems do not reward coordinated and continuing care or encourage high quality care for complex patients. GPs who practise in remote communities and in disadvantaged urban areas often face increased demands without adequate financial recognition. We Democrats believe that as a priority GPs should be adequately rewarded for their coordination work. </para><para>Why is it that fewer and fewer doctors are prepared to bulk-bill? The Medicare rebate simply is not high enough. The relative value study undertaken by the AMA and the Department of Health and Ageing in 2000 showed that clearly. As more and more doctors give up on bulk-billing, because they are not sufficiently remunerated for their long hours and responsibility, more and more patients will head to the hospital accident and emergency departments. Bulk-billing is a valuable part of an effective public health system and is one of the best ways of guaranteeing access to health care for everyone in a community. This downward trend in the rate of bulk-billing looks disturbingly like further evidence of the government's inability or disinclination to support Medicare.</para><para>Before the 1996 election, John Howard said that he was fully committed to Medicare, including bulk-billing. However, in the intervening years various actions by his government suggest that it is moving away from a commitment to what has been regarded as one of the best public health systems in the world. Although the government continues to express support for Medicare, it is slowly moving away from the Medicare system as it was originally conceived. Instead of putting extra resources into solving the problems of the public health system, the government has put a massive amount of money, some $2.5 billion a year, into subsidising private health insurance—despite its demonstrated inefficiencies and poor value.</para><para>International experience has shown that health systems which rely predominantly on publicly funded service provision are generally more cost-effective and equitable. Public and private health systems should be complementary, with public hospitals providing a wider range of services and the private medical sector providing the majority of out-of-hospital medical services. Australia has a mixed system, but the government appears determined to shift us closer to a publicly funded private provision model. Reliance on private health insurance will not achieve the universal access and equity which should be cornerstones of our health system.</para><para>The private health insurance rebate costs taxpayers some $2 billion a year. Much of that money ends up in the pockets of the insured or of shareholders in private health funds, not anywhere near the health system. Health funds are the real winners under this system, not those most in need of improved, more appropriate and more timely health care. We must cap and means test the rebate as a high priority, and divert this money directly into the health system to address the areas of real need. While affluent Australians can get treatment within days in the private system, more and more ordinary wage earners, often with very serious conditions, wait for months for urgent appointments and treatment in the public system. Increasing pressure on both federal and state governments to minimise taxes and public expenditure is leading to pressure to reduce spending on health and to change the nature of Medicare. Increasingly it is being seen as a safety net rather than a universal health insurance system. There are calls for means testing in public hospitals, for the choice of opting out of the Medicare levy for those with private health insurance, and for lowering the income threshold above which those without private health insurance pay the extra Medicare levy. These calls are based on the notion of Medicare as a safety net.</para><para>Criticisms of Medicare undermine public confidence in the health care system. We need a well-informed public debate about the state of our current system and about what action is needed to address its weaknesses. Stephen Leeder, a former President of the Public Health Association of Australia, and Dean of the Faculty of Medicine at the University of Sydney, stated:</para><quote><para>The centre of Medicare has always been the provision of effective care for those who need it irrespective of their capacity to pay. If we lose that plot, contemplating instead how we might sell sickness to profit-makers or list it on the stock exchange, we can bid good-bye to equity in health care. This, in turn, would be a serious threat to Australia's standing as a civil society. </para></quote><para>The Australian Democrats believe that Australia deserves an equitable, efficient and high-quality health care system. We are committed to working towards this goal. We are committed to strengthening Medicare and to restoring access and equity to our health care system.

His contribution underlines fundamental philosophical differences between Labor, with our focus on equity and access to health services, and the Liberals' approach. It is very clear from Senator Herron's address that the Liberals' approach is that we can have a two-tiered system with quality health care for those people who have long pockets and second-rate health care for those who find it harder to pay.</para></talk.start><para>The Prime Minister, John Howard, and his coalition government are set on a path of consistently undermining Australia's internationally regarded health system. This government is threatening the fabric of a system designed to provide quality health care to all Australians. Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and our public hospital system are all under attack. The Prime Minister, John Howard, has been undermining these fundamentals of our health system for years. Why? Because he does not believe in Medicare. He said so himself. In a media release in 1986 he stated:</para><quote><para>Medicare has been an unmitigated disaster.</para></quote><para>On radio in June 1987 he said:</para><quote><para>The second thing we'll do is get rid of bulk billing</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>We will be proposing changes to Medicare which amount to its de facto dismantling ... we'll pull it right apart.</para></quote><para>`We'll pull it right apart,' he said. These are quotes from long ago—but we know that Mr Howard is a person with deeply held convictions. He has not changed his mind about Medicare. He still does not believe in Medicare; he is just politically wiser. As Laurie Oakes pointed out last year, Mr Howard does not say what he thinks on politically controversial issues. Instead, according to Mr Oakes, he `dog whistles'. As we know, the human ear cannot hear a dog whistle, but a dog can both hear and understand.</para><para>Like the dog whistler, Mr Howard communicates his message of fear in the subtext, and Mr Howard's subtext is fear. Just read the Intergenerational Report: according to it, we cannot afford basic medicines for the elderly, we cannot afford the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. Under the Howard government, Medicare is not working at its optimum. Finding a bulk-billing doctor is becoming extremely and increasingly difficult. Mr Howard and his Minister for Health and Ageing are not going to come out and say that they want to ditch Medicare and the PBS, but they are going to undermine our health system and claim that it is unsustainable. Mr Howard and a series of health ministers have been doing this since 1996. Why? Because they want a two-tiered health system and, if they cannot introduce their two-tiered health system through the front door, they will do it through the back door.</para><para>Mr Howard's health and education policies are all about providing advantage to those who can pay. Mr Howard, as we know, does not like refugees queue jumping, but he actively promotes it to those with money when it comes to health care and education. Mr Howard promotes the private health care system at every chance he gets, while our public system continues to struggle. The 30 per cent rebate on private health insurance actively encourages people into the private health system. The Howard government's planned increases in pharmaceutical copayments and falling bulk-billing rates increasingly make basic health care unaffordable. This is combined with a public hospital system in crisis because the Howard government continues to cut its funding. </para><para>Information derived from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare shows that the federal government's share of expenditure on public hospitals has been in decline since the Howard government came to office. At the same time, the states' share of public hospital funding has been on the increase. It is estimated that the federal government has cut $628 million out of public hospitals under the current health care agreement with the states. This does not include the extra costs the hospital system has had to bear following the introduction of the GST. During the Senate Community Affairs References Committee healing our hospitals inquiry, the states expressed concern about the impact of the GST on public hospitals. Queensland expressed the view that it would cost an estimated $1.15 million, firstly, to implement the GST in our public hospitals and $4 million a year to administer it. As every small business person would testify, no doubt the Queensland government underestimated the costs of the GST implementation. This government is saying that, if you want quality hospital care, you need private health insurance. This is the Howard way, and this is the Liberal way. You only have to briefly examine the history of health care in this country to understand this.</para><para>When Labor was elected in 1941, Chifley was determined to implement a national health service. However, the civil conscription clause in the Constitution limiting the regulation of doctors and the election of the Menzies government in 1949 prevented Labor at that time establishing a national health service. Then in 1953, Menzies—whom we all know Mr Howard idolises—established the Earl Page system. The scheme was primarily a method whereby the Commonwealth government subsidised private health insurance by meeting part of the cost of rebates for medical expenses. I am sure we can hear the similarities to systems that we have had from the Liberal Party ever since. Administered by private non-profit health funds, the scheme was voluntary. However, membership of a health fund was a necessary condition for receiving the government subsidy for medical bills. Other key planks of the Earl Page system were a limited pharmaceutical benefits scheme and a pensioners' medical service limited to those receiving Commonwealth old age and invalid pensions.</para><para>When Labor was re-elected in 1972, Whitlam again proposed a national health service, and Medibank was eventually born. However, Labor had to fight the coalition opposition to establish Medibank. The opposition controlled the Senate and blocked the bills establishing Medibank, forcing the double dissolution election to be called in 1974. Health care was a centrepiece of the subsequent election campaign, which we know, of course, Labor won; but the coalition again blocked the legislation in the Senate. Medibank was therefore only established following a joint sitting of the Senate and the House of Representatives in August 1974. With the election of the Fraser government, of which John Howard eventually became Treasurer, the coalition once again began the process of dismantling Medibank. By 1981 there was essentially a return to the Earl Page scheme, with Commonwealth subsidies only paid to members of registered funds. Contributions to funds became eligible for taxation rebates, and eventually free treatment in hospitals was eliminated in every state except Queensland. All of us in Queensland will remember the battle that was had within the coalition for the retention of the free health system.</para><para>Liberals have always been opposed to a public health system with equal access for all Australians—and, I am afraid to say, the National Party of today is no different. With Labor in power for an extended period, from 1983 to 1996, Australia finally obtained the health system it deserves. Medicare was established, and Australia finally had a universal health system—a system where everybody would have access to quality health care. As we know, Medicare had three objectives: to make health care affordable for all Australians, to give Australians access to health care services with priority according to clinical need and to provide a high quality of care. The Liberal Party have always fought against the notion of equal access to health care. They are still opposed to that, and this brief history demonstrates that. Most Australians, however, value Medicare and understand the need for a health care system where you are treated based on your need rather than on the size of your wallet. They want a fair system and one where everybody has access to quality health care. Mr Howard, as I said earlier, understands the political consequences of openly attacking Medicare. Mr Howard campaigned against Medicare in 1984, 1987, 1990, 1993, and he lost all of those elections. He is not going to go there again. </para><para>Medicare provides free or subsidised treatment by doctors and specialists. Through Medicare, the government will pay all, or a substantial part, of your doctor's bills. When a doctor bulk-bills, Medicare pays your entire doctor's fee. Bulk-billing is, therefore, the centrepiece of Medicare. When Labor introduced Medicare in 1984, the percentage of bulk-billing by GPs started in the low 50s. In 1997, shortly after the Howard government took office, bulk-billing peaked at just over 80 per cent. Under Labor, bulk-billing increased from 50 per cent to 80 per cent. But, as we know, it has been in decline ever since.</para><para>Since 1996, it has become harder and harder to see a doctor who bulk-bills and more expensive for Australians and their families to see a doctor who does not bulk-bill. Figures for the March 2002 quarter show that only 74.5 per cent of GP services are bulk-billed nationally and that the average copayment for someone seeing a GP has increased from $8.32 in 1996 to $11.80 today—an increase of almost 42 per cent. The figures are worse for regional and rural Australia. In the electorates of Dawson and Kennedy, bulk-billing rates are around 65 per cent. In the twin cities of Townsville and Thuringowa, the GP bulk-billing rate has steadily declined, dropping to 59.1 per cent in March 2000—one of the worst in the country. Bulk-billing has reached a critical level in Townsville and Thuringowa, with many patients now having to travel considerable distances to see a doctor who bulk-bills. There is a significant risk that many people will put off seeing, or simply not see, a doctor, because they just cannot afford the copayment. Alternatively, and increasingly, they will end up in the public hospital emergency section, placing extra pressure on the already struggling public hospital system.</para><para>Having access to a GP is fundamental to promoting access to primary health care and preventive medicine. Treating people in hospitals is far more expensive than in general practice. We need to keep people out of our hospitals to ensure the long-term sustainability of our public health system. By forcing people into the public hospital system, the federal government is effectively shifting the cost of Medicare on to the states. We can see the impact of declining bulk-billing rates throughout North Queensland. In Cairns we have seen the closure of the Cairns after-hours GP service, because of the failure of the federal government to effectively fund Medicare. This has put an increasing strain on the Cairns Base Hospital. Emergency department attendances jumped by 6.3 per cent in Cairns between June quarter 2001 and June quarter 2002. Almost all public hospitals in Queensland are facing a similar situation due to the decline in bulk-billing and the closure of after-hours services.</para><para>There are more worrying signs for bulk-billing on the horizon. With GPs facing rising medical indemnity insurance premiums, there is a real danger that declining rates of bulk-billing could go into free fall. Unless confidence in medical indemnity is restored, premiums held at realistic levels and restoration of bulk-billing made a priority, there is a real danger that bulk-billing practices will fall further. The Howard government's failure to address the looming medical indemnity crisis has added extra costs for GPs and other medical practitioners, further discouraging them from bulk-billing. We have seen some doctors trying to apply surcharges of between $2 and $6 to their usual fee to cover the soaring medical indemnity insurance costs. </para><para>In the past few months I have met with divisions of general practice in Cairns, Townsville and Mackay. I was formerly a community representative of the Cairns Division of General Practice, prior to being elected to parliament. The issues raised in Cairns and Townsville related to after-hours services and indemnity. In Mackay, members expressed concerns to me about the corporatisation of their health service, mainly through the provision of the software for their computer systems. They also told me about the bowel cancer project they are undertaking, admittedly without any funds at this point in time but they are hopeful of getting some.</para><para>I also met recently with the AMA and representatives from specialist colleges. Doctors have told me about the difficulties they are facing and the concerns they have for their patients and the health care system. Doctors do not like being unable to bulk-bill. They understand that those most in need of health care, the elderly and the chronically sick, cannot afford in many cases to pay for that health care. Doctors are struggling to fund their practices under the current government's funding arrangements. Their costs continue to increase, particularly with the current medical indemnity insurance crisis, and they have to pass these costs on to patients. Increasingly they are telling me that they cannot bulk-bill and that, if they do, it will only be in very exceptional cases.</para><para>The medical indemnity crisis has also increased pressure on the public hospital system by forcing privately insured patients to turn to that system. AMA President, Kerryn Phelps, is reported as saying that Queensland doctors were telling patients to book into the public health system until the indemnity issue is resolved. The decline in bulk-billing and the medical indemnity crisis is putting at risk our whole public health care system. In 1974 Labor established the first national public health care system. By 1981, the coalition government had effectively destroyed it. Only Queensland managed to maintain free public hospitals and only after a fight.</para><para>The Howard government is well on its way to achieving the same thing today. The coalition, and in particular Mr Howard, hate Medicare and want to destroy it. They campaigned against it in 1984, 1987, 1990 and 1993. They learned the hard way that Australians love their Medicare and respect the need for a health system that everyone can access based on need. Mr Howard the politician knows he simply cannot announce the scrapping of Medicare, so he is going to undermine and destroy it by stealth. History and his actions support this argument.</para><para>The continued decline in bulk-billing is just a continuation of the Howard government's attacks on public health care. So what will a coalition health system look like? We need look no further than the American system, in which the quality of care you receive is determined by the size of your bank balance. Basically it is a system in which the average Australian must have private health insurance if they want quality health care. The declining rate of bulk-billing attacks Medicare's first objective: to make health care affordable for all Australians. The proposed increases in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme copayments would have a similar effect. Labor opposes these measures, because we believe in a free public health system. We will again invest in our public health care system and increase bulk-billing rates. Only Labor believes in Medicare, our public hospitals and the principle that everyone should have access to quality health care.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>4058</page.no><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name><name.id>4L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The implication of what we have just heard from Senator McLucas, and the general thrust of this motion, is to suggest that the coalition do not support Medicare.

We in the coalition support the concept of universal health care. Our system is very much like a European system, where people have access to free treatment and public hospitals. The Europeans have variations on that system, of course. In Germany, for example, your health care is paid for by your employer, not by the individual, through the taxation system, as it is in Australia and the United Kingdom. Nevertheless, your basic thrust was quite misleading. I want to point out to you that, even though there may have been a decline in bulk-billing, which is the centre point of this motion, bulk-billing percentages remain very high, with more than seven out of every 10 general practitioner visits being bulk-billed across this country. For Australians over the age of 65, the bulk-billing rate is more than 80 per cent, which is equivalent to eight out of every 10 visits by an elderly person to the doctor being bulk-billed. One area of medicine which you have not mentioned at all is pathology, and a very high percentage of pathology services are bulk-billed.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Very poorly researched.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—Yes, poorly researched, as Senator Kemp says. Again, Senator, you have been very misleading. The record, in the global sense, of the medical system under the coalition government is a very good one. The Howard government have done a great deal on a very broad front to improve health services in Australia. One of the great deficiencies in health services under the previous Labor government, which was there for 13 years, was that medical services in rural areas were very poor. The Howard government have had a specific focus on improving services in rural areas. Another area which was of great concern under the Labor government was aged care. You actually cut funding to aged care. We have substantially increased funding. We have provided funding for improvements to nursing homes—</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Wasn't that mentioned in Senator McLucas's speech?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—No, she did not mention it.

Strangely enough, even though the coalition has done a great deal to improve aged care facilities in Australia, Senator McLucas failed to mention aged care at all, I think, during the whole duration of her speech, which is a most remarkable thing. Perhaps it is something she might like to devote herself to on another occasion. Perhaps she could praise the outstanding record of the Howard government in terms of improving aged care around this country. We look forward to your balancing out your presentation in that way, Senator McLucas.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLucas</name></talker><para>—Are you going to talk about bulk-billing?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Eggleston, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator EGGLESTON</name></talker><para>—We have already mentioned bulk-billing.

Nobody denies that there is something of a decrease. There are many factors behind that decrease, one of which has been mentioned today by you and also by Senator Herron and that is the increasing costs in medical practices, such as the dramatic increases in the costs of medical indemnity insurance. Those problems are being addressed by Senator Coonan and a task force is working through them. Even though there has been some decline in bulk-billing, it is not a huge decline and it is not anything like a crisis. As I said, almost all medical services with general practitioners around this country continue to be bulk-billed. There has never been a large percentage of services bulk-billed by some categories of specialists. It is very rare, for example, to find surgeons who bulk-bill. I do not think that you would be surprised that there has not been very much change there. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us have a look overall at the ALP's record in the 13 years they were in government. As I said, there was nothing very much done to improve rural medicine. In public hospitals, we had overcrowding and long waiting lists, and that occurred because private health insurance had declined. There was no incentive for people to take up private health insurance and it meant that almost everybody was attending public hospitals. Even people on high incomes were attending public hospitals, when they could well have gone to private hospitals and sought the services of private doctors.</para><para>As a result, the public hospital system simply could not cope. That is why, under the Labor government, waiting lists were often as long as two years for operations like hip and knee replacements and other more simple forms of surgery such as gall bladder and cataract operations and so on. These were very important to the individuals concerned and if the problems that needed to be remedied had been attended to it would have greatly improved their quality of life. But, because of the fact that so few people were in private health insurance and were going to public hospitals, the waiting lists were very long. Overcrowding in public hospitals was a big issue under the previous government. It is an issue that the current government has specifically addressed by encouraging people to take out private health insurance again. That program has been remarkably successful and it has led to a huge reduction in the waiting lists of public hospitals. I will come back to that in a minute.</para><para>Another very important area of medicine that was neglected under the previous government was Indigenous health services. In its health program this government has made a focus of improving Indigenous health services. In the last budget it spent a record amount on Indigenous health programs as part of a record Indigenous Affairs budget. Indigenous health was another matter that Labor neglected and that the coalition government has done a great deal to improve.</para><para>I will come back to look in a general way at some of the other things that Labor failed to do when it was in office. Labor failed to immunise Australia's children. In 1996, Australia's full immunisation rate was only 53 per cent, which is well below the levels for China, Algeria, Laos and Vietnam. These are not countries that we usually like to compare ourselves with. We like to compare ourselves with the European countries and North America. When it came to the rate of immunisation of children in this country, we were below the levels of Algeria, Laos and Vietnam. This is hardly a very wonderful record. It is one of the things that this government, under the jurisdiction of Dr Michael Wooldridge when he was Minister for Health and Aged Care, undertook a specific program to improve. As a result, Australia's immunisation rates have risen dramatically.</para><para>Most importantly, as I said, Labor ignored the private health system for 13 years. In 1983, when Labor came into office, 65 per cent of Australians were covered by private health insurance. By March 1996, this percentage had plummeted to below 34 per cent. As we all know, the former Labor health minister Graham Richardson warned in 1993 that, if private health coverage fell below 40 per cent, the entire health system was in danger of collapsing because the public hospital system simply did not have the capacity to cope with the numbers of patients that would be coming in. Labor did nothing about it.</para><para>It took another three years before there was a coalition government in office and something was done to arrest the decline in private health insurance coverage. One of the great success stories of the coalition government is that it did arrest that decline. It offered incentives for people to take up private health insurance. As a result, the percentage of people covered by private health insurance rose dramatically. The pressure came off public hospitals and waiting lists have been reduced. Those people who really need to go to public hospitals to have their surgery done or other problems attended to can now do so and they receive a first-class level of treatment in public hospitals. People who are perhaps a little bit better off and can afford private health insurance are now treated in the private system again, and the whole system has some balance. </para><para>In general terms, this government has done a lot to support Medicare. I think that is a very important point to make, because the thrust and implication of this motion is that it has neglected Medicare in some way. Senator McLucas said quite specifically that John Howard did not believe in Medicare, that he did not support it and did not want it to continue. Given that she said that, it is very interesting that, in the 2001 budget, this government provided an extra $750 million to Medicare to improve access to GP care for all Australians, particularly those with chronic health conditions. The initiatives in that package included $300 million for increased Medicare rebates for GP visits. This particularly benefits patients with complex health conditions who need longer consultations with their doctors. Also, GPs received over $120 million to provide better outcomes in mental health care—a new Medicare item was developed to enable doctors to improve their skills, diagnosis, care planning, management and treatment of mental health problems.</para><para>Another $50 million was allocated to enable GPs to improve the management of Australians with diabetes. That included over $6 million to provide subsidised syringes under the National Diabetes Services Scheme. This is a very important thing. Far too many Australians have diabetes. They have diabetes because our lifestyle is as it is. People do not exercise enough and they eat too much carbohydrate, so we have an overweight population and a very high incidence of diabetes. It is a very important public health issue which needed to be addressed, because the complications of diabetes in its cardiovascular effects are such that the people who have end stage diabetes end up costing the health system a lot when they come into hospital with heart attacks, strokes, peripheral vascular disease and loss of vision.</para><para>In this program last year we also allocated $48.4 million over four years to help improve the management of moderate to severe asthma in general practice settings. We allocated $72 million to increase the rates of women being screened for cervical cancer— again, a very important public health measure—and that program was specifically directed at women living in regional areas; migrant women, who are often reluctant to go to the doctor and have things like pap smears done; and Indigenous women, to whom the same considerations apply. Then we allocated over $43 million to increase the availability of after-hours and emergency care services provided by general practitioners, and 32 new after-hours medical care sites were established across the country.</para><para>All of this is not the record of a government that does not believe in Medicare. It is the record of a government that seeks to improve and broaden the services offered under Medicare. It is the record of a government that particularly wants to engage in preventative medicine and help prevent some of the problems which might cause people to come into hospital, such as dealing with diabetes and asthma and screening for cancer. Far from not believing in Medicare, John Howard and his government have shown a strong commitment to Medicare. They have shown, as a government, that they believe in the concept of universal health coverage and have sought, as I have said, to greatly improve it.</para><para>One of the points Senator McLucas made in her rather long and rambling speech—as Senator Kemp has pointed out—was that in some way the Howard government were not supporting the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and that we were in fact seeking to undermine it by increasing the copayment. The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme of Australia is one of the great things about Australia which is envied in the rest of the world. In this country medications are remarkably cheap because they are subsidised by the federal government. Senator McLucas referred to the United States. If you walk into a chemist in America and want to buy medications, you will suddenly discover that Australia is a country where medications are very cheap. If you walk into a pharmacy in South-East Asia or the Middle East, again, you will find that medications in this country are very cheap. They are very cheap because they are subsidised by the federal government. </para><para>The Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme— the PBS—has grown at an annual rate of some 14 per cent over the last 10 years and the budget for it has grown from just over $1 billion in 1990-91 to $5 billion in the most recent year. It seems that, with the availability of increasingly expensive medications, the budget needed to cover the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is going to go up exponentially. That is why, to help offset the huge explosion of costs that is occurring with the development of new drugs, the federal government proposed in the last budget to slightly increase the copayment by no less than $1. One dollar is not a huge increase. It means that instead of paying $3 or thereabouts, people on health care cards would pay just over $4 for their prescriptions. Nevertheless, it means that they would be receiving a wonderful service and would be able to access very expensive medications—often costing hundreds of dollars—at a very low cost to them.</para><para>The broad conclusion one has to draw is that the Howard government's record in health has been an excellent one. It has been a record of a government which has thought about our health service and seen that there was a need to achieve balance between the private and public sectors. It has provided an encouragement for those people who had the wherewithal and did not need to go to public hospitals to go back into the private sector, and broadened Medicare to include preventative and public health measures. Overall, this government has demonstrated a very strong commitment to Medicare, and Medicare includes bulk-billing. As I said, there has certainly been a small decline in bulk-billing, but nothing significant. I think that fact should be acknowledged by the opposition and I hope they will have the honesty to do that today. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>4062</page.no><name role="metadata">Moore, Sen Claire</name><name role="display">Senator MOORE</name><name.id>00AOQ</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak to the motion on the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> that refers specifically to bulk-billing.

There does not seem to be any real debate about the fact that access to bulk-billing is falling across the country. This chamber has had a series of questions and answers over the last couple of days on that particular issue, and Senator Forshaw covered all of that in great detail in his speech. Senator Crossin tabled a document yesterday evening, which set out a history of figures and talked about the history of bulk-billing in Australia. The historical record on that illustrated an increase in bulk-billing rates under Labor governments for the period until the election of the Howard government and then a decline for the period since then. Those figures are not in dispute. We have not seen the most recent figures, and I am sure we are all looking forward to see whether they follow the same trend.</para><para>But there does not seem to be a debate about the statistics. It does not matter how you see them—whether they are figures, graphs, pie charts or coloured pictures in an annual report—the final result is that bulk-billing has been falling over the last series of years. I worry about the fact that we focus so exclusively, however, on figures. Behind figures there are people, and I want to see what the real impact of the figures reveals, and it does not matter how you find them.</para><para>Debate interrupted. </para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>4063</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>4063</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following orders of the day relating to government documents were considered:</para><para>Torres Strait Regional Authority—Report for 2000-01.

On the journey from Sydney to Brisbane it was very clear that along the coast the drought has not had a particular effect, but travelling back through Broken Hill to my home state of South Australia it was very clear that in western New South Wales and in the pastoral zone of South Australia there is a very terrible drought, which is gripping many of our farm families. In fact, we have had the lowest rainfall for 100 years, and 82 per cent of the state of New South Wales is now in the grip of a worsening drought.</para></talk.start><para>It is estimated that there could be an almost total wheat crop failure in New South Wales, which is one of our key grain exporting states, unless a significant amount of rain falls very soon. At this point, our thoughts are with Senator Heffernan and his family in Junee, where there has been no rain for many, many months and his family are feeling the effects of a very poor season. The winter crop failures could cost Queensland $2 billion, and Australian farmers' incomes are actually forecast to drop by 40 per cent. GrainCorp has revised down its forecast in New South Wales by 1.5 million tonnes in the last month. In Western Australia, the receival estimates are fading rapidly because of the continuing dry conditions and they are likely to drop one million tonnes from the estimated range of just three weeks ago. In Queensland, the forecast two weeks ago was that receivals would fall below 900,000 tonnes, which is a 40 per cent drop from the historical average. In my own state of South Australia conditions are still patchy and farmers are still hoping that some rains will enable crops to be sown. But, increasingly, it now appears that large areas of my state will also fail to complete a harvest this year.</para><para>This is a time when those of us who follow the rural sector closely are thankful for the farm management deposits which were introduced by our government in 1999. I am very pleased to see that 23,000 Australian farmers have now contributed a total of $1.2 billion to those farm management deposits. I heard the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, describe them quite appropriately in the other place as `financial haystacks'. Many of those farm families will be dipping into those financial haystacks as the drought tightens its grip on this country. Queensland has the highest investment in farm management deposits— $294 million—and we are all very thankful for that. The grain industry has invested $207 million in farm management deposits, and the beef industry—which of course is feeling the effects of the drought, particularly in Queensland and northern New South Wales—has invested $188 million.</para><para>When drought strikes in our country we also think of the difficult circumstances that affect farmers when they try to apply for exceptional circumstances relief payments. This has been a very difficult issue for federal and state governments for many years. It was only a couple of years ago, I recall, that exceptional circumstances payments were refused for floods, fires, an insect plague and frost right across Australia almost at the same time, which led some of us to wonder what had to happen on a farming property for the circumstances to be considered exceptional.</para><para>One of the difficulties of exceptional circumstances, as I see it, is the very name of the program. Many farm families are currently in exceptional circumstances—they have had little rain in their area for 100 years—and yet the declaration of exceptional circumstances is still at the whim of state governments, which have to trigger the programs to start with. It is up to the state governments in the first instance to provide assistance to farmers in drought, and once they have made the declaration that the drought is an exceptional circumstance then EC will apply. But it has always been a very hoary chestnut.</para><para>One of the other things I noticed during my 8, 000 kilometre drive—the sort of drive you take, Senator Macdonald—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—8,000 kilometres!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferris, Sen Jeannie</name><name role="display">Senator FERRIS</name></talker><para>—was the amount of road kill. It was extraordinary! There were pigs, goats, hundreds of emus and, of course, the usual kangaroos. This led to an even more hazardous situation where wedge-tailed eagles on the road eating road kill and unable to take off quickly provided quite a difficult road hazard. In many years of country driving I do not recall ever having seen road kill in such proportions as we unfortunately have on our highways at the moment. The inland route from Brisbane down to Adelaide via Broken Hill is littered with road kill. It is very dangerous and also very tragic—these animals seeking a little green feed on the side of the road and paying the highest price as a result. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The lowering rainfall is undoubtedly going to have an effect on our wheat prices. It was very good to see so much bunker storage, particularly in north-western New South Wales where we clearly have good stockpiles of wheat, which will stand us in good stead as the prices increase as a result of poor seasons in the United States, Canada, India and some of the other grain-producing countries. In fact, I understand that only eastern and western Europe are having a reasonable grain season. So, whilst we are going to have a difficult season, thankfully the pool prices are likely to be higher. Thankfully, also, we have a situation now where wheat is being unloaded in Iraq. The difficulties that we had in Iraq just a week or so ago appear to have been resolved and, as of last week, wheat was being unloaded and a number of other shipments were either near or in the ports. So farmers can rest assured that the very important wheat exports to Iraq will not be affected. </para><para>Tonight we are enjoying some soft early spring rain here in Canberra, but my thoughts, and I am sure those of many of my colleagues in the Senate, go out to those farm families who are living on properties where it has not rained for two years. We hope that the rain that is coming to Canberra tonight is actually spreading through the south-western area of New South Wales that is so badly hit by the worsening drought.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indigenous Affairs: Reconciliation</title><page.no>4065</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>4065</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Senator Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Deputy Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to draw the Senate's attention to an important notice of motion that was presented in this chamber earlier this week and to provide some background as to why I tabled this notice. Last Tuesday the Senate agreed to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee conducting an inquiry into progress towards national reconciliation. That decision of the Senate gave effect to two recommendations in the <inline font-style="italic">Social Justice Report 2001</inline> from the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Social Justice Commissioner, Dr William Jonas. Recommendation 12 of the report is particularly pertinent in this case, because it calls on the government to table a full response to the <inline font-style="italic">Social Justice Report 2001</inline> in parliament within 15 days of the report being tabled. If the government failed to do so then the recommendation also called for the Senate to establish an inquiry into matters of concern that arose out of the report. As the government did fail to respond within that time frame, the Senate, as is right, has now acted to set up the inquiry. In doing so, it has once again shown leadership on the issue of reconciliation.</para></talk.start><para>One of the few political issues that has enjoyed full cross-party support over a significant period of time is reconciliation. We saw it back in 1991 when the entire parliament spoke with one voice and established the Council for Aboriginal Reconciliation, thereby launching a decade-long national discussion and learning curve about how we could improve relations between Indigenous and non-Indigenous Australians. Now we are seeing the Senate agree that we need to keep the focus on reconciliation and, most importantly, we need to hold the government of the day accountable in terms of what it is doing to deliver on the reconciliation process it initiated.</para><para>We have had 10 years of grassroots work on reconciliation which was kicked off by the Royal Commission into Aboriginal Deaths in Custody in 1991. There has been the presentation of the documents for reconciliation by CAR, and the release of the six recommendations from CAR to the parliament in 2000. There was a Senate inquiry into the stolen generations in 2000. I have put forward a private member's bill on behalf of the Democrats to give effect to the council's draft legislation on the framework for a national treaty debate, which I first tabled in 2001. There has been the more recent Commonwealth Grants Commission report into Indigenous funding last year and there have been successive Indigenous Social Justice reports over time, each an annual scorecard on the Australian government's record in Indigenous affairs. </para><para>Given the long period of consultation that has occurred and the numerous reports that have been released, we have to ask what the Commonwealth government's response has been to date. We are yet to receive a formal response from the government to the documents for reconciliation and the national strategies to progress reconciliation that were presented to the Prime Minister at Corroboree 2000 by the council. Nor has the Commonwealth responded to the six recommendations contained in the final report from the council which was tabled in December 2000, some 20 months ago. The government has also made a point of responding to not one of the social justice reports or native title reports from the Indigenous Social Justice Commissioner.</para><para>Considering the substantial amount of taxpayer funds that has been spent over the last decade to develop a strategy to move forward and to bring us closer to being reconciled as a nation, all Australians have a right to expect some feedback from the government. But, as Dr William Jonas said yesterday in Parliament House, the Commonwealth has decided to `shut down debate and avoid any engagement' with the recommendations from the social justice reports and the CAR documents and instead to talk only about `practical reconciliation'. But this focus on practical reconciliation is really only a focus on meeting the basic citizenship rights of Indigenous Australians like health, housing, education, employment and so on. Dr Jonas said:</para><quote><para>Practical reconciliation amounts to `business as usual'. It involves little innovation or change to service delivery arrangements to address Indigenous marginalisation in a holistic manner. It simply manages the inequality that Indigenous peoples experience, rather than providing a detailed, comprehensive plan for overcoming this disadvantage. It is a cruel illusion of equality that perpetuates Indigenous people's position at the bottom rungs of our society.</para></quote><para>In that respect it is very disappointing that the Senate now finds itself in a position where it must compel the government to provide the basic information that will indicate its true level of commitment to the reconciliation process. At the moment we simply do not know what benchmarks have been put together by COAG and some of the ministerial councils that might be working on measuring progress, because the government has not released them. Nor do we know whether government departments have engaged in any form of policy review to take into account the recommendations for change made by CAR and the social justice commissioner. We have a responsibility to capitalise on the goodwill of all those Australians who took part in the bridge walks in 2000 and very graphically showed their support for the goal of lasting reconciliation. I do not believe that it is in the nation's interest to allow that momentum and that level of goodwill to dissipate. That cannot be as good as it gets. That is why the Senate has initiated this inquiry—not to go over old ground, not to come up with more strategies, but to gather together the evidence of what progress the government has achieved to date and to ensure the government is accountable for its actions or lack thereof.</para><para>In conclusion, the Senate is now stepping in to ensure that we keep the process moving forward and do not allow the excellent work that has been done to date to gather dust and be squandered. At the end of the day, we need to remind ourselves that there are only 410,000 Indigenous Australians in a population of 19½ million. We are living in the fastest growing Western economy where the standard of living is high. You must ask how it is possible that 410,000 people should overwhelm our imagination. How many Australians can continue to accept the stereotype of Indigenous affairs as a terminal case of public policy failure? To say that the problems confronting Indigenous communities are insurmountable and beyond the resources of government is, in my view, just a cop-out. It is time for some accountability, some honesty and some transparency from the government in the arena of Indigenous affairs. It is time for the government to respond and act on the very considered and reasonable recommendations that it has been presented with from so many quarters. I look forward to working with the Legal and Constitutional References Committee on an inquiry that is so important to our nation's future. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Iremonger, Mr John</title><page.no>4067</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>4067</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—John Iremonger was born in London at the height of the Blitz, which no doubt equipped him better than most for his later involvement in publishing and in politics. One early sign of the passions that would shape his life came when he chose to study history and politics at Sydney University. With his postgraduate work in history at the Australian National University, another passion that would shape his life became evident, for at the ANU he was involved in the establishment of the Australian National University Press and was the founding editor of the <inline font-style="italic">ANU Historical Journal</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Iremonger was there in federal Labor's two winning campaigns of the 1970s—1972 and 1974. He helped organise the spectacular Whitlam campaign launch at the Blacktown Civic Centre in 1972—the first live nationwide telecast of a policy speech. When that election brought Labor to federal government, he joined the staff of Kep Enderby. In the 1974 election, he worked day and night at Labor's national campaign office in Sydney. When the treachery of 1975 brought down Whitlam's government, John Iremonger again worked tirelessly on Labor's campaign. The candlelight vigil for democracy he organised was very typical of Iremonger: impressive, passionate and efficiently organised.</para><para>Iremonger believed in Whitlam's Labor. He always saw Labor's flaws but understood Labor's promise. His understanding of Labor's weaknesses often made him a gentle but persistent critic. His belief in Labor as the party of reform and social justice made him a passionate Labor loyalist. He brought these qualities to his work as commissioning editor of <inline font-style="italic">True Believers</inline>, the centenary history of the federal parliamentary Labor Party. And he gave so much time to the task. He was more than just a hands-on editor—he was a contributor in every sense. In fact, he was a chapter author. He was even a chapter author who failed to meet deadlines. I was aware how much John dreaded answering my phone calls at the time, but we were still friends when it was all over.</para><para>The publication of <inline font-style="italic">True Believers </inline>was only one of the many ways Iremonger worked to keep the light on the hill aflame. The sense of vision that the Whitlam government inspired comes through in the books that are John Iremonger's legacy. He never used the excuse of objectivity to hide from his responsibility to participate in the national conversation. When people say that Australia changed forever after Whitlam, they ought to remember that there were a good number of conservative forces trying to change it back, and Iremonger was at the forefront amongst those who exerted themselves in defence of Whitlam's new, tolerant, more just Australia.</para><para>After Labor's 1975 defeat, Iremonger wrote <inline font-style="italic">The Makers and the Breakers </inline>with Richard Hall about the constitutional vandalism of November 1975. He then moved to Sydney where, with Sylvia Hale, he established the publishing house of Hale and Iremonger in 1977. His versatility and ability to perform an impressive range of the tasks of publication—an editor who could design a cover and do an index—were invaluable to a small publishing house, but most important was what Bruce Donald termed his `ability to encourage the right work on the crucial issue from the best writer of the time'. The quality of Hale and Iremonger's list brought the attention of larger publishers and, in 1980, Iremonger accepted an offer to move to George Allen and Unwin. One of the first books he brought to the new firm was David Marr's <inline font-style="italic">Barwick</inline>. During the 1980s he was responsible for works by Bob Connell, Pat Troy, Stuart MacIntyre, Des Ball and Henry Reynolds. </para><para>In the early 1990s, Iremonger left Allen and Unwin for three years to be publisher at Melbourne University Press, where he expanded the audience for MUP books. His appreciation of excellence was a great contribution to Melbourne University Press. Perhaps of greater value was his never-failing scepticism and his low tolerance for claptrap. However, he was more at home in the rough and tumble of the mainstream Australian conversation, and in 1994 he returned to Allen and Unwin.</para><para>In more recent years, some of his best known books have been <inline font-style="italic">Death Struggle </inline>by Quentin Dempster, <inline font-style="italic">Death in Balibo </inline>by Hamish McDonald, Marilyn Lake's biography of Faith Bandler, Henry Reynolds's <inline font-style="italic">This Whispering in our Hearts</inline> and, of course, <inline font-style="italic">True Believers</inline>. The fact that he published both Gough Whitlam and Tim Fischer shows that, while Iremonger was a man of strong political conviction, he was without prejudices. Described by David Marr as a `patient pedant', he drew the best from his authors.</para><para>Iremonger's passion for the national conversation was not limited to his publishing work, though it is the books he published that are his most tangible legacy. After Labor's return to government in 1983 he advised the Review of Australian Studies in Tertiary Education and the National Consultative Council on the United Nations International Literacy Year. In the mid-1980s he was a founding member of the National Advisory Council of the ABC, and in the second half of the 1980s he was on the board of the Australian Museum.</para><para>In the first half of the 1990s he was a member, and then deputy chairman, of the Literature Board of the Australia Council and a member of the board of the National Book Council, which publishes the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Book Review</inline>, and of the Melbourne Writers Festival. In the late 1990s he was President of the Library Society in New South Wales and was instrumental in that organisation's presentation of an important series of debates, seminars and lectures. Last year he received a doctorate of letters from the University of Melbourne. He deserved no less, but no formal honour granted him could ever match the honour his friendship did us.</para><para>He was a publisher of books, yes, but those books were very much part of a long, enthusiastic, vigorous conversation with Australia and about Australia—a conversation he pursued through every aspect of his involvement in politics, literature and culture and through his many friendships. Iremonger himself summed up life's great gifts as `books, wine and friendship'. John Iremonger died last week. At this difficult time many of us are thinking of John's family, particularly his wife, Jane Marceau, who has herself been inspirational during John's long illness. Australia has lost a great contributor to the public, cultural and intellectual life of this nation.

Australia today takes its place proudly in the world community as a truly successful multicultural society. It is, nevertheless, widely assumed that our mainstream culture is overwhelmingly English in nature. Contributions made by other cultures tend to be relegated to supporting roles. Tonight I wish to pay tribute to a group of Australians who, collectively and individually throughout the history of Australian settlement since the First Fleet, have made magnificent contributions to the growth and flourishing of multicultural Australia—to its society, economy, culture and communities at the grassroots and to its leadership—contributions they are continuing to make. They are the immigrant Australians who have come to this new country from those parts of the British Isles where the culture is distinct from that of Anglo-Saxon and Norman England: the Cornish, the Irish, the Manx, the Scottish and the Welsh. As an illustration—something close to home that I can demonstrate—the senators may be interested to know that, of the 159 members of Australia's House of Representatives who were born overseas, 48 came from these Celtic nations and, of the 105 senators who were born overseas, 36 were from these Celtic nations.</para></talk.start><para>I will now go through the contribution each of these groups has made. The Cornish have perhaps the best claim of the longest association with Australia, since the first person to step onshore at Sydney Cove in 1788 was a Cornish convict named James Ruse. But there was no lack of others of higher social status, including Phillip King, who was later Governor of Norfolk Island, New South Wales and Tasmania, where the city of Launceston was named after his birthplace. Another naval officer of some fame who also became Governor of New South Wales, William Bligh, was a Cornishman as well. The first major influx of Cornish people to Australia came in the late 1830s and 1840s, coinciding with the foundation of South Australia as a free colony and especially with the discovery of mineral deposits. The discovery of silver and lead at Glen Osmond in the Adelaide Hills—by two Cornishmen, incidentally—went a long way towards ensuring the continuation of the South Australian colony. By 1861 the York Peninsula, where copper mines had been established, was known as Australia's `little Cornwall', attesting to the importance of the Cornish community to South Australia. </para><para>The discovery of gold in New South Wales in 1851, which was a turning point in the development of Australia, was again made by a Cornishman, William Tom. But it was in the Victorian goldfields, where gold was to be found in deep lodes which only Cornishmen had the experience to work, that Cornish influence had the greatest impact. In the Bendigo region, where I am pleased to say I have had the opportunity to work with the local community, the area of White Hills and Long Gully was again known as `little Cornwall'—this time of the goldfields. By the 1870s the Victorian goldfields had become heavily capitalised, and the Cornish hard-rock miners came into their own as capitalists and people's tribunes of the new mining industry. In 1874 Cornish miners formed the Amalgamated Miners Association, based in Creswick. The first president of the Creswick branch of the association was John Sampson, whose brand of unionism was said to be in the typical Cornish manner: liberal, moderate and oriented to ensuring the welfare of the workers—characteristics that are highly recommended to the senators opposite.</para><para>One of John Sampson's grandsons went into politics and followed with great success his grandfather's philosophy and example of serving the true welfare of the Australian people and building the Australian nation as a fair, prosperous and liberal society. He was Sir Robert Menzies. Other notable Australians of Cornish heritage include John Quick, a father of Federation; Thomas Blamey; Judith Wright; and Bob Hawke. I am much in debt to the information provided in the book <inline font-style="italic">The Australian people: An encyclopaedia of the nation, its people and their origins</inline>, edited by Mr James Jupp and published in 2001 by Cambridge University Press, and I thank Ms Anne Bannerman of the library for directing me to this book.</para><para>Perhaps I have allowed myself to get carried away by the history and achievements of the Cornish people in Australia, and certainly I shall be out of time before I can do justice to the other people of the Celtic nations—the Irish, the Manx, the Scottish and the Welsh—each of whom can boast an equally fascinating and productive history in Australia. I may have future chances to do so, but for now I must get to the present and the reason I wish to bring this matter to the attention of the Senate.</para><para>These Celtic communities continue to flourish in Australia. During 2001 representatives of the Irish and Scottish communities of Victoria discussed the concept of holding a Celtic nations festival to provide a forum where members of the various Celtic communities could interact and share aspects of their unique cultural backgrounds. There was such a great interest amongst the Celtic community that in early 2002 a meeting of representatives of the Cornish, Irish, Scottish and Welsh communities agreed to establish and incorporate an association called the Celtic Nations Inc. as the coordinating group for activities which impinge on the whole Celtic community in Victoria.</para><para>The aim of the group is: (1) to facilitate the achievements of the shared goals of the Celtic nations community by coordinating the use of various resources to be found within the community; (2) to help maintain the presence of Celtic heritage within Australian life to stand with the various cultural influences on the nation; and (3) to provide representation for the Celtic community in forums and other community activities. The group hopes to promote a greater understanding between the Celtic nations to raise community awareness of the Celticity of the people. Its focus will be on recognition of the unity of these nations in multicultural Australia. </para><para>The association held its first festival on Saturday, 24 August in Melbourne appropriately in the Celtic Club. I would like to congratulate Celtic Nations Inc. for their establishment and their aims because it is very much in Australia's interest that people from different cultural backgrounds should come together and work together actively, instead of just promoting their own culture. I congratulate the Chairman of Celtic Nations Inc., Mr Brian Shanahan, of the Irish community; the Deputy Chairperson, Mrs Gwen Phillips, of the Cornish community; the Treasurer, Mrs Dilys Greenacre, of the Welsh community; and the Secretary, Mr Bill Schrank, of the Scottish community. I wish the association the best.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Unauthorised Publication of Photograph</title><page.no>4070</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>4070</page.no><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name><name.id>84L</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last week in the Senate, Senator Abetz responded in the adjournment debate to my earlier call for him to apologise to a constituent of mine, a women by the name of Thancoupie, an Indigenous artist and reconciliation activist from Napranum in North Queensland. I would like to remind the Senate of the issues surrounding my call for Senator Abetz's apology. Senator Abetz printed a document entitled `A Rabbit Proof Fence Full of Holes', in which he fundamentally questions whether the stolen generations did in fact ever exist. It is very sad to me and to Thancoupie that on the back of that document he reproduced two photographs of him with her that were taken when the Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund travelled to her traditional country at Bowchat, near Weipa, on Cape York Peninsula.</para></talk.start><para>The thing that disturbs and upsets Thancoupie, me and many of her people is that Senator Abetz did this without any reference to her. He made no attempt to contact her. He did not try to gain her permission before he published them. The thing that makes Thancoupie so distressed is the content of the document. It is a document that, in my mind, questions the unquestionable: that Aboriginal children were stolen from their mothers. It is a very harmful document and it is a document that does nothing to assist the process of reconciliation. It is a document that stands for nothing that Thancoupie stands for.</para><para>On behalf of Thancoupie, I call on Senator Abetz to apologise to her for the considerable hurt that she has experienced by being associated with such a publication. I was, therefore, quite astonished at Senator Abetz's response. Instead of acknowledging his error and apologising respectfully, Senator Abetz obviously decided that attack was the best form of defence. Senator Abetz feigned innocence. Quite clearly, he knows that his actions would have hurt Thancoupie quite considerably. Senator Abetz attacked my motivation. I put it on the record here that my motivation was simple: to represent my constituent's views in this place. I want to go to three issues that were raised in Senator Abetz's contribution and respond to them.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Did she write to Senator Abetz?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name></talker><para>—I will take that interjection, Senator Macdonald.

And what did he do? He did nothing. He did not even try to contact Thancoupie before putting her photographs in such a publication.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I will move to the three points that I need to make. First of all, as a form of defence, Senator Abetz said that the damage would not be very great because it was a `very small mail-out in the second most southern electorate of Australia about someone residing in the northernmost electorate in Australia'. I am sorry, Senator Abetz, that is no defence. Distance does not absolve you from politeness or respect. Secondly, Senator Abetz said that it would have been appropriate for me to approach him to raise the matters and have a discussion. That is exactly what Thancoupie expected of him: for him to contact her before using her photographs in such—in her mind—an abhorrent piece of literature. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Two wrongs make it right, do they?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84L</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Sen Jan</name><name role="display">Senator McLUCAS</name></talker><para>—Two wrongs do not make it right, but he was the first who erred and, given his position in this nation, he should have respected that and respected a significant older Indigenous woman from Cape York Peninsula. The third point I want to make is that Senator Abetz suggested that he might have suggested to Thancoupie in passing that he might use these photographs in conjunction with his work as a senator and as a member of the committee. My advice from Thancoupie is that she has no recollection of that. I am sure people will recognise that English is not Thancoupie's first language. In fact she spoke a number of Indigenous languages before she spoke English. Itshows no respect for Thancoupie. If he had respected her and her work, he would have contacted her directly.

Usage data is not available on an annual basis. These legal services were not confined to matters arising under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 and involved a wide range of legal issues relating to the operations of the Department and the Repatriation Commission. This list also includes legal firms providing legal services on matters relating to the Military Rehabilitation and Compensation Service (`MCRS') under the Safety, Rehabilitation and Compensation Act 1988, the administration of which was transferred to the Department of Veterans' Affairs in December 1999. All MCRS matters have been outsourced to external legal service providers who are part of the Comcare legal panel for a considerable period of time.</para><para>·	Australian Government Solicitor</para><para>·	Ayliss &amp; Ayliss</para><para>·	Blake Dawson Waldron</para><para>·	Brophy Bridget &amp; Mirow</para><para>·	Clayton Utz</para><para>·	Corrs Chambers Westgarth</para><para>·	Cridells</para><para>·	Deacons (formerly Bowdens)</para><para>·	Dibbs Barker Gosling (formerly Barker Gosling)</para><para>·	Downings Legal (agents for Barker Gosling)</para><para>·	Freehill Hollingdale &amp; Page</para><para>·	Gadens</para><para>·	Heiser Bailey Mortenson</para><para>·	Lawson Smith</para><para>·	Mackays</para><para>·	Mallesons</para><para>·	Marshalls &amp; Dent</para><para>·	Minter Ellison</para><para>·	Norman Waterhouse (agents for Sparke Helmore)</para><para>·	O'Shea Corser Wadley</para><para>·	Phillips Fox</para><para>·	Pizzeys</para><para>·	Sparke Helmore</para><para>·	Tress Cox Maddox</para><para>·	Watson Stafford</para><para>·	Willers &amp; Co</para><para>(2)	Documents from the files of approximately 3,500 veterans have been referred to these legal firms over the past five years. The vast majority of these matters involve the MCRS legal panel where the legal firm is required to prepare the section 37 statement and associated “T” documents on behalf of the respondent in all matters before the Administrative Appeals Tribunal (`AAT'). In relation to matters arising under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 with the exception of the market testing that has been done on advocacy services before the AAT, it is not the usual practice for veterans' files to be referred to external legal service providers. Documents from a veteran's file will be included in the material that is provided to an external legal provider in a number of situations. First, where there is a monetary claim on the Commonwealth documents relating to the claim will be referred for external legal advice. This is required under Appendix C to the Legal Service Directions issued by the Attorney-General under section 55ZG of the Judiciary Act 1901. Second, where a matter is before the Federal Court, the documents before the AAT (eg the “T” documents) will form part of the appeal papers which will be handled by the solicitor on the record and Counsel. Both the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Repatriation Commission use external legal providers for all Federal Court work. In relation to the market testing of advocacy services before the AAT, the files relating to 12 veterans were referred to Barker Gosling in Melbourne and a similar number of matters were referred to the Australian Government Solicitor. </para><para>(3)	The “Royal Commission on the Use and Effects of Chemical Agents on Australian Personnel in Vietnam” was established by Letters Patent on 13 May 1983. The Royal Commission was not part of the Veteran's Affairs portfolio and was independent of the Department of Veterans' Affairs and the Repatriation Commission. Volume 1 of the Final Report of July 1995 refers to Monsanto Australia Limited being represented before the Royal Commission by Mr B S J O'Keefe QC and Mr J M Stowe. The Report does not indicate who were the instructing solicitors for these Counsel. Monsanto Chemicals (USA) does not appear to have been a party before the Royal Commission.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Wide Bay Electorate: Program Funding</title><page.no>4074</page.no><subtitle>(Question Nos 424 and 443)</subtitle><id.no>424 and 443</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>4074</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government, upon notice, on 10 July 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	What programs and/or grants administered by the department provide assistance to people living in the federal electorate of Wide Bay.</para><para>(2)	What was the level of funding provided through these programs and/or grants for the 1999-2000, 2000-01 and 2001-02 financial years.</para><para>(3)	Where specific projects were funded: (a) what was the location of each project; (b) what was the nature of each project; and (c) what was the level of funding of each project.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>4074</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government have provided the following answers to the honourable senator's questions:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)—</para><para>The Department of Transport and Regional Services provides funding to the federal electorate of Wide Bay under the following programmes:</para><para>·	Black Spot Programme</para><para>·	National Highways Funding</para><para>·	Roads to Recovery Programme</para><para>·	Rapid Route Recovery Scheme </para><para>·	Payment Scheme For Airservices Australia's Enroute Charges </para><para>·	2002 Year of the Outback </para><para>·	Regional Assistance Programme</para><para>·	Dairy Regional Assistance Programme </para><para>·	Ex-Gratia Disaster Relief Packages </para><para>·	Local Government Incentive Programme </para><para>·	National Disaster Memorials  </para><para>·	Natural Disaster Relief Arrangements (NDRA) </para><para>·	Regional Forums Australia </para><para>·	Regional Flood Mitigation </para><para>·	Regional Solutions Programme </para><para>·	Rural Plan</para><para>·	Rural Transaction Centres Programme </para><para>·	Wide Bay Burnett Structural Adjustment Package </para><para>(2)—</para><para>·	Black Spot Programme
