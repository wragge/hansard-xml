Our figuring put the potential profit at $135,450, which also included a fundraising breakfast with Senator Vanstone. In today's letters to the editor section of the <inline font-style="italic">Cairns Post</inline>, Mr Peter Clark, a well-known Liberal in the area, advises that only $30,000 was raised from the dinner. Only $30,000? I have to inform Mr Clark that that is big money to be made from a political fundraiser in a regional town like Cairns.</para></talk.start><para>If we can believe Mr Clark, it was a much more cosy affair than we were earlier led to believe. I say `if we can believe', because Mr Clark then goes on to outline the proceeds of a tribute dinner to the former Treasurer of Queensland, Mr Keith Delacy, held by the Labor Party in 1999. Mr Clark says that entry was worth a lot of money but, for the record, all tickets for that dinner were $50, with the exception of tickets sold to people who were unwaged, which cost $40. That is nowhere near $2,000, Mr Clark. Mr Clark's informant, if in fact there is one, got it wrong on the auction, too. There was no Tony Blair book, no picture of Westminster, no Bob Hawke poster and nobody paid $5,000 for them. Sorry, Mr Clark, I think you are just making it up as you go along. Further, dinner with a former Prime Minister is very different from having to pay to gain access to the current one. Political parties have to raise funds, but to do it by selling access in such an obvious way borders on the obscene. This fly-in fly-out profiteering would make the member for Ryan proud.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>3649</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, colloquially known amongst the Labor Party as a `dash for cash bill'. Just to reiterate comments made by Senator Faulkner, from our perspective this bill is entirely without merit, given that its sole purpose is to settle internal disputes within the Liberal Party. It is not about addressing any deficiencies within the existing Electoral Act. It would seem that other political parties are capable of managing their internal affairs and reaching similar agreements, because they have not tried to abuse the parliament by resolving internal disputes with legislation. I think Senator Ray was granted leave to table a stamp the other day for Mr Crosby to write to the Queensland branch and say, `Do what every other party does and organise the public funding to come in centrally.' But they cannot get that level of cooperation. So here we are, wasting the Senate's time with stupid, trivial, internal Liberal Party shenanigans that ought to be addressed internally. </para></talk.start><para>I will not pass up the opportunity to consider the absolutely woeful state of the Liberal Party in my home state of Tasmania. The recent Tasmanian state election was a complete debacle for the Tasmanian Liberal Party and shows obviously that the Tasmanian Liberal Party, such as it is these days, is totally out of step with the Tasmanian electorate. In fact, their vote at the last state election was 27 per cent. When the Labor Party hit the nadir of 28 per cent in 1990, I thought we were doing pretty badly; but 27 per cent beats us at our worst. It is absolutely disgraceful. </para><para>As a result of this, the Federal Director of the Liberal Party, Mr Lynton Crosby, was called in—I feel very sorry for him—to produce a report on what happened to the Liberal Party in Tasmania. I have to say that it is extremely interesting reading. Anybody who has any interest in campaigning or politics, which is everybody in this chamber, should have a really good look at this. It is very interesting and—I do not think intentionally— it is also very amusing. I will be quoting extensively from this report. In his report, Lynton Crosby somewhat obviously makes the statement that the Tasmanian branch is rife with disunity and based on a flawed culture. He says:</para><quote><para>... the election result was regrettably inevitable— the product in part of flawed processes which themselves were the product of a flawed culture.</para></quote><para>The term `massive understatement' pops into my head in relation to that. Mr Lynton Crosby goes on to say:</para><quote><para>The culture must change so that professionalism and competence are the motivating influences of the Division—not internecine battles which are self-serving and erode the Liberal Party's capacity to be the effective political machine that success demands.</para></quote><para>`Somewhat axiomatic,' people in the chamber are probably thinking to themselves, but things are obviously so bad in the Tasmanian Liberal party that you have to get back to those sorts of basics. Anybody who lives in Tasmania or has any interest in Tasmanian politics knows that, at the heart of it, responsibility for this debacle lies with Senator Abetz—or `Comrade Abetz', as Senator Ray calls him. I would just like to go through some of the strategies that Senator Abetz put in place in terms of his vice-like grip on the Liberal Party in Tasmania, for which we are eternally grateful, and long may it continue.</para><para>First, Senator Abetz was responsible, as we understand it, for putting Bob Cheek into the leadership position and knocking off Sue Napier. Sue Napier was doing a reasonably good job, from our perspective—genuinely, she was doing quite a good job. I am not sure why—perhaps Senator Abetz did not like her, or Mr Bob Cheek was a good mate of his, or whatever—but she got the punt and in came Bob Cheek, and the rest, as they say, is history. Secondly, he was responsible, as I understand it, for knifing Greg Barns, who has subsequently joined the Democrats— maybe an action which he will regret more than joining the Liberal Party way back in the dim darks. Greg Barns made some public statements, which Senator Abetz did not like, in relation to the government's position on refugees. For that, it was made very clear, and there was a resolution of the state executive, that he would not be allowed to run in the forthcoming Tasmanian state election.</para><para>I have to say that is something we are also eternally grateful for, because, as far as we were concerned, Greg Barns was a real problem. Had he been allowed to run and had he got in in Denison—I do not know whether or not he would have—Greg Barns would have been a problem for the Labor Party. Again, we can thank Senator Abetz for his assistance, which he just keeps on giving, to the Labor Party in Tasmania. Thanks very much for knifing Greg Barns. We thought he was a problem but now Senator Abetz has fixed it for us. That is terrific.</para><para>Before I go to the next issue, I read in the Hobart <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> that Greg Barns made an eleventh-hour appeal to Mr Bob Cheek, the erstwhile leader of the Liberal Party in Tasmania, and said, `Let's let bygones be bygones; how about letting me run?' Bob Cheek replied—and this is in the paper— `It's not up to me; you'll have to ask Eric.' This is the leader of the Liberal Party in Tasmania saying that a prospective candidate had to check with Senator Abetz as to whether there was any capacity for him to run—somebody with a national profile, might I add. </para><para>The other thing that Senator Abetz has overseen in his longstanding time as one of the leading lights, if not the leading light, of the Liberal Party in Tasmania is the increasing demise of the number of women in the Liberal Party in Tasmania. The other week I noticed that Liberal Party senators had put out a pamphlet to various electorates in Tasmania, with all their pictures at the bottom, running from left to right and in no particular order from what I could establish. When you looked at it, one thing became extremely obvious: there was not one woman. In fact, it was basically the same grey, boring old blokes. So there is not one woman in the federal Liberal Party in Tasmania.</para><para>Who knows, had the Liberal Party won any seats in Tasmania in the last couple of elections, maybe there would have been a woman but, to my recollection, there were no women candidates. Of course now, out of the paltry seven Liberal Party members in the Tasmanian state parliament, only one is a woman, and that is poor old Sue Napier, who was knifed by Senator Abetz. Clearly, the electorate have spoken pretty well about what they think happened there.</para><para>Senator Abetz and his colleagues—particularly Senator Barnett, who is a very good friend of Senator Abetz and thinks very similarly—are basically using the Tasmanian electorate as a bit of a playpen for their own petty ideological and totally out-of-step views. Let us look at the results of the last Tasmanian election: Jim Bacon was resoundingly elected. What was Jim Bacon's previous job? Jim Bacon was the secretary of the Tasmanian labour council. What was the previous job of the Deputy Premier, who also was resoundingly elected? He was also secretary of the Tasmanian labour council. Both of these people are long-time and proud union officials—and guess what? They were elected in spades in Tasmania, a state which in the past has not been noted for its progressive views, but that is fast changing under the tutelage of the Premier of Tasmania, ex-Secretary of the Tasmanian Trades and Labour Council, Mr Jim Bacon.</para><para>The reality is that, as Senator Ray has indicated before, we are very happy with Senator Abetz remaining in a key position in the Liberal Party. I would be very keen to find out how many Liberal Party members there are in Tasmania. I understand it is an increasingly small number. The reality in politics—we are all in the game, so we understand it—is that it is a lot easier to control very few people. If you want to control a party, you do not encourage new members, you do not encourage talent, you stifle debate and then you have an increasingly small group that you can control. Clearly, this branch is all about control and being the playpen for few totally off-the-wall, extreme right-wing ideologues. I noticed that the Crosby report says:</para><quote><para>It is essential that there be an overriding commitment to good outcomes for the Party, rather than an obsession with self-interest and internal processes.</para></quote><para>So say all of us, and I would have thought that that would have been the bottom line in any political party. On Tuesday last week, we saw in Tasmania a clear example of the type of activity to which the Crosby report alludes, with the appearance of the newly elected Liberal representative for Braddon, Mr Brett Whiteley, in the Devonport Magistrate's Court to answer charges relating to his distribution of an unauthorised how-to-vote card during the election campaign. For the edification of the Senate, I will take people quite slowly through this because it is important. Mr Whiteley was charged with distributing matter containing the names of candidates without the consent of the candidates—which, under the Tasmanian Electoral Act, is an offence—the other candidates being the other Liberals that he was running against in Braddon. I have here a copy of the how-to-vote card, which I will seek to table later. </para><para>This is a clear breach of the Electoral Act in Tasmania and, accordingly, Mr Whiteley pleaded guilty. What else could he do, I suppose? Apparently, 3,000 of these illegal how-to-vote cards were distributed before their illegality was exposed four days before the poll date. In his interview with the police on 24 July, Mr Whiteley said he had planned for several months before the election to put out these illegal how-to-vote cards in an attempt to get his personal vote up. Those of us who have been in politics and in campaigning know that it takes a long time to organise a how-to-vote card; you do not just do it on the spur of the moment. Mr Whiteley, to his credit, fessed up, pleaded guilty and indicated that he had taken a long time in terms of the planning. So it was not a spur-of-the-moment thing as far as Mr Whiteley is concerned.</para><para>Mr Whiteley admitted to police that he knew that it was an offence under the Electoral Act to use other parties' candidates' names without their consent. So he was totally culpable from the outset; he knew and he still proceeded. In other words, this knowingly illegal act was part of his strategy to be elected as a Liberal representative for Braddon. This is really, as far as I can see, a clear demonstration of what Mr Crosby calls the self-interested and self-serving activities which are rife in the Tasmanian Liberal Party. Many people might expect that a premeditated breach of the Electoral Act would be grounds for expulsion, but oh no, not in the Liberal Party in Tasmania. He is not going to be expelled; he is going to stay there. He is the Liberal Party member for Braddon now.</para><para>I wish to indicate here in this chamber that speculation in Tasmania is rife that Senator Abetz assisted Mr Whiteley in the strategy concerning the how-to-vote cards. I personally find this very difficult to believe. I find it difficult to believe that the minister whose portfolio covers the Australian Electoral Commission and the management of the act would knowingly participate in what was clearly a breach of the Tasmanian act. I find it very difficult to believe; I am not sure whether or not it is true. But one of the things that this debate allows us to do is allow Senator Abetz to come into the chamber and advise on the following: did he or didn't he assist Mr Whiteley in this illegal activity; to what extent did he have discussions with Mr Whiteley; did he speak to Mr Whiteley; did he participate in the drawing up of the how-to-vote cards; and what advice did he provide Mr Whiteley and when? As I said, I find it difficult to believe that the minister for this area would have done this, because to do so would have been to participate knowingly in an illegal act. That is why I raise it here in this chamber: I want to give Senator Abetz the opportunity to come in here and clarify.</para><para>For a Labor Party person to hear about this, in terms of the internecine warfare that is going on in the Liberal Party, is not particularly usual.

However, I think the minister has to come in here and clarify that it is not true, because that this scuttlebutt is going around Tasmania reflects on all of us. I just want clarification. I am sure that if Senator Abetz were aware of it he would want to come in here and clarify it. So I have made the case in relation to that. As I said, I find it really difficult to believe but I would like to know the answer, as would many, I suspect. I am sure that it is not the case. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Crosby report contains what must be some sort of record—a total of 94 recommendations dealing with the Liberal Party in Tasmania, which shows that just about everything that could go wrong with a state political party is going wrong in Tasmania. Yet—and thank you very much to the other side for this—we still have Senator Abetz front and centre in the Liberal Party in Tasmania and for that we are eternally grateful. Long may he reign. It is no wonder that the federal Liberal Party has been driven to include what is colloquially known as the `dash for cash' in this bill. They need to keep bailing out people like Senator Abetz. But, according to Lynton Crosby's own report, the Tasmanian Liberal Party is in a dire financial state. It is so badly managed that it is barely capable of meeting its own administrative expenses.</para><para>We know about this in the Labor Party in Tasmania. We went through a very difficult exercise in 1992 after the intervention in Tasmania. We were faction riven, we had no money, we were down to 28 per cent of the vote and we went through a very painstaking reconstruction of the Tasmanian branch. One of the things that we did—and this is a bit of gratuitous advice for Senator Abetz—was ask the people who were the problem, in terms of creating this internecine warfare in the Labor Party, to step aside for a little while in order for the branch to reconstruct. Then we reconstructed, we had new rules, we essentially got our campaigning act together and we went from strength to strength to the point where we are today: we have five federal seats in Tasmania all being held by the Labor Party and we hold state government in spades. </para><para>As another result of the Crosby report, Senator Abetz sent what could be described as an SOS to the Prime Minister that the branch needed a bit of assistance after what was a humiliating debacle. ABC Radio advised that Senator Abetz had been given an extra staff member to assist the Liberal Party in Tasmania. I do not know what other senators think about the act but my understanding of the act is that you cannot just get extra staff to help out for party political reasons; you cannot just send an SOS. He is the minister, so who would he go to? It is like Caesar judging Caesar. He has an extra staff member—and I have a great deal of time for this person, so this is not a personal thing— who just happens to be John Shaw, who used to work for Senator Brian Harradine. I feel a bit sorry for Mr Shaw, because he has been given the poison chalice, as it were.</para><para>I want the minister to come in here and indicate what the rules are in relation to staff, be they electorate or ministerial. Is it appropriate that, as a result of an internal Liberal Party report, Senator Abetz gives himself an extra staff person to do, absolutely and entirely, party work? Now that Senator Abetz is here, I would appreciate clarification in relation to that. Now that Senator Abetz is here there are two things I would like clarified. The first one we have been through in great detail: the allegation in relation to Brett Whiteley, which I find very difficult to believe. The second one is this: what were the circumstances and issues surrounding the additional staff person? We would all like to know that.</para><para>Time does not permit me to go through the Crosby report in great detail but be assured that I will be doing so in various speeches, because it is a hoot. Anybody who has ever been involved in campaigning at a basic level would find this quite an amusing document but I will be going through it at another time. I will leave you with one quick quote from Mr Crosby's report. It is headed `The Liberal Strategy', and the first sentence is:</para><quote><para>There was no real Liberal campaign strategy.</para></quote><para>That is just a taste of what we will attempt to put down over the next few weeks in relation to this report.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>3654</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A little bit of the story of the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> has been lost, perhaps, since the debate began, but let me remind the Senate that this bill is about an attempt by the Howard government to centralise the receipt of public finding by the Liberal Party from the November 2001 election. The Finance and Public Administration Committee recommended, as you would expect, that the bill be proceeded with `expeditiously'. I must say that is a phrase I have not seen recently in committee reports about bills. Labor has been strongly opposed to the bill and produced quite a good minority report outlining why the bill should not be proceeded with.</para></talk.start><para>But the import of the bill—and let me make this quite clear—is to override the Commonwealth Electoral Act in certain respects. The act provides that public funding is paid to the agent of the state or territory branch of the party for which the candidate stood. There is also a mechanism which allows the state branches to request the payment to be made to another party, and this amendment short-circuits this process. Rather than allow the state branches effectively to get together and talk about how to distribute the funding, we have a bill that says it should go to the national organisation, which should distribute the funds as it sees fit. This would allow the secretariat of the Liberal Party to control the disbursement of all the public funding due to the Liberal Party. That might be a good thing but I do not think it really comes into this debate.</para><para>Much has been said about a whole range of extraneous matter, which I will comment on because this is the central part of the debate. The interesting question is: where is the public policy that is embodied within this bill? I do not think there is any and I have not heard Senator Brandis, Senator Johnston or Senator Mason talk about what the public policy initiative is within this bill. They have talked about branch stacking and a range of other matters but not about the public policy implications of this bill: whether there is any public policy merit or whether we should have this amendment to the Electoral Act. </para><para>I did take the opportunity to read Senator Brandis's contribution and I could not decide whether he was in support of the bill or whether he was speaking against the bill. I know that Senator Brandis has now contributed to the debate, so I will not ask him to clarify that. I will assume he spoke for the matter. Perhaps I have to take a longer bow to come to that conclusion. Some time ago, on 21 August 2001, this matter did arise in the press. The article is headed `Rebels stirring in Liberal ranks over funding'.

This bill takes away that; this bill denies cooperative federalism. It does not provide any policy prescription or reason why, which is a little bit disappointing. Many have called it a `dash for cash'; I am not going to call it a `dash for cash'. Scott Emerson, perhaps, said it a little better in an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> on 23 August 2002. He wrote:</para><quote><para>Lynton Crosby is the Jerry Maguire of Australian politics.

These amendments will enable an agent of the Liberal Party's national secretariat to determine the distribution of public funding from their national secretariat to their state and territory branches. It is surprising that the state branches have agreed to this—or perhaps they have not and that is the reason for this bill. Perhaps they have not at all and they are constrained in being able to present themselves here to talk about it. Nevertheless, I find the Liberal Party's need to come before the federal parliament seeking to have it pass legislation intended to assist it in managing the Liberal Party's internal financial affairs an amazing display of arrogance and contempt of the parliamentary process. However, as we know, the situation is in fact far worse. </para><para>The real purpose of this bill is to use the legislative power of the federal parliament to put an end to the internal power struggles and factional warfare within the Liberal Party itself. It has become clear to all that the Prime Minister and Mr Lynton Crosby, the supreme power brokers of the Liberal Party, have lost faith in their state and territory colleagues. In particular, Mr Howard and Mr Crosby have completely lost faith in their Queensland division—at least what is left of it. You have to admit that at least in this case the Prime Minister and Mr Crosby are probably correct in their assessment of their state colleagues. How anyone could have faith in such a faction ridden bunch of infighters is totally beyond me. However, this is a subject I will return to shortly.</para><para>Let us be totally clear about this: all this bill is intended to do is give the federal Liberal Party in the form of their national secretariat the power to pull their infighting and their faction riddled branches into line by gaining control of public electoral funding. The use of legislation like this to help the Liberal Party manage their internal financial affairs, let alone resolve factional disputes within the Liberal Party, is totally wrong. No other Australian federal government has attempted this unprecedented misuse but we have it here. It says volumes about the state of play of the Queensland Liberal Party. I heard Senator Mackay refer to the state of play of the Tasmanian Liberal Party and they appear to be in a similar state of disarray and faction ridden trouble. The action of the Liberal Party in this matter, from the Prime Minister down, has shown that they are still locked in their mentality of, `I've got control and I'm not letting it go.' The Liberals are having internal squabbles—if you do not want to call them factions, but it seems to me that they are internal factional fights.</para><para>In response to the crisis, rather than working it through, rather than talking these things through, we have a bill. Parliament is going to resolve your problems. The parliament of Australia is there to help you. This is why I do not think it should be used in this manner. Talk your way out of it. As I think Senator Ray suggested, grab a stamp and work out how you are going to split these matters up. It has been available for some time; you do not need this bill at all. </para><para>In the first half of this year, from 1 January through to 30 June, the Senate sat a mere 21 days, or 197 hours and 40 minutes. This is in comparison with the same period last year when the Senate sat for a total of 32 days, or 260 hours and 30 minutes. If it were about policy we might be having a reasonable debate, but this is not about a policy debate at all. The Senate's time, as I just highlighted to you, was underemphasised in the last half of the year and there are good debates to be had on important policy issues for the next half, and yet we still have the political infighting of the Liberal Party before us. What we should be doing is going on to legislation that does have policy implications that we can have reasonable debates about.</para><para>But me talk about some of the issues that were raised by Senator Mason during his speech. Perhaps he did go on to talk about what was, in essence, the problems confronting both Senator Brandis and Senator Mason in the debate. Senator Mason said on 22 August during this debate, `This is the ultimate insiders' debate.' He did not go on to explain other than to say that the Liberals are actually interested in trade globalisation and industrial relations reform. But I think he let it slip by saying it is the ultimate insiders' debate. It is your insiders' debate; it is not ours. This is a debate about the internal affairs of the Liberal Party, not about public policy issues—it is not about issues such as trade globalisation, industrial relations reform, mutual obligation and welfare reform, as Senator Mason comments, which is a pity.</para><para>Curiously, he then went on in the same speech—and I think we really get to the nub of what he was referring to and what I have been arguing today—to say: </para><quote><para>Someone like Senator Ray or Senator Faulkner ... will never come in here and debate policy, because when they do they lose.</para></quote><para>In a policy-free debate this is raised by Senator Mason.

That can be the only import of the bill. It can only mean that they do not want you to have independent financial control of your branch. They do not want you to be able to determine your electoral successes or your electoral non-successes, as the case may be. The federal body of the Liberal Party want you to be subservient to their wishes. They do not want to negotiate with you as to how equitably the funds should be distributed. They simply want to control the manner in which the funds are distributed. They want to use the Commonwealth Electoral Act for that purpose, which is indeed disappointing.</para><para>Another article in the Brisbane <inline font-style="italic">Courier Mail</inline> on 17 July this year likened the web of conspiracy, threats and melodrama that currently exists within the Queensland Liberal Party to an episode of the <inline font-style="italic">X Files</inline>.

The primary purpose is to allow the Liberal Party federal secretariat to determine the distribution of election funding between the federal secretariat and the state and territory divisions of the Liberal Party. There is a very simple answer to what this bill is all about and that appears to be, in brief, the answer. </para></talk.start><para>Currently, a decision is being made by the Australian Electoral Commission based on the agreement between the state branches and the federal secretariat. If an agreement is absent, election funding would go to the state branches. It is essential to note that most of the funding would go to those state branches whose candidates achieved the best polling during the election. The Labor Party feel that the bill is unnecessary. The problems that the Liberal Party are having with their distribution of funds should have been, and could have been, resolved within the party if they had sat down together and worked out exactly how this should work. They could even call upon the ALP national secretariat for advice in relation to this, because we have no difficulty with the arrangements as they are. The government are really hiding behind their own mismanagement. And in hiding behind that mismanagement, they have introduced a bill into this chamber that should not have been introduced. It is apparent the government do not trust their state parties, and when there is no trust between the federal and state parties then you are doomed to failure.</para><para>Another rationale could be that the amendments serve to relieve the Liberal Party of an unnecessary administrative burden associated with the goods and services tax. There has been speculation about the Liberal Party and the Queensland branch in relation to that. The federal secretariat, for the purposes of managing a federal election campaign, is a taxable supply under the new tax system—that is, the goods and services tax system. While the arrangement is financially neutral from the perspective of the state division and the federal secretariat— because the state division is entitled to reclaim the GST payment in the form of imputed tax credits—it does impose a modest compliance burden on both parties. It is true that they have become unmanageable, uncontrollable and are causing difficulties within their own party. Due to the Prime Minister's lack of leadership, we are now witnessing this bill in order to avoid nasty confrontation with some of their state and divisional directors by simply getting parliament to legislate to solve the problem. That is simply what they are doing: asking this place to fix their internal squabbles. That shows that, whilst they may be in government, the reality is they cannot govern themselves. </para><para>Some might recall the contribution of Senator Mason last week. Quite frankly, I thought that the evangelicals had descended upon the parliament and Jimmy Swaggart was reincarnated within the chamber! He played well to the crowd but he forgot to mention the bill, and he forgot to mention the real issue of why we are here debating this bill—the internal problems of his own party. It was a grand display that said nothing. He was holding up his parliamentary handbook as if it were the Holy Bible. He was going to tell us all about senators on this side, but he did not quite get to that part. But it looked good for the gallery. He was going to tell us what union backgrounds we all had.

That is what it is really all about; you cannot get away from that singular fact. It is about the problems and what is required by the Liberal Party to resolve the bickering over the disbursement of public funding within the party. That is what it is all about: who is going to get the most out of the public funding during election campaigns? With the party in government, one has to laugh and think, `If this is the best they can do, how are they governing this country properly?'</para><para>The bill really has nothing at all to do with anyone else. It is an absolute disgrace that we are being asked to resolve the Liberal Party's problems and it is an absolute disgrace that the Liberal Party was so barefaced in coming to the parliament to resolve them. I suppose we can understand that the government's desperation is such that it is now trying to force through and pass this bill. It is a futile exercise because the people can see through it. The Liberal Party is no longer in government in any of the states or territories because it cannot run its own party machine in such a way that it can translate into governments elsewhere. Being the party in federal government is always a wonderful stepping stone if one is looking to state governments, but of course it did not work on any occasion for this Liberal Party government.

This bill provides that the Liberal Party's national office, the Federal Secretariat, may write to the Australian Electoral Commission before polling day specifying the federal percentage of public funding— that is, the amount that will go to the Liberal Party's Federal Secretariat—and the state percentage—that is, the amount that will be paid to the state or territory division of the party. If there is no such written notice, the Federal Secretariat will receive all of the public funding. The Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918 declares that its purpose is to, as stated: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Consolidate and Amend the Law relating to Parliamentary Elections and for other purposes.</para></quote><para>This bill of course takes a most broad and liberal construction of the two words `other purposes'. It is an amendment to the act that is an attempt to use the parliamentary processes to settle internal factional disagreements in the Liberal Party.</para><para>We all know that in every political party there are differing groups, people with different philosophical outlooks and different ideological perspectives. We saw that manifest in a debate in this chamber last Wednesday or Thursday, when Senator Stott Despoja made the point that she had been receiving an inadequate amount of support from her own colleagues within her parliamentary party and through the party room. As a consequence of that, she was forced to make certain decisions affecting her own future and the future of her party. Similarly, within the Australian Labor Party it is no secret that there are people with wide-ranging perspectives on a range of issues that face us on a day-to-day basis. And, similarly, it would be unrealistic to suggest that the same does not apply in the two parties that comprise government—the Liberal Party and the National Party.</para><para>But I suppose the matter that distinguishes the opposition and the minor parties in this place from the government parties is that the opposition in particular—I am more familiar with its rules—has rules that determine how state branches are established, how they are set up and run, what the financing is, how funds are to be received and how funds are to be distributed. That is essentially resolved at a national level by a national executive that is elected by and from delegates in all of the states.</para><para>It has long been the practice that funding received by our party at a national level goes to the national organisation and is distributed to the various branches consistent with the national purpose. That is why you have national structures, national organisations, receiving funding via the national parliament for national purposes. The Liberal Party in opposition could have gone down that path many years ago when the issue of public funding of political parties was squarely put on the agenda and the various parties consulted amongst themselves and with each other as to the appropriate way that political parties across Australia were going to receive public funding from the Commonwealth. The Australian Labor Party, in its wisdom, made a particular decision at the time. It has never sought to revoke or revise it and, as I understand it, is quite happy for the decision made some years ago to be applied now and into the future.</para><para>The Liberal Party made a similar decision. We are advised that they consulted with their state branches, their state divisions, and made a particular decision that the funding was to go to the organisation at a state level and that the state organisations or state divisions would expend those funds, presumably consistent with their rules, on purposes decided at a state level. Presumably, there was also acknowledgment that there would be the appropriate degree of contact between the state divisions. Now, as we look around Australia at each of the state divisions of the Liberal Party—each in opposition, each the subject of major losses in the last two or three years, each the subject of change, each the subject of leadership challenge and each trying to decide where they fit into the political cycle—we observe that the agreement freely entered into within that party, for reasons that have not been made clear and are not fully detailed in the explanatory memorandum, is no longer adequate, and this bill is before us because there is a view that the funding direction should be altered.</para><para>As I outlined in my opening remarks, the change that is sought is for the Liberal Party's national office or federal secretariat to write to the Australian Electoral Commission prior to a scheduled federal election and advise where the funding is to be directed, what percentage—somewhere between zero and 100 per cent—is to be directed to the federal party and what outstanding amount is to be directed to the various state or territory divisions of the party. Where there is no such written notice, the federal secretariat will receive all of the public funding. So the central purpose and clear direction of the bill is that all Commonwealth funding that is going to be directed to the Liberal Party is to be directed to the national office of that organisation, subject to that organisation advising the Australian Electoral Commission in writing what percentages might be directed elsewhere to the various state divisions. That means that the bill addresses the issue of `other purposes' in the 1918 act, and this amendment to the act is a clear attempt to use parliamentary processes to settle internal differences within the Liberal Party. The national office of the party wants control of the money that the state branches need because that gives it power over the branches; that is, he who pays the piper calls the tune. In this case the clear intention is for the national office of the Liberal Party to intervene, set up directions, set up staffing and set controls so that the various state divisions or state branches act consistently with the directions of the national office. That purpose is to be achieved via the mechanism that if they do not comply they do not receive funding, and that is what this bill is about. </para><para>For obvious reasons the various state divisions of the Liberal Party do not want this change to occur. If they did want it to occur, it would presumably be a relatively simple process to organise a properly convened meeting for the state divisions to come together to consider a resolution, and the resolution would in outcome be similar to or identical to the outcome that will be contained in this bill if it is passed by a majority in this place. But it is clear that that normal process of negotiation has been entered into and, as is sometimes the case in negotiations, the result has been unsatisfactory as far as the proponents of change are concerned: they have been unable to persuade a majority of their colleagues on their own national governing body or all or some of the various divisions to agree to change.</para><para>Yet eight years ago when the present system of funding was introduced, the Liberal Party argued for this dual system dividing funding between state and federal branches of the party. At that time they argued that it was inconsistent with their ideological belief in state rights, so the Labor Party agreed to amendments to the bill—the government of the day agreed to accept the amendments sought by the then opposition, the Liberal Party—and the bill was amended to let the then opposition party be funded in the way that they thought to be appropriate. So the questions thus arise: what warrants such serious intervention by our federal parliament? Why can't the Liberal Party sort this out internally? That is what they should do.</para><para>We heard last week that the Australian Democrats apparently have differences in philosophy and approaches as to where their party should go. Whilst that debate has been conducted in a relatively public fashion, it is clear that, as is appropriate, they are seeking to resolve their differences internally. They do not resort to ask the parliament, the government or the opposition for advice or seek to have previous acts of parliament amended to suit the desires of a particular group or clique. Similarly, within the Labor Party, my party, it is clear that we are undergoing a serious internal discussion as to what are the appropriate structures that should guide our party into the future. Serious discussion is occurring about the level of union involvement, how delegates should be elected from the various branches, how delegates should be elected from the lay component and a range of subsidiary issues deriving from those key or core principles. But at no time have we ever asserted that it is anything other than a matter of our business that we bring our various state divisions together, put the issues on the table and attempt to resolve them by negotiation or discussion, and in the event of that failing we resolve it by the usual process of a vote.</para><para>We do not think it is any business of the government as to how we conduct our affairs. We do not think it is any business of any other party how we conduct our affairs. We do not think it is any business of the government how we allocate funding that is received via the Commonwealth Electoral Act, as long as that funding is spent properly, consistent with the rules of the party and consistent with the law of the land. Having received the funding consistent with an act of parliament, we expend it, consistent with our own rules, and that is the end of the matter. We do not seek the assistance of any other political party as to how we establish our structures or how we spend our funds, and we do not seek to go back on past understandings, past commitments or, more importantly in the context of this debate, to overturn decisions and agreements reached via various internal processes of our party. Yet, on the other side of this chamber, this issue was squarely faced eight years ago when the government was in opposition. They consulted with their various divisions, their various state branches, and they came to us with a proposition that reflected, at that time, the will of their party. How do we know that? Firstly, they advised it; secondly, it was reported in the press; and, thirdly, they referred us to the various resolutions passed by the state divisions authorising their national officers to conduct themselves in negotiations in a particular way. </para><para>Compare that with the current situation where, similarly, internal discussions and internal negotiations have been conducted in the Liberal Party. There has been no agreement to shift, to change, to alter, to move and so the national office simply walks around to the Prime Minister's office and says, `This is unfair. We've got six or seven divisions around Australia. They've considered a proposition. All of them have rejected the suggestion of change, but we still want to go down this path and we want to have a bill introduced into the parliament which would change the status quo.' That is what they are doing here now. They are attempting to change the status quo inconsistent with, and contrary to, the express desires and wishes of their party, but, more importantly, inconsistent with, and contrary to, the express policy decisions of their own divisions and express resolutions passed by their own party.</para><para>When you engage in that sort of activity— where you simply come in the back door, take the $25 million or $35 million a year that is available via public funding, allocate it to national office and allow only national office to choose how to spend it, and for national office to privately and secretly decide what conditions or what amendments will be attached to the distribution of those funds— you get to the stage where you have a total perversion of the ideas of accountability, responsibility and transparency. Repeatedly over the last five years, the opposition have been told in discussions over various pieces of legislation that one of the core attributes of the Howard government is responsibility in the raising and disbursement of public funds, accountability to the various agencies of the Commonwealth for the distribution of those funds, and, more importantly, accountability and responsibility to taxpayers—either personal or corporate entities—who provide those funds to the Commonwealth. Yet, in this debate—when it is a matter that affects their own party, and future funding and how those funds will be allocated—they go back on all those core principles. They reject every proposition they have put in financial bills and budget bills over the last five or six years and they say, `The national office, in its wisdom, on its own, makes a decision that that body will receive the $25 million or $35 million.'</para><para>What is the alternative? The alternative, of course, is to sit down and engage in negotiations with the various state divisions and identify the various problems that might exist in the various parties around Australia— whether they are policy problems, whether they are branch-stacking problems, whether there is a lack of leadership at the various levels, whether there is too much alternate leadership at the various levels in the various states, whether it is about the drifting or whether it is about the break-up of their vote to a range of other political parties on both the left and the right. You could go through a serious sit-down in each state and do a serious analysis of what the problems are in a particular division of the Liberal Party, do a serious needs analysis as to what funding is required, and come up with a set of solutions that could be worked through that party and which might receive membership support and membership endorsement, and which might result in significant structural and procedural change being implemented in the various state divisions of the Liberal Party.</para><para>The effect, of course, of going through that policy and organisational review process, is that you modernise your party—you bring it up to date; you get rid of the old, you get rid of the stuff that has been rejected, you get rid of the stuff that is no longer acceptable, you get rid of the people who are no longer performing and you get your finances in order. What happens when you do that? At the next election in the various states, two, three or four years hence, candidates in the various divisions of the Liberal Party will most likely be serious candidates for election in the various states and territories. At the moment, they are not. They simply say, `We don't really have any problems, although we've lost eight of the last nine elections. We don't have problems in Western Australia or in South Australia'—where they really did give away the election in both cases. Those elections were there to be won and should not have been given away. They were given away simply because the proper processes of organisational review, preselection, financing and fundraising had not been gone through in a consistent, logical and principled fashion. </para><para>That is one way you could identify the problems in your own party in the various states: you could go through that open, accountable, transparent policy review. Put your ideology and your philosophies on the table, engage in the discussion and the argy-bargy around what are promises, what are commitments and where the electorate wants its government to lead it. Then, having established the rules, there is no doubt that the funding from the private sector, from the business community and, indeed, from the Commonwealth would flow, because you would have a viable organisation, a viable opposition, that is presenting sound alternative paths upon which the community might, in those circumstances, be ready to adopt, adapt to and follow.</para><para>But, no, in this situation the Liberal Party do not do that. They say, `All those things are fine. We do not have any serious need of review. The map has changed from blue to red in every state and territory over the last four or five years, but we are going to continue with the old way. We are going to continue with the structures that were established many years ago. We are going to allow the branch stacking to occur. We are going to allow—and, indeed, encourage— the branch stacking in particular states to go out of all proportion. We are going to allow membership numbers in various divisions to increase from a normal, run-of-the-mill 25 or 35 persons who attend, participate and are elected to office.' All of a sudden, overnight, those numbers increased to 300 or 450.</para><para>We only have to look at the various press reports of what has occurred in Queensland in recent times where, when you have a small rump of people controlling the party, federal preselections are on order, state preselections are coming on stream, and the membership numbers are so minor that you can do an afternoon doorknock in a few of the better-off suburbs in Brisbane and increase your membership numbers from 25 in particular division to 100. Of course, they do not have to live in the division; they do not even have to live in the state—or in the country, as was witnessed in South Australia. All those new members get to vote in preselection procedures, and you can change a particular candidate simply because you go through that rorter process. The net result of that—not to take Brisbane or Queensland in isolation—is that, after many years, you do not become an opposition and you do not become a party; you are not registered as such. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>3664</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to add my comments on the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>.

What a contrast it is to see Labor engaging with its rank and file, very soon to discuss at a national conference very important rule changes designed to make us a party of the future. What a contrast it is to see that the Liberal Party approach to obviously much needed reform is to try to move this bill through this parliament—this dash for cash bill which looks at filling up the coffers of their federal office: `Don't bother talking to the state branches; don't bother talking to the rank and file.

It is unacceptable on two counts. It is a complete flouting of our democratic institutions, particularly this parliament, and I think that the Liberal abuse of institutions of this country through their period of government has been well documented. The way this government has gone about its affairs in office has been to much embarrassment of many Australians who take such pride in our democratic institutions. I think the second important point is how political parties conduct themselves. We are in an era when issues of corporate governance and morality in management are at the forefront of everybody's minds. How ironic is it that we find ourselves arguing about such issues before the parliament today as the Liberal Party sound off about the need for higher quality corporate governance in the private sector when they are using the parliamentary processes and this particular bill to sort out their own little issues of corporate governance.</para><para>I would like to take this opportunity to inform the chamber of the next chapter in what can only be described as a soap opera, although I hesitate to do that because it is about the integrity of our democracy.

In relation to your specific question about this JDS Uniphase operation, the government is aware that there is a possibility that the Australian operations of JDS Uniphase may close down. Options for a local management buy-out are currently being considered by the company. The threat to the Australian operation is part of a global review by this US based company, following the recent downturn in the photonics industry and the high technology sector more generally. The government recognises the importance of a vibrant photonics industry in Australia and so is closely monitoring developments. We appreciate the opposition's keen interest in the matter. The government is also aware that the local operations of ADC Telecommunications are being scaled down. This is a direct result of the parent company's cost reduction and restructuring efforts, which are directed at lowering the company's overall cost structure and improving the company's profitability.

This government set about putting in place border protection measures to stop that. Since August last year, a month which saw over 1,200 unauthorised arrivals alone, an unauthorised boat has not landed on the Australian mainland. That speaks volumes for the policy that the Howard government has adopted in protecting Australia's borders. When you look at arrivals on the excised territories, you see that there has indeed been a drop from some 4,000 to 2,400 arrivals for the same period. We are experiencing the result of our policy working, and we are seeing it in the fact that not one unauthorised boat has arrived on the Australian mainland since August last year. There was the people-smuggling conference which Australia co-sponsored with Indonesia, and that was a great success. Out of that, we have seen unprecedented cooperation in the region in relation to people-smuggling. We have been working with our neighbours to make people-smuggling a criminal offence. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I can announce today that the government will be legislating further in relation to people-smuggling offences.

We will criminalise, where an offender is an Australian citizen or resident, the smuggling of a person, even when the smuggled person did not transit through Australia. We will criminalise the smuggling of a person from Australia to another country. We will also outlaw more serious conduct where the offender smuggles groups of people, or exploits, traffics, cruelly treats or endangers the smuggled person. That is very important because we are dealing with ruthless people smugglers who do not care a jot for their human cargo. Maximum penalties of 10 years imprisonment will apply to offences, or 20 years imprisonment when the more serious behaviour that I have mentioned is involved. </para><para>I can report to the Senate today that, as a result of increased cooperation, we saw today in Thailand a court order that Hasan Ayoub, a person who is wanted in Australia for people-smuggling, be extraditable to Australia. Mr Ayoub does have an avenue of appeal available to him but the government of Australia welcomes this development. This is just another indication of how we are working closely with our neighbours in fighting people-smuggling in the region. This is an important development in enforcement in relation to people smugglers and our new laws will go a long way to fighting people-smuggling.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation: Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd</title><page.no>3668</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>3668</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan.

When we came to government in 1996, there was of course no such thing as a customer service guarantee: Telstra fixed your phone when they were good and ready. Certainly, the people who lived in 80 per cent of the landmass in the outer extended zones had no such thing as untimed local calls; it was always on the agenda at National Party conferences but the Labor Party had not the slightest interest in the subject.</para></talk.start><para>You can go right through the list and you will find that since we came to government, apart from spending over a billion dollars on regional and rural infrastructure, we introduced the customer service guarantee— which is world's best practice—to ensure that people have a replacement technology for analog. Remember that this lot on the other side just phased it out with no replacement in mind—a horrific technological dilemma that fortunately was able to be solved on our watch. On it goes: mobile phones along, I think, 11 major national highways and about 37 lesser highways provide the sort of coverage that people only dreamed about a few years ago, getting out to almost every rural hamlet these days. And the satellite subsidy of up to $1,100 is hugely important to people who live beyond the reach of normal mobile phone base stations. So there is a great deal that has been done already. There is always more that can be done in the future but there is only one side of the parliament that is really interested in these issues.</para><para>We have looked after almost every risk that consumers face but there is one that we cannot guarantee against, and that is the internal sovereign risk: the remote possibility of the Labor Party coming to office. That is a very big problem for people living in regional and rural Australia. They know that Labor have a fragmentation policy on Telstra: they want to break it up into little pieces. I am not sure what happened last Friday, but certainly in the caucus subcommittee meeting Mr Tanner's paper got an absolute thrashing from not only Telstra but Senator Mackay, who represents the CEPU in this parliament—and of course does so admirably, as so many of her colleagues do in pursuing their specific union interests. We have had no apology from Mr Tanner. It is still business as usual; he is still hell-bent on breaking up the company. You only had to read the article by Richard Gluyas in the <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> a few weeks back about the absolutely poisonous relationship that exists between Telstra and the shadow minister. What on earth would happen if Labor ever came to government? It would be at an absolute standstill: you would have the political party of the day wanting to break up a company against the wishes not only of the board but of two million shareholders. It would be an absolute nightmare scenario. That is one thing that I think regional and rural Australia has to be terribly concerned about, if you have someone harbouring that sort of evil intent. Labor are not in the business of looking after consumers and they are not interested in debating quality of service issues; they are interested in bagging the group that we set up to look at the adequacy of services. </para><para>There is a lot that can be done and there is only one side of the parliament that is interested in debating those issues, and we will continue to do so. We have consumers' interests at heart, not unions' interests; we have the wider perspective on these matters. Consumers' interests do not lie in breaking up Telstra or in protecting the network in such a way that it becomes an absolute dog for any government to run and becomes, hopefully for them, a cash cow with which to subsidise some of their rural marginal seats. We have a comprehensive approach that will ensure that people in regional and rural Australia get the telecommunications services they deserve.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>3670</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

In relation to the first part of her question—whether I am aware of the statements made by a particular person— the answer is no. In relation to the second part of the question—which relates more generally to family tax payments, notices of amounts of payment received and whether the provision or otherwise of those notices is an explanation for people being surprised at any overpayment being taken out of their tax payment—I have this to say: Senator, it should be of no surprise to any family that, if they have had an overpayment of a tax benefit, the overpayment of the tax benefit will be recouped through any tax refund they otherwise would get.</para></talk.start><para>That was a part of the legislation that was passed in this place in 1999. There was an expectation that that is what would happen. Families and individuals understand that if you have paid too much tax you get some back and if you owe tax you get a notice saying that you should pay more. The family tax benefit is a tax payment. It is paid through Centrelink—as are a number of payments that are not, strictly speaking, welfare payments—and families that have got an overpayment do not expect to keep it. They expect to pay it back and they have understood for years and years that tax reconciliations are done at the end of the year.</para><para>There was an exception because the government changed the family tax and family assistance arrangements as a consequence of the new tax system. We dramatically simplified them. There were far too many payments. It was just far too complex. Furthermore, we increased them and we gave families the option of taking their family tax payment as an end of year lump sum payment or through the year. The implementation of that system in the first year proved to be a difficulty for some families and in the first year we provided a number of changes to assist families in adjusting to a new system. Those changes were a one-off $1,000 waiver and agreeing that in that year we would turn off the legislated requirement for family tax benefit overpayments to otherwise come out of the tax refund. That was an exception for the first year, did not continue in the next year and will not continue in subsequent years. In summary, Senator, it should be no surprise to any family that when they have had an overpayment—and families know when they have got money and they know that they should not be claiming it a second time—they should expect to pay it back. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3671</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I have a supplementary question.

In any event, Senator Conroy, the answer to your question is that setting off a Commonwealth debt against a tax refund entitlement is, of course, nothing new. I recall the previous government used to do it. It is a longstanding practice. The commissioner has advised me that the mechanism whereby tax credits are used for family tax benefit debts is similar to offering arrangements which have been in place between other government agencies and the ATO for some time. Offsetting ensures that debts are collected simply and easily for both the taxpayer and the government. </para></talk.start><para>What appears to be overlooked in this whole debate about family tax benefits is this: is it really the Labor Party's policy that the money should be retained by these families? Is that really what is being said? What is being put is that it certainly assists families if the debts are collected both simply and easily. It helps both the taxpayer and the government. The taxpayer does not have to make provision for the payment of a separate debt, because the amount owing to the other agency is withheld from the tax refund and sent to that agency. In this case the Taxation Office is collecting overpayment of family tax benefits by the department of social security. The alternative to the use of offsetting against the tax refund is for the department to either take recovery action itself or allow the overpayment to stand. Which would you rather? Neither is very satisfactory. Quite clearly, it is not appropriate that you just let it stand, and it is certainly not appropriate that you have to take recovery action. It is a mechanism that is well recognised and has been in place for some considerable time.</para><para>For the first year of the family tax benefit, the offsetting provisions were not used while taxpayers developed a better understanding of the new family tax benefit system. Offsetting the family tax claims against tax commenced from 1 July 2002 for tax returns for the 2001-02 year will commence. It is not something that is a punitive arrangement. It is not as if anyone who was caught up in the mass marketed schemes and took advantage of some offer that was made by the commissioner is in any different position in principle. The offsetting of the family tax benefit is simply a mechanism which, as I said a little earlier, not only assists families generally but also assists them because they do not have to be subject to recovery action and they do not have to then let the debt stand; whereas those caught up in the mass marketed schemes of those who have not settled will of course be subject to recovery action. They are in a very different position from anyone who has been overpaid a benefit under the family tax system.

He has called upon Minister Truss to work with the state governments to improve the EC process. He put out a press release making this call, and I have to say that his release was ignored because everyone knows that Senator O'Brien was being slightly disingenuous in that call. Minister Truss has tried to work with the states on EC. In fact, Senator O'Brien perhaps was disappointed after the May ministerial council meeting when it appeared that Minister Truss had achieved some—though not complete—consensus with the states. Senator O'Brien apparently does not want to have that consensus with the states because it will mean that the states will have to take some responsibility to help farmers. State ministers have agreed with Minister Truss's plan for reform of EC and agreed that it was a good plan. Some of them wanted to work with Minister Truss to further develop the EC plan jointly. Others, including the Queensland and New South Wales ministers, indicated that they would prefer to keep using EC as a political tool to attack the federal government. They were clearly not interested in working with Minister Truss. Senator O'Brien, could I suggest with respect that, as I said to you last week, you would be better off using your influence to urge your state colleagues—many of whom have no real understanding of rural Australia and who simply want to play on the farmers' woes to score points—to help farmers by joining with the federal government in overcoming these very difficult times.  </para></talk.start><para>It is a very difficult drought and the state governments are required to provide assistance. For EC to apply it has to be a once-in-a-lifetime or cataclysmic event and then the federal government will come in and provide assistance but until that time these are really issues for the states. I urge Senator O'Brien to work constructively with the Commonwealth government. I personally believe he has some interest in doing it. The best way he could do that is not to make political points of this but to work with Mr Truss, to work with the federal government and, more importantly, to get his state Labor colleagues to work with the Commonwealth so that a non-political resolution can be achieved in these very difficult circumstances in which farmers find themselves.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3675</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'BRIEN</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It was only when they got back home and talked to their treasurers that they all went to water, and that is where you could help. You say that you issued some warning to Mr Truss in June. I am not sure how you issued that warning but, Senator, if you are serious—and I believe that at times you are—about helping people in these difficult circumstances, rather than issuing a press release and running it around the political journalists why do you not go and see Mr Truss and say, `Why do we not do this, let's approach the state agriculture ministers together and let's try work something out so that the farmers are given some help'?

Unilaterally—without any reference to the Commonwealth at all—the Victorian government a couple of months ago slashed logging in Victoria by about a third. Senator McGauran asks me what the impact of that was. Do not take my word for it, Senator McGauran, read what the Assistant National Secretary of the forestry division at the CFMEU said. That is Michael O'Connor. I understand his brother is one of your colleagues in this parliament. He said that as a result of this, 600 jobs would be put at risk in country Victoria. That is, 600 jobs would go as a result of the Victorian government's decision. He went on to say that, in social terms, that equated to hundreds of thousands of job losses in metropolitan Melbourne. If that happened in metropolitan Melbourne, you could understand the outrage from Victorian members of parliament. They would be howling at the tops of their voices. But, because it is in the country, nobody over on the other side here and nobody in the federal Labor Party has any concern at all that 600 jobs are to go from country Australia. </para></talk.start><para>The Commonwealth by comparison has put in some $13 million to help with industry development assistance in Victoria as a result of the RFA, and that is what you do to help with jobs in the country. Another way of doing it is to provide for tourism in country Australia, and the Howard government has certainly been at the forefront in achieving this by supporting tourist icons, particularly in remote Australia. I had the pleasure recently of taking the Treasurer to the Stockman's Hall of Fame and the Qantas Founders Museum in Longreach and to the wool scour and the old post and telegraph station in Tambo. They have all received substantial funding from the federal government. </para><para>We have also provided some $4.66 million to the Shearers Hall of Fame in Hay in New South Wales. That was to pay tribute to an industry that has helped to build country Australia. The shearers union, which amalgamated with the general labourers union to form the AWU—both Senator Ludwig and Senator Forshaw will know about that—now supposedly look after the shearers. But what have they done? What have the AWU done? Senator Forshaw should be ashamed of this. They have black-banned the Shearers Hall of Fame because they will not let them sign an individual contract with the centre. They will not let them do that. The AWU and their masters—or their minions, I should say—in the ALP are trying to shut down the Shearers Hall of Fame which would bring real jobs to country Australia because they will not fall into line with the union's outdated view of industrial relations. It is no wonder the ALP want to limit the power of the unions, when you have unions like the AWU trying to stop job creation in country Australia. I ask you, Senator Ludwig and Senator Forshaw, to get onto your union, the AWU, and have them help and support the Shearers Hall of Fame so that we can create jobs in country Australia.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Trade: United States Beef Quota</title><page.no>3676</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>3676</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Hill as the Minister representing the Minister for Trade.

This is in addition to APRA currently taking steps to disqualify the former trustees of Commercial Nominees under the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>AUSTRALIAN LABOR PARTY</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3679</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Leadership and Office Holders</title><page.no>3679</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>3679</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> a revised list of the shadow ministry, including shadow parliamentary secretaries and representations in both chambers.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The document read as follows</inline>—</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">SHADOW MINISTRY</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">as at 23 August 2002 </inline></para><table pgwide="1" border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><tgroup><thead><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para><inline font-weight="bold">PORTFOLIO</inline></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para><inline font-weight="bold">SHADOW MINISTER </inline><inline font-weight="bold">1</inline></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para><inline font-weight="bold">OTHER CHAMBER</inline></para></entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para><inline font-weight="bold">Leader</inline></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Hon Simon Crean MP</inline></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para>Senator the Hon John Faulkner</para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para><inline font-style="italic">Parliamentary Secretary</inline></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para><inline font-style="italic">Alan Griffin MP</inline></para></entry><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para></para></entry></row><row><entry border-style="solid" border-color="black" border-width="1pt"><para><inline font-weight="bold">Deputy Leader.

And superannuation is less regulated than banking. It is going to be tough. It is going to be hard particularly for the industry funds. It is going to mean that the representatives of some of the workers on those industry funds, including union officials, are going to start to be held accountable for investment decisions. It is going to force those people to disclose and at times, seek approval, of members if they are going to engage in related-party activities. So if they are giving work to mates they are going to need to seek approval of members of the fund.

On the one hand, there are the problems of the family tax benefit overpayments which are being deducted without the authority and, in many cases, without the knowledge of many Australians from their tax refund. On the other hand, there is their soft attitude towards the top end of town. </para><para>The issue that I raised today concerns the matter of Commercial Nominees, which is a superannuation savings vehicle. Theft and fraud in the superannuation industry is not significant but in the case of Commercial Nominees, where this has occurred, some $25 million from the retirement superannuation savings of hundreds of individuals, both pre and post-retirement, who are members of Commercial Nominees, was stolen. We know that is a fact because the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act provides for compensation to be paid where theft and fraud occurs in respect to superannuation.</para><para>We know that the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, did receive advice from a senior legal counsel through the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority—commonly known as APRA—which concluded that fraudulent conduct did occur by a number of individuals who were managing, in this case, some $25 million of hundreds of Australians' retirement income savings. We know that fraudulent conduct has occurred. Legal advice went to the minister via APRA and the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, has accepted that legal advice, correctly. We do not criticise her for accepting the legal advice that fraudulent conduct has occurred. The minister then went on to award compensation.</para><para>In the Labor Party's view, in these sorts of cases where we are dealing with compulsory retirement income savings—superannuation—we believe that full compensation should occur. It has not occurred in this particular case. That is an important issue but it is a side issue to the central issue of this minister and the Liberal government in particular being soft when it comes to the top end of town in these sorts of fraudulent cases. We know that fraud has been found in this case: the legal advice is that fraud has occurred in respect of the superannuation system. So if fraud has been found, why, 18 months after the removal of the trustees from this superannuation fund, have no charges been laid against anyone? We have received evidence on a number of individuals who have been involved in this fraudulent conduct. One of these individuals is apparently somewhere in Nicaragua in Central America, and no effort has been made to get this individual back to Australia to have him charged, to try to hold him accountable for the $25 million that has been fraudulently stolen from Commercial Nominees, being the superannuation savings of hundreds of Australians.</para><para>It is all very well for this individual to be in Nicaragua, living it up in exotic locations in Central America, but this government has done nothing about getting him back to Australia. This government has done nothing about laying charges against this individual. This government has done nothing about laying charges against the other individuals who were involved in the Commercial Nominees superannuation fraud, yet the government has accepted that fraud has occurred: it has acted to award compensation. As for the perpetrators of the fraud involving some $25 million in retirement savings, nothing has happened to those who have stolen the retirement savings of some hundreds of Australians in this case and caused an immeasurable amount of suffering while this individual suns himself in various locations in Nicaragua. It is about time the government did something about it and got him back here and laid some charges.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>3683</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Congratulations, Mr Deputy President, on your appointment.

The people who were ravaging it were certainly not the directors or trustees of the top end of town; they were certainly well down the list. So on that reference he fails. The second issue is that there have already been two references to the DPP, including that of the director who went off some years ago with some money to America and then on to Nicaragua, so the truth is that there have already been two references to the DPP who are already looking into it— error No. 2. As for error No. 3, the problem was that while there was some theft or fraud perpetrated quite a number of years ago— and I could go right back to about 1997—in relation to the total loss, the theft or fraud was relatively minuscule. I hope that Senator Sherry's outburst is not going to lead certain people to challenge the levy, when it is ultimately provided, on all super funds across the country.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let us get some background to what happened to Commercial Nominees. Until recently it was the trustee of approximately 475 small APRA funds, a master trust known as Confidens Investment Trust and two trusts known as Enhanced Equity Fund and Enhanced Cash Management Trust, often referred to as ECMT. There were also a number of corporate and public offer superannuation funds, including the Australian Workforce Eligible Rollover Fund, the Network Super Fund and the Midas Super Fund, the total assets of which were around $300 million. CNA was an APRA-approved trustee. The size of the losses caused by the collapse of CNA is estimated, however, to be about $25 million and the collapse has affected close to 25,000 investors. Most of those were in the 475 small APRA funds. The losses have caused major emotional and financial difficulties for a large number of people, many of whom placed their lifetime savings with CNA, expecting reasonable returns on their investment for their retirement. Unfortunately, some investors have been left feeling confused, helpless, angry and frustrated and they have lost a lot of confidence in APRA, to which they have naturally assigned the blame. I would like to take this opportunity to say that, since coming to office, Senator Coonan has moved very quickly and through her action a lot of people are receiving compensation.</para><para>During the committee inquiry a number of issues were raised which highlighted the performance of CNA as a trustee and the role of the regulators, including the adequacy of the regulatory framework, as well as the auditing of superannuation funds. As part of the investment strategy—and this is really where CNA went wrong—the majority of the funds should have been invested in cash. Unfortunately, they were invested in things such as strawberry farms and other undertakings; they were not invested in the likes of BT, the banks, Merrill Lynch et cetera. The other problem was that a lot of these investments were not made at arm's length. All this was not theft or fraud, which was bad and contrary to APRA's rules and all that sort of thing. In response to the committee's questions on this issue, APRA advised the committee that within the superannuation industry it is common for trustees of superannuation funds also to be trustees of other entities in which superannuation moneys are invested. This is probably where some of the weak links which needed to be tied up were. For example, Mr Phil Dally, the General Manager of Saxby Bridge Financial Planning, said that `it would appear that CNA used superannuation money to prop up investments made previously'. So the losses incurred now are not necessarily directly due to the losses by theft or fraud which occurred quite some years ago. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>3685</page.no><name role="metadata">Cook, Sen Peter</name><name role="display">Senator COOK</name><name.id>RF4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I intend to speak to the second part of the motion to take note of answers referred to by Senator Sherry. `Mean and tricky': they are the words that the President of the Liberal Party of Australia, Mr Shane Stone, used to describe Mr Howard—at least he did so in a letter published in the <inline font-style="italic">Bulletin</inline> magazine last year.

I think he is right: it appears to be mean and tricky and he appears to conduct a mean and tricky campaign. But the words `mean and tricky' are there, and here is a classic case of where those words are properly applied. Senator Vanstone wants to give an impression that families in some of the lowest income areas in Australia are somehow rorting their entitlement to social security. In answer to a question today, she says, `Well, of course, people know how much money they receive from the Commonwealth.' No-one is disputing that. The impression of her answer is to put the emphasis on low-income, working families in this country somehow misconducting themselves and that is totally unfair. The truth of it, as opposed to what is asserted by the minister, is that the minister expects ordinary working families to know, in every case, when and if ever they receive an overpayment, and, if they do, to immediately return it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Of course, the way the Commonwealth is supposed to advise these people is through a regular report on their income—an income reporting mechanism. Have they provided that information to the families she is now accusing, by inference, of ripping off the system? No, of course, they have not. They are behind time; they have not come out yet. And yet families—low-income earners—are being slugged to pay back, in lump sums, amounts that they did not know they had and did not know that they were supposed to repay. That is where the mean and tricky part comes in: blame the victims; shift the blame from the government; remove any possibility of the government having a compassionate and human face about struggling Australian workers and their families. The impression she gives is different from the actual circumstances.</para><para>So what is the situation here? In the budget brought down in the year 2000, the government changed the administration of the family tax benefit scheme to remove the 10 per cent tolerance families had in estimating their next year's income for the purpose of determining the level of family tax benefit they received. This had the effect of creating a debt with Centrelink for 650,000 families in Australia—one family in three— that received the family tax benefit because very few families can accurately estimate their next year's income in advance, with changing employment and work patterns in their families. That is what the government expects them to do: estimate in advance what jobs they will have next year for each member of their family and how much income they will get. It is on that basis that these recovery actions have been taken.</para><para>In the middle of last year, when thousands of families found themselves in a situation of owing large debts to Centrelink, the government moved in and asked for the money immediately. Minister Vanstone's own backbench is in uproar about this. The issue has been taken off her by the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet. On the weekend, Ms Helene Weston-Davey reported that she had received an overpayment, despite keeping Centrelink informed. When you add it all together, the job she had—and we are encouraging Australians to take work— meant that her family was out of pocket by the time she paid for childcare and returned the figure to the department of social security. In fact, the government has invented a poverty trap to catch Australian families who are low-income earners in this country and it shows no human compassion, assistance or help, to help those struggling families not only get a job but also manage their obligations to the Commonwealth. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>3686</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The first thing that I would like to say during this motion to take note of answers is that the allegations that Senator Sherry let fly earlier against the Hon.

I remind Senator Sherry and senators on the other side about the 13 years of Labor when we endured interest rates for small business at record highs—and now they are at 30-year record lows. As a small business person myself, I have been very thankful for those low interest rates.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Addressing the issue of the family tax benefit overpayments offset against the tax refund: yes, Senator Cook has made those allegations and Senator Vanstone has responded to them. But it is no surprise that the offsetting of family tax benefit claims against tax commenced on 1 July this year for tax returns for the 2001-02 year. The Commissioner of Taxation has advised that the mechanism whereby tax credits are used to offset family tax benefit debts is similar to the offsetting arrangements which have been in place between other government agencies and the ATO for some time. So it is not rocket science; this is not a huge surprise.</para><para>What we need in this country is a strong welfare system that will work and a good administration system that will work fairly and honestly to the benefit of the family. The people on the other side know full well that this is a very pro-family government. Our Prime Minister has always been pro-family, and this is exactly what we are doing: we are implementing pro-family policies on our side. We support the concept of mutual obligation, and we will do whatever is necessary to improve the system. If there are improvements to be made, be assured that we are in a position to make them and we will be very happy to do so. It is quite a simple philosophy that if you get paid too much then you have to pay it back. Australian taxpayers need to be protected. We need to stand up for them.</para><para>The ATO can also offset tax refunds against tax debts. Offsetting ensures that the debts are collected simply and easily for both the taxpayer and the government. That is what we are on about: protecting both the taxpayer and the government. The taxpayer does not have to make provision for the payment of a separate debt, because the amount owing to the other agency is withheld from the tax refund and sent to that agency. It is quite clear. In this case, the tax office is collecting overpayments of family tax benefit by the department of social security. The alternative to the use of offsetting against the tax refund is for the department to either take recovery action itself or allow the overpayment to stand. For the first year of the family tax benefit the offsetting provisions were not used while taxpayers developed a better understanding of the new family tax benefit system.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name></talker><para>—Bring back Senator Mason! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AUF</name.id><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name></talker><para>—Those on the other side are quite happy to interject and are not interested in the answer. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>3687</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to take note of the answer given by Senator Coonan and the answer given by Senator Vanstone during question time. What those opposite fail to get is that this is not an issue about the rights and wrongs of any individual family's circumstances. It is actually about a flawed process. It is about bad legislation and bad administration. In fact, it was pleasing to hear Senator Vanstone admit today that there is actually room for improvement. It is about time!</para></talk.start><para>This is all about a failure in public administration that the minister is attempting to cover up by referring to our fellow Australians as `welfare whingers'. It is not about welfare; it is not about the welfare system. It is not in any way a welfare issue. It is about support for families. There are lots of vulnerable parents and children out there—and, I am sorry, not all of them are on welfare. All of them—not just those who get direct support through the welfare system—need our support. This is actually about tax. It is about your family assistance tax measure. It is not about welfare, it is not about whingeing, it is not about trying to rip off the system; it is actually about tax. It is about a piece of tax legislation that aims to provide rebates to Australian families, a tax that just happens to be administered on behalf of the Taxation Office by Centrelink. There are obviously administration problems with that. But it seems that the government's only advice to its fellow citizens who are finding it very difficult to receive their proper rebate is: `Have patience and endure. Just wait, and we'll try to sort it out.'</para><para>One therefore has to wonder what policies, instructions and training were provided to Centrelink staff to assist in the implementation of this legislation, because the failure here is not on the part of Centrelink staff. With new legislation and without clear directions on possible ramifications, they were in the position of implementing the letter of the law. Let us remember that the legislation requires that the only change is to current payment from the time of the new estimate. It does not include an automatic recalculation to ensure that the person is given a choice to minimise their chances of an overpayment. In fact, as I understand the situation, Centrelink staff now actually advise their clients that they face a potential overpayment and that, by clients providing a further increased estimate, the payment is likely to balance itself out over the full year. In fact, I am informed that some Centrelink customers are now advising Centrelink on a fortnightly basis of fluctuations in their estimate to attempt to ensure that they do not end up with an overpayment.</para><para>Yet all the minister can do in response to that is call them `welfare whingers'. Honestly! Why does this have to be the case simply because the staff concerned with the frontline implementation of badly drafted legislation have realised that providing this advice minimises the number of Australians who end up becoming debtors to the Commonwealth? It minimises the number of Australians who have their tax refund stripped away to pay back the debt. It minimises the number of Australians who are disadvantaged because of a lack of information as to how the assistance package really works.</para><para>Commonsense suggests that Australian families are not trying to rip off the system. Commonsense also suggests that a computer system of the agency administering this assistance should be capable of handling basic recalculations of payments to wipe out potential debts. I am sure it could, if the government would only instruct that that should happen. Commonsense displayed by the Centrelink staff on the ground now assists families facing potential overpayments and actually encourages them to overestimate, so they go without income support in the first instance to minimise their chance of receiving an overpayment. Commonsense would also suggest that the government should have a better approach to re-estimating and recalculating during the course of the year, rather than engaging in an exercise where 650,000 families are faced with the consequences of being overpaid. The failing here is not the fault of our fellow Australians; it is a failure of legislation and its implementation by this government. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Agriculture: Sugar Industry</title><page.no>3688</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>3688</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy President Hogg, this is my first opportunity to congratulate you, as a fellow Queenslander, on occupying the chair.

Sugar industry assistance in the past, as the Prime Minister acknowledged last week, has failed to deliver the reform outcomes set by the government for package after package after package. It is essential at this particular juncture, before we allocate another $100 million of government money to any sort of package for the sugar industry, that the government ensures that any assistance is tied to performance benchmarks that include environmental management.</para><para>The government's reforms appear to suggest that bigger is better and that a third of farmers need to go. What I am worried about, and the Democrats are concerned about, is that bigger and more intensive all too often means that the environment is the loser. Between 1993 and 1996 there was an enormous expansion of acreage under which sugar was produced in Queensland. A lot of this involved land clearing of very sensitive rainforest and other areas. According to the Hildebrand report, 30 per cent of the land that was cleared and put into sugar production was not suitable for cultivation. In our view, the first priority in rationalising this industry must be taking out that land which should never have been put into cultivation in the first place.</para><para>It is also essential that we note that the run-off from Queensland cane farms ends up in the environmentally sensitive Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The government cannot afford to allow the sugar industry to continue to deny that it has any environmental responsibility for its run-off of nutrients, pesticides, soil and all the other aspects which continually create difficulties in our North Queensland waters. It is worth noting that in the submission to the Hildebrand report the CSIRO noted a whole range of off-farm effects from poorly designed and planned cane farming. These include a sediment export to waterways and reduced water quality; high potential for nutrient leaching; salinisation of ground water and reduced water quality; reduced buffering of watercourses against sediments, nutrients and pesticides; degradation of aquatic habitat; loss of biodiversity; potential harm to freshwater, coastal and marine ecosystems, as well as the loss of biodiversity; reduced quality of drinking water; damage to riverine ecosystems; increased fish morbidity and mortality; potential harm to freshwater ecosystems; and potential increase in fish morbidity from oxygen depletion in streams.</para><para>These are all real effects if we do not ensure that farm practices in our sugar industry improve. The Democrats very strongly support having an economically, environmentally and socially sustainable sugar industry in North Queensland. We want to ensure that we have a sugar industry that does survive. The difficulty we have had in Queensland and in Northern New South Wales for so long is that each of the sugar industry plans generated by this government and its predecessor failed to produce a sustainable industry. Sustainability is not just about ensuring that there are decent incomes for North Queensland families and other sugar farmers, although this is very important. Sustainability is also about ensuring that the land that they are farming continues to produce and minimise its impact on associated ecosystems well into the future.</para><para>The industry is now facing its worst crisis because of a collapse in world prices and overproduction worldwide. It is time to finally come up with a formula that will ensure that the industry is sustainable in economic, environmental and social terms. That formula needs to ensure that, in terms of benchmarking for assistance, world best practice environmental management techniques are not just a desirable aim but an absolute and non-negotiable necessity. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>3689</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Science: Stem Cell Research</title><page.no>3689</page.no><no.signed>815</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>00AUF</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Barnett</name></names></petitioninfo><para>Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The Petition of the undersigned shows that the Commonwealth of Australia and the various States are considering legislation which would allow the use of excess IVF embryos in stem cell research.</para><para>Your Petitioners request that the Senate should:</para><para>·	Regard the human embryo as a human life deserving of human dignity;</para><para>·	Acknowledge the important and proven contribution to medical science of adult stem cell research; and</para><para>·	Prohibit any research which results in the destruction of human embryos.</para><para>And your petitioners, as in duty bound, shall ever pray.</para><presenter><no.signed>815</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Barnett</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id></talker><para>Senator Barnett (from 815 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><petition><petitioninfo><title>Australia Post: Biggera Waters</title><page.no>3689</page.no><no.signed>2235</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>84N</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Ludwig</name></names></petitioninfo><para>Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned shows our concern that:</para><para>(1)	The closure of the Biggera Waters Australia Post in December 1999 was against the best interests of the residents of Biggera Waters</para><para>(2)	Your petitioners request that the Senate support the reopening of the Biggera Waters Australia Post and that the current reserved service and the uniform postage rate, the existing cross-subsidy funding arrangement for the uniform standard letter service and require a government assurance that no post office (corporate or licensed) will close due to these proposals.</para><para>(3)	Further, we call on the Senate to support the expansion of the existing community service obligation of Australia Post to encompass a minimum level of service with respect to financial and bill paying services, delivery frequency, a parcels service and access to counter services, whether through corporate or licensed post offices.</para><presenter><no.signed>2235</no.signed><talk.start><talker><name role="display">Senator Ludwig</name><name.id>84N</name.id></talker><para>Senator Ludwig (from 2,235 citizens)</para></talk.start></presenter></petition><para>Petitions received.</para></petition.group><debate><debateinfo><title>DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION, SCIENCE AND TRAINING: PRODUCTION OF DOCUMENTS</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>3689</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>3689</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>3689</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A Senate return to order of 20 August of this year orders the tabling, by no later than now, of various pieces of financial information relating to public universities.

These publications also contain data for all institutions and the sector for 2000 covering the requested financial information, selected research performance measures and enrolment information.</para><para>Changes in the operating result for all institutions for the period 1996-2000 can be found at figure 1.19 on page 52 of the <inline font-style="italic">Higher education report for the 2002-2004 triennium</inline>, which I have already tabled. Section 14 of the Higher Education Funding Act 1988 does not require the preparation of summary reports along the lines suggested at point six of Senator Carr's request, nor does the department prepare them as part of the profiles process, although it may produce such information in order to provide the minister with policy advice.</para><para>Much of the information requested for 2000 has either been published in the publication <inline font-style="italic">Finance 2000: selected higher education finance statistics</inline> or been previously provided to the Senate Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education in response to questions on notice. I am happy to table these answers today. I would also like to inform the Senate that the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee supports the minister's response to this request.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>3690</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the documents.</para></motion><para>We see today a response from a government who are desperate to hide the true nature of the financial crisis in the Australian higher education sector. We have heard today from a government who clearly do not want the public to know the nature of the financial state of Commonwealth funded universities. They are saying that this is not the business of Australian taxpayers. They are not prepared to indicate whether or not our universities are in a financially secure position. They are saying that that is none of the business of this Senate. </para><para>Dr Nelson is running around the country, conducting a review of the country's higher education system, but he will not give this Senate basic information about the financial circumstances facing Australian universities today or about what the department knows, in terms of its projections, is the likely situation for universities across the next three years. We have been provided with a number of published documents about events that occurred in the past, which of course anyone who knows anything about higher education is only too well aware of and more than capable of accessing. It shows contempt by this government to respond to this return to order in this way.</para><para>At the June Senate estimates, departmental officers confirmed that there was detailed financial information prepared by the department, of exactly the type that the Senate has asked the government to provide today. What is provided by each university is collected, collated and processed by the department on an annual basis. This information includes forward projections. There are forward projections for every university in this country. This information—these projections—is based on estimates that the universities themselves provide, but it is also processed by the department and produced in graphic form—in colour, no less. </para><para>Here is an example of the so-called highly confidential information. Here is an example of the information that this government says will bring down the universities of this country if this Senate is given copies of it. It is information about the availability of funds, expenditure by activity, student-staff ratios, funding for students and staff, fee-paying students, the ratio of salary costs to total expenditure of staff et cetera. I will ask leave to table this document that is so secret and confidential. This information relates to one particular college, Batchelor College in the Northern Territory. There are figures and tables such as this—I have others here— from every university in this country. We are told that this information is so secret that this Senate cannot be provided with it. Information that is widely known across university administrations in this country is prepared by this government every year—information that is vital to an assessment of what is actually happening in our universities; information that is critical to any proper public debate about the future of higher education in this country.</para><para>Associated with each of these reports are basic assumptions, outlined in detail, as to the effect of government policies on these universities. What we are being told here today is that information is provided by the department to the universities. At every estimates they have this information, and it comes back to the Senate in that form. The difference is, of course, that you have to know what questions to ask. You are not provided with the full, glossy report that is provided to each of the universities; that is information that they can have that the Senate cannot have.</para><para>Dr Shergold has written a letter to me, and it has been tabled here today. He wrote about the department's failure to answer these basic questions at Senate estimates. After the hearings, his officers confirmed that the information I was seeking was readily available in the department. We are not asking for new information to be created; this is information that is used day in, day out by the officers of the Commonwealth. I showed the letter that has been tabled here today to Mr Harry Evans, the Clerk of the Senate. He made a few comments in response, and I will seek to table those responses in full, too. Dr Shergold's claims were, as has been repeated today, that making the information available would severely damage the interests of individual institutions. That is a claim that is not demonstrated. No evidence is produced to support that claim. Dr Shergold also provides the view that it could `give incorrect and misleading pictures of the present and future financial health of institutions'. We are entitled to ask why it is that only the government officers are the ones who can rightly claim, in their view, that they have a correct view of education policy in this country. That is a nonsense. Quite clearly, this is the basis on which the department is relying for its judgments about the future of higher education in this country.</para><para>Dr Shergold's letter also goes on to say that releasing the information might `adversely affect Australia's reputation internationally'. The Clerk of the Senate advises me that this is effectively the LAPD excuse, named after a Los Angeles mayor who said that the public could not be told about offences committed by the Los Angeles police, because it would undermine confidence in the police force. Surely there is reason for all of us to be concerned about—to fear for, in fact—Australia's international reputation when the public that pays for these institutions is not entitled to have basic information about how the system is running—not about what happened in the past but about what is happening now, to get an assessment of what the government knows is happening into the future.</para><para>Dr Shergold's letter says that the financial projections constituted `policy advice to the minister'. Quite clearly, they are based on data which is advice made available through public means, through the department by departmental documents, and in no way cover normal provision of the concept of ministerial advice. It is like saying that every single item in the department is protected from disclosure to the Senate on the presumption that one day it might be required for advice to a minister. Clearly, that is a nonsense. </para><para>Dr Shergold also goes on to say that the HEFA does not require the financial projections to be provided to the Senate. Not explicitly—but section 14 of the act specifies that information be provided by universities to universities as part of the profiles process, in a form approved by the minister. The minister, through the department, obviously requires the information to be provided. Again, it is a nonsense to say that this government can excuse itself from public scrutiny and accountability because it does not suit it that information be made available which will clearly expose the deep, structural financial crisis within Australian universities.</para><para>The information is available, the government acknowledges that it is available, it is prepared on an annual basis, it is required to be provided by an act of this parliament, and the government is now seeking to deny this parliament access to that information. That is quite clearly a situation that is unacceptable. I repeat: these documents are readily available. They are easy to produce; there is no great cost involved. There will be no basis for a claim that the Senate is inhibiting the work of government. The documents indicate in their financial statements the income and expenditure, the movements of funds throughout the year, assets and liabilities, and the various effects of the government policies on the actual operation of the university. How can that information be commercial-in-confidence? How can it possibly be the case that universities—public institutions—should not provide this information when each and every one of them is required to provide it?</para><para>There is quite clearly a case here. There is no argument about this, as far as I can see, other than the fact that the government is seeking to hide behind a cloak of secrecy to avoid accountability. These are obviously matters that will not rest here, and I would suggest that these are questions that need to be pursued through the full processes of the Senate. It may well be that this is a matter that we will have to revisit. I have reports already on a number of these institutions. I know that the reports exist, and I think it is totally inappropriate for the government to seek to avoid its responsibilities to higher education, and to the public education debate, by hiding behind this pathetic, miserable excuse of claiming commercial-in-confidence when quite clearly these are issues that universities know fully about. It is not hiding anything from the universities; they actually know what is going on. I would think that it would be appropriate for the government to reconsider its view. I seek leave to table one of the graphs and charts that were considered so secret. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>3692</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave— Madam Acting Deputy President, Senator Carr has been here long enough to know that, if you seek leave to table something, the fundamental courtesy is to show it to the other side of the parliament.

We have seen the ongoing detention of thousands of men, women and children in Nauru and Manus Island as well as the continuing detention of people in Australia, including people who have actually been through the process and have been assessed as refugees. There are still hundreds of people like that on those Pacific islands at the moment.</para><para>There have been enormous costs—in excess of $1 billion more than would have been needed to have been spent if the government had not changed its policy specifically as a consequence of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> and the upcoming federal election—and those costs are still being incurred. This is not a policy that happened 12 months ago, won the government the election and then it moved on. This policy is still being prosecuted today, and the cost in human misery, social division and the degrading of the Australian social fabric— and the cost in taxpayers' dollars—is continuing to escalate. We have the new purpose-built detention centre that is being fast-tracked on Christmas Island and being given special exemption from all of our national environmental laws at the same time. This is at a cost of more than a quarter of a billion dollars, when we have empty detention centres sitting in Australia, solely so we can keep them off the mainland for some political purpose so that the Prime Minister can say they have not set foot in Australia.</para><para>We have the immense damage being caused to our reputation in our own region, the Pacific region, the stress on our relationship with PNG at a particularly crucial time with a new government coming in there and the total perversion of the most central part of Australia's aid program focused on the Pacific. The highest percentage of our aid program is in our own region, in the Pacific—as it should be—and we have completely distorted and perverted the whole message, the whole intent and the whole purpose of that program, not for any social good or for social development, empowerment or the hauling of people out of poverty but to actually put people into misery and for political purposes here in Australia. That is the consequence of the events of one year ago with the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. </para><para>That is not to say that before that the government's policy was sweetness and light. That was just the outcome of what the government had been doing, particularly for the last three years, with its continual distortion, propaganda and misinformation to the Australian public about the facts relating to refugees and asylum seekers. It was deliberately trying to turn the Australian people against the refugees and asylum seekers and portray them as people who were not deserving. That had been going on for years, and then with the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> it descended to depths beyond those I think anybody believed would occur. Nobody would ever have believed that an Australian government—even a Liberal government—would send in the troops and use the military to board rickety, overcrowded and barely seaworthy vessels. The evidence before the so-called `children overboard' inquiry was astonishing: the use of the military to board those vessels, one of which was so overcrowded that, in order for the military to be able to board it, they actually had to take some of the people off so they could fit on. The extent to which the government went was absurd but, unfortunately, it was reality.</para><para>This motion seeks not only to recognise that but to indicate that it is a matter of urgency. It is urgent because it is not just noting an anniversary but noting that this is still happening and that thousands of people are still suffering today. It is not just people and children in detention who are suffering but people in our own community. There are thousands of people who have been recognised as refugees and are out in the community who are being deliberately denied settlement assistance and support from agencies. For what I hope must be the first time in Australia's history, a government minister was actually saying to welfare organisations who received government funding, `You are not allowed to provide assistance to these people. Even if they are in need and meet the precise criteria you were set up to assist, you cannot help them. If you do, you will lose your funding.' It is just extraordinary.</para><para>This motion also seeks to call on the government to act. The Democrats would like to see massive change. But at an absolute minimum we must recognise that there are refugees who are still detained, who have been recognised for months as refugees, on Pacific islands. They should be allowed to be free. It is a blatant breach of the refugee convention to be detaining people who are refugees.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>CX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator Sandy Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Maybe they should go home!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>—They are refugees.

Senator Bartlett singularly failed to address the two most fundamental facts about the Pacific solution, the policy adopted by the Howard government. The first of the facts which Senator Bartlett chose to ignore about the Pacific solution is the fact that the policy has worked. The policy has been an outstanding success on its own terms.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—That means it has worked, does it?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—You voted for it in the last election.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name></talker><para>—Senator Kemp, you never know where the Labor Party is on this. At various stages late last year the Labor Party was actually supporting the policy, as you know, Senator Kemp, through you, Mr Acting Deputy President. So the first proposition which one could have been forgiven for failing to appreciate, having heard Senator Bartlett, is that the policy has been a success. Since 16 December last year there has not been one unauthorised boat arrival in Australia. That is the first proposition: the policy worked. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The second proposition, which again was ignored entirely by Senator Bartlett in his remarks, is that the policy attracted the overwhelming support of the Australian people at the general election on 10 November last year. I know that there are few species in Australian politics who have more contempt for public opinion than the Australian Democrats. Their conduct and behaviour in the last few weeks has certainly been a textbook example of disregard and contempt for public opinion. But, truly, Mr Acting Deputy President, you would think that at least some respect for the wishes of the Australian people would be shown in debating this policy. So there we are: the policy is a success and the policy is supported by the Australian people.</para><para>One of the paragraphs of Senator Bartlett's motion deals with the detention centres. I remind you, Mr Acting Deputy President, of the position in relation to the most well known of the detention centres, the Woomera detention centre. At the moment, for all the fuss, do you know how many people there are now in the Woomera detention centre? As of today, there are 181. Of those 181 people—these are all unauthorised boat arrivals—do you know how many there are awaiting a determination as to their application for refugee status? There are two. Two people are all who remain in the Woomera detention centre awaiting determination as to their refugee status.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—I haven't heard that on the ABC.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>008W7</name.id><name role="metadata">Brandis, Sen George</name><name role="display">Senator BRANDIS</name></talker><para>—You probably have not heard that on the ABC, Senator Kemp.

There are two others who are awaiting temporary protection visas, having had their applications for interim refugee status successfully determined. So there it is: there are two who are about to be released on temporary visas; more than half—93 of them— have exhausted their rights of appeal and are awaiting deportation; another 84 have failed in their application for refugee status but are appealing through the system; and there are only two who have not yet had a primary determination. For all the fuss about the Woomera detention centre, that is where it lies now.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to turn to what seems to me to be the central point in this entire debate and yet is deliberately missed by the critics of the government's policies. People like Senator Bartlett and Senator Brown, who I see over there about to participate in the debate, love invoking the language of social justice. They love saying, `Social justice or fairness or humanitarian concerns demand that we condemn this policy of the Howard government.' I say that social justice means that the places go to the neediest. There is not an unlimited number of places in the Australian refugee program. Having regard to the fact that Australia is per capita the second most generous country in the world when it comes to receiving refugees, you will know, Mr Acting Deputy President, that places are not unlimited and that every time an unlawful entrant comes across our borders he or she takes a place that would otherwise have gone to a more needy and deserving person.</para><para>On 16 April this year, the `children overboard' inquiry, of which Senator Bartlett is a member, heard some very moving evidence from officers of the then Department of Immigration and Multicultural Affairs, particularly from Mr Bill Farmer, the secretary of the department. Mr Farmer described to us in graphic detail the situation of the world's population of unsettled refugees, which he estimates as being between 14 million and 20 million people. These are stateless people; they have nowhere to go. They are people who are in limbo and, in some cases, have been housed for up to a decade in the most appalling destitution in refugee camps in the Third World. For instance, Mr Farmer told us about the situation of the people in the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya which houses a varying population of about 100,000 human souls. These people live in situations in which sanitation and housing are inadequate, they have no access to adequate medication, women and children are constantly at risk from predators and there is widespread malnutrition. These people are the neediest in the world. </para><para>Wouldn't you agree, Mr Acting Deputy President, that any Western nation's refugee program should be focused on the neediest people, not the people who buy passage from people smugglers, not people who—according to the evidence we heard at the `children overboard' inquiry—spend anywhere between $US2,000 and $US7,000 to buy passage, who arrive in Malaysia and Indonesia by commercial jets and pay their money to people smugglers and who then seek to enter this country by unlawful means? Our refugee program—and anybody who is serious about social justice has to concede this, surely— should be directed to the destitute people of the world and not to people who, in the words of Mr Farmer, the secretary to the department of immigration, have been described as middle-class refugees. A well merited fear of persecution does define a refugee, but surely there are other criteria when it comes to allocating the finite places, and of all of those criteria surely the most acute must be human need.</para><para>Earlier this afternoon, in answer to a question in the House of Representatives, the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, informed the House of Representatives of the effect upon the availability of places to truly needy refugees of the Pacific solution and the success of the border protection policies of this government. Originally, we expected that in the financial year just gone only 6,500 places would be available to genuine refugees but, because of the Pacific solution, in 2001-02, 8,416 placements were able to be offered by Australia—an extra 2,000 people, destitute people, who did not pay, who did not arrive by commercial jets, who did not break our laws, who now this country, one of the most generous countries in the world, has taken into its bosom. We are made to feel by Senator Bartlett as if we are committing an offence against humanitarian values. On the contrary, our refugee program reflects our humanitarian values by concentrating on the people who need their protection most.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3699</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The contribution we have just heard from Senator Brandis, who I would remind the chamber is a lawyer, is fairly typical of the shifty and shady sorts of contributions we have had from the government at least in part on this issue.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I raise a point of order: to refer to a senator as shifty and shady is most unfortunate; I do not think it is appropriate and should be withdrawn.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>—I think Senator Sherry was referring to the speech rather than to the senator as being shifty.

Indeed, at least half of the frontbench—with the exception of Senator Kemp, I would have to say—are lawyers. As I said, their modus operandi is to turn black into white. Only a lawyer could argue before the election that children were thrown overboard and then after the election, when the truth was discovered of course that that event did not happen, argue that it in fact did happen. That is the assertion from people like Senator Brandis.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think this is an appropriate debate in which to put down a few background facts as to the arrival of refugees in this country. When the Howard Liberal government took power in 1996, there was an appreciable increase in the number of asylum seekers that sought refugee status in Australia through boat arrivals. It increased. Many were granted refugee status, many were detained and many were sent home, in accordance with the system that was set up during the Labor Party's time in government. Between March 1996 and the 1998 election, 1,072 people arrived on our shores—under a Liberal Party government, under the current Prime Minister. Between the election in 1998 and January 2000—when our then Labor leader Kim Beazley, aware of this increasing problem, announced his coastguard policy— 4,064 people arrived on our shores by boat. So between our previous leader Kim Beazley's announcement on 3 January 2000 and 22 August 2001, the 213th boat—let me emphasise this—prior to the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, 6,348 people, had arrived. That is a total of 11,484 people arriving in unauthorised boats in Australia, whether via the mainland, Christmas Island or Ashmore Reef. </para><para>The current Prime Minister, Mr Howard, did not care a damn about people smugglers up until one critical moment. He let the situation drift along for six years after their election in 1996 with an ever-increasing and significantly increasing number of refugees arriving in an authorised way through the actions of people smugglers. He let this situation increase dramatically over the six years. The government allowed 11,484 arrivals and did absolutely nothing about this issue until—surprise, surprise—just before the end of their second term in government when they decided to do something. As I have said, our then Labor leader, Mr Beazley, had flagged a coastguard to deal with the situation almost two years before the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, decided to use this influx of boat people for political purposes. The Liberal government has picked up the sensible policy proposals of engaging with the neighbourhood—Indonesia, Malaysia and Timor—off the back of Labor Party policy.</para><para>What is amazing about these figures that I have just read to the Senate is that they make a mockery of the Liberal Party election slogan, which was `We decide who comes into the country and the circumstances in which they come'. Mr Howard had failed to signal, tell or do anything about the 11,484 asylum seekers and many profiteering people smugglers who had decided over two terms, almost six years, of his government to head for Australian shores—up until one famous incident: the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> incident.</para><para>This incident started on 26 August last year, when a routine surveillance flight by Coastwatch revealed the presence of a vessel approximately 80 nautical miles north-west of Christmas Island. The KM <inline font-style="italic">Palapa I</inline> was carrying 433 potential asylum seekers en route to Australia before it broke down. One can only speculate about whether, if the KM <inline font-style="italic">Palapa</inline> had successfully reached Ashmore Reef or Christmas Island, the Howard government would have done no more than to treat it like the earlier 213 boats and taken the asylum seekers on board to detention centres on the Australian mainland for processing but, with an election to be conducted within two months and the Liberal government trailing Labor in the polls, the KM <inline font-style="italic">Palapa</inline> was an electoral opportunity too good for the Howard government to miss. On 27 August 2001, Australian Search and Rescue broadcast a call to any merchant ships in the vicinity to render assistance to the stricken vessel. A Norwegian freighter, the MV <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, responded to the call, intercepting the vessel and bringing its passengers aboard. The master of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>, Captain Arne Rinnan, had intended to take the people rescued to a port in Indonesia, but the passengers demanded to be taken to Christmas Island. The captain then requested permission to berth at Christmas Island. This request was denied by the Liberal government, which directed the asylum seekers be taken to Indonesia. When the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> continued to proceed to Christmas Island and entered Australian waters, Australian Special Air Service troops boarded and took control of the ship.</para><para>It was in this atmosphere, and guided by the polls, that the then Liberal government conceived its political Pacific solution as an election strategy based on the broader issue of border security. In pursuit of this strategy, the Howard government attempted a number of unseemly and inappropriately desperate actions. These included the attempt to push through the Senate border protection legislation which would have legalised murder—I suppose as a non-lawyer, Senator Kemp, you would not understand how serious that is— and a round of hurried approaches to other nations to take the asylum seekers on the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. These approaches included the foreign affairs minister, Mr Downer, asking the UN administration in East Timor to allow the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> passengers to be transferred to a camp in East Timor. This request, made on the day of East Timor's first election, was refused—despite a separate approach from Mr Howard to the UN Secretary-General, Mr Kofi Annan. There were also unsuccessful approaches to the governments of Fiji, Tuvalu, Palau and Kiribati about the possibility of setting up new detention centres. On 1 September 2001 the Prime Minister announced a truly Pacific solution to the dilemma he had created by promising that no asylum seeker on board the MV <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> would be allowed to set foot on Australian territory. This Pacific solution was based on striking agreements with New Zealand and Nauru to allow the 433 Afghan and Iraqi asylum seekers to be transferred to holding camps on their soil while their claims to refugee status were being processed. </para><para>I wish this government would pay a bit more attention to the Russian money laundering—the hundreds of millions of dollars that have been moving through the territory of Nauru. We hear very little of that from this government—that is so desperate to rank up the issue of terrorism. I would say to the Senate that I would like to know where this Russian money that is being cycled through the various Nauru offshore financial vehicles is coming from.

I suspect very strongly that at least some of it is coming from some very odd sources in the former Soviet Union.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The Pacific solution was conceived in haste. It was very costly, it was unsustainable, and it had no ongoing benefit other than changing the way and the location in which the asylum seekers are processed. Let us look at the staggering costs of this so-called solution to date. The 2002-03 budget allocates the following over four years: $5.6 million for travel, $430.8 million for detention on Nauru and Manus—and we would like to know where this money is going, particularly in the case of Nauru, where money from the Russians is coming from very odd sources—$75.4 million for the regional cooperation agreement, $7 million for AusAid for Nauru, under a memorandum of understanding, and $2.1 million for the continuation of DFAT's temporary consulate on Nauru. So far, this totals $520 million. Importantly, these figures give no indication of how much it is costing to undertake the processing by the department of asylum seekers on Nauru and in PNG.</para><para>All processing of asylum seeker claims is being carried out by the department, except for those asylum seekers who came off the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> and the boat intercepted at sea known as the <inline font-style="italic">Aceng</inline>. The processing of these people is being handled by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. These figures, also, do not disclose how much the Pacific solution is costing in relation to ongoing aid, including the provision of security on Nauru and PNG by the Australian Protective Service and the Federal Police. Whilst the Federal Police are on Nauru I would like them to have a close look at the Russian moneys that are moving through Nauru financial institutions. That is a fairly important issue. To continue the list of costs of the Pacific solution: there are also additional costs to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to deal with the government-to-government issues arising out of the arrangements, costs for the department staff to visit these offshore locations, and the cost to the Defence Force of taking any intercepted asylum seekers to Nauru and PNG. </para><para>It is even more difficult to trace the money already spent on the Pacific solution as it was hastily cobbled together without any clear budget allocation midway through the last financial year. The government has confirmed that the setting up and operation of the detention centres in 2001-02 cost $72 million in Nauru and $42 million in PNG. Once again, these figures do not include any of the department's costs for processing, additional defence expenditures or transportation and costs incurred by the APS, the Federal Police and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In terms of aid moneys, it is known that the memorandum of understanding with Nauru pledged a total of $30 million in aid. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>3702</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens support this urgency motion. This is <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>Day, and as such it is a day of ignominy as far as politics in Australia and this nation are concerned. While I hear the case being put by the opposition just now, which sounded very much like it supported the motion, we have in the last 12 months, besides seeing a government which has acted with enormous inhumanity towards people in distress for political ends, seen a government which has been consistently paired with an opposition arguing valiantly the case against the policies which it supports. It is an extraordinary situation in Australian politics where you have a government supported, aided and abetted by an opposition in doing the wrong thing. I frequently get asked: `The majority of Australians support this, don't they?' Opinion polls show that, but there has been no leadership from the opposition, and there is still no leadership from the opposition, to restore not just humanity but dignity and probity to immigration policy.</para></talk.start><para>We Greens stand strongly for a more humane option as practised by many European countries, for example, in dealing with large numbers of immigrants. But let me again say this to the government and the opposition in this week of the Earth Summit: the failure of another policy—and that is environmental policy—is going to lead to many tens of millions more refugees as this century unfolds. A primary villain—for example, through the agency of global warming—will be the current government and its policies which will lead to a legacy of enormous environmental, economic and social disruption further down the century. The movement of people and the numbers of refugees which, as Senator Brandis pointed out, are somewhere in the order of 14 million to 16 million people in the world at the moment, is nothing compared to what is coming unless a more mature assessment of the future is made by a government which at the moment is in ostrich mode and has its head very much in the sand.</para><para>What an appalling failure to relate to other human beings as this government and this Prime Minister have exemplified in these policies. What a failure to relate to humanity at its basic level. At the forefront, it is dollars, economics and tugging the forelock to international trade, but when it comes to human values they are being put on the shelf. Just 12 months ago, Ben Oquist from my office told me about the cabinet decision, having asked the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> to pick up those 400 refugees, to turn away the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. We immediately held a press conference and appealed for a more humanitarian outlook, for the people to be received, taken ashore and properly processed, and for the cheats to be sent home and the genuine refugees to stay here. This remains our policy. It would have saved Australians at least $1 billion, but it would have, more than that, saved this nation its reputation, which is being dragged through the mud. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3702</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I must say that I am not surprised to see this urgency motion moved by Senator Andrew Bartlett today, because we are all well aware that the Australian Democrats would do anything to move some of the attention away from them and onto other issues. Certainly, Senator Andrew Bartlett would be the first one to do that. I am also not surprised, of course, to hear Senator Brown speak in the way he has, because the one thing you can say about Senator Brown is at least he is true to form. He never lets you down. He always sticks with the same line, which is supported by probably three or four per cent of Australians. Senator Brown, if you were to come in and say anything else, we would be disappointed. </para></talk.start><para>I have looked very closely at the urgency motion that has been put forward by Senator Bartlett. He is trying to highlight the fact that it is 12 months since the issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> became one of public notice and one that was reported in the newspapers. Senator Bartlett is using the 12-month anniversary since that happened to try to highlight some issues which are important to him, but the vast majority of Australian people actually overwhelmingly support what the government did 12 months ago today. It seems as though that fact is lost on Senator Brown and on Senator Bartlett and on at least some of the members of his party. They have lost the fact that this was done with the overwhelming support of the Australian people. If you go and look at all of the polling that was done in relation to this particular issue, and it continued in the following months, you will see that there was and still is overwhelming support for the Australian government's policy in relation to asylum seekers, to turning away the vessel and the way that we have handled those people who sought to come to Australia illegally.</para><para>I do notice that in paragraph (d) of the matter of urgency Senator Bartlett talks about the `stresses on our relationships with PNG, Nauru and our other Pacific neighbours and a major distortion to Australia's aid program'. Where he pulled those facts out of the air from I simply do not know because, in fact, the Australian government is very grateful for the cooperation of the Papua New Guinea and Nauru governments in the establishment of asylum seeker processing centres on Nauru and on Manus Island.</para><para>The new Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea, Sir Michael Somare, is on record as saying that the presence of the processing facility on Manus Island has not created any difficulties amongst the people on the island and in Papua New Guinea as a whole. So where are the stresses on these relationships that Senator Bartlett wants to include in his urgency motion? There is absolutely no basis for him suggesting it, no basis for it being part of his motion, because it is not backed up by facts.</para><para>The Pacific Islands in general share strongly our concerns about people-smuggling. Let us not forget what the issue really is about. The issue is about people-smuggling and how we as a country can best handle the very difficult situation of people fleeing their own countries, trying to circumvent the normal refugee and immigration processes in order to get to Australia. The Pacific Islands have been immensely cooperative on these issues. Transnational crime issues, including people-smuggling, have been a regular item on the agendas at meetings of the Pacific Islands Forum. So for Senator Bartlett to say that it is putting `stresses on our relationships', I think, is a major distortion of the facts, and he should recognise this.</para><para>The level of concern over this issue in the region is also reflected in the number of Pacific countries which attended the Bali conference in late February. Nauru, Palau, Samoa, the Solomon Islands, Kiribati, Fiji and Vanuatu all attended the Bali conference because of the concern that was raised about people-smuggling and transnational crime issues. Australia very much welcomes the excellent cooperation and support that we have received from the governments of Nauru and Papua New Guinea in developing offshore processing arrangements for asylum seekers; both Papua New Guinea and Nauru have received significant benefits from assisting Australia. The establishment of processing centres in those countries has resulted in substantial infrastructure development and an increased flow of technical assistance to those developing countries which can only help them as they seek to further their lot in their area.</para><para>Senator Bartlett talks about a major distortion to Australia's aid program. It is not based on fact at all but it is another emotive little issue that he just wanted to throw into his matter of urgency. The focus of Australia's aid program has not been altered by offshore processing of asylum seekers. Our aid continues to be a partnership with the countries in the region to help them achieve better standards of living for their own people, and that should be the major criterion. When he talks about the need for the government to do a range of things for people who are detained on Manus Island and Nauru who are determined to be refugees, we need to remember that those people on Manus Island and Nauru are not held in detention under the Australian Migration Act—it is an important thing that we need to remember—but they are being subject to the laws of the countries in which they are being processed. It has nothing to do with the Australian Migration Act. The asylum seekers and refugees accommodated on Manus Island and Nauru were admitted to those countries on restricted visa conditions. They are required to remain in those centres pending processing or to return to their country of origin for resettlement. </para><para>Australia has already indicated that it will take its share of refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. The government has already indicated that. Of the 581 persons who so far have been found to be refugees, 136 are already in Australia and hold temporary humanitarian visas. Eighteen of them arrived between late April and early July, 42 arrived on 30 July and a further 76 arrived during August. So the Australian government is taking its fair share of refugees from Nauru and Papua New Guinea. Senator Bartlett says in his motion that all of those who are determined to be refugees should be released into the Australian community. He is simply suggesting to us that we should be taking more than our fair share of the burden of refugees that there are throughout the world. It has been well noted and well documented that, in fact, per head of population we do take our fair share of refugees. On a personal note, I wish that more places would be made available for refugees who are not trying to enter this country illegally but who are living in squalid conditions in Africa and in Pakistan and in many other places around the world. I do not see why those who can afford to pay vast sums of money to people-smugglers, to criminals, in order to get to Australian shores should have an advantage over those who are without money and living in squalid conditions in Africa and in other parts of the world. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>3704</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support this urgency motion moved by Senator Bartlett in relation to the MV <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline>. The events of a year ago were some of the sorriest in Australian history, and I think that as time goes by historians will document them in that way. Senator Ferguson started off by saying that it was appropriate for Senator Bartlett to raise this motion today because it was a means of taking attention away from the problems of the Democrats, but what this issue did a year ago was exactly that. This was an issue that was fomented by the government in order to take the people's attention away from them and the way that they were conducting affairs in this country.</para></talk.start><para>One year ago a number of boats arrived in Australia, and we turned them away. Not since the 1930s when we turned away a large number of Maltese who came here by boat, not since the early 1940s when we turned away a number of Jewish people fleeing from the first days of Hitler had we turned away boats in this country. Let us get this in historical context: not since those days did we turn boats away. We wound back the clock. In this instance, the people were fleeing from Saddam Hussein and from the Taliban, and we turned them back. We did not have any room for them here; we would not let them engage our system. We did that and, in doing so, we put people's lives in jeopardy and lives were lost. We truncated Australia's reputation. One year later, the problem is still there; the problem still exists. Of the 294 Afghanis who were sent to Nauru, 233 are still there.</para><para>I will get back to the big leak in Operation Relex and the big leak in the Pacific solution in just a few minutes, because some time soon this is all going to come a cropper. Unfortunately policy debaters in this country have not focused on that as yet. In the meantime, the taxpayer pays: $1 billion. As a former immigration minister, I know the importance of keeping the system under control; I know the importance of protecting borders. But I also know that there are ways of doing things. A $1 billion payment to accommodate what was a relatively minor problem at the time is not the way to go. The public do not just pay by direct outlays, they also pay indirectly, through government policies. This is the ironic aspect of this. That socioeconomic group that John Howard went out to whistle Dixie to this time last year, whose votes he wanted, are the ones who are now paying. They are the ones who are not getting the services they expected. They are the ones who are paying extra by way of taxes than they were promised otherwise. They are the ones who are not getting the social benefits. They are the ones whom Senator Vanstone is ripping payments back from. It is ironic that they are the ones who are paying. </para><para>This country is also paying in the way that our reputation has been truncated. If people do not believe that, there was more evidence of it in the newspaper this morning. In one of the comment pieces, Alison Broinowski documented very well the way Australia's reputation has gone low only two years after the Sydney Olympics had our reputation riding high around the world as a successful multicultural society: tolerant, accommodating of diversity, and celebrating our multiculturalism. <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> undid all this. But let us not be misguided. This country has always had a policy of determining who is allowed into this country. We have always had the state-of-the-art technology to ensure that we could vet those with security risks. A year ago we were told by the Prime Minister that that may not be the case. We were being warned that people who had bombed the World Trade Centre may have had links to boat people coming into Australia. One year later we discovered that was a fiction as well, as was the fiction that John Howard tried to perpetrate that he was the only person who had been concerned about it.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order: I thought that it may have been a slip of the tongue by Senator Bolkus earlier, but he should call the Prime Minister by his proper name.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, John (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Watson)</inline>—Address the Prime Minister by his correct title, please.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—The Prime Minister—your Prime Minister—not one that I am proud of, not one that most of the public is proud of, but your Prime Minister, Senator Ferguson; the one who writes your speaker's notes, the one who prods you when you do not stand up for him, the one who gets really angry, the one who is so paranoid that he has closed off the area in front of his office. That has never happened before. People who come through the normal entrance in the ministerial wing now cannot go by the Prime Minister's office. Why? Because he has a touch of the vanities, that is why.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We used to have the security checks and the criminal checks, but we were told a year ago that we had to be warned that there might be criminals coming in on these boats. Two weeks ago before another parliamentary committee the Federal Police Commissioner made it clear that that was not the case. We have also had an independent refugee assessment system, which had been working quite well, and can continue to work well if this government takes its hands off it. We also had an advance warning system. As the minister for immigration I was quite well aware of that and invested enormously in making sure that it worked. We also worked cooperatively within the region with the UNHCR to ensure that there was burden sharing when it came to issues like this.</para><para>What happened here was a failure of policy. This government knew a year beforehand that these boats were coming. Minister Ruddock made it clear that he expected some 40,000 people to arrive. Did he do what Senator Ray did when he was minister; what Mr Hand did when he was minister; what I did when I was minister: go off at that first call, that advance notice, and set up a regional arrangement to ensure that Australia did not cop all the burden? No, he did not. He sat on his hands for a year, and now the taxpayer is still paying for it.</para><para>I mentioned earlier that the Pacific solution is not working. One reason it is not working is that offshore in Nauru, for instance, of the 295 people from Afghanistan who went there to be processed, 233 have failed the test and are still there. They have failed the test. If the Taliban government were in control in Afghanistan most of them would probably have passed the test. But what happens to these 233 people now? Senator Ferguson says, `It's none of our business. We've got nothing to do with it.' But, Senator Ferguson, look at the agreement between Nauru and Australia. It is littered with comments like, `Australia will arrange for the day-to-day management of the asylum seekers' facilities. Australia will arrange for day-to-day administration of facilities. Australia will ensure no people are left on the island. Australia will return both sites to the original,' and so on. What we have here is an agency arrangement. Can I tell you why that is important? As I say, policy makers have not caught up with this point yet, but I am sure they will very soon. Just two weeks ago in the Federal Court of Australia a Palestinian person was released because it was found by the court that the government could not return that person to Palestine—they were not allowed in. What we have here with these 233 people is a situation where the governments of Iraq or Afghanistan will not take them back, particularly the Iraqis. </para><para>Let us concentrate on the Iraqis. They cannot be sent back. Under the law that operates in Australia governing Australian officials, wherever they operate, it will not be all that long down the track that these 233 people will have to be released. Under the arrangement with Nauru, they will not be released to stay in Nauru. In the absence of any place to send them to—and I know the minister has been running around the world trying to find Middle Eastern countries particularly to take these people back, but not just them—those people will be released in Australia. One billion bucks later, and that is what is on the horizon. At the same time as that the government says, `This is not affecting Australia's reputation.'</para><para>This week or next in Sweden there is to be a conference organised by the International Office of Migration, the office so critically involved in the operations in Nauru and PNG. What is that conference all about? It is all about giving the captains of ships like the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> more authority to override the sort of resistance that they got from governments like the Australian government one year ago. The way the Australian government acted in respect of that ship presented enormous problems for those who captain ships across the world. That conference is designed to see if that problem can be overcome.</para><para>We get Senator Ferguson in here talking about this issue and claiming that all is kosher in the system. We do not get the Prime Minister talking about it; we do not get the Prime Minister prepared to front the cameras and talk about it. He wants to talk about other things that happened a year ago, but he does not want to talk about his government's role in this issue. Is he ashamed of it? Is that why he will not talk about it now?

Firstly, of course, he wants to enhance his credentials to lead the Democrats, however bizarre that may appear to most of us in the Senate. Secondly, he wants to undermine our immigration policy in the broad and its essential core values—for what purpose one can only speculate. The first of the core values he seeks to undermine is that Australia has a non-discriminatory immigration policy under which anyone can seek to migrate here for economic, family or humanitarian reasons, regardless of ethnic origin, gender, colour or religion.</para></talk.start><para>Secondly, immigration is about nation building and must always be in Australia's national interests. A third core value is that our immigration policies must enable Australians with non-Australian partners or dependent children to be reunited in Australia as permanent residents and, in time, as Australian citizens. Fourthly—and importantly for this motion—Australia must contribute its fair share to the resettlement of those people who are most in need of humanitarian assistance. In resettling refugees the Australian government devotes very considerable resources to ensuring that these people have the support they need to become fully integrated members of our community as time goes by—and of course we have a very successful multicultural society. Last, and by no means least, we must have the capacity to manage the movement of people across our borders in an orderly and efficient manner. Without this crucial element the idea of a managed immigration policy rapidly becomes meaningless, like so much else that the Democrats espouse these days.</para><para>I have been handed a transcript of a doorstop interview with Senator Bolkus in Adelaide in 1994 when Senator Bolkus was, I understand, the Minister for Immigration and Ethnic Affairs. It concerns an announcement that the then government had made regarding border protection. I will read this transcript into <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, because it makes very interesting reading in the context of Senator Bolkus's comments just a few moments ago. He said:</para><quote><para>The message of today's announcement is a clear one. The objective of today's announcement is to basically stop boat arrivals coming into Australia, and we expect that the announcement of the measures in the package today will have a substantial effect on the number of boats coming here.</para><para>The fact is that we want to send a very clear message to anyone who is intending to come to Australia illegally by boat with no valid claim that the doors are closed.</para><para>They are not wanted here unless they have got a valid claim.</para><para>Essentially you are not wanted here if you haven't got a valid claim. Don't even bother trying.</para></quote><para>That was Senator Bolkus as immigration minister in 1994. It is interesting that he should be singing to such a different tune today.</para><para>The government have put in place a number of measures which have been effective in strengthening the integrity of Australia's migration and humanitarian program. This range of measures has allowed Australia to continue to provide protection to those people who are at risk, while at the same time disrupting the operations of people smugglers. Some senators seem to have forgotten that the government's action in relation to the asylum seekers on the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> was firmly based on our desire to ensure that the asylum-seeker system protected those most in need and was not abused by those seeking migration outcomes. You will recall, Madam Acting Deputy President, that when the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> incident occurred exactly a year ago it was supported by the ALP because it was becoming increasingly clear that people were paying criminal gangs to access Australia and gain a migration outcome to which they were not entitled ahead of those with a much greater need. </para><para>Australia has been a mecca for people coming to our shores to start a new life and, as Senator Ferguson pointed out, as a nation we can be very proud of the fact that we have an unarguably unrivalled reputation and record of assisting people in great humanitarian need. Australia is an active participant in global refugee settlement and that contribution goes back to the 1930s. Since World War II, Australia has taken over 600,000 refugees and humanitarian settlers—about 10 per cent of our total migrant numbers. The majority have been resettled through Australia's offshore humanitarian resettlement program. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3708</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank senators for their contribution. It is an important issue; it is one that affects many thousands of people in our community and in our region. Senator Brandis, at the start of the debate, stated that this policy of the government's has worked, that it has been a success. I guess it all depends on how you define `success'. Yes, he is right in that there have not been any boats with asylum seekers arriving in Australia this year. There are, of course, many thousands of refugees. In Indonesia, there are people— some of whom I visited just recently—who have been assessed as refugees, as well as other asylum seekers who are stuck there, in particular the Iraqis. They cannot go forward; they cannot go back. They are simply in limbo.</para></talk.start><para>This policy might have worked for the government. I am sure it has been a success: John Howard is back in the Prime Minister's seat; the Liberals are back in government. If that is their definition of success, then it has worked. But from the Democrat point of view, a policy can hardly be described as successful if it has cost an unnecessary extra billion dollars that could have been used for environmental repair, for assisting industries that the coalition like to go on so much about, for helping rural communities and for helping our schools, our health system and our education system. That is $1 billion which could have been used for social good that has been used for social destruction— hardly a successful policy. It is hardly a success for those many hundreds of children who have been detained indefinitely throughout that period of time and who continue to be detained. It is hardly a success for those people who are refugees—who have been assessed and acknowledged as refugees by either the UNHCR or our own departmental officials—to still be on Pacific islands in detention while the government tries desperately to find any country in the world but Australia to take them. It insists on keeping the refugees there because it knows that, as soon as it starts taking numbers of refugees, the pressure on other countries will subside. </para><para>It is an urgent matter. One year on from the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa </inline>incident, you would think that things could not possibly get worse. But one thing the Prime Minister continually astonishes people with is that, every time you think he has gone as low as he could possibly go, he finds a way to go even lower. He has done it on this, and he is continuing to do it. The policy is ongoing; the human, financial and social impacts are ongoing. It is an important matter that needs urgent action. It needs to be turned around as soon as possible, because the ongoing cost to the Australian community in dollars and in social damage will be immeasurable. The longer it goes on, the more damage will occur and the longer it will take to repair. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the motion (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Bartlett's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

The Senate rejected the bill, seeking greater consultation with the people of Norfolk Island on the matter. It was referred to the External Territories Committee in March 2000.</para><para>Current electoral arrangements on Norfolk Island raise serious concerns. The franchise for Assembly elections is based on residence on Norfolk Island rather than Australian citizenship. There are also requirements for eligibility to vote that are 30 times the period that applies in other parts of Australia—a residential period of 990 days or two and half years residence in the previous four years; whereas the usual period in Australian states and territories is one month, or six months in Tasmania. The result is that some Australian citizens are prevented from voting in Norfolk Island elections and non-Australian citizens are entitled to vote and to stand for election. The Committee concluded that this was unacceptable.</para><para>Under the proposed provisions in the rejected 1999 bill, only Australian citizens would have been eligible to enrol and stand for election to the Norfolk Island Legislative Assembly. An `ordinary resident' qualifying period of six months for enrolment was proposed, and the enrolment rights of those currently on the electoral roll would have been preserved. Since Australian law does not require a person to renounce any other citizenship, dual citizenship, combined with the `grandfather clause', would have provided security of voting rights and existing citizenship for all those currently entitled to vote.</para><para>The Norfolk Island Assembly, which gave evidence to the Committee argued the special nature of Norfolk Island's traditions and culture, as well as the concern felt by some Islanders that these may be threatened by allowing relative newcomers a voice in island affairs.</para><para>The Committee was not persuaded that there was either a proven risk or a need for special protection, particularly when such protection, entrenched in electoral law, served to deny a basic human right to a group of citizens. Moreover, the Committee argued that, because the role of the Norfolk Island Assembly extended well beyond simple, local issues, it was vital to Australia's national interest that Ministers and other Legislative Assembly members were Australian citizens. The Committee also noted that Australian citizenship is now a requirement, or is being considered as a requirement, for enrolment and election at local government level on the mainland.</para><para>The Norfolk Island Government also objected to what it saw as the Commonwealth legislating on matters which were the province of the Norfolk Island Assembly. </para><para>The Committee recognised the right of the Norfolk Island Assembly to legislate in this area and it believed that it was preferable that it do so. However, the Committee was aware that a succession of Norfolk Island governments had rejected electoral changes proposed by the Commonwealth. Consequently, it was clear that the likelihood that a Norfolk Island government would act unilaterally to implement changes, which the Committee considered to be fundamental to a strong democracy, was remote.</para><para>The Commonwealth made it clear during the inquiry that self government for Norfolk Island continued to be desirable; however, it did not believe, and the Committee concurred, that the changes to the Act affecting the electoral system in any way diminished the Island's self government. The Committee also believed that the Commonwealth had a responsibility to ensure that the Norfolk Island Government met its existing fiscal and social obligations to the community. Moreover, the Committee recognised that the Commonwealth has, and will continue to have, the legitimate right to intervene if it believes that an issue of national and international importance is at stake.</para><para>The Committee hoped that there would be increased cooperation between the Commonwealth and Norfolk Island governments and would be disappointed if Norfolk Islanders should ever be required or feel obliged to choose between increased independence and the benefits of citizenship. </para><para>The Committee concluded that a requirement for Australian citizenship in order to vote or stand for election to the Legislative Assembly was appropriate. It was satisfied that adequate safeguards could be provided for non-citizens who were already enrolled and noted both the relative ease with which a New Zealand citizen might acquire Australian citizenship and the opportunity that existed in both nations for holding dual citizenship. </para><para>Two referenda were held on this matter on Norfolk Island, both strongly supported the Norfolk Island Government's position of no change. However, the Committee was not satisfied that the conduct of the referenda was accompanied by clear, comprehensive information. There was also concern about perceived levels of intimidation on the island of people who disagreed with majority views. Therefore, it was the view of the Committee that popular referenda were not appropriate mechanisms for determining such questions. The right to vote is a fundamental right, not a matter of popular opinion. This is particularly important where those without the vote are excluded from the referendum to give them the right to vote. Popular opinion often opposes the rights of minorities, the very groups which human rights seek to protect.</para><para>The Committee made three recommendations to the Government. First, that the Norfolk Island Act be amended to make, with appropriate safeguards for those on the electoral role, Australian Citizenship a prerequisite for both suffrage and the right to stand for election. Second, that referenda and elections on Norfolk Island come under the supervision of the Australian Electoral Commission. And third, that the eligibility period for voting be reduced to six months.</para><para>I commend the report to the Senate.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>3711</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>3711</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>3711</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the 47th report, <inline font-style="italic">Treaties tabled on 18 and 25 June 2002</inline>, together with the minutes of proceedings.

In its deliberations the Committee accepted evidence that compulsory third party arbitration can result in decisions that are unsatisfactory to all parties. </para><para>The Committee received submissions from the public expressing concern that the declarations were made in order to limit East Timor's options in upcoming maritime delimitation negotiations. However, it noted that East Timor's stated preference is to settle boundaries through negotiation, and that the declarations do not target East Timor. Australia has outstanding maritime boundaries to negotiate with New Zealand, France and Norway.</para><para>·	The International Convention for the Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism.</para><para>The Convention advances the ability to police the international financing of terrorist acts and makes clearer the obligations of cash dealers to ensure that suspicious transactions are reported to the Government.</para><para>·	An Amendment to the Convention on Prohibitions or Restrictions on the use of certain Conventional Weapons which may be deemed to be Excessively Injurious or to have Indiscriminate Effects.</para><para>The amendment to the Convention obligates Australia to refrain from the use of devices that create non-detectable fragments, incendiary devices and blinding laser weapons in non-international as well as international military engagements.

I envisage that most treaties will continue to be dealt with within the current requirement that the Committee report within 15 sitting days of the tabling of the treaty in the Parliament. The Government has however acknowledged that some of the more complex and significant, perhaps controversial, treaties will require a greater period of time for the Committee's deliberations and for public debate. Accordingly, consideration of these treaties will be afforded an extension from 15 to 20 sitting days. This will build upon the Government's commitment to the democratisation of the treaty-making process of which the Treaties Committee is an integral part.</para><para>I commend Report 47 to the Senate.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>3712</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000Collins</name.id><name role="metadata">, Jacinta (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Collins)</inline>—The President has received letters from party leaders and an independent senator seeking variations to the membership of committees.</para></talk.start><para>Senator ABETZ (Tasmania—Special Minister of State) (5.22 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That senators be discharged from and appointed to committees as follows:</para></motion><para><inline font-weight="bold">Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts Legislation Committee—</inline></para><para>Participating member: Senator Nettle</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Environment, Communications, Information Technology and the Arts References Committee—</inline></para><para>Participating member: Senator Nettle</para><para>Substitute member: Senator Buckland to replace Senator Lundy for the committee's inquiry into environmental performance at the Ranger, Jabiluka, Beverley and Honeymoon uranium operations</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Selection of Bills—Standing Committee—</inline></para><para>Appointed: Senator Eggleston.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3712</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>A message from His Excellency the Governor-General was reported informing the Senate that he had assented to the following law:</para><para>New Business Tax System (Consolidation) Act (No. 1) 2002</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>VETERANS' AFFAIRS LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3712</page.no><id.no>R1582</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>3712</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator ABETZ (Tasmania—Special Minister of State) (5.23 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3712</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3712</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time. </para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>This bill makes a number of amendments to the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 to address minor anomalies, make consequential amendments and clarify policy.

Firstly, to remove an anomaly so that civilian compensation payments that are offset against disability pension are not also counted as income for the purposes of the income test; and secondly, to correctly reflect arrangements for the direct recovery of debts from compensation payers and insurers in respect of the partner of a person who received lump sum compensation.</para><para>The bill will also clarify policy in relation to telephone allowance to make it clear that eligible persons with a mobile telephone service, and no traditional fixed line telephone service, may receive telephone allowance. </para><para>The bill will also amend provisions of the VEA relating to rent assistance. These amendments will align the eligibility provisions for rent assistance for veteran pensioners who receive a base rate Family Tax Benefit with those of the Social Security Act 1991. The amendments will ensure that rent assistance is available under the VEA to eligible persons receiving Family Tax Benefit with no rent component. Other amendments will address the issue of retirement village entry contribution payments and access to rent assistance and will align the VEA with the Social Security Act 1991.</para><para>Furthermore, the bill will extend the eligibility criteria for the Pension Loans Scheme which provides income support to eligible persons in the form of a loan. The changes will extend the eligibility criteria to include certain persons who are not a veteran or the partner of a veteran and will enable eligible income support supplement recipients to be eligible for the Scheme from `qualifying age' rather than `pension age'. `Qualifying age' is five years earlier than `pension age' and is the age at which war widows and war widowers may be eligible for income support supplement and a number of other related benefits under the VEA. </para><para>Similarly, amendments to the eligibility criteria for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card will enable war widows and war widowers to be eligible for the Commonwealth Seniors Health Card from `qualifying age' rather than `pension age'.</para><para>The bill also contains other minor technical amendments to clarify provisions in the VEA.</para><para>This bill continues the Government's ongoing commitment to improving the repatriation system to benefit and provide equitable assistance to our veteran community, to whom we owe so much.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Ludwig</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BILLS RETURNED FROM THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3713</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Message received from the House of Representatives returning the following bill without amendment:</para><quote><para><inline ref="R1522">Health Insurance Commission Amendment Bill 2002</inline></para></quote></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMONWEALTH ELECTORAL AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 1) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>3713</page.no><id.no>R1502</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>3713</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Debate resumed.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>3713</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—With great regret, I will leave the soap opera story of Caltabiano and Quinn. Hopefully, I will allow an opportunity for my colleagues to take that up later. The saga does continue, such is the absurdity of the organisation of the Liberal Party in this country. I move the second reading amendment circulated in my name:</para></talk.start><para>Omit all words after “That”, substitute:</para><para>“the following matters be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters for inquiry and report by Thursday, 24 October 2002:</para><para>(a)	any amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002 circulated in the Senate chamber; and</para><para>(b)	the Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002”.</para><para>I move this amendment because there is a whole series of very important issues raised in the amendments proposed by Senator Brown and Senator Murray in relation to the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, and moving this amendment will allow the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters to consider them in some depth. Whilst there is nothing in this appalling bill that Labor find worthy of support, there are some issues raised in the proposed amendments by the Democrats and the Greens that we believe are worthy of further inquiry, investigation and exploration.  </para><para>I turn first to the Democrat amendment. They are proposing a very complex amendment to the act, to provide for a general right of access for political parties to national funding. They argue that, through different mechanisms, the funding of both the Labor Party and the Democrats is paid directly to the national or principal agent to the party, and the legislation proposes to make it accessible to the Liberal Party in its particular circumstances. The amendments go to the detail about how this bill applies in those circumstances. One thing that struck me was that it is a very lengthy amendment and it will significantly change the intent of the bill. That is why we see conducting this inquiry as essential if it is to be given due consideration.</para><para>One of the other issues that the Democrat amendment raises is a very big question of public policy, about the way in which parties choose to structure themselves. I spoke earlier about some of the absurdities that are occurring in the Liberal Party at the moment and held up in contrast an appropriate way for political parties to go about organising themselves and modernising themselves. I think Labor presents itself as a very diligent and exemplary organisation in seeking to manage its internal processes equitably, fairly, openly and with some dignity. In stark contrast, the Liberal Party are dragging themselves through the mud. This causes some hilarity in some quarters, but clearly the government is abusing its status as the elected government of this country in bringing this bill before the parliament. Nonetheless, the Democrat amendment is thoughtful. It is worthy of lengthy consideration, and I think it is incredibly important that the Australian Electoral Commission be asked their views and that their input be sought on this amendment—its impact, its merit, its implications and so forth. The most appropriate way to do that is to take it to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. That will allow us the mechanism to seek that advice from the Australian Electoral Commission.</para><para>I turn now to the Green amendment. Senator Bob Brown proposes an amendment to the bill so that, where a corporation makes a political donation of over $1,000 and the corporation is wound up or made insolvent within three years of making that donation, an amount equal to the amount of that donation is payable by the political party to the liquidator and may be recovered by the liquidator as a debt due to the liquidator by action. I should note that this amendment is not proposed to be retrospective.</para><para>This is an issue facing democratically elected governments and political parties in democracies around the world, particularly in an era where corporate governance is at the forefront of political agendas. According to many reports, many US politicians have been given money from the likes of Enron. There have been other collapses of funds set up for former employees, creditors or charity. So the US is grappling with this issue as well. The Greens amendment raises very important issues of public policy that are both relevant and credible in the context of the current debate. The proposed amendment will significantly change the intent and purpose of the bill before us. As I said earlier, Labor cannot find any merit in the bill before us, but it can see some merit in exploring the amendments proposed by various members of the cross-bench in an inquiry of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters.</para><para>It is worth noting that, here in Australia, the situation described in the Greens amendment has occurred: it is well and truly on the record that HIH has reportedly given many hundreds of thousands of dollars to the Liberal Party. In 1999, when insolvency was already on the cards and that company was apparently facing losses, over $100,000 was donated to the Liberal Party and some money was also donated to the National Party. That is clearly an example. However, this is not something that is peculiar to the Liberal Party. Labor received some donations from companies: for example, froggy.com donated some money to the New South Wales Labor branch. The company is apparently facing losses of some $65 million and I know that the ALP's WA branch has agreed to repay a $10,000 donation. So it is not something that is peculiar to one political party or another. It is not even something that is peculiar to political parties here in Australia. It is being grappled with throughout the world. </para><para>This is a very important issue of public policy and it is a very important long-term issue. I would argue that its importance extends significantly beyond the vested interests and the self-interest demonstrated in the bill that the coalition has put forward. This is a very complex issue and worthy of a high degree of investigation. That would most appropriately be done under the auspices of an inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Most significantly, it would allow the Australian Electoral Commission, which has not been involved with these amendments, to provide some detail about the implications of these amendments for our democratic structures and the laws that they administer. The Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is very much the appropriate body to get advice on this subject. It has always considered these matters. Amendments to the Commonwealth Electoral Act have always been referred to this committee because of the experience and depth of knowledge of the participants in this committee. The advice, insights and points of view of the witnesses that come forth would be most gratefully welcomed by the senators participating on the committee.</para><para>One thing that is being shown in this debate is that, when this chamber applies its collective cross-bench and opposition minds to a problem, there are opportunities for good to be done through amendments to bills. I think that it is a display of the shallowness of the coalition that they did not take the opportunity to move constructive amendments to the Electoral Act on important public policy matters such as the implications of corporate collapses or important definitions or the structure and method of organisation of political parties between federal, national and state bodies in the way that the Democrat amendment does. Labor is being very responsible in creating an opportunity for these amendments to be investigated in some depth. I commend to the chamber the amendment that I have moved. I urge fellow senators to support it and also to give maximum consideration to the merit and implications of the significant and complex amendments proposed by both the Greens and the Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>3715</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support the motion moved by Senator Lundy on behalf of the opposition to the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. I think that these are extremely important matters. I certainly appreciated Senator Lundy's contribution and her description of the amendment that I have foreshadowed on behalf of the Australian Greens. If the amendment were to be adopted by the parliament, it would effectively mean that if a corporation that goes broke has made a donation to a political party within the last three years that donation will go to the liquidator and would therefore go towards helping the shareholders, who of course are hurt very badly when they lose their money in this way. I have no objection to that amendment being scrutinised by a committee and I welcome any input it might have into that amendment.</para></talk.start><para>I have not had time to have a very good look at the amendment being proposed in the Committee of the Whole by Senator Murray, but it does appear that that amendment is going to effectively expand the government's intention in this legislation which not only would give the Liberal Party the right to ordain centrally that the states give public funding to the central body but would make that an option for all parties. That is effectively an amendment coming from the Democrats that is going to facilitate the government getting its way on this legislation, which it has been unable to do for some time. I think the Labor Party has argued cogently that the parliament ought not be intervening in the workings of a political party in this way and certainly, if the Liberals and the government parties are unable to get their branches to pay into a central fund through a general agreement, so be it. It ought not be for the parliament to be overriding the wishes of the branches in that case and saying, `You shall do so,' but a mechanism for that has been found here.</para><para>The history of this mechanism is that it was first found for the Democrats some years ago when Senator Kernot was leading the Democrats and there were difficulties with the Western Australian branch. At that time special legislation was put through that gave the Democrats the ability to effectively collect all the money for public funding from around the country and have it put into a central deposit. Now the government parties want that, and the move is here to allow all parties to do that if the central party wishes. </para><para>The Greens will continue to oppose this legislation. We think it has a very strong political imperative in it, with the idea that political parties should be centralised in their function. So be it if that is what the Liberal Party and the Democrats want, but to use this mechanism to get their way to override the branches is quite untoward and quite remarkable for the Liberal Party, which is so much a states rights party. So much for states rights when it comes to the Liberal and National's own interests, which are very quickly overriding that states rights sentiment through this legislation and saying, `Bang! We will have the money brought into the national organisation, whatever the regions may think.' The Greens are not going to be part of that.</para><para>However, it is notable that if all of the Democrats support this legislation it will go through. Senator Lundy, if all of the Democrats oppose your motion, it will go through without being scrutinised by a committee. What could be less democratic than that? I hope that is not going to happen, but I fear it is. I think this matter should have some debate about it. To get amendments like this is, as Senator Lundy has said, extremely important. But to get them put through at the government's behest, with the support of the Democrats, is strange politics to me. I do not think it is right.</para><para>I say to Senator Murray, who has proposed this quite complex amendment with far-reaching impacts, that I would have thought he of all people would want time for the public and party members to scrutinise this—for people to have a good look at it, for there to be input and then for the Senate to consider it. So I do hope you will be supporting Senator Lundy's amendment. Senator Lundy is proposing a two-month stay while the matter is considered in a committee. I think that is fair enough. We have been dealing with this matter for some years now, and here is a new complex amendment with a very big impact and we ought to have time to look at it properly. I support the opposition amendment and appeal to Senator Murray and the Democrats to do likewise.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>3716</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the second reading amendment moved by Senator Lundy on behalf of the opposition to the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>. I do so for a number of reasons. If you look at the amendment moved by Senator Lundy, you will see it does two things. Firstly, it redresses a `policy-free zone' that this bill originally created, which may partly explain why it was not subject to a committee in the first place to ensure that the bill was examined in full and dealt with appropriately and that parties had an opportunity to make submissions in respect of the bill. Secondly, it gives the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters the ability to call in the Australian Electoral Commission to deal with some of the matters that are raised in the two complex amendments that have been circulated in the chamber.</para></talk.start><para>It is comforting to hear from Senator Brown that he supports our motion. I was going to go to his motion at first, but to be kind to it generally—given that he now supports our motion for the matter to be referred for further inquiry and report by the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters— there are difficulties raised as to whether or not it achieves its purpose. Proposed section 306A refers to repayment of donations where corporations are wound up. There are a number of points to go through. The amendment deals with an amount of $1,000. There is an issue as to whether that is the appropriate amount it should be put at. The amendment refers to three years as the period, when making donations, one can go back to. The third matter contained within that proposed section is the ability of the liquidator to be able to recover debts due by action in a court of competent jurisdiction. In themselves, those matters deserve far more scrutiny to ensure that, if that is the import of the amendment, they can—although making no comment in respect of it—achieve their purpose. You have to ensure that the amendment to add a section 306A is the only amendment that is required to ensure that the Commonwealth Electoral Act permits section 306A and that there is no other law that might otherwise disallow or obstruct the purpose of that amendment. </para><para>The bankruptcy laws as administered by the Insolvency and Trustee Service Australia, ITSA, also have to be correctly understood and utilised to ensure that the purpose of the amendment can be achieved. The amendment can easily be examined and considered by the joint committee, which can then have the experts from the Australian Electoral Commission or ITSA, dealing with bankruptcy, examine the amendment to ensure that it achieves its purpose but without making any particular comment in respect of the amendment itself.</para><para>I enjoin Senator Murray to support our second reading amendment that the matter be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. Senator Murray's quite complex amendments go to some 11 in all. One of the curiosities of the amendments relates to proposed section 287B, which provides for a designated federal party. It goes on, as I understand it, to explain that that party might be other than the Liberal Party. So there are some complex legal issues that arise when you are dealing with national entities, state entities and a third entity, which is usually divisions or parts of a national body. I am not so sure whether they are all encompassed within amendment (2) as proposed by Senator Murray.</para><para>The Senate would benefit from the AEC and perhaps the Attorney-General's Department or the Government Solicitor's office being able to give us a view about whether the amendment as proposed by Senator Murray would achieve its purpose, without going to whether we agree or disagree with the proposed amendment. If there is going to be a debate in the committee stage on these amendments, it would be helpful to ensure the Committee of the Whole does have the benefit of the views of the Australian Electoral Commission, ITSA, the Australian Government Solicitor's office and the Attorney-General's Department and their competent solicitors as to what those amendments actually do, whether they achieve their purpose, provide a clear path and do what they are supposed to do.</para><para>When you look at legislation and when amendments are made one should always guard against unintended consequences. Unintended consequences are usually brought out or highlighted by, as in this case, a joint committee or other committees. That is why legislation is often referred to committees—to not only examine the bill but also ensure that unintended consequences do not arise. Clearly, there can be problems if unintended consequences are discovered. It would be helpful if the joint parliamentary committee could examine Senator Murray's complex amendments to ensure that that is not the case here. I undertook not to take too long in this debate, so I will not go on. There are matters that trouble me in relation to the Queensland Liberal Party, which I will not go into in detail—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—You mean repeat.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84N</name.id><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name></talker><para>—I have to report to Senator Abetz that there are new issues in relation to Queensland. I only discovered this on the news service today. The relevant article was headed `Liberal leader makes second bid to win reform war', but I do understand that Senator Lundy took the Senate through that. It is interesting to examine some of the quite unusual things that they are pushing forward, but one of the more serious aspects that highlight a problem we always face in dealing with this area is that there is a party convention coming up from 6 to 8 September and that, although there is a significant amount of movement, those sorts of matters should not be confused and brought up within this debate. I am sure the government will tell us that they are separate and distinct from that and that it has nothing to do with this `dash for cash' bill.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I think the best course of action—and I am sure the government would agree—is to send the matter to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters, have an inquiry and report on those amendments by Thursday, 24 October 2002. That would take the matter well beyond that September conference, and I am sure we will know by then whether Mr Quinn has won or lost his reform agenda. We might even know by then whether Mr Santoro, as it is sometimes reported, will be in the Senate and perhaps he will be able to explain his role in those issues. We certainly look forward to that debate. To ensure that I do not take too much of the Senate's time in relation to this, I think it is necessary to refer this bill to the joint committee, given the state of the bill, the type of bill and the type of amendments. That is one of the guiding principles Labor has always had when amendments such as these are proposed which are fundamentally different from the thrust of the bill itself. Let us face it: the thrust of the bill is a dash for cash or `Show me the money from your federal director,' as I have now decided to call it, because I think it is more apt.  </para><para>That is the import of the bill, but these amendments actually take away that idea and move the bill to something else. I am not too sure what that something else is, and that is why I think it is very important that the joint parliamentary committee examines the bill to ensure that we do understand it and, more importantly—and I think Senator Murray would agree with this—that people have an opportunity to understand what is being proposed here and have an opportunity to comment and understand the import of the amendments and what they intend to do. It is important that the state branches and especially the Queensland branch of the Liberal Party, as it has been reported, but also other branches and political parties that might be caught by these amendments understand the amendments and what they intend to do and have an opportunity to examine whether they will work, work effectively or not work at all or will require adjustment, amendment or removal in some respects. I would be disappointed if Senator Murray was not like-minded in ensuring that there was proper scrutiny of the legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>3718</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the proposed amendment by Senator Lundy to the second reading of the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> and indicate to the chamber that One Nation will be opposing the amendment. The reason we oppose the amendment is that we believe it is each political party's right within the process of their party to administer their affairs.

I do not believe that sending the issue off to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters is the correct way to proceed with this issue.</para></talk.start><para>Having placed that on the record, I just take the opportunity to speak very briefly to Senator Murray's amendments, which in actuality are even more far-reaching and have greater implications for all political parties— for the reason I have raised that each individual political party should and must have the right to actually manage their affairs as they see fit. The Labor Party themselves have a set process that has been determined by their party as to how they distribute and administer their electoral funding, and that is their right. I believe that the same opportunity should apply to the Liberal Party.</para><para>I agree with the basis of Senator Brown's amendment.

I thank honourable senators. I say that with tongue in cheek, but it is usual to thank honourable senators for their contributions to these debates. We are in fact debating the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline> and not all of the extraneous matters that senators opposite appear to have had great delight in raising. It was somewhat shameless of them to raise a whole host of issues, trying to exaggerate and fabricate matters that allegedly were occurring in the Liberal Party here and there, whilst turning a blind eye to the fact that they had their own party officials such as Karen Ehrmann end up in jail, the Sword-Feeney dispute within the Labor Party—indeed, as I understand it, now the Senator Ray-Senator Conroy fall-out et cetera. </para></talk.start><para>We could trawl through all of that, but let us look at what this debate is all about. It is not that sort of bill. In fact, very simply, the bill is to allow for the public funding payable to the Liberal Party as a consequence of votes obtained at federal elections to be paid to the federal manifestation of the Liberal Party or as requested by that federal manifestation. When federal officers run federal campaigns it is appropriate for the federal office to get that funding. My colleague the Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Finance and Administration, in introducing this legislation in the other house, made that point and indicated that in fact since 1999 that is how the Liberal Party had been conducting its federal elections.</para><para>Put in another way, federal taxpayers' money paid pursuant to federal legislation will be provided to the federal manifestation of the political party—in this case, the Liberal Party. Nothing could be simpler, nothing could be fairer, and why the Australian Labor Party needed 15 speakers in all during the second reading debate is beyond me when we have got such a very restricted bill before us. We did have a very tedious display of mock outrage by a gaggle of Labor speakers. Their filibustering through quite useless contributions has cost the taxpayers literally tens of thousands of dollars through wasted sitting time.</para><para>The Leader of the Opposition in the Senate started the debate and made his usual and expected shrill contribution. Full of his trademark hysteria, he generated some heat but, as always, no light. The honourable senator could not have believed his objections and his own conspiracy theories. Indeed, the other Labor senators—especially the newer ones who participated in this debate—will be devastated to find out that they threw themselves into this debate, lemming-like, for no high principle at all. Let us remember that in 1995, when in government, Labor amended the Commonwealth Electoral Act in a similar manner at the request of the Australian Democrats. The then Senator Kernot thanked Senator Faulkner's Labor government for their `assistance' in getting the amendment ready. That must have been during the time that Senator Faulkner was starting to warm up the coffee plunger. It was not in active use at that stage, but undoubtedly that was part of the warming-up process of that now infamous coffee plunger. Senator Kernot said during the debate:</para><quote><para>... I am grateful for the assistance that has been given by the minister's office ...</para></quote><para>At that time Senator Faulkner and Senator Cook, both of whom made contributions in this debate, were senior ministers in the Keating government, fully aware of their government's policy in this matter. This was a specific provision for the Australian Democrats. We, as a principled opposition at the time, listened to the arguments put forward and voted with Labor and the Democrats. I understand it was carried on the voices. That was because we took a principled stance as an opposition. Now Labor are getting so used to opposition that they are opposing things for opposition's sake. They are doing backflips from when they were in government. They say, `A specific provision for the Democrats is okay, but not for the Liberal Party'—then they try and claim it as a matter of high principle. It is like their arguments on privatisation. When in government, they privatise everything they can lay their hands on—then all of a sudden, when in opposition, they say, `There are matters of great principle here. Of course we can't support privatisation.' They are showing all the characteristics of a party ready for a very long stint in opposition.</para><para>It is interesting that opposition senators have suggested that the amendments ought to be referred to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. In 1994 the ALP submitted to the Joint Committee on Electoral Matters that public funding for elections should be provided directly to federal or national offices of registered political parties. The ALP argued that such a reform: </para><quote><para>... establishes the principle that funding provided by the national parliament for national elections should go direct to the national offices of parties.</para></quote><para>That was their view when they were in government; that is what they argued. Now they are in opposition, and all of a sudden the principles they espoused in government are thrown out the window for cheap political opportunism—embarrassing a lot of the newer senators who honestly believed that what Senator Faulkner was putting forward was a longstanding principle of the ALP. I think that Senator Faulkner did not brief his party room as to the Labor Party's history in this matter, when they quite properly assisted the Australian Democrats when requested. I invite the new Labor senators to have a look at section 288A of the Commonwealth Electoral Act, and go up to Senator Faulkner and say, `How on earth did this get through the parliament? Did you vote for that, Senator Faulkner? Did you vote for that, Senator Cook?' Of course, the answer will be, `Yes'. Then all they have to do is ask, `What is the difference on this occasion?' The answer will have to be, `We are in opposition.' That will be the policy free zone approach of the Australian Labor Party on this matter.</para><para>If the parliament regulates the operation of the registered organisation, it is appropriate for the government to listen to requests, as Labor did for the Democrats. As a principled opposition, we supported the move then and I invite Labor senators and other senators in this place to do it on this occasion. I understand that the Democrats have indicated their support for the government amendment, and I thank them for it. I note that they have proposed further amendments. The government see the merit in those amendments and we will be supporting them. It is interesting to see how different parties behave in this chamber. From the Labor Party there is simply negativity. It is unwilling to really engage, whereas the Australian Democrats do have a constructive approach to this matter and have proposed further amendments. In a spirit of cooperation, we see merit in those amendments and we will be supporting them. It is a pity that Labor cannot drag itself into relevancy and make a positive contribution.</para><para>I note that, at the very last moment, the Labor Party have moved a second reading amendment as a delaying tactic to try and refer this off to the committee system. Let it be remembered that this bill has already been to a committee, as long ago as September 2001. This is such an important matter of public principle that the committee was overwhelmed, in fact inundated, with submissions. How many? Four in all: one from the Australian Labor Party and one from a member of this parliament. There were two submissions from the public. That is all the excitement it generated amongst our 19 million fellow Australians. Now the Labor Party are of the view that this matter should go to yet another committee because there is a matter of such great moment in these amendments. I pose the question: where were the Labor senators in 1995 when section 288A was put through? Was that rushed off to another special Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters inquiry? Of course it wasn't. You know that what you as the Labor Party are going through is an absolute charade.</para><para>We also have an amendment from the Greens. It has been rushed, it is politically opportunistic, it is flawed and it is bad policy. We were told during the contribution that the Greens believed that donations from the corporate sector to political parties should go into an opaque trust and then be disbursed according to the vote at the election. It is a pity that the Greens did not do that with the $90,000 they got from the Commonwealth Bank and with the other donations they received. They did not hand that out. What they are saying is: `Don't do as we do; just do as we say.' It is quite duplicitous of them to make that suggestion. If, as they are suggesting, you have to repay the money if the corporation goes into liquidation within three years, then no political party could in fairness use that money for a period of three years, just in case the company did go into liquidation. You would have to quarantine it in your books, just in case. You cannot do business, I would have thought, on that basis. It would be interesting to know whether the Australian Greens conduct themselves in that way and quarantine their own donations. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, I rise on a point of order.

Indeed, if parties have to repay moneys when a company goes into liquidation within three years of the donation being made, you would have to ask the question: should the $1,947 spent by HIH on liquorice all-sorts also be required to be repaid by the manufacturers of liquorice all-sorts? Or, indeed, should the tobacconist be required to repay the $1,600 on cigars? In the list of HIH purchases, one that would have been a very handy item in relation to the Labor Party's contribution to this debate was $75,000 worth of eau de toilette spray. Given the contribution by the Australian Labor Party, a good dose of some of that would have been of assistance.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If honourable senators bothered to read the Corporations Act and acquaint themselves with it, they would know that the act contains provisions that permit liquidators to apply to a court to reverse transactions made by a company leading up to its failure within certain time limits. That is available to liquidators. If the court finds that the transaction is reversible because of the company's insolvency, the payment will be returned to the liquidators for distribution to creditors. The provisions prevent companies disposing of assets or transferring funds from the company leading up to its failure at the expense of unsecured creditors. In other words, the Corporations Act sets out the circumstances under which a company liquidator may apply to a court to set aside certain transactions. These rules, as they should, apply to all recipients.</para><para>The Greens, in a cheap political stunt, are saying: `If it is a political party, it is all going to be different.' Does Senator Brown want Monash University, for example, to repay all the funds that HIH made available to it? No, that is not a part of these amendments. Indeed, if Senator Brown were genuinely concerned about this, the amendment he is proposing should be an amendment to the Corporations Act, not to the Commonwealth Electoral Act, because, quite frankly, I doubt that anybody trying to deal with their responsibilities in corporate law would turn to section 306, or whatever it is, of the Commonwealth Electoral Act to find out their duties and responsibilities. They would be, I suggest, in the framework of the Corporations Act.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name></talker><para>—Senator Harradine, you have made a very valid point in relation to that, and that is why I asked whether Senator Brown was anxious for the creditor to pursue the donation to Monash University by way of a special piece of legislation— which takes us down the path of why a political party should suffer more than the supplier of liquorice all-sorts, cigars, the Monash University or whoever. There has to be one rule that applies to all, and that is in the Corporations Law. I assume that Senator Brown simply is not aware of that provision in the Corporations Law.</para></talk.start></continue><para>As I said before, we have had a number of shrill contributions to this debate from the other side. Honourable senators have taken the opportunity to seek to discredit the Liberal Party by trawling through all sorts of things. Allow me to quote from the Labor Party submission of 1994 to the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters because it is a very good summary of what this bill is simply about. The ALP argued in their submission when they were in government that such a reform:</para><quote><para>... establishes the principle that funding provided by the national parliament for national elections should go direct to the national offices of parties.</para></quote><para>And that is exactly what we are doing in 2002. Sure, since 1994 the Labor Party have gone into opposition. Since 1995, when they cooperated with the Australian Democrats to get specific proposals into the legislation for the Democrats, what has changed? Nothing—other than that they have been put into opposition. So for cheap political purposes, now in opposition, they are using the opportunity to oppose that which they argued for whilst they were in government. It is in fact this cheap opportunism by Labor in relation to a whole host of issues, including privatisation, that has led the Australian people to the conclusion that the ALP are not fit to govern because they have gone back on their principles whilst in opposition. </para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate. It is a simple bill. It was looked at by the relevant parliamentary committee as way back as September 2001—12 months ago. Now we have a rush of cheap amendments from Labor and the Greens to try to stall the process yet again. This has been in the public arena now for well over 12 months. The Australian people were aware of it and they got that excited by it that, out of our 19 million fellow Australians, two of our fellow Australians put in submissions to the inquiry— other than the Australian Labor Party and a member of the parliament.

To summarise, the effect of these amendments is to allow the same provisions that are available to the Liberal Party to apply to all other parties who would like to access that same system. The attitude of the Democrats to this bill can be summarised in two short sentences. Firstly, these principles being established for the Liberal Party should only be accepted if they are available for all parties—and I think that is a reasonable proposition. Secondly, the consequence of such amendments should not be to force this arrangement on anyone; it should be a matter of choice. These amendments seek to achieve that outcome.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>3725</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Would Senator Murray be good enough to explain to the committee again why part (4) of Democrat amendment (2) is there and what it means?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>3725</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The amendments have the effect of extending the provisions currently in the bill relating to the Liberal Party to other parties which have a federal secretariat and state or territory branches.

That is wrong. The point is that a registered officer of a party at national level could move to avail themselves of this mechanism without the states being consulted. As a good and true Tasmanian, Senator Abetz may have to account for this one day: the state branches are cut out in this mechanism. The point I am trying to make is that there may be a lot of people working in smaller political parties that are not represented in here but are nevertheless a very important part of the democratic fabric who do not know that there is effectively a transfer of power to the national organisation, which was not there before but is inherent in this amendment. They will have no say about it. If somebody at central office who is called the registered officer wants to avail themselves of the new power here, the state branches have no say.</para></talk.start></continue><para>That is why I supported Labor's second reading amendment.

There should have been an opportunity for lots of people who work their hearts out for their little political parties—there are dozens of them right across the spectrum—to have been consulted about this so that they could make a submission. If this goes through as it is, it will come as a bolt out of the blue for many of those people out there. That is why I thought the Labor amendment was a good one.

There is nothing like getting a broad brush of representation when these sorts of issues are being discussed.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Murray—through you, Mr Chairman—these are complex amendments. Senator Murray may have been able to satisfy himself that there are no unintended consequences from these amendments but I would have thought that it was appropriate that the parliament's Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters—the committee of this parliament that is charged with the responsibility of examining electoral law in this country—has an opportunity to look at these sorts of proposals. I respectfully suggest to Senator Murray that there has been no opportunity for that committee to examine this matter. No-one in the Liberal Party for a decade has seen fit to bring this question about the distribution of public funding before the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. In other words, no-one has, either in evidence before the committee from the Liberal Party or in submission to the committee from the Liberal Party—none of those individuals or organisations and none of the state divisions or the federal secretariat or anyone who represents them—raised this issue before the committee. </para><para>In those circumstances, when such complex amendments are proposed by Senator Murray, it seems to me absolutely appropriate that the committee of this parliament that is charged with investigating these matters has a look at it. We are left in this committee stage—I think you would agree with me, Senator Murray—having to accept your good word, and you are a man of your word, that these amendments have been drafted by the AEC. I think that is the case, is it not, Senator Murray? Perhaps you can inform the committee as to whether that is the case. Perhaps they have the support of the Australian Electoral Commission.</para><para>The approach that the Australian Democrats have taken here is absolutely unsatisfactory. To give the Australian Democrats some credit for this, the issues of concern to their political party have always been raised by a form of submission to the JSCEM. Witnesses before the JSCEM, including Senator Murray himself as a witness appearing on behalf of the national executive of the Australian Democrats, have argued the position that that political party holds in relation to these sorts of matters. I think, Senator Murray, you would have to acknowledge to this committee that at no stage did the Australian Democrats put forward any such proposal. I am not sure that this committee is in a strong position tonight to be able to make a judgment without some more thorough investigation as to the good sense and utility of these particular proposals.</para><para>I simply do not understand the motivation for moving these amendments. You cannot, Senator Murray—through you, Mr Chairman—turn a bad bill into a good piece of legislation. You have to go to the motivation of the government in relation to this. I am disappointed that you are desperately in there trying to dig the government out of a hole of its own making. Senator Murray, of course, has said from time to time that he is pretty relaxed about this legislation. I do not think he really understands why the Labor Party are so concerned about this particular piece of legislation. You do not, do you, Senator Murray? You do not understand why we think that the introduction of and debate on this legislation in this place is such an abuse of parliamentary process. We have tried to mount that case—I think we mounted that case very effectively during the second reading debate. It is all so unnecessary to have to pass some legislation in the Commonwealth parliament to sort out the internal problems of any political party.</para><para>In that respect, this legislation is unprecedented. I am very disappointed that the Australian Democrats have seen fit to support such legislation and now, in a desperate last-ditch effort, are attempting to see if the legislation can be improved by extending it to other political parties. I am afraid, Senator Murray, the intention, the motivation, of this legislation is clear and it ought to be obvious to you, as it is obvious to other senators in this place. I hope, as this committee stage debate continues, that you give some thought as to the integrity of the Australian Democrats in relation to issues of electoral matters and electoral policy in this country. You have been sucked in by the government on this issue, Senator Murray, and this is a very transparent effort on your behalf to try and fix problems of the government's making. You do not have to do it. It is not the job of the Democrats to dig the government out of a hole. I think the responsibility of the Democrats is—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—To dig themselves out of a hole! </para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—That may not be possible. It is the responsibility of the Democrats to make some judgments about the legislation before the chamber. This is perhaps the most cynical piece of legislation that we have seen debated in this parliament in a decade. This is all about a political party unable to get its act together, unable to get its own state divisions to agree on the disbursement of public funding, unable to get its own senior executives to sign on the dotted line. In that situation, what does the government do? It resorts to the parliament to try and solve these problems. It is very disappointing that Senator Murray then takes on the responsibility, as I say, of trying to dig the government out of a hole. I hope it is not the establishment of a pattern on his part. I encourage the Australian Democrats to think very carefully about what they are proposing. It is very unfortunate that there is some sort of closed-door arrangement with the Liberal Party of Australia on this matter. There are all those other important matters of electoral policy—the key issues in relation to funding and disclosure, where the Liberal government and the Liberal Party have such a poor record. I really do hope that we are not going to see a similar attitude and approach from the Australian Democrats when it comes to dealing with those issues of substance, which I hope we will be doing a little later in this committee stage debate.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>3729</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will respond to some of the remarks of Senator Faulkner, picking out the odd one as I go along. One of the things he said was that he hoped we would not support the idea of a political party being named in the act. We could never agree with that proposition, because we ourselves are named in the act—although Senator Faulkner said that there were 37 mentions of the Liberal Party, which is quite an extensive list. The best way for me to answer the remarks of Senator Faulkner is to again say the things that I said in my speech in the second reading debate. Here is an excerpt:</para></talk.start><quote><para>As the electoral matters spokesperson for the Democrats, I have tried to employ a fairly central principle—that is, whether this bill does allow the same process or the same opportunity to every participant in the electoral process who is entitled to receive public funding. </para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—You've been arguing for one member, one vote.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—I believe in one vote, one value, and I will bring that amendment later on.

We will only pass it with amendment. I went on to say:</para><quote><para>The other principle I have to look at is whether the allegations by the Labor Party concerning Liberal Party disaffection with this bill are true or not. I have no way of knowing that; I have no way of knowing how much irritation there is in state Liberal divisions. I can only work from my own experience and, as the electoral matters spokesperson, I have not had any—not one— member of a Liberal state executive, the Liberal president or a Liberal office holder ring me, email me or write to me, either officially or unofficially. The only time I have had any concerns expressed to me about this bill was by two members of this parliament who raised the matter informally with me. So I do not have any evidence that there is any internal Liberal Party concern about the mechanism which would allow a more centralised funding payment.</para><para>However, if that is the case, I then have to discard that area of concern and return to the first principle, which is whether this bill will allow the same provisions for all political parties or all those who receive funding. With regard to the Australian Democrats themselves, the law presently provides that funding is paid to a principal agent. Labor, in the speech from Senator Faulkner, outlined their agreed method between their state and federal bodies to allow them to be paid nationally. This legislation proposes to allow the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party to be funded directly, and we have been advised that that is unanimously agreed to by the federal Liberal secretariat, which includes all divisional presidents.</para><para>We either would end up rejecting this or we could try amending it ... Through different mechanisms, the funding of both the Labor Party and the Democrats is paid directly to the national or principal agent to the party, and the legislation proposes to make it accessible to the Liberal Party in its particular circumstances. There are a lot of political parties other than the ones just mentioned. Our amendment will provide a similar option for all political parties. We think it is reasonable for the Liberal Party to have the option to be funded at a national level, if that is their consensus, but the option should be available to all political parties via the Australian Electoral Commission without in future having to come to parliament seeking specific legislation. </para><para>Therefore, our amendments will amend the bill so that it applies more generally to political parties registered under the provisions of the Commonwealth Electoral Act. </para></quote><para>I cannot express our approach more clearly. It seems to have aggravated the Labor Party enormously, but for us the principle of being able to be paid nationally, if that is what a political party wants, is unassailable. I personally do not care if it is One Nation, the Greens, the Labor Party, the Liberals or the Democrats.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator Conroy</name></talker><para>—Can it have its own constitution as well?

No reasonable person could accept the position that the Australian Democrats have been advised that it has been unanimously agreed by the federal Liberal secretariat, including all the divisional presidents, that this legislation should be supported, that the legislation proposes to allow the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party to be funded directly and that is unanimously agreed.

The stamp has already been tabled in the Senate by Senator Ray. There will be no cost to the Liberal Party at all.

The first issue was the definition of a state branch. That is in section 287(1) of the act. In relation to a federal secretary supplying notice to the Australian Electoral Commission, I understand that the practice of the Australian Electoral Commission is in fact to seek proof, by way of the resolution that was carried in relation to the authority that the federal secretary alleges that he or she has. Suggestions have been made that the government's bill has been born out of internal Liberal Party division. Paragraphs 2.44 and 2.45 of the committee report dispel that completely and utterly.</para></talk.start><para>The next issue is why we need this legislation at all. In subsections 299(5A) to (5C) is the provision the ALP used to direct funding from the states to their federal secretariat. It is an all-or-nothing provision— that is, all the money gets paid to the federal secretariat. There is no ability for a percentage—and this is important—to be paid to the federal secretariat and a percentage to the state officers. Therefore, as a federal body that does happen to believe that the states have a role, you can have a situation where a percentage can be paid to the federal body and a percentage to the state bodies. In my respectful submission to the chamber, there is no difficulty with that.</para><para>In relation to the Democrat amendment, it is my advice that this will potentially only impact, if at all, on six out of the 60 registered parties: the Democrats, the ALP, the Christian Democratic Party Fred Nile Group, the Liberal Party, the National Party and Pauline Hanson's One Nation party. So, despite all the protestations of Senator Brown as to the Greens, the Australian Greens is not a federally registered party. It is a disparate group of state entities that do not have, on my advice, a national secretary or secretariat pursuant to the Electoral Act. As a result, it will not apply to the Australian Greens. As I understand it, it will apply to those that have a separately registered federal body. </para><para>In relation to the Greens funding, the Australian Electoral Commission, in the year 2000-01, noted that the Commonwealth Bank made moneys, albeit unspecified, available to the Australian Greens. What if you do not like the Commonwealth Bank, having received unspecified funds? It may well have been a mortgage, for example. That I do not know; I am not sure that gets us anywhere. But Avant Card, which I understand is a business, did make a contribution of, if I recall correctly, about $66,000. So, if it happens that the Commonwealth Bank's unspecified contribution to the Greens was in fact by way of a commercial transaction or a mortgage, that is fine and let us move to Avant Card, because it would still apply to any political party that had received a donation from a corporation. And, as I understand it, Senator Brown's matter of high principle is that the Greens would not have spent that money until after three years of its receipt. I think that deals with the matters that have been raised so far.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>3733</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It does not deal with the matter and I will not move to some other company. Senator Abetz has been caught out. He stated categorically that the Greens had a donation of $90,000 from the Commonwealth Bank. He is now, of course, back-pedalling because he did not know what he was talking about. He had not done his homework and he made a bald statement based on supposition.

How do we know that this was the case? Not just because I am asserting it, not just because you can read about it in the newspapers but because the Queensland Liberal Party had to pay a substantial fine and penalties to the Australian Taxation Office. That is what has actually happened.

It is a very famous name; I do not know if they are related. It is the McMahon family, and I send a cheerio to the McMahon family. I understand they live in Highgate Hill. Highgate Hill, for those of you who are from Western Australia or Tasmania, is not anywhere near Caboolture. It is actually in the centre of Brisbane, some 100 kilometres away. So we see the Caboolture branch of the Liberal Party sending seven McMahons who live in Highgate Hill to represent the Caboolture branch of the Liberal Party. It is really quite extraordinary. It is good to see a family getting involved in politics, I say, and that is what we all like to see, but this is clearly absurd.

He said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>This legislation proposes to allow the federal secretariat of the Liberal Party to be funded directly, and we have been advised that that is unanimously agreed to by the federal Liberal secretariat, which includes all divisional presidents.</para></quote><para>That puts the lie to the need for this legislation.

I do make this point, and it is a serious point, that you cannot have it both ways: either the federal secretariat and the state divisions sign up in support, and if they do the bill is not required; or that is simply not the case. The point I make, and it is a strong point, is if there is agreement there is no need for the bill.</para><para>Let us try to deal with this issue about the impact of the Democrat amendment. The Democrat amendment allows the central body of a political party to dictate to its state branches who will get public funding following a federal election. That is what Senator Murray's amendment ensures. The point has been made on a number of occasions here that the Democrats themselves have the name of their political party in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. I have heard it now from the minister—and Senator Murray is nodding sagely at the back, hoping that I will not take up the point in the committee debate—but, if it is good enough for the Democrats, it ought to be good enough for the Liberal Party. In relation to this, if you ever mention the Australian Democrats, mention the Liberal Party of Australia. Everyone knows, including of course Senator Murray, that for every registered party, except the Australian Democrats, as I understand it—if there is a change, Senator Murray, I would be happy to acknowledge that perhaps the information I am going to provide to the committee is outdated—the candidate who ran in the election is a member of the state branch or state division of that political party and was nominated by the state branch or state division of that political party. Mr Temporary Chairman, as you would know, that stands in stark contrast to the situation we have with the Australian Democrats, because they have a national membership structure, and that is why the Australian Democrats are named in the Commonwealth Electoral Act. Senator Murray knows that. It is even possible that Senator Abetz knows that. Certainly, the Australian Electoral Commission knows that that is the situation. </para><para>Over the past few weeks the newspapers have been full on the Democrats' national membership structure and what the implications of it are in relation to the future of the Democrats in this parliament. I do not want to go into that. I do not want to score any cheap political points during this committee stage debate. But Senator Murray should acknowledge that the Australian Democrats have a national membership structure, and Senator Murray should explain to this committee the statement he made in relation to the position of the federal secretariat. If the state divisions of the Liberal Party do agree, as Senator Murray says they agree, then why have the legislation? So there are two things that Senator Murray needs to explain, and it is only a quarter to nine at night.

Everyone in this chamber knows—and I want to acknowledge this— that Senator Murray is one of the most expert senators in this chamber in relation to the provisions of the Electoral Act. I do not say that in a cute way. He is experienced in handling electoral legislation in the Committee of the Whole. He is an experienced member of the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters. He has joined with me, Senator Ray and one or two other senators in extensive cross-examination of witnesses in the Senate Finance and Public Administration Legislation Committee. I acknowledge that Senator Murray is one of the most expert senators in this chamber on the Commonwealth Electoral Act.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I know Senator Murray can tell the chamber that the Electoral Act currently provides that public funding is paid to the agent of the state branch of a party for which the candidate stood. I know that Senator Murray can explain why the Australian Democrats, with their national membership structure, are mentioned specifically in the act. But what is proposed here—and I come back to the fundamental point—is that this parliament, the Senate, is being asked to provide a mechanism for the Liberal Party to sort out how they organise their internal political finances. Of course, Senator Murray says that they are all in agreement. That is absolute claptrap. That is absolute nonsense because if that were true we would not be having this debate. Senator Murray must know that what he was saying to the committee was wrong and that what he said during the second reading debate was wrong.</para><para>Currently, under proposed section 299(5)(a) of the <inline ref="R1502">Commonwealth Electoral Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</inline>, a state division can lodge a notice with the AEC requesting that payments be made to the agent of another party. That is the simple mechanism that is in the Electoral Act now for parties to resolve how public funding is organised. It is a nonsense for a senator to come in here and say that everyone in the state divisions of the Liberal Party agrees, although they cannot use the mechanism that is provided under the act. We say it should be up to the political parties themselves to sort this out. If they cannot sort it out, it is no business of the Commonwealth parliament to sort it out for them. </para><para>I have said before, Mr Temporary Chairman Cook, that as far as the Australian Labor Party is concerned our national secretariat— our national executive on which you, of course, are a distinguished member—has reached agreement with all the state ALP branches.

But we have to start with the essential proposition. You and some of your colleagues have had the opportunity—in fact, I think it is a great privilege—to serve on the government benches. One of the privileges that goes with being on the government benches is the right to introduce whatever legislation you like. Frankly, I would not have introduced half the bills this government has, and perhaps even less, but as an Australian senator I speak seriously to you when I say that I honestly believe that the government of the day is entitled to bring forward its legislation to have it debated.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Of course.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—And you do not object to that.

The second thing I say is, `Does it introduce any extra cost?' As far as I am aware, it does not. The cost is the same prior to or after this bill. So what is at issue? What is at issue from Senator Faulkner's perspective is that the parliament is being asked to debate a method of funding which, if I summarise him correctly, he believes could be internally resolved. He might be right. I do not disagree with that proposition.

I do not know whether Senator Abetz sits on the Federal Council of the Liberal Party—he may or may not. I certainly believe that Senator Abetz would have knowledge of the discussions that occur with respect to the Tasmanian representatives on the Federal Council of the Liberal Party.

It does surprise me, given that we are having to do the job for the federal Liberal Party of ensuring that the moneys they receive from an election are passed to their national office, that we should be interfering in a political party operation in this way. I would be very surprised if the Tasmanian representatives on the Liberal Party national council, or whatever ultimate executive body has the authority to deal with these matters, agreed to this particular piece of legislation. In fact, I think we have this legislation because the Federal Council of the Liberal Party could not be convinced by their national office, or by the Prime Minister or Senator Abetz or others who want the money to be paid direct to the national office.</para><para>Of course, I can understand the despair of the Liberal Party national office in wanting to make sure that not one cent goes to their Tasmanian operation.

You can be a member of a Liberal Party electorate no matter where you live in Queensland, no matter where you live in Australia and no matter where you live overseas. You can live in Hong Kong, apparently. You can sign people from all around Queensland, all around Australia and all around the world into one electorate in Queensland.

You have to admire Senator Crichton-Browne. He was certainly an organiser from what we have heard. He went around to all those small rural branches, to the mining communities and the rural communities in Western Australia.

I know that in Victoria they have recently had some problems. The Liberal Party in New South Wales had a change of leader last year and have been out of power for some six or seven years. If you look around the country—and many of my colleagues have commented on this in greater detail than I have—they are in a very sad and sorry state. You do have to ask yourself: why should they get any money; why should any of these state branches get any money? Their performances have been so poor in the last five or six years. But there is an important principle here. A political party should determine through its internal rules processes— through its national council, its national executive—what is an appropriate way in which to allocate the moneys that come as a result of public funding. Why should the parliament have to determine this matter for the Liberal Party? We would like to know whether in fact it is simply too hard—that the Liberal Party cannot sort it out internally. They have had discussions at their council meeting. I hope Senator Abetz will tell us about the debates that have occurred at the national level and why they have not been able to get agreement. Of course, the Prime Minister, the national office and Senator Abetz want to deal with it via the parliament. They believed, at least at some point in time, that that was the easiest way to override the views of at least some of their states that they could not convince should pass over the money via a resolution of their national council or their national executive, whichever body has the appropriate authority to deal with this matter.  </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>3744</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A few matters have been raised by Senator Sherry.

I can ask Senator Sherry and the Tasmanian Labor Party as to the circumstances in which Senator Murphy was forced out of the Australian Labor Party. I could ask why Duncan Kerr was rejected for the front bench, why his request for endorsement for the state was knocked back and why his resignation from the federal parliament was rejected. Do not pretend that everything is rosy in the Labor house when it is not. I think that the Australian people do not find these sorts of debates very edifying.

Former Senator Cheryl Kernot in her speech thanked the Australian Labor Party minister's office for his cooperation in the matter. Senator Sherry was there. This high principle that the legislation should not be amended was not there in 1995 when he was part and parcel of doing exactly that which he condemns today in 2002. The only difference is that then he was in government and now he is in opposition and, as part of an unprincipled opposition, he will oppose everything that comes before this chamber. That is unlike us: when we were in opposition in 1995 we saw the need for the Australian Democrats to have a specific provision in the legislation and as a principled opposition we supported those amendments. I would encourage the Australian Labor Party for once to take a principled stand on an issue. But it was the same when they were in government. They supported privatisation after privatisation; suddenly they are in opposition and privatisation is somehow unprincipled.</para><para>I was asked about the government's amendment. I am not sure how this is actually relevant, given that we are debating, as I understand it, the Australian Democrat amendments to the bill. Nevertheless, as the legislation is at the moment, either all the money has to go to the national secretariat or none of it. We are a party of cooperative federalism and what our amendments will allow is for a percentage of the funds to go to the national body and a percentage to the state bodies. The legislation at the moment does not provide for such a possibility. We, as a liberal party and being cooperative federalists as we are, think that that would be very beneficial for the Liberal Party. The law at the moment does not allow it. For the Liberal Party it makes good sense, and the Australian Democrat amendments to the legislation suggest that other parties ought to be able to avail themselves of a similar procedure. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>3744</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I asked Senator Abetz a little earlier tonight if he could explain his statement that the Australian Greens is not federally registered as a party.

I am pleased to have that interjection on the record. Not only is it disorderly; it is again the sort of fulmination coming from this minister which makes one question his ability to take a level-headed part in a debate like this. I was saying that, a little earlier tonight, Senator Abetz was found to be making statements which were untrue and which were very short of the mark as far as a minister of the Crown leading a Senate committee debate would be expected to behave. He has made this extraordinary statement. He is talking in a debate at the committee stage in which an Australian Greens senator is taking part and he says that the Australian Greens is not a federally registered party. One would think that logic would say, `How did two Australian Greens senators come to be here if that is the case?' I asked Senator Abetz to explain the statement that the Australian Greens is not federally registered, and I ask him again to explain it. And I will continue to ask him until he comes forward with an explanation because I simply do not understand it. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>3745</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator ABETZ</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—It is very unfortunate when you have somebody seeking to make contributions to this sort of legislation when they do not understand it.

What a minister! There is a very strong convention in here that we do not bring advisers into this, and I have not done that. If I were in the minister's chair, I would make sure that, above all, I was defending them if they ever did come under attack. But here we have a minister who cares to make statements in here and then transfer the statements he has made, or the onus for them, to somebody else. I do not accept that. We are all responsible for what we say in here. I can put this matter to rest. I am not going to pursue it further except to say that, earlier tonight, Senator Abetz said that the Australian Greens are not federally registered. He has now told the chamber what is glaringly obvious to everybody else in here, and that is that the Australian Greens are federally registered. In an important debate in here on fundamentals like that, the minister ought to get it right, because he makes himself very vulnerable to questioning of his ability to grasp the legislation and to know what he is talking about. As far as the Australian Greens are concerned, we are a federal establishment. The branches of the states and territories came together to establish the Australian Greens in 1992. We have celebrated our 10th birthday and we are going beautifully at the moment. We are very pleased that we are federally registered. It is a different system to what Senator Abetz understands the Liberal Party system to be, but then I am not too upset that we are somewhat different to the Liberals in structure and in policy direction. </para></talk.start><para>Finally on this particular matter, I have to agree with Senator Faulkner: I have not heard the argument that would support this amendment from Senator Murray. I do not follow the logic that says it is required. When Senator Abetz argues that it is necessary, he brings into the argument the fact that the state and territory branches of the Liberals have agreed that this legislation is necessary but that they are baulked by this legislation. I think it has only emerged tonight that the whole rationale being put forward by Senator Abetz for this legislation is that some arrangement could be made between the branches and the federal structure for a division of the funds. It was not that the funds go to the federal party and then are divided up, which is what I understood it was. Now we are saying that, if the Liberals want to make a split between the funds at state and federal level, this legislation will give them the ability to do that. I ask: if the cheque goes to the state parties and they agree to give it to the federal party, why don't they then, with the goodwill that is obviously there, say, `But let us split it two to one,' or, `Let us split it four to three,' or whatever it might be? There is something missing here. There is something going on behind the scenes in the Liberal Party that is not being evidenced to this committee. What is the impulsion behind this legislation? There is no logic in Senator Abetz's argument which convinces me that Senator Murray's amendment is necessary. Senator Murray has very kindly assisted to help the Liberals to come forward with a better formula, but Senator Murray himself says he does not know what it is that has motivated the Liberals to bring this legislation into here. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—He's holding out on us.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name></talker><para>—No, I'm not holding out on you.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—No, I think Senator Murray is simply saying that he can improve the government's legislation.

Senator Abetz says that people in here are making outrageous allegations et cetera, but let us be honest: Senator Abetz is one of the worst offenders in this. Let us not try and put too fine a point on it. I raised a serious issue earlier today and I want an answer. I made it very clear when I raised this issue earlier today that I did not believe it, but I have not heard a refutation from Senator Abetz. So I will go through it again, although I do not think it is true. The issue that I raised earlier today was about something that is happening in Tasmania at the moment. In the state election a candidate called Brett Whiteley distributed how-to-votes that were in breach of the Tasmanian Electoral Act. Mr Whiteley knew they were. About 3,000 of these illegal how-to-votes were distributed before their illegality was exposed. In his interview with the police, Mr Whiteley said that he had planned this for several months. It does take several months to put together a how-to vote. Those of us who have put together how-to votes— and I have put together many how-to-votes—know that it does take a long time to organise.</para></talk.start><para>The reality is that Mr Whiteley knew that he was breaching the act. When he appeared in court fairly recently he pleaded guilty. He just said, `It's a fair cop, gov—I am guilty; I knew it.' I suspect that was in fact an attempt to avoid a jury trial because, if there had been a jury, a lot may have come out in relation to this. I have been advised that a number of Liberal Party members in Tasmania were involved in this. One of the names that came up was Senator Abetz's. As I said earlier today, I do not believe that he was involved. What minister would be so stupid as to involve himself or herself in a serious breach of the act? However, I think I am doing Senator Abetz a favour here, because it is common gossip in Tasmania that this is the case. Senator Abetz has the opportunity here today to say, `I never had any discussions with Mr Whiteley in relation to this matter. I was not aware of it until the point at which it came to the Liberal Party state executive.' I am sure that that is the case, but I would like Senator Abetz to get up and indicate that and then that will be the end of the issue—it will be on the public record. </para><para>The second issue that I would like to raise—and I have not received a response to this either—is a direct recommendation arising out of the jolly good read called the Crosby report. As I said earlier today, anybody who has anything to do with politics or campaigning really ought to read it, because it is a hoot. One of the recommendations that came out of the Crosby report was on the ABC and I would like the minister to have the opportunity to explain this as well. The recommendation was that, because of the parlous nature of the Liberal Party in Tasmania, Senator Abetz should get an extra staff person.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Robert Ray</name></talker><para>—Reward failure?

But I want to know the basis upon which he got the job. I understand that there is some largesse and flexibility around these things, but it is not apposite for the Federal Director of the Liberal Party and the Prime Minister to say to Senator Abetz, `Here is an extra staffer because you had such a disastrous state election.'

There are so many leaks in the Liberal Party in Tasmania at the moment it is like a colander. That is the second issue I want a response to. Given that Senator Abetz is the responsible minister, there ought to be some clarification about whether the extra staff person is being funded by the Liberal Party. I doubt it—I do not think they could fund a round of drinks in a pub at the moment in Tasmania, never mind an extra staff person. Who is paying for this extra staff person? Is it the Liberal Party? Is it the government? What is this person being paid to do? According to Mr Crosby, this person is there to help Senator Abetz and the Liberal Party in relation to electoral matters in Tasmania. These are two key issues that deserve responses. As I have indicated, I do not believe the first one. But, Senator Abetz, I think that it would be a good idea if you clarified it. The second issue was in the media, so perhaps the minister would clarify that one for us. If it is permitted for federal directors or national secretaries of parties to go around saying, `You had a terrible result, here's an extra staff person in government,' and to be so blatant about it then, in the interests of a level playing field, let us all hear about it.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I want to advise the chamber that, since I gave the speech this morning, this newly-elected member of state parliament Brett Whiteley has in fact been given a bond after admitting that what he did was incorrect. I have the how-to-vote here if anybody is interested in having a look at it. I have to say: what kind of a party would do this? I would seriously contend that this would not happen in the Labor Party in Tasmania.

They say that it was unapproved et cetera, yet they leave him there. That is what the Liberal Party in Tasmania is going to do. This guy has said that he knew his actions were illegal, has pleaded guilty and has been sentenced—and he is still there as the state member for Braddon. What is the Liberal Party doing about somebody who admits they knew they were culpable and that they knew months beforehand that they were breaching the act? The Liberal Party is saying, `Well done'—pat, pat—`you can stay there.' I do not think that anybody could seriously defend that sort of action. I would be very interested to hear the minister attempt to defend it. I could be wrong, but I am pretty sure that I talk on behalf of the Labor Party in Tasmania when I say that we would probably have a bit to say about that. I am not sure that somebody who had done that would survive with their kneecaps intact, to be totally blunt. I cannot say the same for Greg Barnes. </para><para>Those are the two issues I want clarified. I have to say that, personally, having somebody who has actually been sentenced for committing electoral fraud and not doing anything about it internally in relation to the Liberal Party reflects on every single member of the Liberal Party in Tasmania.

Then there is another heading that reads `The Liberal Strategy'. The first sentence, which is in isolation, says, `There was no real Liberal campaign strategy.' So say all of us, I suppose, in relation to what happened with the Liberal Party and Tasmania. All I have got to say is that I do not know how much you are paying Mr Crosby, but I would have a look at it again because to come up with stuff like `The Liberal Strategy' and `There was no real Liberal campaign strategy' you would not have to be Einstein to work that one out.

Recently, the Senate Standing Committee on Employment, Workplace Relations and Education began its hearings. In Sydney, the following tragic situation came to light. Imagine yourself in this situation: your daughter is 11 years old and has multiple disabilities which include mild autism and severe chemical allergies; if she walks into a freshly painted classroom she stops breathing. Because this young girl did not fit the requirements to attend a special school in New South Wales she has been attending a comprehensive high school all her life. Due to the lack of state funds, the school finds it very difficult to provide for her special needs and she is often moved from various school situations and environments that often make her ill. Is that an appropriate learning environment for a student? Obviously it is not, given that it has already held her back two years.</para></talk.start><para>There are so many families in our society, a number of which I have spoken to, that must face the day-to-day horror of seeing their child with a disability go off to our state school system with very little recognition and very little support. Many families with children who have a disability spend much of their lives fighting losing battles against state bureaucracies. Often, the community is unaware of the extent of the problem. If your child has a disability it is all a bit hit-and-miss in New South Wales. More than half of New South Wales teachers have absolutely no training in disabilities education—it is really pot luck for the parents and for their children.  </para><para>Shedding some light on this important area of education is a current Senate inquiry into the education of children with disabilities which met in Sydney earlier this year. The New South Wales government treated this serious inquiry disgracefully by producing a lousy 3½-page document which did not arrive until the afternoon before the hearings. Are our children with a disability in New South Wales only worth 3½ pages? Given that the New South Wales Department of Education and Training had been aware of this inquiry since late last year, I could not help but expect 3½ pages of gold. What I actually read was waffle. The document contained no facts, no figures, no strategies and no assessment details. The submission was a complete joke. By submitting this inadequate document, the New South Wales government have proved that they are derelict in their duty to provide for the education of these children and for appropriate training for their teachers.</para><para>Life has dealt children with disabilities a very difficult life experience, and the last thing they need is for a state government not to exercise a proper duty of care. What the inquiry did hear was clear evidence from groups such as the Australian Parents Council, AUSPELD, Isolated Childrens Parents Association, the Royal Institute of Deaf and Blind Children, the Autism Association of New South Wales, the Australian Association of Special Education and the Australian Guidance and Counselling Association, who gave the true story. They outlined a disturbing picture in New South Wales of the neglect of our children with disabilities. No wonder the Carr government tried to hide the submission from these groups and the situation from our community.</para><para>The overwhelming response from all parties has pointed out the following shortcomings in disability services education in New South Wales under the Carr government: no systematic program to test whether children have a disability; virtually no pre-service and in-service training of teachers in the identification of such children and how to teach them; lack of support services for children with disabilities in mainstream classrooms; insufficient coordination in the management of such children when they move between sectors—for example, from preschools to primary schools. Our children with disabilities are being seriously short-changed by the New South Wales state government, which seriously needs to look at its budget priorities.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Women's Soccer Association</title><page.no>3751</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>3751</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I wish to talk about some very serious and alarming issues relating to the Matildas, Australia's representative women's soccer team. A number of serious allegations regarding the financial and ethical behaviour of the Australian Women's Soccer Association and Soccer Australia have been brought to my attention. These issues, I believe, warrant inclusion in the proposed inquiry into soccer in Australia which the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp, announced in mid-August. I have written to Minister Kemp requesting him to investigate these matters as they relate to the financial and ethical management of women's soccer. I have requested that the minister investigate the expenditure and accounting of public and private funds which were allocated to the Australian Women's Soccer Association in the lead-up to the 1990 World Cup and the 2000 Sydney Olympics.</para></talk.start><para>The minister's proposed inquiry into soccer should also investigate allegations that young female athletes were duped into appearing topless for a foreign television advertisement. It is important for the integrity of the sport that we know who duped these girls and where the funds have gone. It is important that allegations that female athletes were pressured into appearing in this sort of ad because they were told the sport needed the revenue be investigated.</para><para>There are many questions that remain unanswered, questions which I believe the government's inquiry should address for the good of women's soccer. These questions include: did the Australian Women's Soccer Association inform the national coaches of the Matildas that the toothpaste ad to be filmed in Perth required young female athletes to appear in only a flesh-coloured G-string; were all the members of the Matildas made aware that the ad was to take place or just a select few; what was the process for picking players for the ad; and who decided which members of the Matildas would be required to take part? Most importantly, why was it that players who were selected to take part in this ad were not told beforehand that they would be required to appear without clothes? I am also gravely concerned that some of the Matildas may have been intimidated into signing a contractual agreement for the ad after the event. </para><para>As women's soccer received substantial government money through the Australian Sports Commission, did the CEO, the high-performance manager, the Australian Women's Soccer Association board, the Australian Institute of Sport or the Australian Sports Commission know prior to the ad that the girls would be required to take their clothes off? If so, did the Australian Sports Commission or the Australian Institute of Sport endorse the ad? Surely, someone involved in women's soccer must have signed an agreement for members of the Matildas to appear in this ad knowing full well what it entailed.</para><para>What were the Australian Women's Soccer Association board members doing at this time? If they were present when the ad was being filmed, surely they were aware that some of these young girls were unhappy with being required to appear naked. If players were pressured into participating, then this must also be investigated as part of the government's inquiry into soccer in Australia. The Australian Sports Commission and the Australian Institute of Sport also have questions to answer in relation to the Matildas. Knowing that women's soccer was experiencing financial difficulties, did either the commission or the institute endorse the use of nude advertisements as a legitimate way of raising funds? What action did the Sports Commission take if and when they were informed of the players' concerns?</para><para>I now want to turn to financial irregularities involving women's soccer. The Australian Women's Soccer Association was recently liquidated in the ACT Supreme Court owing its lawyers $70,000. This is unbelievable when you consider the amount of government funding women's soccer has received. In the past few years, women's soccer received $1.15 million for the financial year to June 2000, $710,000 leading up to the Sydney Olympics, $100,000 from the toothpaste ad, income from the Matildas calendar and ongoing grant moneys. How is it then that by July 2002 the Australian Women's Soccer Association is wound up in the Supreme Court with a debt of $70,000? How is it that the Australian Women's Soccer Association allegedly informed the Matildas' coaches in March 2000, just prior to the Sydney Olympics, that only a budget of $28,000 remained? Where did the funding they received through the Olympic athlete program in the years leading into the 2000 Olympics go? The Australian Sports Commission should say whether or not they are satisfied that all the funding moneys were expended appropriately. It may be appropriate that an itemised breakdown of all expenses relating to the Matildas be provided to the proposed inquiry into soccer.</para><para>During my inquiries I have also come across matters that, while not directly related to the issues I have raised, are connected to the broader issue of management and probity. I have, with the agreement of the people who raised these matters with me, written to the Australian Federal Police and the Australian Customs Service, asking them to look into these matters, as they may be of a criminal nature. Accordingly, it is not appropriate for me to talk further about these matters at this time. If Senator Kemp's inquiry is to be open and genuine, it must include the following terms of reference: the expenditure and accounting of public and private funds allocated to the Australian Women's Soccer Association in the lead-up to the 1999 World Cup and the 2000 Olympics and beyond; second, the process by which the Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Institute of Sport, the AIS high performance manager and the Australian Women's Soccer Association organised and authorised advertisements for the purposes of fundraising; and finally, the procedure by which concerns and complaints raised by players and/or coaching staff involved with the Matildas were dealt with by the Australian Sports Commission, the Australian Institute of Sport and the Australian Women's Soccer Association. I urge Senator Kemp to take these matters seriously and to act accordingly by including all of these matters in the terms of reference for his inquiry into soccer in Australia. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Democrats: Leadership</title><page.no>3753</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>3753</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am very honoured to have been appointed as interim leader of the Australian Democrats. At the same time, I am very saddened by the events that have brought us to this point and to the change of leadership in my party. I believe we must strive strongly for stability at this time. I want to start with an apology to Democrat members and to Democrat voters, given that they have had to endure the turmoil of recent months. To them I say sorry. I also specifically want to express and extend apologies on behalf of the Democrats to our founder, Don Chipp, who was in intensive care recovering from surgery when he heard on the television the news that Senator Natasha Stott Despoja had resigned. Don has pointed to certain egos in the party room as being the problem. He, more than anyone, knows that there have been many occasions over the last 25 years when critics and commentators have declared that the Australian Democrats are gone and are done for. However, the Democrats have survived crises before and we will again. I am committed to bringing unity, seeking an end to infighting, and restoring the focus to our policies and legislative achievements. I assure members of the public that the Democrats are continuing to focus on legislation before the parliament, including the electoral amendment bills, the higher education amendment bills, the proceeds of crime bills, the ASIO legislation, amendments to the Marriage Act and so on.</para></talk.start><para>I realise that the media coverage would suggest that we have been focused only on internal matters, but in fact the legislative and policy work continues—as it always has. This morning's party room meeting, the first since last Thursday, went well. It was, as they usually are, very civil. I endeavoured to contact all of my colleagues over the last few days since being appointed as interim leader, and was able to speak to most of them. I urge those who are still bunkered down and lobbing the occasional threat to desist. Communication, dialogue and compromise must be brought to the fore. From there we can build understanding, trust and goodwill. I believe that the majority mood is a serious and genuine commitment to reconciliation in the party room. If nothing else, one of the outcomes of last week is that the importance of supporting the parliamentary leader has been emphasised. I have also spoken to as many national executive representatives and other party members as I could, and was very pleased with the feedback. The national executive is committed to working constructively, and I certainly urge my Western Australian division to follow that example. I understand that membership applications have risen subsequent to the announcement of the interim leader decision, and I certainly urge people to join and be part of the process. These difficult times will pass.</para><para>I entered the parliament at the same time as Senator Ridgeway. As I said in my first speech, working as a deckhand on my father's cray boat, miles out to sea in the wee hours of the morning, surrounded by rotting cow hocks and fish heads and crashing face first into strong headwinds might have been good preparation for a career in politics. I am serious about reconciliation and trying to pull the party together. I am very encouraged by the messages of support I have received from members and supporters and from members of the public. I have received more than 1,500 emails in recent days, so I must apologise to many of those people that it will take me some time to get back to them. I trust they understand.</para><para>Finally, I take the opportunity to thank Senator Stott Despoja for her leadership of the party over the past 16 months—which included the federal election—as well as her period as deputy leader from late 1997. As many have noted, she has exhibited great dignity in her conduct around her resignation, and dignity by virtue of the fact that she did not leave the party and take the party seat with her. She will, of course, continue to be a valuable member of the party, the party room and the Australian Senate. An inspiring individual, she has attracted many people to take an interest in the Australian Democrats. I hope to build on that public goodwill, turn around the perceptions of disarray, and offer a bridge between members of the parliamentary wing and the party organisation. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>South Australia: Road Toll</title><page.no>3754</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>3754</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I will touch briefly on an issue that is becoming of increasing concern to me. It does not just relate to my own situation in South Australia—where I spend many hours on the road—it is also of relevance, no doubt, to my colleagues in this place. I am concerned about the number of accidents that have occurred on the road between Adelaide and Whyalla, a road which I travel on regularly—at least once a week. Many times during a sitting week I drive back to Adelaide from Whyalla. A number of serious road accidents have taken lives and created serious injury to travellers. As I drive along, I try to contemplate why, and I think a key contributor would be fatigue. Tonight I am talking particularly about National Highway 1 between Adelaide and the Western Australian border. As I said, it is a road that I travel on quite frequently, although I would do so less frequently, of course, between Whyalla and Ceduna or the border. Certainly, I travel on it frequently enough to know the kangaroos and the wildlife pretty intimately. We are underestimating the effect of fatigue on our driving habits on our national highways.</para></talk.start><para>There has been a call in South Australia, in fact, for higher road speeds. A prominent state Liberal MP based in Port Augusta is calling for the road speed to increase to at least 130 kilometres per hour. He bases that proposition on the fact that country drivers get used to their conditions. They are used to driving in the country and driving long distances. On that very foolish assumption, he has suggested that we raise the road speed. But what stops the city driver who does the annual trip to the country from going at the higher speed as well? Are there two road speeds?</para><para>I applaud the South Australian government's decision to alter road speeds more to suit the conditions of the road. I think that has already been done in New South Wales to a large extent. There are areas where you can go faster, and on occasions you will be slowed down to 80 kilometres per hour on main highways or main link roads. That is the way it should be. Certainly, in this address tonight I am not wanting to say for one moment that money is not being spent on the highways. In fact, the roads have been upgraded considerably to cater for road trains that drive right into Adelaide now. That is not the problem. The roads are reasonably good. They could be better, but they are reasonably good when you consider the distances that are covered and the number of road users.</para><para>It is not the road trains that are causing the problems, although a tanker driver was killed less than two weeks ago at Crystal Brook. I understand that he had a head-on collision with another car. These things worry me because it could be me who the other driver hits. It could be me who nods off to sleep. It is not unusual for me to make the four-hour trip to Adelaide and the four-hour trip home again in one day. I am very conscious of this, and I am also very conscious that you can stop for five or 10 minutes and be okay.</para><para>What really got me to my feet tonight was an article that appeared in a recent edition of an airline magazine. It was written by Channel 9 motoring presenter Jeff Watson. I will not mention the name of the magazine unless I am asked to do so for the simple reason that it is not a magazine that the airline itself produces; it is produced by a third party. I want to show the irresponsibility of some writers when they think they are writing an interesting story—in this story the writer drives a Morris Minor across the Nullarbor Plain— but they can take it too far. He says:</para><quote><para>The next bit of the road, between Caiguna and Balladonia, is strictly for the lead-footed driver. It is dead straight for 160 kilometres (a hundred miles in pre-metric Morris Minor language). It's unlikely you'll encounter the constabulary in this remote spot so there is no better time to nudge the rev-counter. </para></quote><para>That is encouraging drivers to nudge the rev-counter and to go faster on this straight stretch of road. Where better to do it, I guess, except that that straight stretch of road is far from a stopping point on one side and far from a stopping point on the other side. How can you encourage people to drive faster and to put their lives and those of others at risk? I think this writer is totally irresponsible. Also, he says:</para><quote><para>The scenery here is about as interesting as a Rotary Club luncheon so I suggest you just keep going.</para></quote><para>I am not a member of Rotary, but I do have a lot of friends who are. I have not been to their luncheons, so I do not know how uninteresting their luncheons are. But it seems to me that this article is not only irresponsible but also offensive to a group of people. It is really offensive to the intelligence of people who have care and goodwill at heart and who wish to travel long distances. Truck drivers have to go backwards and forwards along that road, and I have seen very few accidents involving trucks. I know there have been some, but very few are caused by, or involve, heavy transport—the road trains. How irresponsible is an article like this which encourages people to go faster, when people who earn their living by driving along that road are placed at risk day by day?</para><para>I think the federal government could play a role in improving our roads. I agree that that is happening and I applaud what is happening with the highways, but it could be a lot better. I would not include some of the regional link roads in that, but the main highway across to the west is very good. But I think the federal government does need to do more in promoting safety on these trips. You can put in little red and black markers for deaths and serious injuries—and that gives the children something to do when they are travelling because they can count how many extra markers are along the road; there always seem to be one or two more—but it is not really drawing people's attention to safety on our highways.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—That's Bob Carr's job.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009D2</name.id><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name></talker><para>—It may be Bob Carr's job; it may be anyone's job. But the federal government has a role to play as well on national highways. That role is to educate people about the effects of fatigue and the real effects of higher speeds on the highways. If my Senate friends opposite think that it is a great idea to get out in their fancy cars and drive faster, that is a choice they will make. It is a price that they might not pay; it is a price that another road user may well pay because of their negligence and their lack of good driving habits. So I think the federal government has a real role to play in increasing the education of those using our highways for long-distance travel.</para></talk.start></continue></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Employment: Outworkers</title><page.no>3755</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>3755</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to draw the Senate's attention to the plight of Australia's outworkers in the clothing industry. This issue has been an ongoing one in the Senate, in Australia and around the world for some time now, and it has seemingly come to the attention of a number of our media outlets of late as well. A recent investigative report undertaken by Channel 7's <inline font-style="italic">Today Tonight </inline>sought to expose sweatshops and highlight the issues faced by many thousands of Australian outworkers. Subsequently, journalists Andrew Bolt and Miranda Devine took up this issue in their respective columns, both seeking to debunk these issues as part of a church-union conspiracy to drive the industry offshore. The Bolt article states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Anyone with a bit of brains would wonder who'd be so mad as to work for $2 an hour, when they'd get more on the dole.</para></quote><para>Whilst Bolt's simplistic argument may appeal to some readers, what he fails to express is that changes made to immigration laws in 1996 withdrew rights of migrants to access social security within the first two years of migration. This has effectively forced many non-English speaking migrants into the clothing industry as outworkers. Outworkers are predominantly employed in what can best be described as an `unregulated industry', which is more often than not hidden from the public's attention. It is an industry with an environment pervaded by occupational health and safety problems, overwork, insecurity, intimidation, fear, physical violence, fraud, non-payment, underpayment, withholding of payment and disempowerment. </para><para>The Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union estimates that up to 329,000 outworkers are employed in the clothing industry—something Bolt simply passes off as an `untruth'. It has been estimated in the Industry Commission report into the textile, clothing and footwear industries that 95 per cent of clothing industry outworkers are non-English speaking women—many of whom would be restricted from access to social security. They work in the industry because they are forced to, not because they are without intelligence as Bolt would lead his readers to believe. This form of employment and the arguments promoted by Bolt seek to exploit pre-existing gender, class and ethnic divisions in the community and take advantage of a vulnerable labour force, much of which has few alternative employment options.</para><para>The Bolt article and Miranda Devine's article, which was featured in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald </inline>on 15 August this year, establish their views of the industry based on an answer by an employer on a current affairs show aired on <inline font-style="italic">Today Tonight </inline>in late July. It is claimed that the employer interviewed on the program responded to the question of how much he paid his workers with the figure of $13 per hour. Bolt and Devine take this answer as gospel and shape their knowledge of the whole industry on this one response purely on the information provided in the current affairs program. No research was offered and none was undertaken. The entire basis of both articles is on another journalist's research on a current affairs program.</para><para>A more comprehensive analysis of the industry was recently undertaken by Dr Christina Cregan from Melbourne University. In her report <inline font-style="italic">Home Sweat Home</inline>, Dr Cregan examined the working patterns, wages and conditions of 119 outworkers—110 of whom were born in Vietnam and 114 of whom were female. The Cregan report estimates that the average rate for clothing industry outworkers is $3.60 per hour. Further, the report finds that outworkers were paid between 20c and $5.35 per garment, with garment production time ranging from three minutes to 90 minutes per garment. Most workers surveyed reported that they did not receive paid holidays, sick pay or paid public holidays, and it was not uncommon for outworkers to be paid as little as 50c per hour. Sixty-two per cent of the outworkers surveyed worked every day and 74 per cent worked 12 to 19 hours per day. It is reasonable to suggest, as this report does, that `The work consumes their lives'.</para><para>The Devine article goes on to claim that the Textile, Clothing and Footwear Union, church groups and community organisations are threatening Australian jobs via their campaign to raise the standards which outworkers in the clothing industry are employed under. I would suggest that, whilst Australians recognise that keeping jobs in Australia is crucial, they would not recognise this form of employment as fair and reasonable, and it is in contradiction with the Australian ethos of everyone deserving a fair go.</para><para>The industry has become structured around the exploitative conditions of outworkers, which are estimated to be as high as 329,000 Australia-wide. This figure of 329,000 translates into more than 10 outworkers for each registered clothing factory worker. Organisations concerned with the plight of outworkers understand that the industry has become structured in such a manner that ensures outworkers are kept in what can be best described as an unregulated, exploitive industry that prohibits them from knowing their rights and entitlements and further limits their ability to organise collectively.</para><para>The article by Andrew Bolt titled `It's a fair job: no sweat' in the <inline font-style="italic">Herald-Sun</inline> on Thursday, 1 August 2002, went on to make a number of quite bizarre claims. In it he says:</para><quote><para>I'm talking about how church groups and unions persecute <inline font-style="italic">real</inline> refugees.</para></quote><para>I find it difficult to believe that both church groups and unions, who in fact are the champions of the underprivileged in our society, can all of a sudden be twisted around to be those that are responsible for the persecution of those employed under the conditions I talked about. He goes on to say: </para><quote><para>And like many social campaigns backed by our churches, this involves telling untruths.</para></quote><para>And just in case churches object to his first quote he prepares us for the fact that churches obviously tell untruths and are not to be trusted—again, quite a bizarre claim coming from an article whose research is based on a current affairs program. He goes on to say:</para><quote><para>But no untruth is too wild for cause-pushers in the media, egged on by like-minded activists and the union-run Labor Party, which is doing its damnedest to put outworkers in unions and out of work.</para></quote><para>Again, this is a rather bizarre claim that those organisations who seek to represent and defend people in these situations are all of a sudden part of a conspiracy to put them out of work. Mr Bolt has not worked out that there seems to be a mutually exclusive proposition in that last quote. People cannot be put in unions and out of work if the objective is to gain union membership or employment. They cannot happen—they are mutually exclusive—if that is the objective. I seek leave to table the article by Mr Andrew Bolt.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOP</name.id><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name></talker><para>—In conclusion, the arguments promoted by the journalist to debunk this are based purely on an opinion that union organised Labor Party and church groups act in some conspiracy to try to deprive these workers of a future and try to destroy an industry and send it offshore. But the overwhelming evidence prepared by universities—by Dr Cregan—which has stood up to some intellectual scrutiny is supported by a Senate Economics References Committee report in which they undertook a review of the inquiry into outworkers in the garment industry. That committee also took submissions and heard evidence from the likes of the Australian Business Chamber, the Australian Retailers Association and the Council of Textile and Fashion Industries of Australia. As a result of those submissions and many more a number of conclusions were reached by that committee. The report says:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>In its initial report the Committee stated that one of its major concerns was that outworkers were not recognised as employees by the majority of their employers. The Committee is very concerned that, until some agreement between the parties is found that identifies all outworkers as employees, they will continue to be exploited by questionable middlemen.</para></quote><para>The report went on to say:</para><quote><para>... it is important that the federal government take immediate action and show some willingness to protect outworkers from further exploitation.</para></quote><para>These reports are the result of genuine intellectual inquiry and are not something based on the bias shown by some reporters.

New South Wales and Queensland are the most affected states, but all states have regions that are experiencing serious or severe rainfall deficiency. Eighty-two per cent of New South Wales is drought affected, with a further 10 per cent experiencing marginal conditions. Thirty-eight Queensland shires representing 16 per cent of the state are drought declared. The latest Bureau of Meteorology drought statement identifies the impact of poor autumn and early winter rains in central Victoria, south-west Western Australia, eastern South Australia and even parts of our home state, Mr President—Tasmania.</para></talk.start><para>For Australians who live in the major cities drought usually means no more than the appearance on television news of stories featuring dry dams, dusty paddocks and skinny sheep. For farm families the impact of drought is obviously more profound. Over recent months a series of economic indicators have given us some picture of the growing disaster being visited upon the nation. The ABS reported a fall in rural exports for June of about seven per cent in seasonally adjusted terms. Recent livestock figures show cattle slaughter numbers are on the rise as more farmers are sending their stock to the abattoir as feed runs out and the price of grain rises. Increased beef production, combined with the increases in the cost of feed, water and agistment, has weakened the beef market and forced prices lower. Meat and Livestock Australia said today that the beef price slump is in the order of 30 per cent. One of the cruel ironies of drought is that when crops fail and yields fall the price of grain rises. The rising cost of grain is of course an additional burden on those who need affordable grain to feed their stock, including those in intensive industries such as pork and poultry. </para><para>Westpac has predicted that the drought will cost the national economy as much as $5.3 billion and slice 0.8 per cent from growth in gross domestic product. Adverse economic conditions affecting hundreds of thousands of people who live outside the major cities simply cannot be quarantined from the general economy. This is confirmed by the August monetary statement by the Reserve Bank of Australia, which says:</para><quote><para>The large swing in rural incomes that is normally associated with dry conditions can have a noticeable effect on economic growth, largely through lower rural exports, and also indirectly via the flow-on effects of weaker farm incomes to other sectors of the economy.</para></quote><para>Senators will be aware of some foolish comments made by the Treasurer on 24 July dismissing the impact of the drought on the national economy. Following the publication of poor economic data in the days after this, the Treasurer conceded that there had been some impact and then did a major backflip during his photo opportunity in outback Queensland. Regrettably, Mr Costello's ignorance of rural Australia is not uncommon amongst senior members of this government. In support of this point I need do no more than refer senators to Mr Costello's comments on the drought and the government's continuing obsession with the sale of Telstra.</para><para>Statistics alone do not provide the full picture of the drought's impact. They do, however, point to the decisions being forced on farmers by unforgiving climatic conditions. It is not just the drop in income that hits farm families; as income drops, demands from banks and other creditors become more pressing. As farm families stop spending, country businesses feel the squeeze and jobs disappear. The wretched withdrawal of services from country towns accelerates as farms and businesses close, people move away and the fabric of country life diminishes.</para><para>As senators from New South Wales and Queensland will be aware, the Carr and Beattie governments have drought relief packages in place, reflecting the seriousness of the situation confronting those two states. These state based packages include fodder and water subsidies, financial counselling and advice on drought management. New South Wales today announced an extension of its state drought relief package and advised that formal applications for exceptional circumstances relief declarations will be lodged within two weeks. It is likely that Queensland will also soon lodge exceptional circumstances applications. It is therefore now time for the federal government to help farmers who are experiencing the trauma of drought.</para><para>Back in May, Mr Truss presented a proposal to the Primary Industries Ministerial Council advocating changes to the exceptional circumstances program. These changes included a new farm business support program, an enhanced role for the states in assessment, the introduction of relief buffer zones around declared areas and a changed funding formula. It is this last change that has stalled the reform process. Mr Truss seeks to diminish the Commonwealth's share of business support funding while lifting the contributions of the states. All of the states are united in their agreement on the structural changes and equally united in their opposition to Mr Truss's funding changes. The states' position was known to Mr Truss before the Primary Industries Ministerial Council meeting and their position remains unchanged more than three months later.</para><para>Mr Truss failed to build a consensus before the Primary Industries Ministerial Council meeting and has failed to show leadership since. All he has done to try to solve the impasse is issue media statements complaining that no-one is paying any attention to him. He has mostly done this himself, but every now and then John Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, has rushed to his side seeking to bolster the Nationals' credentials and distract attention from his minister's incompetence. Regular listeners to the John Laws program would have heard a ridiculous episode a few weeks ago when Mr Anderson asked Mr Laws to make representations on behalf of his minister next time he was talking to Bob Carr. As you would expect, Mr Laws expressed some incredulity about this request, and not without cause. </para><para>The current national drought strategy was devised by a federal Labor government between 1989 and 1992, but it did not develop the strategy in isolation from the states. The administrative and funding arrangements were agreed between the Commonwealth and all state governments. Labor primary industries ministers John Kerin, Simon Crean and Bob Collins worked constructively with the states; they did not throw a plan on the table and expect someone else to do the hard work for them. This government says it will not consider reform unless the states agree to funding changes. Most alarmingly, Mr Truss has not pledged to assess new applications on existing guidelines while he sorts out the exceptional mess he has made of exceptional circumstances reform. Let us not forget that Mr Truss created the mess and is now trying to shift the blame to the states because he cannot fix it.</para><para>The grip of drought is tightening in New South Wales and Queensland, and exceptional circumstances applications are likely to be lodged soon. I first warned of impending EC applications back in June, but the Commonwealth has done nothing to prepare for their arrival. Farm families do not care, frankly, about Commonwealth-state constitutional arrangements. They do not care about disagreements on funding for the exceptional circumstances program. What they care about is the Commonwealth shouldering its responsibility to help them through difficult times. Nobody expects the government to shelter rural Australia from all the consequences of drought, but farm families do expect that the federal government will do its best to assist when swathes of the country are affected by drought.</para><para>Labor has urged Mr Truss to do more than play politics with the states. Blaming lack of action on disagreement between the Commonwealth and the states is the oldest excuse in Australian politics. Now is not the time for excuses, because applications will soon be lodged with respect to a large area of our continent. The current guidelines were good enough for the Western Australian and Queensland applications in 2001, just months before the federal election, and they must be good enough for farm families waiting for relief now. Rural and regional Australia must not suffer any further.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 10.37 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>3759</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>3759</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission Act—Statement under subsection 122A(3)— Suspension from office of a regional councillor.</para><para>Civil Aviation Act—Civil Aviation Regulations—Airworthiness Directives—Part—</para><para>105, dated 15 [5], 19 [3], 23 [5], 24 [7], 25 [6], 26 [5], 29 [6] and 31 [3] July 2002; and 7 August 2002.</para><para>106, dated 26 [3] and 29 [2] July 2002; and 19 August 2002.</para><para>107, dated 29 [2] July 2002.</para><para>Class Rulings CR 2002/52-CR 2002/55.</para><para>Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act—Notice under paragraphs 45(1)(b) and (f)— Disposal of shares and cessation of membership in Sydney Airports Corporation Limited (SACL).</para><para>Product Ruling PR 2002/108.</para><para>Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act— Request from Minister to APRA under section 230A, dated 1 July 2002.</para><para>Telecommunications Act—Telecommunications Numbering Plan Amendment 2002 (No. 2).</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Indexed Lists of Files</title><page.no>3759</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 30 May 1996, as amended on 3 December 1998:</para><quote><para>Indexed lists of departmental and agency files for the period 1 January to 30 June 2002—Statements of compliance— </para><para>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission.</para><para>Civil Aviation Safety Authority (CASA).</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>3761</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Seasprite Helicopters</title><page.no>3761</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 325)</subtitle><id.no>325</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>3761</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 16 May 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to Seasprite helicopters:</para><para>(1)	Have any payments been made to Kaman in 2002; if so, can the Minister indicate: (a) the type of payment made; (b) the date; and (c) the value of the payment.</para><para>(2)	In terms of the service contract: (a) what payments were made to Kaman; (b) on what date; and (c) what was the value of the payments.</para><para>(3)	The Defence Annual Report 2001-02 notes that 805 Squadron has been `commissioned': (a) when was this squadron commissioned; and (b) have any personnel been assigned to the squadron; if so, how many (or does it exist as a notional unit).</para><para>(4)	Has a facility been established to house the squadron.</para><para>(5)	To date, what has been the full cost of funding the squadron, that is, all personnel costs, administration costs, supplier costs, and facility costs.</para><para>(6)	Is the principal role of this squadron to fly the Seasprite helicopters.</para><para>(7)	When was the Chief Petty Officer assigned to the integrated service team for the Seasprite (as indicated in an answer to a question at Senate estimates hearings).</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>3761</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	As at 31 May 2002, against the prime acquisition contract, there have been 4 earned value payments totalling AUD 14,929,660, 8 milestone payments totalling AUD 1,578,031 and associated price variation payments totalling AUD 4,636,715.80.
