Under subregulation 8A.1(1) a `debtor' can include a Head of an Executive Agency. As part of the procedure for attachment, subregulation 8A.4(1) provides that an Agency Head may appoint a paying officer for the purposes of makingdeductions from a debtor's salary. This regulation does not provide for the situation where the Agency Head is the debtor. The Committee sought advice about the procedures that are to be followed where an Agency Head is in the position of considering whether deductions should be made in relation to his or her own debt. The Minister for Employment and Workplace Relations, the Hon Tony Abbott MP, advised that `an Agency Head can delegate to a person any of the Agency Head's powers or functions' and that `if the circumstance arose, then for reasons of probity, the Agency Head should delegate to another person any decision in respect of their own judgment debt.' The Committee has written to the Minister seeking further advice as to whether the regulations should specifically address this issue. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown</inline> to move on the next day of sitting:</para><quote><para>	(1)	That so much of standing orders be suspended as would prevent this resolution having effect.</para><para>	(2)	That the following bills be restored to the <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> and that consideration of each of the bills be resumed at the stage reached in the last session of the Parliament:</para><para>	Constitution Alteration (Right to Stand for Parliament—Qualification of Members and Candidates) 1998 (No. 2)</para><para>	Convention on Climate Change (Implementation) Bill 1999</para><para>	Customs Amendment (Anti-Radioactive Waste Storage Dump) Bill 1999.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Pursuant to order, the Senate is now adjourned to enable honourable senators to attend a memorial service for the victims of the terrorist attacks in Bali.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 9.32 a.m.</inline></para></interjection></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
