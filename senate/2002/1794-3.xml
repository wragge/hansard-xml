We all remember the good old days of Gareth Evans saying one thing publicly and another privately, and that seems to continue. So no lessons seem to have been learned in terms of addressing the national interest. </para></talk.start><para>Clearly, when ANSTO undertook the original assessment, their brief was to do their very best to identify any problems. The finding that they handed down at the time, one assumes, was provided in all good faith after there had been all necessary and exhaustive scientific tests conducted. That is not a perfection test. In other words, in the real world you can never be absolutely sure of anything. I have not seen the report but one assumes that they were doing their best, on the evidence available to them, to make a considered judgment. To the extent that Senator Forshaw quoted them as saying there were `no major faults' identified, that may still well be the case. </para><para>Once the inspection of the actual excavations at the site commenced, ANSTO noted a possible fault that could be of significance from a seismic perspective. It is not as if they categorically ruled out any possible seismic problem in the first instance and they are categorically saying there is a seismic problem now. They did their best to take all the necessary steps to be satisfied that it was safe but now, presumably with an abundance of caution—and once they actually got onto the site inspection area—they have identified a possible fault that could be of significance. To me it is only prudent behaviour to err on the side of caution and to conduct further inquiries, and that is the process that is being gone through now. It is entirely premature and quite unhelpful to a sensible and non-emotional assessment of the matter for the Labor Party to be scaremongering instead of waiting until the report is handed down.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2527</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

As the Senate knows, in March last year we announced our intention to sell the Sydney Airport Corporation by way of 100 per cent trade sale. The sale process was, as you know, interrupted by the tragic events of September 11 and the collapse of Ansett and was suspended for a period but resumed in March. It was my great pleasure to announce in Sydney this morning, with Deputy Prime Minister Anderson, the successful sale of the Sydney Airport Corporation Ltd to the Southern Cross Airports Corporation. The airport will be sold to the Southern Cross consortium for $5,588,000,000. This price reflects very full and fair value for Sydney airport as a world-class international facility and is the government's 18th successful airport sale.</para></talk.start><para>The sale price of $5.6 billion represents the biggest government trade sale in Australia's history and is also the world's largest ever airport trade sale. It is a great outcome for the Commonwealth, for the Australian aviation sector, for consumers and for taxpayers. The net proceeds, after paying off SACL debt of $4.2 billion, will be used to pay off Commonwealth debt. We have already paid off $61 billion of Labor's debt and we will now pay off another $4.2 billion. The public debt interest savings every year from this sale will be $250 million. That will, of course, help ease the pressure on interest rates and will enable us to spend valuable taxpayers' funds on higher priority areas than paying interest.</para><para>Southern Cross was evaluated as the best bid of the three, according to our comprehensive sale objectives. Sydney airport will, of course, continue to be subject to the legislative and regulatory controls of the Commonwealth. The curfew will continue to apply from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m. The long-term operating plan will continue to apply. Preservation of access for regional airlines will be maintained. No regional airline will be forced away from Sydney airport as a result of this sale. Under the sale conditions, and most importantly, Southern Cross will continue to ensure fair and equitable treatment for all of SACL's very strong, very good work force, including the preservation of accrued entitlements.</para><para>Selling the airport has been an essential part of our overall privatisation program. There is no doubt that Australia's airports are much more competitive now and are providing a much better service to Australian and international customers. I think this airport privatisation experience does show quite conclusively that governments do not need to own assets like airports to effectively regulate, whether it is aviation or any other sector of the economy. In that vein, we do welcome Labor's support for the sale of Sydney airport, but I must say it makes their opposition to the further sale of Telstra even more ridiculous. Service standards at Australian airports are guaranteed through regulation and legislation, as are telecommunication service standards. The government's conflict of interest as the majority Telstra shareholder and the regulator is untenable, and increasingly recognised as such. The Sydney airport privatisation has been an outstanding privatisation success and our next responsibility to Australian taxpayers is to sell the rest of Telstra. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Intergenerational Report</title><page.no>2529</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>2529</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Patterson, the Minister for Health and Ageing.

My question would be, to those on the other side: when will the Labor Party stop peddling the myths that they are peddling about the PBS? When will they actually front up to the fact that you cannot engage in a policy, which they had from 1983 to 1996, of borrowing money from overseas to pay for the PBS—which is exactly what they did. I have to say to you I am thrilled that we have an Intergenerational Report. I got into politics because I was teaching in gerontology and I was very concerned about the issue of an ageing population, and in particular about the baby boom generation and its parents. I never heard senators on the other side speaking about it, but over and over in the chamber I talked about the issue of an ageing population and its issues.</para></talk.start><para>It took this government to actually put into the Charter of Budget Honesty the requirement that every five years a government will report, in a Treasury report, on what will happen—if you keep the levers, if you keep the policies in place—to various parts of the portfolios and what will be the expenses. People can argue around the edges about the assumptions underlying that, but we know that there are going to be ever increasing demands on our health system. In fact, some people have argued that we could consume all that we produce, all of our GDP, on health alone and still not have enough money. Somehow we have to come to a decision—as a community, as a nation—on how much of our national budget will we spend on health and how much of our personal budget will we spend on health.</para><para>The Labor Party has been running around perpetuating all sorts of myths about the PBS. But the fact is that the PBS needs to be sustainable for me to be able to ensure, as health minister, that I have the ability to be able to put onto the PBS medications which are coming through the pipeline which will cost thousands of dollars. We could take the easy line the Labor Party took: borrow money from the next generation. But the whole importance of the Intergenerational Report was to indicate, if we continue to go down the line Labor was going down, the problems that we would inherit and the difficulties we would pass on to the next generation. I have no intention of doing that. Those of us who grew up as baby boomers grew up in an Australia which was prosperous, which gave us all the opportunities we required. That is the sort of Australia we should be passing on to the next generation, not one bogged down with the debt that the Labor Party racked up. We have paid back $61 billion of that debt and now will not have the next generation subjected to the sort of interest rates that they would have been subjected to under Labor.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2529</page.no><name role="metadata">Crowley, Sen Rosemary</name><name role="display">Senator CROWLEY</name><name.id>ZF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question. I am not sure about relevance in answers, but that one just about touched on nothing. I would remind the minister that it is no Labor Party myth we are talking about here but a report from two leading researchers from the Australian National University. Is the minister aware that according to the ANU study the Intergenera-tional Report `paints an unnecessarily grim economic picture'? Does this mean that even the government has lost faith in its so-called good economic management or has the government deliberately painted a picture of gloom to justify savage cuts to the PBS and other essential programs, particularly damaging to the poor and sick in this country? </para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>2530</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Yet another myth from Senator Crowley: we are not cutting spending out of the PBS.

We will not be cutting money out of the PBS. Let me reiterate: we will not be cutting funding out of the PBS. What we are doing is trying to curb the growth of the PBS because it is not sustainable at the rate at which it is growing. The Labor Party went on about Celebrex all day yesterday. Are they going to take Celebrex off? What are they going to do? The Australian public would like to know what they are going to do. All they can do is oppose the measures that we put in place.

We now face moves by the unions to extract $500 per year from non-union members, that is, the 75 per cent of workers that have made a deliberate choice not to belong to a trade union.

Why be responsive to workers if you can grab their money without having to be elected by them? As the New South Wales Labor Premier described it, `This is nothing more than a tax on non-union members and should not go ahead.' Where does the weak leadership of the federal opposition stand on this? Silence. At least the Labor Premier of New South Wales has had the courage to come out and say, `It is a wrong decision and should not go ahead.' But where is the leadership of the federal opposition on this? Absolutely nowhere, because when it comes to the welfare of small business and Australian workers or the trade union movement these people over there will always choose in favour of the trade union movement. The choice now is pay $500 to remain free or pay $250 per year to join the union. How surprising that this stunt should come from the Victorian unions represented by Senator Kim Carr— but thank goodness his namesake, Premier Carr, has seen the light and has rejected this outrageous proposal.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have also had in another area Labor's unfair dismissal legislation. It was rightly called unfair, because it was unfair to small business and unfair to the people who wanted jobs. Now we have the suggestion that there be a limit on overtime. That is the proposal of the ALP and the ACTU, but you simply ask: in small business, if the workers cannot do the overtime, who is going to be doing the overtime? The small business proprietor. Ms Burrow, who is the ACTU President, may like to reflect on the fact that the growth in small business and growth in employment in small business has been in the area of women. Women have been the driving force of growth of small business. As a result, Ms Burrow is now on record as wanting these women to work the extra hours, if they are small business proprietors, and be denied the possibility of earning that extra bit of money in overtime if they are an employee to pay for the car, school fees or indeed a holiday. The unions still dominate the Australian Labor Party and if Mr Simon Crean wants reform in the Australian Labor Party to modernise it I suggest that he modernise his policy on small business. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme</title><page.no>2531</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>2531</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Patterson, Minister for Health and Ageing.

We are committed to transparency within the agreement and, for that reason, we will be releasing at least some part of Australia's request to other countries. However, some other parts will have aspects that are commercial-in-confidence and we may not be in a position to disclose that information. But where possible it would be our wish to disclose that information in order to achieve transparency and to contribute to the community debate that Senator Cherry has spoken about.</para></talk.start><para>It is the view of the government that there are great opportunities for our country in this process. We believe a more open, predictable and transparent international trading environment for services will give us new opportunities in education, tourism, financial services, telecommunications, legal services and other professional services sectors. Therefore, we would very much wish to see this process be successful. Also within the spirit of the last part of Senator Cherry's question, I can inform the Senate that the government is, however, aware that this must not be at a cost, for example, to standards within Australia. Therefore, we have made no commitments on audiovisual services and only limited commitments on health services and various positions in relation to other services. Within that restraint, if we are able to utilise this process to achieve a more open market, that has to be to the economic benefit of Australia and therefore a flow-on benefit to all Australians.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>2532</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

The SIS Act does allow for the minister's discretion as to what is determined as the eligible loss and the amount of the assistance provided, should assistance be granted. In my press release— and, I think, in answer to a previous question in this place—I said that section 232 of the SIS Act very clearly says that I cannot grant assistance in excess of the amount I determine to be the eligible loss and the SIS Act does not prohibit me from granting less than the determined eligible loss. The government agreed to the financial sector inquiry recommendation that any grant be limited to 80 per cent of the eligible loss. The government, as you know, has recently agreed to change this policy to lift the limit to 90c. Despite the amount of discretion allowed to a decision maker under part 23 of the SIS Act, the government has always been open—and indeed transparent—as to the likely amount that would be paid by way of financial assistance.</para></talk.start><para>The limiting of financial assistance to 90 per cent of the determined eligible loss ensures consistency both with international practice and other government assistance programs. Financial assistance schemes operating overseas generally limit the amount paid to either a percentage amount or a monetary ceiling. The United Kingdom Payments Compensation Board limits payments of assistance to 90c of the loss suffered—except where a person is within 10 years of retirement, where 100 per cent is paid. Assistance paid to claimants in the HIH assistance scheme is in general 90 per cent of the claimed loss, with the exception of certain claims. Limiting assistance to 90 per cent limits the moral hazard position of the government. The government does not explicitly guarantee superannuation savings, as Senator Sherry would know. By paying a reduced amount of financial assistance, it ensures that trustees and fund members shoulder at least some responsibility for allowing such losses to occur.</para><para>Senator Sherry has previously made statements about the ALP's lack of support for paying only a proportion of the loss. These statements were generally in response to the announcement of our response to the financial sector inquiry report. But the provisions under the SIS Act which allow for a grant of financial assistance to be not greater than the amount of the eligible loss is an unamended part of the original SIS Act introduced by the Labor government in 1993. The explanatory memorandum to the 1993 SIS bill stated that the provision was self-explanatory, yet it seems that, many years later, I have to explain it to Senator Sherry again. I agree with the explanatory memorandum: the provision is self-explanatory; it is very clear that less than 100 per cent of financial assistance can be granted.

But I can say that it would be diverting, to say the least, if we actually ever heard from the ALP any well thought out superannuation policy on any measure at all, including the safety of superannuation. We had Senator Sherry with his blank piece of paper; and we had Ms Macklin promising a review of all their their policies, including superannuation. All we have had is a knee-jerk reaction—their being dictated to by their union masters. We have 60 per cent of some sort of superannuation policy. All we know is that the unions want to put up the superannuation guarantee to 15 per cent. They want to decouple any connection with work.

The Queensland government in the past has made commitments to the sugar industry in terms of additional water supplies. It should allow costs associated with the scheme to be further spread across all users. Currently, irrigators pay for approximately 96 per cent of the scheme.

Thus, under the water reform process, it is true that the consumer is supposed to pay a real price, because subsidies encourage unsustainable use, but it is not designed to require an unfair price to be paid.

On a previous occasion I said at some length that the process involves, first of all, a lengthy investigation because of the disarray found in the books of Commercial Nominees. The lengthy investigation involves a reconstruction of the books and a reconstruction of the accounts to determine exactly whether there has been either fraud or theft. The scheme does not compensate people for bad investments or even negligent investments and so it is necessary for there to be an independent investigation to establish whether or not there has been fraud or theft that enables a decision to be made under the act. Senator Hogg seems to be oblivious to the role that a regulator plays in this matter. Matters only come to me after these investigations are determined.

Whilst the process might seem rather lengthy, obviously you have to take these books as you find them, and a lengthy period of reconstruction was necessary in order to be able to assist the people who have been impacted very badly by this matter.

It seemed that it was a more appropriate way to exercise that discretion to pay 90 per cent but not to create such a moral hazard that there was never, under any circumstances, any risk to anyone who ever invested in a superannuation fund.

In 1996, the NHMRC issued its <inline font-style="italic">Ethical guidelines on assisted reproductive technology</inline>. These guidelines set the standards for clinical practice in assisted reproductive technology in Australia. The guidelines contain a list of prohibited and unacceptable practices, which include the paying of donors of gametes or embryos beyond reasonable expenses. Such expenses would be minor ones such as travelling costs or parking fees. Further, the NHMRC guidelines stipulate quite clearly that informed decision making is essential, including for donors of gametes and embryos, in order for people to consent to participate in a particular activity.</para><para>In 1999, the NHMRC issued its national statement on ethical conduct in research involving humans. This statement sets out what is involved in obtaining consent. Obtaining consent should involve the provision of detailed information to potential participants and must not be subject to any coercion or to any inducement or influence that could impair the voluntary nature of the participation of the individuals concerned. The NHMRC describes inducement as involving the offer of excessive and inappropriate reward in order to obtain compliance in a particular activity. Such inducements compromise the ability of a potential donor to make a free choice. Large or excessive payments to donors would be seen as an inducement.</para><para>I am not aware of any plans to set up a so-called trade in motherhood by legalising the sale of human tissue; in fact, on 5 April this year the Council of Australian Governments, COAG, decided that commercial trading in human sperm, eggs or embryos should not be allowed. COAG members issued a communique after the meeting on 5 April 2002. They stated that the offer of what they described as `valuable consideration' to any person for donation of his or her gametes or embryos or the gametes or embryos of any other person is an unacceptable practice and should be prohibited in Australia. `Valuable consideration' includes a discount or priority in the provision of a service, but not the disbursement of any reasonable expense incurred in connection with donation of reproductive material. This statement is entirely consistent with the NHMRC's position. The matter of payment for donation of gametes or embryos is included in the Human Cloning and Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 which will be introduced into federal parliament this week. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Nauru: Money Laundering</title><page.no>2537</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>2537</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison.

As the minister would know, Macquarie Island is heritage listed and its colony of elephant seals is noted in the statement of significance as one of the values for which Macquarie Island is listed. Minister, can you advise whether these experiments were referred to the Australian Heritage Commission, as required under section 30 of the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975, prior to the approval for the research being given?

I recall the issue of the elephant seals and Macquarie Island from when I was environment minister and, as I think was said in the question, I banned the branding which was being used as a means of identifying the seals. Certainly, I recall the ethical code which required that no other method be used that in any way harmed the seals. I might say in passing that the research was obviously designed to be for the benefit of the seal colonies. Such research was tracing food stocks to assess whether the food was decreasing, which would therefore have a detrimental effect upon the colony. We did not believe that, in seeking to achieve that worthwhile outcome, it was necessary to harm the seals that we were trying to benefit. I also note some recent reports that other methods of keeping track of seals were causing harm.

We have had every excuse under the sun. But, today, we had a new one—`It wasn't my fault. It was, in actual fact, Joe Hockey, the former minister's fault.' That is the pathetic level we sank to today, to try to cover for this minister's and this government's callous treatment of some workers who have had their money stolen. Their retirement income has been stolen by the directors, Enron-style. And what a pathetic argument we have in return: `Oh, we can't afford moral hazard.' Moral hazard does not apply if your money is stolen, it does not apply if the directors have done a flit to South America. They are in Guatemala, for God's sake. These poor workers have had their money stolen. The whole purpose of the superannuation levy is so that workers can be compensated.</para><para>Senator Watson knows what I am talking about; I will be interested to see if Senator Watson wants to rise in this debate, because he is a supporter of those workers. To be fair to Senator Watson, nobody—not even Senator Sherry—has pursued APRA over its incompetence and its allowing CNAL to go as bad as it did. Senator Watson knows that these workers deserve 100 per cent, and I am hoping that he is prepared to get up and put his money where his mouth is in this case, and put the case for these workers. Because what happened is—the facts are not in dispute—the directors of this fund put money into related party transactions, illegally, and then took the money and ran. They took the money and ran. And this minister has the gall to come in here and talk about moral hazard, to talk about how she is doing them a favour; she is increasing the rate from 80c to 90c. Isn't she wonderful? The legislation allows and Labor's position is 100 per cent. These workers have been robbed. This government will only look after the Prime Minister's brother; it will only look after workers' entitlements if the Prime Minister's brother is a director. `Well, God, let's get him on a few more boards,' we say, because then we might see some workers' entitlements protected.

There are a number of provisions in relation to the SI(S) Act which I will go through in a moment. But, firstly, I must outline that the facts are not entirely as outlined earlier by Senator Conroy. I think it would be unfortunate if the listeners to this debate were misled by what was actually said. It is true that the problems of Commercial Nominees of Australia Limited, CNAL, commenced in about 1997 and they have not improved a lot since then. As a result, there is a deficit of approximately $25 million in the Enhanced Cash Management Trust. As part of that total operation there was more than the cash management trust; there were dozens and dozens of self-managed funds that were administered by CNAL. Some of those funds have also lost money.</para></talk.start><para>The problem with the cash management trust was essentially theft and fraud. For an amount to be paid by the government, the SI(S) Act requires that there be theft or fraud. The theft or fraud appeared to occur very early in the piece rather than in more recent times. This created a difficulty for the government because the money that people lost in more recent times was not lost as a direct result of the theft and fraud—at the time they put their money in, the money was not lost as a direct result of the theft and fraud. However, I think the work of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation satisfied the government and all the other parties that the nature of cash management accounts is that the money goes in there for a short period of time and effectively gets rolled in and rolled out. But the position did not get any better as a consequence of that theft or fraud; in fact, it deteriorated. Had APRA taken action a lot earlier than it did, we would have seen the loss being a lot less than what eventually resulted.</para><para>The SI(S) Act does provide for compensation to be paid, and it can be paid from one of two sources. It can be paid out of consolidated revenue or a levy can be made on other funds within the superannuation industry under the jurisdiction of APRA. We have been quite critical of APRA in previous years because, ostensibly, the CNAL fund had the badge of approval from APRA, which caused a lot of people to put money into that fund. That badge of approval was regarded as almost being tantamount to the Reserve Bank guaranteeing or standing behind the deposits of the banking system. So people from all walks of life lost money, and the consequences for some of those people were very severe. </para><para>I am very proud of the part played by our committee, of which Senator Sherry and Senator Conroy were members, but I think there is too much responsibility being put on Senator Coonan. Under the circumstances, Senator Coonan has acted very quickly since she took on this important portfolio. She called for these reports and, as a result of her action, we now have a resolution to this issue. That is a far cry from what we had three months ago, six months ago or a lot earlier. So a condemnation of the nature we have seen this afternoon is not only unfair but also unjustified and it is certainly very much misplaced. I must acknowledge the role that Senator Coonan has played in the deliberations that I have had with her in bringing this matter to a head and making sure there is justice. I have spoken to a number of people who are affected. To a person, they agreed that their life has been changed enormously as a result of Senator Coonan's action. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>2541</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are some eight million active members of superannuation funds in Australia. By `active' I mean that money is actively going into their superannuation funds. Superannuation for the vast majority of Australians is in fact compulsory. It is to assist them in providing an additional retirement income when they get to retirement. So compensation, when moneys are stolen from their superannuation fund through no fault of the fund members, has a very significant impact on people who are retired or coming up to retirement.

The interesting thing about Commercial Nominees is that this is the first case in 10 years where prima facie theft and fraud under the act have been determined. It is a very important case, and there is a very unusual set of circumstances. The Labor opposition does not suggest that the government provide an absolute guarantee in all circumstances for superannuation funds. What it does suggest is that the SI(S) Act is quite clear in the case of theft and fraud. The act allows the minister to declare full compensation. Why in the event of theft and fraud occurring—which is fortunately a very rare occurrence—should a person coming up to retirement or in retirement have to spend sleepless nights worrying about what they are going to live on if their money has been taken as a result of theft and fraud?</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other compounding fault in this case was the action of APRA. Senator Watson, Liberal senator and Chair of the Senate Select Committee on Superannuation, has pursued APRA very zealously. Senator Watson has acknowledged that, had APRA taken action earlier than it did, the losses would not have been as great. Senator Watson is a very strong critic of the role of APRA in the case of Commercial Nominees. But who set up APRA? Who set up this regulator to protect Australian workers' superannuation? The Liberal government set it up. The Treasurer, Mr Costello, proudly boasts that APRA is the world's greatest regulator. He is on record time and time again saying that APRA is the world's greatest regulator. But certainly in the case of superannuation and Commercial Nominees and certainly in the case of HIH, APRA—the regulator set up by the Liberal Party—has been found wanting. It has not been doing its job, and it has been rightly criticised. So that compounded the problem those Australians who are members of Commercial Nominees had to face.</para><para>The Labor Party does not suggest that in all circumstances where there might be poor investment return there should be compensation, because that is not an issue of theft and fraud. The issue in regard to Commercial Nominees is an issue of theft and fraud. What is important about the Commercial Nominees case is that it is the first prima facie case of theft and fraud in the last 10 years. The minister herself pointed out that it was the Labor Party that inserted special protection in respect of superannuation in the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act. The special protection is that, where prima facie theft and fraud is declared, there can be 100 per cent compensation—in other words, full compensation—in those circumstances. It was the Labor Party that set up that full protection in these circumstances. </para><para>We are not critical of the minister being slow; she has been the minister only since October last year. If any criticism should be handed out—again, I think Senator Watson acknowledged this—it should relate to the poor performance of her predecessor, Mr Hockey. Goodness knows what he was doing in his previous position because the time dragged on and on and on. So we are not critical of Senator Coonan in that regard. What we are critical of is that, having a KPMG report saying prima facie, `Yes, theft and fraud occurred,' the minister did not award full compensation, as she can do under the act—100 per cent compensation. This is not an issue of moral hazard; we are dealing with a very narrow case, a very important case, where 100 per cent compensation— <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>2542</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—We heard Senator Conroy open this debate to take note of answers to questions this afternoon and, as my colleague Senator Watson indicated, he played somewhat fast and loose with the facts regarding this issue of Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd. He did that because his intent was not to deal with the issues but to launch a personal attack on Minister Coonan. The fact is that the major issue here is the $25 million deficit in the cash management trust and, in addition to that, as my colleague has already said, the issue of the shortages of the self-managed funds. The proposition here from the opposition is that Minister Coonan is at fault because she has failed to provide 100 per cent compensation to those people who have suffered losses as a result of the failure of this particular superannuation arrangement. The fact is that the act provides for 100 per cent compensation when 100 per cent of the losses are due to fraud and theft. The clear evidence in this case is that, while fraud and theft were involved in the losses, they did not cause 100 per cent of the losses. There were other matters that caused a portion of the losses realised on the part of these funds: there were poor investment decisions made by the trustees and the managers of the funds which contributed in significant measure to the losses incurred by the investors and the superannuation beneficiaries in these particular funds. That is why the minister has not provided 100 per cent compensation.</para></talk.start><para>However, she has provided 90 per cent compensation. If you looked at the issues and did the analysis, you would see that it is probably fair to say that that is a very generous decision by the minister. If you looked at the balance between the losses caused by fraud and theft and the losses caused by poor investment and poor management decisions, you would see that the losses caused by fraud and theft probably would not reach 90 per cent of the losses. Yet, to be generous to those who have suffered these losses, the minister has indeed come up with the 90 per cent provision which she announced on Friday, 14 June. She announced then that she was going to provide financial assistance to those small superannuation funds under the previous trusteeship of Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd. She is providing that assistance under part 23 of the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act, which provides for compensation to small superannuation funds that have suffered losses in the Enhanced Cash Management Trust.</para><para>It is worth noting that redemptions from that trust were frozen in November 2000 and applications for assistance for these funds were made by Oakbreeze, the replacement trustee, only on 7 February 2002. So the minister can hardly be accused of being tardy in the decision that she has made to provide compensation. The actual request for compensation was only made in February and she has acted very quickly to analyse the situation, to reach a conclusion, to make a decision and to announce that decision last Friday week. As I said, 90 per cent probably covers more than the amount of losses that can be accurately attributed to fraud and theft. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act allows for the minister— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>VJ4</name.id><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Watson</name></talker><para>—It was the catalyst.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name></talker><para>—As my colleague says, it was the catalyst. The SI(S) Act allows for the minister's discretion to determine the eligible loss and amount of assistance provided should that decision be taken. That is exactly the way in which the minister has acted. She has acted properly. She has reached a decision that the amount of loss achieved by fraud and theft is 90 per cent. As I say, if you analyse it closely, you will see that it probably was not that amount. The act specifically states that she cannot grant assistance in excess of the amount that she determines to be the eligible loss. She has made that assessment. She is providing 90 per cent, and I believe that she has acted promptly and generously in this matter. The government agreed to the financial sector inquiry recommendation that any grant be limited to 80 per cent of limited loss. That was the initial decision and she has gone beyond that now. She has persuaded the government to lift that to 90 per cent. So the minister has been active; she has supported the people who have suffered loss in this situation. She has acted with promptness and with due regard to their situation and is only to be commended. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>2543</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the motion to take note of the answers given by the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, in relation to Commercial Nominees of Australia Ltd. When we analyse Senator Chapman's speech, we find that, in truth, he is saying that the minister is substituting her decision for what could otherwise be a decision made by a court or what might be found to be the truth. As I understand it, Senator Chapman says that 90 per cent probably covers more than can be attributed to theft and fraud. So is Senator Chapman standing in the shoes of the fishermen? Is Senator Chapman being judge and jury in determining who is liable and who is not liable—that is, only in supporting what the minister might have considered to come to that conclusion? It is baseless and unfair. What the minister has done in this instance is very unfair. The government have determined that only 90 per cent should be provided. No reasons have been given. There is no basis or justification for that decision other than a vagary about what might be— that is the point: what might be—attributed to theft and fraud.</para></talk.start><para>When you examine the decision, it is a trigger. KPMG, as I understand it, came to the conclusion that there was theft and fraud. That then becomes the trigger and, once the trigger is ignited, 100 per cent should follow. It should not be a discretionary decision by the minister in this instance. If we take Senator Chapman's analysis to its final conclusion, it would allow the minister to determine 10 per cent, 20 per cent, 30 per cent or whatever the minister considers theft and fraud might be able to be attributed to any other issue. We have to really look at the issue itself. We have small superannuation funds. There is the ability for compensation to be given. There is an industry fund to allow those moneys to be expended where there are problems, such as those that have been attributed to Commercial Nominees. </para><para>The issue did take a lot longer than Senator Chapman alleged it took. This issue has been going on, as I understand it, longer than since February this year. Senator Chapman made a huge omission: he did not tell us all of the time that it has taken for this matter to come to a conclusion. In effect, in omitting some important and vital information to this chamber, he has not been able to demonstrate his arguments successfully. He has said, in support of Senator Coonan, that she acted quickly. That remains in some doubt in my mind as the government have not been quick at all in resolving the Commercial Nominees matter. That is clear. We then find that not only are they not quick in resolving that matter but only 90 per cent of the resolution is put forward. So the people out there who are in these small funds will then say, `What fairness do you get out of this government?' There is an industry levy fund. It underwrites small superannuation funds. It allows for them to be compensated for the loss they have suffered, but we find that that is not what the government consider is a fair thing. They decide what they think is a fair thing and, in this instance, they have said that that is only 90 per cent. There is no reason for limiting the compensation—none at all. </para><para>When we look at what happened under HIH, we find that 100 per cent was provided. Why? That is a question that perhaps Senator Chapman and Senator Watson can help us with. I would surely like to hear their answer in relation to that. Perhaps they can explain why there is a difference. We can also see the regulators' hands all over this in regard to both Commercial Nominees and HIH. Surely, it is about time that the government took the initiative and decided that they needed to improve their management, their handling and the way they were going to address APRA. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>General Agreement on Trade in Services</title><page.no>2544</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>2544</page.no><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator CHERRY</name><name.id>00A9C</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Cherry today relating to the General Agreement on Trade in Services.</para></motion><para>The General Agreement on Trade in Services, an agreement with such potential significant effects across a wide range of Australian services, has had incredibly little public debate in Australia.

When you start talking about the liberalisation worldwide of drinking water, you are talking about a significant potential transfer of income from the Third World to the First World. I quote the concerns of Oxfam-Community Aid Abroad which has significantly criticised the push by the European Union to include drinking water into the GATS. It makes the point that the EU has clearly called for water for human use to be included in the liberalisation time frame. This is probably due to the fact that European companies dominate global markets in this sector. It has pointed out that in many of the places where water has been deregulated in the Third World there have been very substantial transfers of income from the poorest part of the community to other parts of the community.</para><para>There is a whole range of groups within Australia who are expressing concern about where Australia will line up on the General Agreement on Trade in Services. The Teachers Union, for example, and its international body, has expressed concern about whether education will be opened up and about whether the Australian government will be required to provide similar access to markets, subsidies and regulation for foreign competitors or foreign owned corporations seeking to compete against the Australian public education system.</para><para>This is because the definition in the GATS of what is a government service is somewhat limited. It allows a service to be declared to be capable of being subject to the GATS unless it is delivered exclusively by a government on a totally non-commercial basis. There was a report by the Canadian British Columbian government which actually looked at this government authority exclusion. It found it had been defined very narrowly. Because of the wording of the exclusion, only a small subset of services—those provided by completely non-commercial absolute monopolies—appeared to be protected by the exclusion. This means the Australian government will need to list virtually every single government service and every single activity of government as an exclusion from the GATS. We need to know that they will do that. We have not been told that they will; we need to know that they will. </para><para>The Doctors Reform Society is another Australian group which has come out and expressed concern not just about the impact on the public health system but about the regulation of professions. That is because when you look back at the GATS it requires that regulation of professions must be `not more burdensome than necessary to ensure the quality of the service'. Where does that leave the regulation of professions such as medicine and law and a range of other areas in this country? Are we supposed to actually start opening up the regulation of professions to be as least trade restrictive as possible on the basis that they are not burdensome? This opens up a whole range of areas of significant government regulation to scrutiny by the World Trade Organisation under an agreement that will make national competition policy look like a teddy bear's picnic. </para><para>I am very pleased that the minister in the answer to my question did in fact say that the government would be releasing the information on the request. It needs to be done now. The community needs to be fully engaged on what the government intends to do on the GATS to make sure that we have all the answers on exactly what it is going to mean for Australian services, particularly the provision of public services, before we sign off.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CHRISTMAS ISLAND: PHOSPHATE MINING</title><type>Miscellaneous</type><page.no>2545</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Return to Order</title><page.no>2545</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>2545</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I would like to read a brief interim response to the Senate return to order motion No. 90, moved by Senator Bartlett.

When the federal Leader of the Opposition, Mr Crean, received a full briefing from the People Smuggling Task Force prior to coming to a decision on this issue, the bureaucrats involved in that briefing were unable to answer two simple and specific questions put to them by Mr Crean. The first question was: can they give an assurance that excising— that is, cutting out islands off the Australian coast—will prevent or deter boat arrivals on the mainland? They could give no such assurance. The second question was: how will this specific measure of excising islands— cutting out islands from Australia—prevent further boat departures from Indonesia? They said that it would not. </para></talk.start></continue><para>We believe these are the real facts of the government's so-called policy, as admitted by its bureaucrats. The minister for immigration agrees that those questions were asked and he agrees that the assurances that Labor sought could not be given. The minister knows full well what his advisers told Labor, that the most effective option to stop people smugglers is to stop the boats departing. The minister therefore agrees the legislation he is seeking will not achieve the goals he claims to be pursuing. Therefore, it is very simple: Labor believes that the government is not looking for a solution, that it is just playing politics—very divisive politics. If we had agreed to the government's regulation this week they would not have stopped playing this game of politics. By now they would be bringing forward legislation to cut out bits of Australia's mainland. Labor has been holding firm and has stopped the Howard Liberal government starting on its plan to rub out bits of Australia's mainland. </para><para>The Labor Party are totally committed to strong border protection. We believe that the legislation that was to have been presented to the Senate, but that I believe will not now be considered, following the reference of these matters to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee, would not have achieved this. Simply put: you do not protect your borders by surrendering them. You do not protect your borders by handing over bits of your country to the people smugglers. That is just running up the white flag and surrendering Australia's national sovereignty. And that is appeasing people smugglers and inviting them to head for the mainland. The Prime Minister, Mr Howard, is saying he will decide which bits of Australia to hand over to people smugglers and how much will be handed over each time. Mr Howard is giving away, cutting out, more and more of Australia as time goes on. What will be next? My home state of Tasmania? King Island, that I was visiting last week? What will be next? We think that these issues are so important that they need to be dealt with in a bipartisan way and we think border security is too important to become a political plaything of the current government.</para><para>The reason this bill was proposed to be before us today was to give the government the opportunity to squeeze political advantage out of it and to prepare the way for a double dissolution election on so-called border security. What they want to have in the kit bag is the opportunity to rerun the 2001 election campaign, which, as we all know, was conducted on these themes and was built on exploiting the intersection between race and fear. This is fertile ground politically— the Liberal government has proved that. But exploiting it, and exploiting it continuously, inevitably leads to self-destruction, the loss of national confidence and a nation that turns inward and is paralysed by fear. It is also political opportunism to characterise Labor as soft on border security. Nothing could be further from the truth. When this nation truly faced a border security threat in World War II, when it truly faced the threat of invasion, it turned to Labor to lead it, and Labor delivered. It repudiated the current Prime Minister, Mr Howard's, mentor—the creator of the party that currently holds the government benches. The government is a pretender in this area, and the bill that is to be referred off is part of that pretence.</para><para>I will go briefly to how ineffective this bill would be. The government is standing here somehow pretending that excision—cutting out bits of Australia—would stop people-smuggling. It is trying to create the image that so-called excision is somehow a stop sign. How on earth does that follow? Determined people would still come in. If a part of the nation is excised and cut out, and if they think that they would be advantaged by going that bit further to avoid the cut out pieces, then why would they simply not go to the mainland of Australia? The government has just run up a flag and said, `Well, that's too hard. We will have the so-called Pacific solution, where we will spend hundreds of millions of dollars in places like Nauru'— and we touched on that in question time today.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name></talker><para>—On a point of order, Madam Deputy President: I do not wish to intervene on Senator Sherry's speech too much but, as you know, this is an unusual compliment we are paying to Senator Sherry to allow him to speak.

I thought Senator Sherry was going to make a few very short remarks by leave. I was going to make some short remarks in response. It is one way of having a debate; it is not the ideal way. The standing orders envisage that, if formality cannot be granted, there are two options: one is to suspend standing orders, which is time consuming and inefficient; the other is for it to drop down to, I think, item number 14, where it can be done by way of a debate. The coalition have given the opposition a chance to make some comments. I hope that, if we are now going to say it is not formal, which we will do, we do not suspend standing orders. It will then come up at item 14, and Senator Sherry will conclude any remarks at that stage.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—It has already been granted formality.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—In that case, I will make my remarks as brief as possible. The government will be opposing the motion. We believe that this legislation is important. We do not share the rather strange and illogical position the opposition seems to be trying to develop that there is one solution to the problem of illegal boat people coming to Australia's shores—be that the mainland, or one of those many offshore islands or reefs. We believe that it takes a number of measures. We do not believe you can have a one-line policy saying that the solution is to go to Indonesia and tell the boats to stop leaving that country. It is an interesting concept. If Australia has lots of islands, then certainly the archipelago of Indonesia has many more. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The reality is that the Australian government has been working very closely across a number of fronts and, in many cases, in consultation and cooperation with the Indonesian government and many other jurisdictions to do just what the Labor Party says we should do. The fact is that we are doing it already. We are taking a range of measures. The excision of parts of Australian territory—as we did with Ashmore Reef, Christmas Island, the Cartier Islands and the Cocos Islands—has been part of a policy which to date has been more successful than previous policies. It is not a policy in itself. It is part of a policy, one particular strategy. The excision of these other islands is part of an integrated policy which is to send a clear signal to people smugglers and others who seek to come to our country illegally that: `We're going to make it a bit harder you.' </para><para>We are not—as Senator Sherry and other spokesmen for the opposition parties would have you believe—somehow getting rid of bits of Australia, or giving away our coastline or our sovereignty.

Only a week ago, the `opposition parties'—as the Democrats are becoming joined at the hip to the Australian Labor Party they are now being described by the gallery as the `opposition parties'; it is becoming a new term in Australian politics— sought to disallow, successfully as it turned out, regulations that had the effects of this legislation. The government at that time was obviously not pleased with the outcome. But no lesser person than Senator Faulkner, the Leader of the Opposition in this place, in that debate, as reported in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard </inline>on 18 June said: </para><quote><para>... put principle above politics, to do the right thing and have a debate on the substantive issues.</para></quote><para>That was only a few days ago.

That is a classic Labor tactic: if you do not want to deal with something, have a vote on something or fly your colours up the mast, send it off to a committee. </para><para>It is not as though these issues have not been canvassed publicly, by committees or ad nauseam by the parliament before. It is not a case of accountability of the Senate or of the government to the Senate, or genuine scrutiny of a bill. All of these issues have been canvassed. Mr Crean has had a briefing from the task force, as Senator Sherry said by leave in his statement. It is not part of accountability processes which we respect and have built in this place into one of the great legislative institutions of mankind.

It is a Labor Party political ploy—with the support of Senator Faulkner's `coalition in opposition party' colleagues—to frustrate the government's program and, more importantly, its strong commitment to border protection.

I think Senator Sherry's contribution was more a debate on why the <inline ref="R1578">Migration Legislation Amendment (Further Border Protection Measures) Bill 2002</inline> was bad rather than why it should go to a committee and Senator Campbell's was more about why the ALP is bad rather than why the bill should go to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I would like to outline why it is important that it go to the committee. It is important because it is not just the bill that is going; it is a lot of related issues not the least of which is whether we might be breaching our international obligations under this legislation—which is a very real possibility—as well as other aspects.</para></talk.start><para>Let me remind the Senate that this is not an issue that has had a lot of scrutiny and debate. The initial excision of the first few islands by legislation last year was done without any reference to a committee, with a truncated guillotine debate and with no opportunity to explore these issues. The regulations were brought in without any consultation whatsoever. So this is the first time the Senate has had a chance to look at the actual issue of excising parts of Australia for the purposes of the Migration Act, and I think it is long overdue.</para><para>I welcome that opportunity and I welcome this motion by the Labor Party to do that and to look at the broader questions that are involved that have not been examined by the Senate to date. I do not think that sending it to a committee to report back in the next sitting week, which is in August, is sending it to the never-never. I am sure that Senator Mason would be horrified to hear the Legal and Constitution References Committee called the never-never. It is a very important committee that does a great job and works with people across parties in a constructive way. This will provide a great opportunity for these issues to get the scrutiny they deserve. </para><para>I should also counter some of the distortions in Senator Campbell's statements, because it needs to be done every time these falsehoods are put forward. It is not illegal— it never has been—to seek protection from persecution, even though you might enter a country without authorisation to seek that protection. If it was illegal then the Jews would never have got out of Germany and plenty of other people would have never been able to get refuge. It is not jumping the queue. Many of the people that come here on boats from Indonesia have actually gone through the proper process, have applied to the UNHCR, have been assessed as refugees and still cannot get settlement. Even though they have been assessed as refugees they cannot get protection, so they have no option. They are not queue jumpers; they are people who are simply seeking safety and guaranteed protection from being sent back to face persecution. </para><para>As for the Democrats being an opposition party, Senator Campbell may or may not be aware but I think we have been an opposition party now for nearly 25 years—perpetual opposition. We are opposed to some of the things the government does and some of the things the Labor Party does. We will support anything from anywhere that we think is positive, oppose anything that we think is negative and constructively engage in trying to amend anything that is amendable. That is our role, it has always been our role and it is one that we perform more effectively than any other smaller party in Australia's history. We are celebrating our 25 years of existence this year, which will demonstrate our record in that regard. It might be occasionally irritating being in permanent opposition, but that is our role and I do not see any strange reason why that should be a problem for the government. It should have noticed that after 25 years we are still hanging around and are not necessarily going away.</para><para>We support this motion. It is a positive motion. The Democrats will be contributing constructively to the committee. We are not just sending it off so that we do not have to talk about it. It will come back the next sitting week anyway, should the government choose to do that. At least if we debate it then, we will do so from a far more informed position than we have been able to do to date.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>2551</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I think that referring these border protection measures to the Legal and Constitutional References Committee is the right thing to do. It interests me that Senator Campbell and the government do not want this to be referred to a committee and that they say that this has had plenty of public debate and plenty of discussion. I am not aware of any significant debate. I do not know what the government thinks it now knows that it did not know back when we started the process of debating this issue when the first border protection measures were put in place with the excision of Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands.</para></talk.start><para>I do not think the government has any new information that would cause it to want to move to bring the line further south. Why 23 degrees south latitude on the Western Australian side and 12 degrees on the east coast is the relevant line, who knows? I think we do need to have some discussion about it and we do need to have a proper inquiry into whether or not this measure is suitable. My personal view is that it will probably cause more problems than it will solve. As I said during the discussion previously, it does not change the environmental problems that may ultimately be caused by the straight-out introduction of the regulations that the government proposed and by the legislation it now proposes. So I do support the matter being sent to a committee, and I think it will be an interesting inquiry.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>2551</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I am particularly pleased that the parameters of this inquiry, if the motion does pass the vote we are about to have, will include whether the thousand islands legislation is consistent with Australia's international obligations and what the financial impact on the Commonwealth will be.

Part (a) seeks to look into the capacity of the Australian telecommunications network to deliver services to all Australians, particularly in regional and rural areas. Part (b) talks about the capacity of the network to provide all Australians with reasonable, comparable and equitable access to broadband services, or the Internet, as most of us know it as. Part (c) relates to current investment patterns and future investment requirements and part (d) is about regulatory and other measures which might be required to bring the Australian telecommunications network up to an adequate level to ensure that all Australians may obtain access to adequate telecommunications services.</para><para>The amendment that the government is moving is to add a new part (e) which would then allow the committee to inquire into whether proposals to structurally separate Telstra into a network company and a services company would enhance the ability of the telecommunications industry to deliver adequate services to all Australians. Then it would renumber the current part (e) as part (f). The effect of the government amendment is to allow the committee that is seeking to do an inquiry into Telstra's service provision—obviously a matter the government has taken very seriously over the past six years— to also subject to the scrutiny of that committee a proposal which has been put forward by the opposition spokesman on telecommunications, Mr Tanner, in relation to splitting Telstra up—having one part of it basically own and run the network and another part of it run the services part. I therefore move the amendment in those terms and speak briefly to that.</para><para>This reference of a committee is quite interesting. Two years ago, the coalition appointed an inquiry into telecommunications services headed by Mr Besley. I do not think anyone would argue with the fact that Mr Besley ran a very competent inquiry, with very good people on that committee. The Labor Party came out and attacked it. When we established that inquiry, the shadow minister, Stephen Smith, said:</para><quote><para>... you can have absolutely no confidence that this report can be regarded as an objective, impartial assessment of Telstra's service levels.</para></quote><para>Labor attacked that inquiry, which was set up by independent, eminent Australians who were sent out to effectively do a report card on the success of those investments in providing better telecommunications, particularly for people in regional and remote Australia, and to give the government an independent assessment of just how successful those programs had or had not been.</para><para>I had the great privilege to be in the portfolio of communications and IT at the time that Mr Besley's committee reported. Quite clearly, Mr Besley found some significant gaps in service delivery in some parts of Australia. The government had already committed close to $1 billion to upgrading particularly regional and rural telecommunications infrastructure through a range of programs, many of them world first programs. For example, there was the untimed local call tender, where we effectively offered anyone living in the outer extended zones— something like 42,000 households—free installation of a satellite dish providing them up to a minimum of 64 kilobits per second, and faster in some places. That delivered symmetrical high speed Internet through satellite to 80 per cent of the Australian mainland. It was a significant program. I might say—without bragging on the government's behalf, because all Australians should be proud of the program—that I discussed the program with leading policy makers in Washington when I was there a few weeks ago. They thought it was a fantastic program, to offer people in the most remote parts of the country high speed Internet with free installation and comparable charges to what you or I, Mr Acting Deputy President, might pay in metropolitan parts of Australia. It is a phenomenal program. Telstra, who won the tender to provide that program, informed me very recently, when I had to send more information on this to people in the United States who had sought information on it, that the program has had a pick-up rate of in excess of 30 per cent. It is a massive rollout of high speed Internet into some of the most remote parts of our planet. </para><para>Although we will oppose this reference, because we think it is politically motivated, the members of the committee that make this inquiry will be astounded by the incredible increase in communications services that has occurred as a result of this government's commitment—a commitment of very intense policy work but most importantly backed up by over $1 billion worth of investment. When Mr Besley made his report he had been attacked unmercifully by Stephen Smith and the Australian Labor Party generally for being `fatally politically compromised'. They said that the report `would not be free from political interference' and that it was a `political stunt' that `created a perception of a clear conflict of interest'. These were all the claims that Labor made about the Besley inquiry. Mr Besley reported, and we said, `Okay, we have not been comprehensive enough in our investments.' We then announced some $167 million more of investment into further upgrading services. Those investments are being made throughout the last few months and throughout this year.</para><para>It is a matter of some hypocrisy that there is now this proposal from Labor, which criticised an independent committee a couple of years ago. The shadow minister, Mr Tanner, in the CEPU newsletter—and I guess that shows where his real audience is—dated 21 June 2002, just a few days ago, said:</para><quote><para>... the quality and extent of telecommunications services in rural and regional Australia is still very inadequate ... and Telstra's network is deteriorating.</para></quote><para>You have the Labor Party—with the help of the Australian Democrats—setting up an inquiry into telecommunications services, and they have already made the decision on what the result is going to be. This is the party that say Mr Besley is biased and `fatally politically compromised'. Not content with criticising an eminent Australian businessperson who did a very effective job in measuring Australia's performance two years ago, they have decided—for what could only be regarded as cheap political purposes—to set up their own inquiry, having already decided on 21 June 2002 that the services are `still very inadequate' and that `Telstra's network is deteriorating'. That is something that I am sure the committee will find to be false. I guess, if it serves any purpose, it will prove that their shadow minister does not know what he is talking about—but that would be nothing unusual.</para><para>The hypocrisy will be compounded. I hope the Democrats will agree that, if you are going to have an inquiry that will not be tainted as politically motivated from the start, it would be fair—when you are out there talking to everyone about the options for telecommunications in Australia—to have the option on the table from the alternative government, the opposition, of structurally separating Telstra, as a term of reference. If you were fair dinkum about the policy, if you were fair dinkum about having a policy debate about the future of telecommunications—as it is a vital service—you would do that. The government have put— and I do not think anyone would criticise us for this, even though you could criticise the outcome—enormous policy time and effort into trying to improve it. I am sure members opposite would say, `You could have done it better; you could have done it differently,' and that is what debate is about. But, if you are going to have a debate, if you are going to have a committee, why wouldn't you put all of the options on the table? What have Mr Tanner and the parts of the Labor Party who actually support him on this—others do not, and I guess it is fair to have factional division within a party on policy and other grounds—got to hide in having the community come forward and debate structural separation? </para><para>Obviously, Labor will not do that. But I say to Senator Allison—who will speak on this motion shortly—that I do not think the Democrats need to be part of defending Labor's sensitivities, which I do not understand, in relation to this. If you genuinely want to focus on improving telecommunications services, if you want to look at the regulatory regime, if you want to look at the quality of service in basic telephony, mobile telephony and Internet based telephony and in broadband, have a look at structural separation. Let us put the Labor Party proposal under the microscope. I can see why Labor may be sensitive about it—I do not understand why they are, but I can see that they may be slightly sensitive—but I do not see why the Democrats would not say, `Let's support the government's amendments and allow the committee to have a broader terms of reference,' rather than narrow them for what seem to me at least to be politically motivated reasons. With those words, I commend the government's amendment to the motion moved by Senators Mackay and Allison for this reference.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>2558</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As joint mover of the motion, I would like to make some comments about the amendment put up by the government. First of all, I would like to correct the minister when he says that this is politically motivated; it is not. It is also not a repetition or a duplication of the Besley inquiry; it has quite different terms of reference. I think that, and have thought for some time, there is value in us looking at the network and examining its adequacy. If we are to believe the many complaints made about the system and its ongoing maintenance then it is a serious and nationally significant matter for the Senate to consider.</para></talk.start><para>One of the more important aspects of this reference is the question of accessibility to broadband services. No matter what the minister suggests by way of adequacy of services, you cannot argue that the prospect of broadband and Internet online services reaching even the majority of Australians over the next short period of time is likely. We certainly do not have a plan from the government as to how that might happen. I reject the minister's claims that this is not necessary or that there is any motivation other than a desire to see whether Australians can look forward to a telecommunications environment which is second to none in the world. I point out that Australia lags behind many other countries, especially countries like Canada, which can be compared to Australia for the purposes of assessing the take-up and the affordability of online services.</para><para>We will not be supporting this amendment. The government talks about political motivation, but that is what is in this amendment. The Democrats will not support it if for no other reason than it does not talk about proposals. The minister admits that this is about the ALP's `proposal', but as I understand it, that was a discussion paper with a range of options. If the government wants to put up a proposal then it ought to come back to the Senate and ask the Senate to examine that proposal, and I am sure we would be very willing to do that. But, in the absence of a proposal from the government, I do not think it is appropriate for us to look at anything the ALP may have said, proposed or suggested in recent times. Perhaps this warrants a separate inquiry of its own, but it certainly should not be tacked onto the inquiry which has been drafted already and put before the Senate. It would take this inquiry in a completely different direction, and that is not something that we support.</para><para>As I said, Senator Campbell, if you have a proposal you think is of use to the government then we would be willing to examine it. However, the government has many resources available to it, including perhaps an extension of the Besley inquiry if that is seen to be such an independent and worthy vehicle for having examined service levels in the past. By all means, why not refer this to the Besley inquiry? But you need a proposal before you can have an inquiry into a proposal. I will leave my remarks at that and indicate that the Democrats will not be supporting this amendment but we support the reference. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>2559</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In conclusion, I would like to concur with the remarks of my colleague Senator Allison and indicate that I would have expected Senator Alston to be here. I understand that Senator Ian Campbell is doing this on behalf of Senator Alston, but Senator Alston is not here and that is a shame. Let us not try to dress this up as anything other than what it is—a total political stunt on behalf of Minister Alston. As Senator Allison indicated, if the government were serious about having a Senate inquiry, government members on the committee that we belong to would have initiated an inquiry into the state of the network in Australia. They did not. It was left up to the Labor Party and the Democrats, who worked very hard in relation to the terms of reference, to get a substantial inquiry which will allow us to consult with people adequately in the metropolitan areas and the regions.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Allison mentioned the Besley inquiry. That is a very interesting issue. I would say this to the government: if they regard our inquiry as so abhorrent and so politically motivated—here is Senator Alston now—where is this government's commitment to Besley mark 2? We recently had Senator Boswell letting the cat out of the bag on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program. He indicated that he thought everything was fine in the regions now. He indicated that he thought there was equity in relation to service access. He indicated on behalf of the National Party that he thought it was okay to proceed with the sale of the remainder of Telstra. Whoops! What happened that week? Absolute furore in the National Party room—absolute furore—and we had Senator Boswell extremely embarrassed, egg all over his face, backing off from this commitment that he made because of the backbench furore in relation to it. What was the Liberal Party's response? The Liberal Party's response, when told by a number of National Party backbenchers that we need a further inquiry, was no commitment to a second Besley inquiry. Senator Campbell may well be right in relation to the Besley inquiry. We have our own views about what it did and did not look at, but it is better than nothing and the government has not even committed to a second Besley inquiry. All we get is some mealy-mouthed rubbish from the Deputy Prime Minister and the House of Representatives about establishing benchmarks. Talk about piggybacking on the work of other people. Rather than the minister himself saying, `Look, there is no need for a Senate inquiry because I am recommitting here today to the Besley inquiry, at least to shut up my National Party backbenchers,' what do we do? We have what is clearly a political stunt on the back of the hard work that has been done by Labor Party and Democrat senators. Let us not try to dress it up as anything other than that.</para><para>Who is the government going to ask before they proceed, I think more expeditiously than not, with Telstra 3? Who is the government going to consult? I can tell the Senate because the government have told us. They are going to talk to their—guess who?— backbench. Their backbench is going to be the arbiter of whether regional Australians have access to service delivery and telecommunications that are equal to those enjoyed by people in metropolitan areas— hardly, I would have thought, a group of people that has no particular allegiance. We are dealing with members of a political party. So they will consult with their backbench, and once the backbench is happy then that is fine. That may be well and good, but we have already had Senator Boswell on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program saying as far as he is concerned equity exists so we may as well proceed with the remainder of the sale of Telstra.</para><para>I will be a lot quicker than I otherwise might have been. This is barely worth talking about and I think it is an extremely ordinary effort from the minister, Senator Alston, who was here very briefly but has run out of the chamber. I had hoped for some remarks on it, but we are not getting any. This is a total stunt. We say to the government: if you are serious in consulting with the Australian people the least you can do is recommit to having a second Besley inquiry. We think that even that is deficient because we think that there are major areas that Besley did not look into, including the issue of hundreds of thousands of faults that exist on the network, the parlous state of the network and the fact that it has been totally underfunded. But that is fine: if this government is going to go off and talk to its backbench and that will be the final arbiter, on its own head be it. This is nothing more than a political stunt. The Democrats and the Labor Party have spent months in organising these terms of reference. We think it is going to be an excellent inquiry. We think it fills the gap that is currently there in the absence of the government doing absolutely nothing on consulting on Telstra. I commend the Democrats for working with the Labor Party and together we brought forward an excellent proposal. I personally look forward to the inquiry. I think it is going to be a lot easier getting information through this inquiry than through a tortuous estimates process with Telstra obfuscating every single step of the way, which we normally have to put up with. It is becoming increasingly politicised, might I say—a fact which has been recently highlighted by Mr Tanner—and, of course, we now have Telstra threatening to sue Mr Tanner for the temerity to indicate that Telstra might be `a little bit political' in its comments in Senate estimates. I do not think you would have to be Einstein to agree with that one. This is just a stunt. What we are after, as Senator Allison has indicated, is a solid, genuine inquiry. We will go out, we will make an assessment about the services in regional Australia and metropolitan Australia and we will consult with the Australian people in the absence of any government initiative to do that. </para><para>Question negatived.</para><para>Original question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [NO. 2]</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>2560</page.no><id.no>R1517</id.no><cognate><cognateinfo><title>SUPPRESSION OF THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1485</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>CRIMINAL CODE AMENDMENT (SUPPRESSION OF TERRORIST BOMBINGS) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1487</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>BORDER SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1514</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate><cognate><cognateinfo><title>TELECOMMUNICATIONS INTERCEPTION LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><id.no>R1481</id.no></cognateinfo></cognate></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>2560</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 24 June.</para><para><inline ref="R1517">SECURITY LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (TERRORISM) BILL 2002 [No. 2]</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>—The committee is considering the <inline ref="R1517">Security Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> and amendment (5), sheet 2512, revised 2, moved by Senator Brown.

I apologise to the committee for that, but we are right on track here at the moment. I should foreshadow that I will be looking at amendment (5) and the committee's deliberation on that. If the committee will give me a moment, I will get amendment (1) in front of me. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>2561</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—While Senator Brown is doing that, I will just bring this into focus. Yesterday, government amendments (5) and (8) were postponed, as was Democrat amendment (2). These amendments dealt with the definition of a terrorist act. As I understand it, Greens amendment (1)—which is what Senator Brown is looking at at the moment—will deal with the same issue; that is, the question of the terrorist act involving serious harm to a person. To refresh people's memories, yesterday Senator Brown said to me, `This involves serious harm to a person; that does not involve harm to anyone else. Does it include a case where someone could be fasting and intent on harming themselves by fasting?' The government is in a position to proceed with its amendments (5) and (8). I have looked at the situation and I can advise the chamber that there are a number of reasons that the legislation is framed as it is, and I can outline that to the chamber now.</para></talk.start><para>The government will oppose the amendment which is about to be moved by the Greens, the effect of which would be to exclude serious harm that a person causes to themselves from the definition of `terrorist act'. As I say, there are a number of reasons for this. Violent suicide in a public place that is calculated to coerce the government or intimidate the public can be properly considered a terrorist act in some cases, and I referred to that yesterday in relation to a suicide bomber. Indeed, acts involving suicide have a long history as an intimidatory form of violence and terrorism. More broadly, a key point I bring to the chamber's attention is that the concept of serious harm is commonly used in criminal offences without specifically excluding harm to oneself. In other words, in other parts of the criminal law you do find provisions which are similar to this which involve serious harm to a person, which could include self-harm. That is a standard approach in Commonwealth and state criminal offences.</para><para>I also note that, in considering the issues of intimidation and coercion in the context of the definition of `terrorist act', the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee considered that the definition should follow the United Kingdom legislation. In relation to this serious harm element, the approach in the bill follows the United Kingdom definition in not excluding serious harm caused by a person to themselves. Whether a case involving self-harm would be prosecuted would depend on whether the elements of the offence were present and on the prosecution policy of the Commonwealth, as with other offences involving concepts of harm. The government is concerned not to leave this as a loophole in the legislation, which it believes the Greens amendment would do. </para><para>There is a difference between this part and the endangering of life. I note that this limb is different to the limb relating to endangering a person's life, which does exclude danger to oneself. There are legitimate cases where creating danger to oneself is justified; for example, in saving another person. So those are the reasons for the government maintaining its position on amendments (5) and (8). I think that really does cover the field in relation to government amendments (5) and (8), Democrat amendment (2) and Greens amendment (1). If we now deal with Greens amendment (1), we can then go back to those other amendments which I have covered.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>2561</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move Greens amendment (1) on sheet 2561:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Schedule 1, item 3, page 7 (line 28), amendment to paragraph 100.1(2)(a) as amended, after “person” add “other than the person taking the action; or”.</para></quote><para>The Minister for Justice and Customs avoided the central point at issue here, which I outlined last night, which is protest by such measures as fasting.

This bill talks about terrorism coming from people who have, amongst other things, political aims in their actions. This particular part of the legislation includes self-harm as being a coercive or intimidatory action on a government, with a political purpose. That would snare Gandhi. It would snare the suffragettes. We cannot leave on the books the situation where people who are prepared to take their beliefs to fasting or to some other form of self-threat can be declared terrorists and face life imprisonment as a result of that. This was the proposition I put to the minister last night. I expected to have an answer today or some alternative form of dealing with it, but he has avoided it altogether. I ask other members of the committee to consider the ramifications of that. Of course the minister will say, `We would not interpret it that way.' Legislation should not allow it to be interpreted that way. Future governments, if given the opportunity, somewhere down the line will interpret this legislation to use it against political opponents. I remind the committee that again last night people from all parties and the crossbench referred to the parliament's proclivity for banning the Communist Party—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—In 1951. Thank you, Senator Ray. But when this was put to a referendum the people of Australia said no, even though it was just after the Korean War. They said no because the banning of an organisation like that goes so strongly against an open society, a democratic society, a society where freedom is to the fore.</para></talk.start></continue><para>But here we have a legislative measure, a bill, which is moving to do precisely what the people of Australia 50 years ago said parliament should not do, and it is going a lot further than that. In this particular clause it is saying, `We are going to put the threat of peaceful protesters using time honoured methods being labelled terrorists by the government of the day.' This should not be left open to government interpretation and, if that is where it has to be left, it should be removed. The Greens are trying to amend it to ensure we do not leave it open to future government interpretation. I invited the minister last night to come back with some form of legislation that would fix this and today he makes reference to Britain or somewhere and says, `We are doing what they are doing.' That is not good enough.</para><para>I reiterate that if you go to South Korea you will find a country with a much shakier democracy than we have that has shelved legislation like this, simply because the people were so opposed to it. The challenge here is for the government to come up with legislation which nails terrorists, because the government says we have to have that legislation. I have maintained that we already have enormous powers to nail criminals, including terrorists, under existing legislation, and to watch for them and track them down. But if we must have new legislation, it has to be legislation that does not trespass on a whole broad field of community activities and protests; this particular clause does. It ought to be either knocked out or amended to get around the problem I am talking about. </para><para>Last night I foreshadowed the problem that the minister has talked about of a person who is going to kill themselves to make a point and perhaps terrorise other people in the process. But the point is that for that extraordinary situation, you have the label of `terrorism' being put across a whole range of people, including not a few who have already protested by fasting outside this parliament in the 14 or so years that this parliament has been here. We should not do that. Mary Robinson, the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights, has warned against it, recognising that of course we must take strong measures against terrorists but not at the expense of internationally recognised liberties and liberties which have been exercised in this country for the last 100 years. </para><para>I therefore commend the Greens amendment to the committee and I again ask the government: did it look at the ramifications for people who are protesting through fasting or other methods to make their point? The minister seems to indicate that the government did not even take this into account or, if it did, it dismissed it because it was too hard. Being too hard does not excuse sloppy legislation which can be abused further down the line.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>2563</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think that the bow that Senator Brown is drawing is so long and I think there is merit in his argument.

Of course, it was the culmination of many other sociopolitical factors, but it pivoted on the issue of Northern Ireland which continues to this day, although not in the acute and dramatic way that it did in 1979-80. Given the political context of the time—the criminalisation, the banning, the proscription, if you like, of the IRA, the imprisonment of Bobby Sands and the act of fasting he undertook which resulted in an international campaign and international recognition of the issue and arguably increased concern and criticism of the British government—I think you could run a reasonable argument that that was an act of coercion or intimidation. So, to me, that is the more recent argument, less historical in comparison to suffragettes and Gandhi. I think that kind of political act is something that we could well experience in the future. We cannot predict these things.

I cannot interfere with that discretion, but I can make it very clear here and now that it is the government's intention that this legislation is not intended for a hunger striker.

We are talking about a prosecutor acting in a different political climate under a different government in the future. Legislation should clearly say what it is intended to mean.

Is that terrorism? Does that not frighten people and cause affront? What would the government think if that was happening in front of this parliament or in front of a public building in Australia? Does the government mean to tell me that a prosecutor, under a hostile government in the future, is not going to say that these people are creating terror? I think this is wide open for just that to happen. And there will not be reference to what is going on in Britain or Somalia or somewhere else when it does happen. We have to deal with this legislation in the Australian context.</para><para>I oppose the definition of terrorism as it applies. It is far too wide, and that means it is wide open to abuse. But in this particular matter we can see how it can be abused and we can see how it can be used against people who have taken part in traditional, peaceful protests in the past. I think the committee should look at it very, very seriously. We ought to challenge the government to come up with more defined wording to this legislation, and not simply leave it to go through on an assurance by the government.</para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Brown's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The Chairman—Senator S.M.

The words, as amended, are not limited in any way, so it does not, in our view, make a lot of sense to add words like `lawful or unlawful'—any adjectives in fact—to the definition that would, in essence, duplicate the effect that has already been achieved. I understand and accept the spirit with which this has been put forward, but I see no positive effect. In fact, I do think there is a risk that adding words like this to such a key clause, without adding any meaning, will lead only to confusion.

The committee is obviously going to agree with the government, because the government will have the support of the ALP in this. All I can say is that it is very worrying to trespass on a whole field of traditional protest which has made our society the better, which marks our society as a vigorous democracy which involves inclusion of a broad range of ideas, which is not restrictive, not militaristic, not coercive and, hopefully, where people are acting in a non-criminal fashion—non-punitive. I think when a future government comes to object to whatever point of view those people are putting forward we will now have a punitive arrangement for people involved in such things as fasting. These amendments are of course aimed at improving and do improve the government's first run at this legislation, which was quite frankly horrendous, but they do not improve it far enough.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>2566</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to address a question to the minister in respect of subclause (2A)(b) of amendment (8) , where it says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(2A)	 Action falls within this subsection if it:</para><para>	(a)	is advocacy, protest, dissent or industrial action; and</para><para>	(b)	is not intended:</para><para>	(i)	to cause serious harm that is physical harm to a person; or</para><para>	(ii)	to cause a person's death; or</para><para>	(iii)	to endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action; or</para><para>	(iv)	to create a serious risk to the health or safety of the public or a section of the public.</para></quote><para>Last evening we were discussing this question of serious harm that is physical harm.

I will refer to the question, firstly, of serious harm. In the Criminal Code Act 1995, serious harm is defined to mean:</para></talk.start><quote><para>... harm (including the cumulative effect of any harm):</para><para>(a)	that endangers, or is likely to endanger a person's life; or </para><para>(b)	that is or is likely to be significant and longstanding. </para></quote><para>So it is of a wider definition than to endanger the life of a person. It does include that but it goes further, in fact, to include harm that is `significant and longstanding'. </para><para>In our proposed subsection (2A) we are saying that, in the first instance, it should not be intended to cause serious harm—that is, physical harm—to a person. We are saying that is a broad definition and it catches the threat of serious harm to a person; even the person who is actually carrying out the threat. We have discussed that before in relation to Senator Brown's proposed amendment in relation to a hunger striker. I gave the example of someone who has strapped a bomb to themselves, intent on suicide. That is quite different from (b)(iii), which says `to endanger the life of a person, other than the person taking the action'. So (b)(iii) is dealing with the protection of people other than the person proposing the threat. It talks about endangering life, but it does not extend that to the person carrying out the action. It does that for the reason that there are legitimate cases where creating danger to oneself is justified—for example, in saving another person. That is why it has not been extended to the person taking the action. It is a question of endangering the life of someone.</para><para>Subparagraph (b)(i) actually relates to the causing of serious harm. That is where you are out to cause serious harm—not to put anybody in danger of their life but just to cause serious harm—and so that is a slightly different limb, if you like, from (b)(iii). Subparagraph (b)(i) is where you set out to cause the serious harm that I mentioned—which includes endangering life—and you intend to cause physical harm to a person including yourself, and (b)(iii) is where you intend to endanger the life of other people. So we believe that those two cover the field.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>2567</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to make some comments on these government amendments. I commend to the committee the remarks I made last night in relation to these particular matters, because they are at the heart of these bills. It is absolutely crucial that this committee get this definition right. It is relevant to this bill and to the other bills that we are dealing with in this package. It is absolutely essential that we deal with the very sloppy definitions contained within the original bills when they were introduced. As I have said, these bills were riddled with unintended consequences, and the problem this committee faces is that, if we do not get these definitions right, there could be draconian consequences, serious consequences, for innocent people. That is why, as far as the opposition are concerned, we have put so much effort into ensuring that this definition is right.</para></talk.start><para>It was really only a couple of weeks ago that the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, said:</para><quote><para>We believe the community is prepared to make sacrifices of individual civil liberties in order that the community generally is protected from those threats.</para></quote><para>To be fair to the Attorney-General, those threats are terrorist threats. But we in the Labor Party—and, I believe, the vast majority of senators and parliamentarians in this building—would not want to sacrifice such liberties and freedoms lightly. We will not sacrifice civil liberties and democratic freedoms lightly—and I say that deliberately. I think that is crystal clear from the debate that senators have engaged in so far in this committee and crystal clear from what occurred in terms of the submissions to the Senate committee and the enormous amount of correspondence that has been received on these important bills from a very wide range of interested people in the community.  </para><para>What we say to the committee from the Labor perspective—and it is a really important principle—is this: if these bills are right, if they are properly drafted and significantly amended, then with improved drafting, with tighter definitions, people's rights will be protected. That is the task. I have been very frank from the beginning of this debate in saying that the challenge is to be vigilant in the fight against terrorism and vigilant in protecting the democratic freedoms and liberties and values that Australians hold dear. That is the task for this Senate committee.</para><para>The definition which we are dealing with here is at the core of the bills. We know we are dealing with a bill that, when introduced, had a very sloppy definition of a terrorist act and had the potential, as a result, for significant consequences. We have been concerned from day one that we faced a situation where civil protests might have been criminalised as terrorists acts under the definition that was contained when the bills were introduced. The example that we have consistently given is that domestic political protests could have fallen within the definition as soon as they became unlawful in any way. That could be for something as minor really as trespass or nuisance or the like. These sorts of issues had to be fixed. And the original definition did not distinguish terrorist violence from offences or forms of violence covered in other acts. We have been successful in convincing the government to very significantly tighten this definition. It was absolutely unacceptable, as far as the opposition is concerned, and we had to ensure that any possibility, however remote, of protests or industrial action being dealt with as terrorist offences had to go. It had to go, it had to be removed, and it has been.</para><para>I want to say something in relation to the general issue that we are talking about as we deal with this definition, and I have explained to the committee how seriously it is treated on this side of the chamber. Recently it has come to my attention that one Commonwealth body, the Defence Service Homes Insurance, recently wrote to their policyholders. I ask the Senate committee to give some consideration to this, and I would be interested in the minister's comment. They have told their policyholders that a clause has been added to the DSH home building insurance policy. It is called `Terrorism exclusion endorsement' and it has gone out to all policyholders. It says:</para><quote><para>Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary within this insurance, or any endorsement thereto, it is agreed that this insurance excludes loss, damage, cost or expense of whatsoever nature directly or indirectly caused by, resulting from, or in connection with any act of terrorism regardless of any other cause or event contributing concurrently or in any other sequence to the loss.</para></quote><para>That is self-explanatory; it is the sort of terminology you would expect in such a clause. Then it goes on, and this is the key part:</para><quote><para>For the purpose of this endorsement, an act of terrorism means an act including, but not limited to, the use of force or violence and/or the threat thereof of any person or groups of persons, whether acting alone or on behalf of or in connection with any organisations or governments, which from its nature or context is done for, or in connection with, political, religious, ideological or similar purposes—</para></quote><para>and I encourage the committee to listen to this—</para><quote><para>including the intention to influence any government or governments and/or to put the public, or any section of the public, in fear.</para></quote><para>That is fundamentally based on the Canadian definition. Defence Service Homes Insurance have come up with such a definition in relation to an act of terrorism which is one that I think most in this committee would say is a reasonable outcome. So we have got Defence Service Homes Insurance adding a clause to their DSH home building insurance policy that is fundamentally based on the Canadian definition, but that is not the government's preferred approach. I give DSH Insurance credit: they have come up with a cleaner, better way of doing things. It is the same task that this committee faces in relation to this legislation.</para><para>I believe the definition has been massively improved. It needed to be. I doubt that we would have been able to achieve this outcome without the extraordinary effort from witnesses and from the Senate committee. I particularly acknowledge the effort of my colleagues in the Australian Labor Party who have really put their shoulder to the wheel in relation to this matter. It is essential that we get this right. The government got it horribly wrong. It is much better if these amendments pass. It has always been a difficult task—I acknowledge this—to get this definition right. Many nations have genuinely struggled with this challenge for decades—literally for decades. Many are struggling with the challenge to get a definition of terrorism or terrorist act correct now. This is now a best effort. It needed to be massively improved and it has been. We can be very thankful there has been such an extraordinary effort in this chamber, in committees of this chamber and beyond, to ensure that this outcome has been achieved, because the unintended consequences if we had not been able to do that are just too horrible to contemplate. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Peter (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cook)</inline>—Senator Brown, do you intend to do anything about the Australian Greens amendment (4) on the sheet?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Mr Chairman, I am sorry, but just on a procedural point: I am happy to show it to the minister and I seek leave to table the extract from the Defence Service Homes policy.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>2569</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I hear what Senator Faulkner has just had to say, but I do not agree with him.

It will leave open the prospect of an abusive future government or a DPP— as the minister indicated a little earlier in the day—acting unilaterally to have people who have been engaged in activities, which could only have been seen as part of the fabric of Australian history in the past, being indicted as terrorists. The shortcomings of the government's and Labor's agreed approach might be summed up to some degree by the letter which all members received two days ago from Amnesty International. I want to quote from that letter in response to what Senator Faulkner had to say. The letter from Amnesty says:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Amnesty International objects to this package of “anti-Terrorism” legislation, and calls on you to do the same. If enacted, this legislation risks infringing fundamental human rights. We congratulate the members of both the relevant inquiries for their comprehensive reports into the proposed Bills, and for their belief that the Bills in their current form are unacceptable. However, Amnesty International believes that the recommendations made by the Senate and ASIO Committees—</para></quote><para>they are talking about the ASIO bill, which is not part of the consideration of the Senate tonight—</para><quote><para>while an improvement on the original legislation, do not go far enough to ensure that the rights of innocent people will be protected.</para></quote><para>Amnesty International says that its main concerns relating to the two bills have been extensively outlined in both their written submissions to the Senate and to the ASIO inquiry, as well as in the oral evidence provided at those inquiries. They say:</para><quote><para>We outline below some of Amnesty International's outstanding concerns following the release of the Inquiry Reports and the Attorney-General's news release of 4 June 2002.</para></quote><para>On the Terrorism bill—and this is the one we have in hand now—Amnesty International says:</para><quote><para>As noted above, Amnesty International has not been able to obtain a copy of the full “Terrorism Bill” as amended. </para></quote><para>This is just two days ago.</para><quote><para>Accordingly, our comments are based on the amendments as announced by the Attorney-General on 4 June 2002.</para><para>Amnesty International believes that even after the inclusion of the government's amendments—</para></quote><para>meaning the ones we are dealing with right now, which Senator Faulkner says go to the heart of the matter—</para><quote><para>there is a complete lack of clarity in this Bill. The Bill risks violating the right to a fair trial and the right to only be prosecuted for a recognisable criminal offence under clear legislation. The terms used in the legislation, such as “things” in proposed section 101.4, are too broad and vague. Not only does the Bill risk breaching international human rights law, it is also profoundly unfair. </para><para>The definition of “terrorism” in the proposed Bill is too broad. While exemptions for “lawful advocacy, protest or dissent” are provided, there are no definitions of these concepts. This would allow for vague interpretation in application of the legislation, and an inadequate degree of certainty as to what activities will be deemed to be “terrorism” offences. The proposed inclusion of an element of “intimidation or coercion” does little to assist with clarifying this definition. Amnesty International is concerned that this element may in fact result in limiting legitimate protest.</para><para>From the news release—</para></quote><para>they are referring to the Attorney-General's release of 4 June 2002—</para><quote><para>it is unclear whether the proposed amendments clarify the definition of “member”. As drafted, the Bill allows for a penalty of 25 years imprisonment for someone who is an “informal member” or who has merely “taken steps to become a member” of an organisation that the Attorney-General has declared to be a “terrorist organisation”. It is Amnesty International's position that this definition of “member” is too broad.</para></quote><para>Amnesty International goes on to comment on what, effectively, we are going to see as an outcome, if my hunch is correct:</para><quote><para>The Bill has the effect of criminalising activities that even the Government does not believe should be prosecuted. Before the Senate Committee, the Attorney-General's Department confirmed that there are numerous examples of activities that may be covered by the Act that are not intended to be prosecuted as “terrorism” offences. Amnesty International has concerns with relying on the Department's assurances that police and prosecuting authorities will not proceed with prosecuting people for “terrorism” offences in circumstance where their actions are not intended to be caught by the breadth of this legislation.</para></quote><para>And note this sentence from Amnesty International:</para><quote><para>History contains many examples of instances where laws that were not initially intended to be used in a particular way have been used for precisely that purpose further down the track.</para><para>The Bill does not recognise requirements of natural justice. While it allows the Attorney-General to “ban” organisations, there is no requirement within the Bill that the relevant organisation have the opportunity to respond or to be heard. Further there is no requirement that the Attorney-General notify the organisation of his decision. Adequate safeguards must be inserted in the proposed legislation to protect rights when proscribing organisations as “terrorist” groups. Allowing for a complete review of the Attorney-General's decision to proscribe an organisation is one necessary element that the Bill lacks. Amnesty International urges further steps be taken to ensure innocent people are not unjustly affected by the proscription of organisations.</para><para>The Bill as initially drafted removed the right to be presumed innocent by reversing the onus of proof. The proposed amendments remove this reversal of the onus in some areas of the Bill, but do not appear to do so for every relevant section (see, for example, proposed section 102.4). Concerns remain that the right to be presumed innocent may be violated. Reversing the onus of proof breaches Article 14(2) of <inline font-style="italic">the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights</inline> (“ICCPR”) and Article 11 of the <inline font-style="italic">Universal Declaration of Human Rights </inline>(“UDHR”). The burden of proof must remain with the prosecution to prove the elements of the offence, and anyone charged with an offence must be allowed the right to be presumed innocent until proven guilty.</para><para>Amnesty International also has concerns with the extension of the definition of treason in the proposed legislation. We note the Attorney-General's statement that it will be a defence to this section of the person's conduct relates to the provision of humanitarian aid. However, there remains significant concern that the advocacy work of community groups, including Amnesty International itself, may fall within the scope of this offence.

The government's bill in this proposed section augments the definition of a terrorist act in such a way that acts can occur anywhere in the world and still be in breach of this section—in other words, the reach of this legislation is extended overseas and could net people who are taking part in protests overseas and action can be taken against them here in Australia. For example, if you have Australians protesting in Tiananmen Square or in downtown Lhasa against the brutal imposition of military occupation of Tibet by the communist Chinese dictatorship, they could arguably be indicted as terrorists under Australian law.</para><para>We know how close the Howard government is to the Beijing regime of President Jiang Zemin. Therefore, the potential for protestors at the Olympics in 2008, for example, is enormous. They might be protesting about Tibet or the horrendous labour conditions that obtain in many places in China. They might be protesting against the broadscale infringement of human and democratic rights in China—something we hear nothing about from the White House when President Bush exclaims that America is there to remove the evils of dictatorship and totalitarianism and impose freedom and democracy around the world. Then there is not a word about China.</para><para>But I am very concerned that people more consistent and logical than President Bush, who stand up for freedom and democracy wherever it might be threatened and go to China to protest for it, can be caught up by this legislation. What about the Falun Gong? The Chinese regime says that they are terrorists. What about those Australians who recently protested in Tiananmen Square? Twelve of them were very badly treated; they were manhandled and bundled back out of the country. Will a future government be under pressure from the Chinese regime to classify those people as terrorists when they are not? Yes, there is potential for that under this legislation. </para><para>It is not, as Senator Faulkner has said, tied down and sorted out; far from it. It is very worrying legislation indeed. What about people who, in the future, will undoubtedly be involved in protesting for a free Papua— formerly called West Papua? Indeed, what about people who want to protest for the freedom of the Kurds? This government has already proscribed the Kurdish freedom party, the PKK, although in the last three years that party has eschewed violence and turned to the pursuit of democracy. There was frontdoor proscription, but the government has also effectively been able to move, via backdoor proscription, on that organisation in a way which worries me greatly. I will be returning to that issue with the Greens amendment on backdoor proscription, which the government already has the power to levy by crippling organisations financially.</para><para>The provisions in this legislation open a whole box of questions. I ask the government why it has moved to extend its overseas reach in matters of political dissent but not in matters of business malfeasance. What about those corporations that have caused death and injury overseas through either negligence or siding with dictatorships? Would it not be consistent for the government to be legislating against them? I am one of those who are totally in favour of this country's legislation that indicts child abusers, after having been overseas abusing children, when they return to this country. If they are not caught overseas, they can be brought before the courts here. If people come back to this country after being involved in terrorism, then it is logical to say, `Let's indict them here.'</para><para>But, again, this legislation is wide open to abuse and coercion by other governments, who might see Australians who are acting in support of freedom, democracy, religious rights or workers rights as terrorists; they might put pressure on a future Australian government to indict them here, in their home country. We cannot leave that to the Director of Public Prosecutions. I do not think we should leave it to future governments either. I think we should nail this down and make it very clear that we are talking about terrorists who have caused mass bloodshed, violence and destruction; we are not talking about Australians who have gone overseas and risked their lives to defend the civil liberties of people in other countries. But this legislation can net such people—and it should not.</para><para>These particular provisions have been put into the bill because somewhere back there, in the international surveillance authorities, it has been thought to be a good thing. But it has not been thought out, and these provisions in the legislation should be removed. Again, I hope that the opposition will look carefully at this. These clauses are wide open to abuse, and we should not leave it that way.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cook, Peter (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cook)</inline>—The question is that amendments (6) and (7) on sheet 2512 revised 2 be agreed to.</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—Chair, I raise a point of order.

Is this not going to put at risk Australian citizens who go overseas and take part in protests for democracy, freedom and the rights of people which have been taken away by dictators elsewhere? Let me come to the extraordinary example where a government here could come under pressure. China describes the Dalai Lama as a criminal. It is a totally illegal activity to be distributing pictures of the Dalai Lama in Tibet. Are Australians who are arrested there going to be able to withstand the ability of the Chinese secret police to load them up—they do this time and time again—with charges which are not true? They would be framed in that situation. Without the ability to reach overseas and get evidence, how are citizens here in Australia—if they come back here and get charged—going to defend themselves in that situation? </para></talk.start><para>This component of the legislation is fraught with difficulties. If you are going to have the ability to indict Australians taking part as terrorists in events overseas, be very clear about it. As I said earlier, narrow the definition for those people who are out of the reach of the direct surveillance and apprehension of Australian authorities—whom we may trust enormously compared with their counterparts in some other countries—but do not leave them vulnerable in this legislation to the secret police and agencies of other countries. I am sure the Attorney-General will get up and say, `The Australian courts are going to be careful about this,' and that the DPP will and so on. The legislation should be explicit. At the outset, it should be confined to those people involved in what the public perceives as terrorism overseas which is violence, bloodshed and destruction.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>2573</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The matter that is being considered is the issue in the bill:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(3)	In this Division:</para><para>(a) a reference to any person or property is a reference to any person or property wherever situated, within or outside Australia; and</para><para>(b) a reference to the public includes a reference to the public of a country other than Australia.</para></quote><para>Clearly, examples have just been given by Senator Brown in support of his amendment which would delete, as I read it, proposed subsection (3), which is the section I have just read out.

You will also lose the prospect of prosecuting a terrorist who committed terrorist acts overseas; and then fled to Australia. You could have an event such as September 11 where, had the people involved survived the attack and fled to Australia, you would want to prosecute them here. This legislation deals with encompassing actions which are taken overseas which involve threats to the public in another country; it is not just the Australian public. There are two very important aspects of this legislation: firstly, to prosecute Australians who commit terrorist acts overseas and, secondly, to be able to prosecute those who commit terrorist acts overseas and then flee to Australia to try to escape justice.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to Senator Brown's query as to whether someone who engages in lawful protest overseas could be dealt with under this provision, in order for Australia to extradite a person there needs to be dual criminality: it has to be an offence in that country and an offence here.

They could be prosecuted here only if they had committed acts of terrorism overseas.

We face a situation where this parliament can enact any law to operate outside Australia provided its subject matter is otherwise within its legislative power. Generally, as I understand it, criminal laws are presumed to extend only to the territorial limits of Australia unless a contrary intention is expressed in legislation. The Crimes Act is generally expressed to operate beyond the Commonwealth and territories, and the Proceeds of Crime Act is expressed to operate outside Australia.

Senator Brown mentioned some examples of extraterritorial criminal offences: he spoke about child sex crimes, for example, and I accept what he said in relation to that. But let us look at what some of those criminal offences are: piracy, theft, fraud and bribery against the Commonwealth, slavery, sexual servitude and deceptive recruiting, various computer offences—cybercrime, as it is called—war crime, the taking of hostages, engaging in torture or using biological weapons, various offences at sea and, of course, dealing in drugs outside Australia with or without the intent of bringing those drugs into Australia. They are some very important examples—why shouldn't terrorism fit the same bill? Why isn't the crime of terrorism just as important as those?</para></talk.start></continue><para>As well as the sorts of offences that I have spoken about, the Senate in committee has, under Corporations Law, tax law, family law and intellectual property law, dealt with a whole range of offences that operate extraterritorially. In the view of the opposition, terrorist offences—offences against these laws by Australians overseas—should be able to be prosecuted here. That is the fundamental principle. I commend this approach to Senator Brown and ask him to consider it, because I did hear him express concerns last night about two Australians who are currently held overseas, Hicks and Habib. Senator Brown spoke at length in relation to those two people. Of course, a preferred course of action is that those individuals be prosecuted here, if that is appropriate, and dealt with here, under Australian law, by Australians. This amendment has a lot to commend itself to the committee. Again, I accept the spirit in which it is put forward. I hear what Senator Brown says, but the arguments are very strong that this amendment should be defeated and that we should ensure that we see these laws in relation to terrorism and terrorist offences apply to Australians outside Australia. It is an important principle and this committee should not resile from it.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>2574</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The debate is not about terrorism with destruction, murder and massive bloodshed—if only it were. This legislation has the potential to capture people who are involved in vigorous protest, which accompanies all open and free societies and democracies. If it were confined to what the public perceives as acts of terrorism, violence and destruction then I would not be concerned about its reach going overseas. But it is not. It covers a whole range of other activities which do not involve bloodshed and destruction against other people. We have just dealt with the definition, and it is much wider than that. The minister was not prepared to say that charges could not be brought against people who fasted to the point of endangering themselves. He was not prepared to say that being a member of an organisation would not in itself be enough to see this legislation brought into play.</para></talk.start><para>I remind the committee again that, at the one opportunity people were given to ban an organisation, the Communist Party, which was then put clearly in the dock as dangerous, violent, injurious and threatening to democratic society, Australians voted against it being proscribed. This legislation allows such organisations to be proscribed and allows members of such organisations to be proscribed with them. It is not just about terrorism; it would be a much simpler thing if it were. This expands the publicly perceived term of `terrorism' to a whole range of other activities that governments might not like in the future. To expand it to that extent is dangerous, and I am opposed to it. The Greens amendments would fix that, but they are being voted down by the Labor Party combining with the government—and these amendments are going to have that fate. </para><para>Before I finish speaking on them, I want to draw to the committee's attention the fact that I asked the minister last night to provide this committee with further information about the plights of Mr Hicks and Mr Habib, who are being held in outrageous conditions at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, by the United States military authorities precisely to ensure that their civil rights are not granted. I pointed out to the minister last night that Americans who had been taken to Guantanamo Bay have been sent home, where they come under American law. Australians who went to Guantanamo Bay are still being held there and our government, in an appalling failure to look after the interests of these citizens, has not demanded their return to the jurisdiction of this country. Were this legislation through, it would make not one whit of difference to the Bush administration's abrogation of the rights of these two Australians and its total discrimination against them and other foreign nationals vis-a-vis the Americans who have been arrested in Afghanistan and taken to continental United States either through Guantanamo Bay or directly. After talking about this yesterday, I saw Mr Hicks's father on the ABC television news last night telling the world that his son had been held for 131 days in a cage at Guantanamo Bay.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Why?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—Indeed, why?

If this were happening to American nationals in some other country, such as ours, there would be hell to pay; they would not stand for it. But our government does stand for it and in so doing is abrogating its obligation to these two Australian citizens.

The minister has answered this, but perhaps it is worth clarifying the position—not that it needs clarifying—just to put it on the record. Acts that are committed overseas have to be acts that are criminal acts in Australia. In other words, China, some place in the Middle East or anybody else declaring a matter to be a crime does not bind the Australian jurisdiction. A crime that has been committed overseas has to be recognised as a crime in Australia. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Brown says—the minister might want to answer this—there is still the difficulty of the quality of the evidence that you might get from overseas. I remember, with the war crimes legislation we had in the 1980s—that shows you how long I have been here; it is about time I moved on—there were real problems with the quality of the evidence, and that was a difficulty. Nonetheless, if you take into account that the crimes we are looking at are quite vicious, the legislation is correct in saying they ought to be crimes and have a cover overseas. For example, other issues such as bribing or attempting to bribe officials overseas bring the rigour of the law upon people in Australia. If we pass this legislation, we must ensure that the quality of the evidence is correct.</para><para>I have great faith in the Australian Federal Police, who will be dealing with this and who have overseas posts. I have great faith also in Mr Damian Bugg, the Director of Public Prosecutions. I think he is quite outstanding. We have a connection through common Tasmanian ancestry. But it is not just for that reason I note he is an outstanding prosecutor; he is the latest in a series of good prosecutors including Michael Rozenes and Mark Weinberg—I think Mr Temby was the first one. We have had good prosecutors at the federal level and we also have a good police service.</para><para>Senator Brown has raised an issue that we should take note of. It is the issue of whether people overseas might not create evidence to embarrass people, who act in a particular way overseas, and use that evidence to try to stir up an unjustified prosecution in Australia. As I say, the police investigations that are done through the Federal Police and the quality control that is placed on the evidence by the Director of Public Prosecutions would probably overcome these difficulties.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>2576</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Cooney is correct in what he says about crimes committed overseas.

The International Criminal Court will have jurisdiction over only the most serious of crimes of concern to the international community as a whole, such as genocide, crimes against humanity and war crimes. While some of the most serious terrorist acts could possibly also constitute genocide, crimes against humanity or war crimes, the crimes contained in this bill are aimed at a different class of conduct. Many terrorist acts may not fall within the jurisdiction of the International Criminal Court or the similar criminal jurisdiction contained in Australian domestic law to be enacted by the <inline ref="R1607">International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002</inline>. The question of whether a crime falls within this bill or the International Criminal Court legislation, when enacted, will depend on the conduct in question, and the decision will be made by the relevant Australian prosecuting authorities. </para><para>The International Criminal Court (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002<inline ref=""></inline>has extraterritorial application to ensure that Australia is always able to prosecute crimes under the ICC statute domestically, no matter where they occur. Likewise, the crimes contained in this bill require extraterritorial application to ensure that Australia will always be in a position to bring the perpetrators of these crimes to justice, regardless of where these heinous crimes are committed.</para><para>I note the interest of the Democrats and Greens in matters of international criminality, and I look forward to their cooperation to allow for the swift passage of the legislation in relation to the International Criminal Court, which we will be bringing in, I think, on Thursday.

There is a total double standard here from the Howard government, simply because our Prime Minister does not have the gumption to eyeball the leader of another country, the United States, a foreign country, and say, `I will not put up with you treating Australian citizens in a way that you would not allow us to treat American citizens.'

But there is a concern when these two Australian citizens have their reputations traduced in Australia because, amongst other things, we do not like the idea of having these two Australian citizens imprisoned as they are and not think that in some way they deserve it—and that is why we do say they deserve it. I think that is what Senator McGauran was saying: `It would be a terrible thing to allow these people to be locked up if they weren't in some way guilty of something, and we are not sure what except that it has something to do with the war as conducted in Afghanistan.'</para></talk.start><para>I think it is bad for us as a nation to denigrate our own citizens held in a foreign jail without there being a proper hearing.

That is not happening here. I think we should acknowledge it and simply say that America is such a powerful nation which stands so forcibly and alone in the world as a superpower that there is really not much we can do about it.

Again, this word `reckless' is wide open to abuse further down the line. A number of the amendments I have already moved, and will move, seek to remove the various offences proposed by the government that do not require a prosecution to prove that an alleged offender knowingly committed terrorist acts or one of the related offences. Specifically, what our amendments will do is remove recklessness—this word appears in other places—as the fault element that a prosecution will have to show to convict someone of these offences that have been created by the legislation. They are offences that of course have very heavy penalties. If you look at the penalty for the section in hand—that is, recklessly being involved with a person training to be a terrorist—you see that you are liable to imprisonment for 15 years. The Labor Party have recognised the problem in having offences based on negligence and they are right to do so, and we will support their amendments. But the gravity of these offences and the seriousness of the penalties involved are such that someone should be charged and convicted of the offences only if they knowingly engaged in those offences. Section 5.4(2) of the Criminal Code Act defines recklessness. It states:</para><quote><para>(2) A person is reckless with respect to a result if: </para><para>(a) he or she is aware of a substantial risk that the result will occur; and</para><para>(b) having regard to the circumstances known to him or her, it is unjustifiable to take the risk.</para></quote><para>It is not just the Australian Greens who see a problem here. Justice Dowd, in evidence before the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, opposed the fault element of recklessness in relation to the financing of terrorism. Chair, you will find on page 4 of the report of the committee Justice Dowd said:</para><quote><para>There are many causes, such as that of the Tamils, for instance. I went to a fundraising function, before I held my present office, of the Tamil community. In this little dinner, put together by the local Tamil community, they probably raised about $200 by selling meals and so on. The money was to go to help people injured in the war that is occurring in Sri Lanka, where medical supplies are not allowed through—proper food is not allowed through but particularly medical supplies. These were to help people that had been injured. That, one would think in Australia, is a pretty innocent, reasonable sort of activity. I oppose totally any terrorist activities. I oppose Azeld, as the Tamil community here knows, any act of terrorism in the ordinary sense and have condemned it at every opportunity that I can, to their face and otherwise; but I will not, through fear of this sort of legislation, stop helping orphans, war-injured and civilians injured. </para></quote><para>Justice Dowd said later—and you will find this on page 6, Chair:</para><quote><para>Take, for instance, my attending a function in a school hall to raise $200 for wounded Tamil people. Was I reckless in not checking where the cheques went? I think I contributed $20 to pay for the meal. I suspect the profit on that was fairly negligible, but was I reckless in not checking the accounts of that organisation—or do I have to not go? When you have extended jurisdictions, such as in 101.4(5)—</para></quote><para>he is talking about this legislation—</para><quote><para>then that is in fact too high an onus and you need something better than that. I should not have to prove that I was not reckless—because I possibly was. I use the personal example to illustrate the point, not to confess to some terrible crime.</para></quote><para>Justice Dowd highlights why amendments to remove recklessness are so important. Are we able to check that every organisation we donate to is not involved in terrorist acts or training terrorists, bearing in mind the broad definition of a terrorist act that the government is proposing here with the support of the opposition? It is not just finances, of course. The argument is the same for the government's proposed section 102.7 `Providing support to a terrorist organisation', as contained in amendment (17).</para><para>The argument is also the same in relation to the possession of things—and we run into the word `things' in this legislation. What if I possess a thing that is connected to a terrorist act and I am not aware of what it will be used for? Do we need to keep track of every mobile phone or every document that is brought into our houses? And in relation, finally, to the specific amendment on training that we have cited here, every education institution—TAFE or universities—a tradesperson who is taking on an apprentice or, indeed, even the military could be caught out by an offence of recklessly training someone who then commits terrorist acts. Let us not forget that Timothy McVeigh was trained by the US military and then went on to do the Oklahoma bombing. Were the US military reckless, one could ask? Did they adequately evaluate this man and his potential?</para><para>Serious offences such as those envisioned in this legislation should require someone to be knowingly involved in the offences. Recklessness can mean that people were totally innocent of that knowledge but in the opinion of the government or a prosecutor ought to have had knowledge of the offences. After the event, of course, circumstances can turn against an individual who might then find themselves spending 15 years in jail in circumstances that have totally changed. In effect, they may not have known what was going on, and they abhor terrorism, but they were caught up in those circumstances. Again, this provision is dangerous and the Greens want to remove the application of the word `reckless' in it because we believe, in itself, that is reckless.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>2581</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Let me just say one thing to Senator Brown concerning Justice John Dowd, just to put it in context.

Since he gave that evidence, there has been a great change in this so that now the onus has shifted. Strict or absolute liability has been done away with in respect of this legislation and now the onus is upon the Crown to prove that the person was reckless as defined in the Criminal Code.

I think this committee should recognise that, under pressure from the Senate committee and, I suspect, the government's own backbench, and certainly the opposition, this change has been made. I acknowledge all those inputs to the government's new proposal.</para><para>While the offences are better structured in some respects and have been recast to include intent and knowledge, we remain very concerned that the government is proposing to include offences where the relevant fault element is negligence. In the government's proposed hierarchy for the offences, knowledge of a terrorist connection to activities would expose a person to a penalty of up to 25 years imprisonment. Recklessness—that is, having the foresight of a possible connection but acting irrespective of that foresight—would expose an individual to a penalty of up to 15 years imprisonment.</para><para>Logically, both knowledge and recklessness require a particular mental state—I think lawyers always describe this as mens rea—but, as such, a test as to an accused person's knowledge or recklessness is subjective. That is appropriate in relation to these offences as we would say terrorism is, in its essence, all about intent, all about the state of mind of the perpetrator. It is this mental element that distinguishes terrorism from other criminal offences and justifies the specific criminalisation of terrorism as a higher level of offensive behaviour. It is in that context that the opposition opposes the introduction of offences based on negligence. In law, proving negligence would not require proof of any particular mental state. This is because the test for negligence is an objective one based upon an assessment of what a reasonable person may do in the circumstances, not based on what the alleged perpetrator may have intended. This is a crucial difference. We do not think a person can negligently commit a terrorist act. That is why we are opposing the government amendments that introduce such an unacceptable threshold for terrorist acts.</para><para>While I am on my feet speaking about negligence, let me indicate to the committee on a related matter—and this has been discussed on a number of occasions during this committee stage—that a news release has been issued by the Attorney-General, Mr Williams, about amendments to the ASIO bill. We have spoken at some length in this committee debate about the processes that have led to this debate being held at this time. I want to quote what the Attorney-General said in a news release in relation to the ASIO bill. He said:</para><quote><para>The opposition has indicated that it would like time to settle a position on the bill and any amendments before the bill is debated in the House and did not want to debate the legislation in the House or the Senate this week.</para></quote><para>He goes on:</para><quote><para>Given the tight timeframe available to respond to the parliamentary committee reports on the bill within this sitting period, the government has agreed to delay debate on the bill until early in the next sitting period.</para></quote><para>It is, in my view, totally unacceptable that the Attorney-General, in the middle of this very important debate on this package of bills to counter terrorism, produces a news release like this when the opposition certainly have indicated we will ensure, with the support of the government, that the Senate concludes its consideration on this package of counter-terrorism bills. There are now only a couple of days left in the scheduled Senate sittings before the winter recess. We want to ensure this package is dealt with. We want to ensure an amended package is achieved that gets the balance right between ensuring a strong response on terrorism but not sacrificing key liberties, key freedoms and key elements of our democracy. That has been our objective from the start and we are hopeful, if not confident, that we will be able to achieve that outcome. But it does not help when the Attorney-General puts out a news release like this about a related piece of legislation.

In the absence of a government response to the report, I wanted to have the benefit of government amendments to the ASIO bill so we could have a proper consideration of the bill and the government's proposals. I asked time and time again for those to be provided.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Eleven deadlines were broken by the Attorney-General in relation to providing those amendments to the opposition. Eleven times they could not deliver. We still do not have a government response to the report; we still do not have even a response in principle to the recommendations of the joint committee or in principle to the amendments, let alone draft amendments. That is the situation we face and it is absolutely unsatisfactory to have the Attorney-General put out a press release like this when the government was unable to provide that level of information to the opposition and to the parliament more broadly. Fair enough, it is important legislation.</para><para>I do not think anyone in this parliament would object to the government saying it wants time to get its response right—it needs time to draft amendments to the bill. There are 15 recommendations that come forward from the joint committee, for a start, and the government would want to respond properly to them. To suggest in some way that the opposition deserves criticism or censure for this is outrageous. It is outrageous for the Attorney-General to put out a press release like this in the circumstances that we face. Of course, whenever you do that you are very quickly exposed by the facts. The facts are that there are no government amendments, either drafted amendments or even amendments in principle, there is no response to the joint committee report and there is no indication as to how the government will respond to the joint committee's report or the changes it may make to that bill. Not only is it the opposition's view— and I do not lightly say this in the chamber but I can say on this occasion—but also I know it is the Australian Democrats' view, and at least the view of the Green senator, that this bill should not be proceeded with in these circumstances. When we deal with this very important legislation we have to have every opportunity to give it thorough and adequate consideration, and I can guarantee that is how the opposition will approach these matters when we are provided with an indication of the government's approach.  </para><para>I do not resile from the fact that I do not want to deal with such legislation until we have an opportunity for proper examination. But, equally, the Attorney-General should not be putting out press releases like this to try to get some spin up in the media that you can blame the opposition for this bill not being dealt with. I am not ashamed at all that the bill is not being dealt with in this sitting because when the Committee of the Whole gives proper consideration to the bill, which I am confident it will, you can guarantee one thing: it will be a lot more thorough than the dog's breakfast of a bill that was introduced into the House of Representatives by the Attorney-General with the expectation that both chambers of the Australian parliament would give it the tick and pass it through. Fortunately, we will not do that. Fortunately, the joint committee has examined this particular bill and come up with its recommendations. The Labor Party will take a considered approach: we will make a thorough examination of not only the bill as it stands and the joint committee's recommendations but also any draft government amendments put forward. That is what anyone in this parliament ought to expect us to do. I do not think anyone in this parliament would expect the Attorney-General to issue a news release like the one that has just been handed to me in the middle of this important debate on our responsibilities to ensure we get a balanced and appropriate set of laws in this country to counter the threat of terrorism. That is a real responsibility, an important one. It bears heavily on everyone in this chamber and I do not think the response of the Attorney-General tonight does him any credit at all. It stands exposed as a very cheap and very cynical, though perhaps not the dirtiest trick in the world, press release that has been issued today. Let us get back to the business of dealing with what is before the committee. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>2584</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This press release that Senator Faulkner has alluded to is both disingenuous and dissembling. I have had something to do with this process, not as intensely as Senator Faulkner, but the implication in this press release is that the ASIO bill will not be proceeded with this sitting because of opposition from the Labor Party. That is the implication in this. The reality could not be further from the truth. I think, without too much big-noting, I drove that report into the House of Representatives on 29 May. We as a committee could have taken a bit more time and it would have been presented only last Monday week in both chambers. But, because we were at estimates and the House of Representatives was sitting, all members of that committee made sure the report would go at the earliest possible moment to the Attorney-General. It went through him for vetting to make sure we had not made any security blunders and, from memory, was presented in the other place on 29 May. That is 27 days ago. We realised the absolute importance from a political point of view of ensuring that, if the ASIO bill was to be amended extensively, it should be done in the House of Representatives first rather than doing it all and debating the bill in the House of Representatives not knowing what its final form was going to be.</para></talk.start><para>The major amendments, if the government was going to accept them, should have been incorporated in the bill in the House of Representatives. That would have totally changed the nature of the bill before it came here and would have changed at least the focus of the debate here. So every opportunity was taken. At four o'clock yesterday we were sitting just across the road at the government service delivery committee of the Labor Party and on the agenda was our response to the ASIO bill—that was the main item on the agenda—but how could we consider that when we had no response from the government as to any of the recommendations of the joint committee or any views on how the legislation should be amended? Not one amendment had been forwarded to us— not even in principle, let alone the technical drafting—and we sat there like a jilted bride waiting for the information to come over and it never did. I doubt whether Mr Williams has seen this press release, frankly. I do not think he would have the gall to issue it, given the history of it. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—I accept that—he probably hasn't.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>UI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name></talker><para>—Some eager beaver, junior woodchuck staffer probably rammed this out and thought, `We can get a bit of mileage out of this. We are not going to get the ASIO bill through this session; let's blame the Labor Party.' What really annoys me is that we have been bending over backwards trying to be cooperative in progressing these security bills. We were probably overeager to negotiate on the ASIO bill and, having given extensive cooperation, our payback is to be slandered in a press release by the Attorney-General. He has not delivered one amendment to us. He could not deliver a pizza, this bloke—he really couldn't. Do you want to know what the real test of a good minister is? It is not whether they can handle a crisis; it is whether they can handle two or three at the one time. Mr Williams cannot, that is quite clear. He has had every opportunity from 29 May to give a proper response to this parliament on the ASIO bill. He has not been able to do so. Maybe he has an acceptable excuse. He has no excuse for putting out this press release.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Without the amendments before us now it is impossible to make a decision this week on the ASIO bill—he knows it, we know it and that is why it has been put off. But don't come out and put out a cheap, nasty press release like this blaming others when he himself is to blame. If he is not capable of responding to those 15 recommendations, then he should not get his bill. Let's face it: what sort of Attorney-General produces a bill that says it is okay to take a 10-year-old Muslim girl off the street, strip search her and keep her incommunicado indefinitely? Of course we want to change such a bill. Of course we want to put in the protection of legal representation—protection against self-incrimination. Of course we want protocols to say how the proscribed authority would proceed in the interviewing of people. All that complexity that is missing from his current simplistic bill had to be solved. He should spend more time at the hard grind of working out appropriate amendments and ticking off appropriate legislation before he puts it into the parliament rather than putting out cheap press releases. If he did view this press release, he should be ashamed of himself. If he did not view this press release, he should reorganise his staff to make sure that he does in future.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>2585</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have not seen the news release to which Senator Faulkner refers.

I make the point that the comments made by Senator Faulkner are quite correct in the sense that I can state on behalf of the Democrats that there has been no delay or obfuscation on our part. In fact, I think the committee stage on these bills has been going very well, given the constraints and the subject matter. I also pay tribute to all of those committee members on both the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, on which I happen to serve—but I did not raise it for that reason—and the parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD because of the very strict time limits with which they were given to work. Given the extraordinary complexity and compre-hensive-ness of both the antiterrorism bills and the ASIO legislation, I think it is quite astonishing that both committees have worked so well to produce the reports they have within the time constraints given to them.</para></talk.start></continue><para>There is the suggestion within the Attorney-General's press release, as I understand it, given that I have not seen it, that somehow the ASIO legislation ought to be dealt with now. I would argue that is quite wrong for three reasons: firstly, that was never the undertaking from the crossbenches or, as I understand it, the opposition; secondly, there is absolutely no urgency in the ASIO legislation, and in fact the community is understandably anxious whenever it perceives that important bills, particularly relating to civil liberties and human rights, are being hastened or are perceived to be hastened; and, thirdly, this suite of antiterrorism legislation largely forms the foundation for the subsequent and following ASIO legislation. </para><para>If we were to deal with that subsequent legislation in this session, which is now more jammed than it was earlier, then we would be concertinaing, we would be squeezing, the time constraints and debate on this legislation unrealistically. I think the pace at which this committee stage has gone on these bills at the moment is effective and adequate and I would not like to see any squeezing of that time frame or hastening of that debate. On behalf of the Democrats, we are quite comfortable with the ASIO legislation being dealt with in the next sitting. For the record, we have been given no indication or undertaking that that would be dealt with in this sitting and any implication that my party might somehow be at fault for that being the case is simply wrong.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>2586</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I might just address the bill and the amendment at hand. I am sure that that is what people would expect of us rather than being very sensitive about issues which have no relevance to this particular amendment. In relation to opposition amendment (3), negligence does have a place in the criminal law. Indeed, in the Criminal Code Act 1995, at 5.5 under division 5, fault elements, negligence is defined as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>5.5 A person is negligent with respect to a physical element of an offence if his or her conduct involves:</para><para>(a) such a great falling short of the standard of care that a reasonable person would exercise in the circumstances; and</para><para>(b) such a high risk that the physical element exists or will exist; that the conduct merits criminal punishment for the offence.</para></quote><para>That is a comprehensive definition of negligence in the Criminal Code Act 1995. It sits there along with intention, knowledge and recklessness, and so we very much have negligence as a part of our criminal law. Negligence is a fault element ranging through the whole ambit of criminal sanction, from motor vehicle offences to manslaughter. So there is nothing new in having negligence in relation to a criminal offence.</para><para>The opposition seeks to remove that aspect of criminal negligence from the `terrorist training' offence. The government believes that this detracts from the effectiveness of that particular offence. A person's conduct will be criminally negligent only where it departs so substantially from standards of reasonable behaviour as to warrant the imposition of criminal sanctions. Removing the negligence offence will restrict the circumstances in which persons who engage in training in connection with a terrorist act can be prosecuted. We believe that an essential part of this training offence is the tiered approach of knowledge, recklessness and negligence. Someone who joins in the training of terrorists and who does so negligently, we say, should be caught by the provisions of this legislation. It is very clear whether a person has direct knowledge and intention, and that can be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. That stands as reasonable.</para><para>The opposition has agreed that `recklessness' is appropriate in these circumstances, but we believe that the test should also extend to `negligence'. When you look at the definition of negligence in the Criminal Code Act, it is of such a standard as not to be just a mere oversight; it is something much more. We believe that, where a person provides or receives training in relation to terrorism, the net should be widened in order to catch that activity. We believe that people will escape liability if the net is not widened; there will be a loophole. So we believe that the aspect of negligence is essential to this particular offence.</para><para>It may be that someone will say, `Well, look, I didn't have direct knowledge; I wasn't reckless in my disregard; I just didn't bother to find out.' You have to inquire more closely in that regard. The test as set out in 5.5 of the Criminal Code Act must be applied, and that element has to be proven beyond a reasonable doubt. It is a matter that the government has taken seriously; it is not something it has treated in a cavalier fashion. This is a very serious aspect of criminal law and this legislation provides, I would say, a heavy onus on the prosecution as to proof, having regard to the definition I have outlined. I think that the government, in its amendments (11), (13) and (14) has a package which is entirely appropriate. I commend those amendments to the Senate. </para><para>I feel that I must comment in relation to some other matters that were raised earlier in relation to another bill—although I will be much briefer, because I am keen to see this particular bill and associated bills dealt with by the Senate. I am advised that the press release put out by the Attorney-General today was in answer to press inquiries as to why the ASIO bill was not being dealt with this week. I hear what Senator Greig has to say in relation to the matter not being rushed through. I think that, when you look at the Attorney-General's release in a dispassionate way, you can see that he is setting out that the opposition is considering its position and the government needs time to respond to the parliamentary committee. I remind senators that, back in March, the ASIO bill was separated from this package by virtue of being referred to a different committee. That is the reason they are not still in the same bundle. The ASIO bill really has no bearing on the questions we have had to determine here today.</para><para>In relation to the matters at hand, I commend the government amendments to the Senate. I believe that opposition amendment (3) would leave too much of a gap in relation to law enforcement of this provision. I remind senators that negligence is nothing new in the criminal law in this country. It has a comprehensive definition in the Criminal Code Act 1995, and it requires proof beyond reasonable doubt.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>2587</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am confident that the minister has seen American news reports in recent weeks that the FBI, I think it was, has been the subject of claims that information about terrorist networks in the US had been provided to it but that lack of communication, inadequate communication or lack of response altogether had failed to get that message to the appropriate authorities or directed to the government for response. I wonder whether negligence might apply in that scenario. Perhaps we could take it out of a US context and put it into a potential Australian context. If someone in our intelligence agencies or defence forces inadequately fails to communicate knowledge of terrorist activity, or if the receiver of that information fails to act on it, does negligence come into play in that circumstance? Alternatively, is it mitigated by the fact that paragraph (a), which paragraph (c) in your item (3) relates to, only relates specifically to the provision of training?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>2587</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I think the question that Senator Greig poses deals with the possession of documents, which is related to government amendment (13).

These offences will be replaced with tiered offences carrying different fault elements and graduated penalties, much like the scheme that I mentioned in government amendment (11). Government amendment (13) replaces the offence of possessing a thing connected with a terrorist act—proposed section 101.4 relates here— with two offences carrying different fault elements and graduated penalties. Amendment (14) replaces the offence of `collecting or making a document connected with a terrorist act' with two offences carrying different fault elements and graduated penalties and, in this regard, proposed section 101.5 is relevant.</para><para>In each case a maximum penalty of 15 years imprisonment will apply where the defendant knows that the thing or document is connected to a terrorist act. Where the defendant is reckless as to the terrorist connection a maximum penalty of 10 years imprisonment will apply. There will be a defence where the possession of a thing or the making or collection of a document was not intended to assist or facilitate a terrorist act. Again, this touches on those similar arguments which I mentioned earlier, and the graduated fault aspect and penalty aspect are in similar terms regarding knowledge and recklessness.</para><para>Senator Greig asked a question earlier in relation to documents being not provided. Correct me if I am wrong, but I think that relates to a situation where a law enforcement official fails to pass on information. Senator Greig asked whether it would constitute a terrorist offence if that person was negligent. Firstly, there are in place in Australia mechanisms for the passing of intelligence and other information, and that is subject to privacy and other safeguards. There are measures in the <inline ref="R1485">Suppression of the Financing of Terrorism Bill 2002</inline> to streamline the exchange of financial intelligence in appropriate cases but, from the facts as outlined by Senator Greig, I cannot see how the failure by an official in that case to pass on information would constitute an offence under this bill. The documents should have a closer connection to terrorism, other than that which is described in the circumstance outlined by Senator Greig.

As originally drafted the strict and absolute liability provisions in this legislation raised real problems. Fortunately, the government has removed the strict and absolute liability provisions, adopting one of the recommendations of the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee report. However, we believe that there are still some outstanding issues of onus of proof. Where possible, we are seeking to avoid situations where the defendant bears an evidential burden in relation to matters that ought to be proved by the prosecution.</para><para>Government amendments (13) and (14), as presented by the minister, deal with the offences of `possessing things connected with terrorist acts' and `collecting or making documents likely to facilitate terrorist acts'. The provisions provide that a person does not commit the offence if he or she does not intend to facilitate `preparation for, the engagement of a person in, or assistance in a terrorist act'. They are structured in such a way that the defendant bears an evidential burden requiring her or him to point to evidence that tends to disprove intent. This is, I must say, an unusual approach to intent. In relation to murder and other serious offences, intent is always an element of the offence, and that ensures that the prosecution bears the onus of proving intent. There is no justification for imposing an evidential burden on defendants in relation to the disproof of intent. We Democrats therefore propose these amendments, as they are intended to address just that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>2590</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—For the record, the government opposes Democrats amendments (3) to (6) as it believes that they will detract from the purpose of the provisions in the bill. The government, in relation to Democrat amendment (3), says that it would provide that the offence of possessing things connected with terrorism does not apply if the person did not intend to facilitate `preparation for, engagement in, or assistance in terrorism'. The government also proposes that cases where there is this lack of intent be excluded from the offence but by way of a defence. The government's approach will ensure a defendant cannot escape conviction on a technicality but must instead have some evidence of having no intent to facilitate or engage in terrorism.</para></talk.start><para>This is in the context of the recasting of the offence under government amendments so that the prosecution must, in any case, prove the defendant's knowledge or recklessness as to the thing being connected to terrorism—that is, the defence is in addition to the main elements of the offence. The government's approach in casting this as a defence is consistent with the United Kingdom Terrorism Act 2000. If evidence is raised by the defendant, the prosecution must then disprove the defence in addition to all elements of the offence beyond reasonable doubt. We believe the government's approach provides a fair and balanced outcome, which is why the government will not support Democrats amendment (3).

It is much like conspiracy. The offence of conspiracy involves two or more people agreeing to commit a criminal act. With conspiracy, the act does not have to o-ccur, just the agreement to do it. So this is nothing really unusual. In fact, in the Criminal Code and other jurisdictions you have attempted criminal acts. That involves a preparation and a carrying out of your intention but your intention is not fulfilled, it is thwarted in some way, and you can be guilty of an attempt. Section 101.6 covers those preliminary actions.

From my experience and involvement in the committee process, proscription has been the most contentiously debated and discussed point of this particular suite of bills. This Democrat amendment proposes to remove division 102, which deals with proscribed organisations. As the legislation stands, the proscription power it contains is arbitrary in the extreme. The power is excessively broad and not adequately subject to review. One of the grounds on which the Attorney-General may proscribe an organisation is if it poses a danger to the security or integrity of the Commonwealth or another country, as proposed in section 102.2. Professor George Williams, Director of the Gilbert and Tobin Centre for Public Law, argued the following:</para><quote><para>While the reference, in section 102.2(d), to the security of the Commonwealth or another country is broad, the reference to the integrity of the Commonwealth or another country is almost meaningless.</para></quote><para>The New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties made the following point:</para><quote><para>Many respectable organisations regularly threaten the security of other countries in their legitimate activities to achieve democracy or the preservation of the rule of law.

The illegality of providing assistance to a proscribed organisation is incredibly vague and imposes potential criminal liability on an indeterminate set of people many of whom would not know they were doing anything wrong. </para><para>It is inappropriate in the extreme that the power to proscribe organisations should rest solely in the hands of one member of the Executive Government. It is an arbitrary power with very significant potential for abuse. ... </para><para>Furthermore, it is of great concern that the legislation does not adequately provide for review of the Attorney-General's decision to proscribe an organisation. Wherever there is a concentration of arbitrary power it ought to be checked. There is no mechanism for reviewing the merits of a decision to proscribe an organisation.</para></quote><para>The government and opposition each have amendments to this proscription process— developed with a view to making the proscription process less arbitrary. We Democrats have a fundamental problem with proscription and the notion of prescription and, more specifically, with the consequent criminalisation of membership of an organisation. Punishing mere membership of an organisation is determining guilt by association and should be opposed. Not all members of an organisation share the intentions or support the activities of other members. It is worth noting that under the government's amendments the definition of a terrorist organisation remains very broad. It would include organisations that indirectly foster the doing of a terrorist act whether or not the terrorist act occurs. Certainly those groups that directly or indirectly participate in terrorism or even in its planning can rightly be described as terrorist organisations. Even those which directly foster terrorism, through advocacy or other means, may be considered terrorist organisations.</para><para>But indirectly fostering terrorist acts would seem to create the possibility of organisations being deemed terrorist organisations simply on the basis of a reasonably tenuous link with any terrorist act that does—or, as the case may be, does not—occur. For example, a group may aggressively but not violently advocate a political position. If a person took violent action on the basis of that advocacy, could it be considered that the organisation fostered that action? They may not have done so directly, but the legislation requires only that they foster it indirectly. We can hope that prosecutors will exercise discretion responsibly or that the courts will give a restrictive meaning to the provisions; however, it would be far preferable if the provisions of the legislation were more tightly drafted to ensure that they did not extend to groups not genuinely involved in terrorism. This is somewhat of an aside because, as I say, the Democrats oppose any measure which would put people in jail simply for being associated with an organisation. Under this legislation they need only be an informal member or a person who has taken steps to become a member of the organisation. In point of fact, the government's amendments ensure that a person can be jailed for 25 years for being associated with, but not a member of, an organisation deemed to be terrorist. We would far prefer that the government deal with the actual criminal conduct rather than relying on guilt by association and, for that reason, we advocate this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>2594</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I need some encouragement if I am to support this particular provision in the bill, and I refer to proposed section 102.

Why indeed is proscription necessary? Is it to pre-empt the commission of terrorist offences? If that were the case and with a proscription order against an organisation, what is to prevent that organisation from reconstituting itself? I am directing these remarks particularly to the Minister for Justice and Customs, Senator Ellison, through you, Mr Temporary Chairman. For example, if you proscribe an organisation, what is there within the legislation that would prevent the organisation from reconstituting itself? Is the proscription necessary for capturing persons who would not otherwise be captured by the terrorist offences? Is that a reason for proscription? Why would that be the case? If that is the reason that the government is proposing proscription, why is it? Why is it necessary to have proscription controlled by the executive rather than the judiciary? Going further, why are there no provisions allowing an individual or an organisation to object and make submissions in relation to pending proscriptions? These are some of the things that are exercising my mind. I am wondering whether the minister might put my mind at rest on those particular matters. I am really wondering why it is necessary to have proscription in this legislation. Obviously, the government has a very valid reason or certain reasons which might appeal to the committee, but for the life of me at the moment I cannot see why there is need for proscription. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>2595</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats are suggesting we do away with proposed division 102, which is entitled `Proscribed organisations'.

I suggest to Senator Harradine that we should wait until we get to the government and opposition amendments and then we can deal with the amendments at hand.

Let me say from the outset that when you proscribe an organisation you send it underground. When you send it underground, you make it more difficult to pursue its activities and the people who are members of it—that is the first issue. The second issue is that, under this legislation, even with the amendments foreshadowed by the government, it becomes a matter of banning organisations which are very difficult to define. The measures that the government has in mind, as amended, are very unsatisfactory. I point to the provisions that a United Nations list might be used by the Attorney-General to ban an organisation. When you look at the process involved there, it is banned by the United Nations Security Council. It is not by resolution of the council itself that an organisation is banned; it is by a reference to a process that the council has set up. I am told that that process is as loose as the potential for organisations to be nominated by a member of the United Nations Security Council and then, if there is no objection within a certain number of days, they are listed. Are we to follow through and ban organisations on a list made by a committee in the United Nations Security Council—a process which can be very openly abused by any member of the security council, including China? </para></talk.start><para>There is no appeal in this process. The organisations themselves are not given the opportunity to come forward and say: `We are being set up here. We are not a terrorist organisation. Have a look at us; hear our side of the story.' If members believe that all the governments who are involved in sending delegations to the Security Council are beyond listing organisations as terrorist organisations that we would not list, then they need to look again. For example, the Chinese government believe that Falun Gong is a threat to the state and is a terrorist organisation. As I said earlier, they even go to the absurdity of listing the Dalai Lama as a criminal. We know he is not. We know that, if there is one human being on this planet who can be defined as being good and the antithesis of criminal, it is the Dalai Lama—but not for the Chinese government. </para><para>So then you only have to go one step further to look at people who might be peacefully promoting the cause of independence or freedom or civil liberties in Tibet or in other parts of China to see how readily such organisations could be listed as terrorist—totally unfairly, totally against our ideas of what is terrorist and what is not—and then it is up to the Attorney-General to follow that through. We might say that there are checks and balances involved there and no Attorney-General would do that. I will go back to what many people—and what eminent legal people—appearing before the committee that looked into this matter said: you do not leave legislation like this open to looseness and to the potential future abuse by a government and hope that does not happen. It is a fatal mistake to do that.</para><para>Terrorism, as it is understood by most of us—and certainly by most of the Australian community—is an involvement in a criminal activity. We are talking here about proscribing criminal organisations which may be involved in criminal activity. I believe the criminals should be caught. The people who are going to be involved in violence or death or injury, or in planning such deeds, need to be apprehended. But as I have said repeatedly in this committee, there is ample opportunity and we have great laws already in place for surveillance and for apprehension of people who are involved in criminal activities, or prospective criminal activities, in this country. </para><para>But this legislation allows the Attorney-General of the day to proscribe Australian organisations which he or she believes are, or are intending to be, terrorist organisations. That has awesome implications for every member of that organisation. I believe that in the circumstances of 1951 the Communist Party would have been thus labelled. I do not think it is very difficult to see us moving to that situation again when not only the Communist Party but also, with this legislation, a whole range of unions would have been listed as terrorist organisations, as would a range of community groups during the Vietnam moratorium period and the Wilderness Society during the Franklin Dam episode. During that episode a number of members of this parliament asked for the Army to be brought in, seeing it as a national emergency and seeing that organisation as planning a process of protest which would lead to violence. It never did. The planning was never there but, nevertheless, the political judgment was that this was effectively an act of terrorism.</para><para>The principle here should be that you track down the individual, you watch what they are doing, you prevent them and you apprehend them under the existing law. We are opposed to this legislation, but we are mightily opposed to this particular provision. The idea of proscription, of banning organisations, is not part of the Australian tradition. Once again I point to the fact that the one time the Australian populace were given an opportunity to state their feeling on this matter—that is, the Communist Party referendum just over half a century ago—despite the circumstances then of the Korean War and Stalin, who still had a year left in him, the Australian people said no. I do not believe that we should be saying, `Let the Attorney-General from here on in supplant the Australian people and decide who may or may not be listed as a terrorist.' Nor should we—and I am a great supporter of the United Nations—let some committee of the Security Council of the United Nations make a list so that the Attorney-General here can follow it through, with no right of appeal and none of the checks and balances that we would consider essential in this country. </para><para>I have a very long list of individuals and organisations that are opposed to proscription in this legislation. I am not going to read them all out but I am going to list some of them. Some of them are: the Executive Council of Australian Jewry, the Women's International League for Peace and Freedom Australia, the New South Wales Council for Civil Liberties, the Federation of Community Legal Centres in Victoria, the New South Wales Bar Association, the Australian Arabic Council, the Ethnic Communities Council of Victoria, the Islamic Council of Victoria, the Young People's Legal Rights Centre, the New South Wales Law Reform Commission, the Australian Council of Trade Unions, the New South Wales Privacy Commission, Liberty Victoria—the Victorian Council of Civil Liberties, the Fitzroy Legal Centre, the National Association of Community Legal Centres, the Redfern Legal Centre, the Women's Rights Action Network Association, the Adults Advisory Council Tasmanian Commission for Children, the Law Institute of Victoria—Young Lawyers Section, Amnesty International Australia, the Association of Criminal Defence Lawyers, the Human Rights Council of Australia, the Supreme Islamic Council of New South Wales, Greenpeace, the Public Interest Advocacy Centre, the Australian Catholic Social Justice Council, the Australian Council for Civil Liberties, the Law Council of Australia, Quaker Peace and Justice New South Wales, the United Nations Association of Australia, the Australian Lawyers for Human Rights, the Franciscan Missionaries of Mary, and many others—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—And the Australian Labor Party.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>QD4</name.id><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name></talker><para>—and the Australian Labor Party, the Australian Greens and the Australian Democrats.

But I do accept, as other senators do, that this is an absolutely crucial part of the package that we are dealing with. I want to make absolutely clear from the outset, as I think I have done and all Labor speakers have done in the second reading debate on these bills, and as has been a consistent position of our party for decades, that the Labor Party is implacably opposed to an executive proscription regime. </para></talk.start><para>As we look at the amendment before the chair, we actually have another threshold issue to consider. It is one thing to have a very strong commitment in relation to a proscription regime, but the committee has to make this assessment: do we believe it is appropriate for Australian law to contain offences in relation to terrorist organisations? Proscription is a threshold issue, I absolutely agree; but so is that a threshold issue. The problem with the amendment that is currently before the committee is that, if it is passed, there will be no offences in relation to terrorist organisations. It means that, if you are very actively involved in directing a terrorist organisation, that is no offence. There is no penalty. The weakness of the amendment is it removes the chance of any offences in relation to terrorist organisations—for example, even something as straightforward as directing a terrorist organisation. That is something that I do not believe this Senate or this parliament should contemplate.</para><para>Having said that, I absolutely accept that we have a responsibility to deal with the proposal that the government has put forward in relation to its proposed proscription regime. It would be churlish not to acknowledge, in the position now encompassed by the government, that is has moved considerably from its original position. In the view of the opposition, it has not moved anywhere near enough. We do not support, and will never support, any proposal for an executive proscription regime. That is something the government continues to argue for; it is, in the view of the opposition, absolutely unacceptable. We do not support giving the wide and arbitrary powers that are proposed in this legislation to any minister of any government. We know that those sorts of powers are open to abuse. We also know that even the current government has certainly demonstrated a capacity to abuse the existing powers that it has. But is not just about the current government; in fact, this committee has to ensure that we do not write a blank cheque for future governments in relation to any proscription regime. </para><para>In the Labor Party, we have always had concerns about this issue. We know that these sorts of proscription regimes, as proposed by the government, have traditionally been a tool of repression. And we in the Labor Party say they have traditionally been a tool of repression in the hands of conservative governments. That is the situation with proscription regimes: a tool of repression, not a tool of law enforcement. </para><para>There has been some talk already in this committee debate about the motivation for Robert Menzies' attempt to ban the Communist Party in the 1950s. The motivation was very simple: it was to spear the Labor Party; it was to damage the Labor Party. As I said to Senator Brown earlier—it seems like weeks ago, but I suspect it was only 24 hours ago in this committee stage debate—in the early 1950s, the vast majority of Australians did not like communists, they did not like communism, but they voted Menzies' referendum down. Why did they do that? Because they knew such a proposal was antidemocratic and inconsistent with fundamental Australian values—and they were right.</para><para>Understanding that over a long period of time the Labor Party has adopted a very strong, very consistent and very principled position, we still say it is appropriate to have offences in Australian law in relation to terrorist organisations—but we do not accept the capacity of a minister in the Australian government to proscribe organisations, to ban organisations. We just do not accept what is now the third limb of the government's proscription regime which I acknowledged previously was the only limb—even of itself, in a very different form—of the government's proposal in relation to these matters. I will speak at greater length about these matters in a short while.</para><para>I accept many of the weaknesses that other speakers in this committee stage debate have identified in relation to executive proscription regimes. There is no doubt that in dealing with terrorist organisations in the modern world, they change their form, they change their nature and they certainly change their names. But we ought to take the responsibility of targeting the terrorists. Those people who are involved in terrorism and terrorist activities should feel the full force of the law in this country. We have to have laws that can deal with them. We do not want inappropriate laws, like an executive proscription regime, but we need to have laws that will deal with offences in relation to terrorist organisations.</para><para>It is for that reason, while we cannot support Senator Grieg's amendment, we certainly will take an approach in relation to this important element of the debate on this package of counterterrorism bills to ensure that the principles I have enunciated are included in the legislation. Do not forget: this legislation has already been massively amended by the government. There has been such a significant change in relation to the way the government has approached this issue; I acknowledge that. The only proposal the government had in its original bill— sloppily and incompetently drafted as it was—was in relation to a totally unacceptable executive proscription regime. As I have said, as far as the Labor Party is concerned, all executive proscription regimes are unacceptable. </para><para>The government now has a regime with three limbs—limb 1 is an organisation found by a court to be engaged in a terrorist act, limb 2 is an organisation which the United Nations Security Council has found to be an international terrorist organisation and limb 3, which remains the amended proposal of the government, is an organisation which the Attorney-General is satisfied, on reasonable grounds, is engaged in a terrorist act. Though we want to ensure that those who commit offences in relation to terrorist organisations are dealt with, we will not and cannot contemplate a proposal from the government that includes an executive proscription regime. In our party's view that is anti-Labor. But that is not the crucial point. The point is: it is antidemocratic. It runs the risk of seriously abrogating the rights, the liberties and the freedoms of Australians. </para><para>In other words, if the government's proposal is accepted we run the risk of criminalising what people think and the organisation they might happen to join because they have some sense of commitment. We want to make sure that those people who are engaged in terrorist activity suffer the consequences. That is as it should be. Target the terrorists. Focus on terrorists and terrorist related activity by all means, but do not adopt a proposition that is open to manipulation by a government of any political persuasion either now or in the future. It is unacceptable to any decent person, and that element of the government's proposal is absolutely unacceptable to the Australian Labor Party.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>2599</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—A few minutes ago Senator Brown said that banning political organisations in Australia was not the Australian way. Historically, of course, he is totally inaccurate. He often talks, and so does Senator Faulkner, about what happened in 1951. Let's go back 11 years before that. Let's go back to 1940 when all communist parties in Australia were declared illegal. That happened with the Menzies government on 27 May 1940 when it was resolved to declare all communist organisations illegal. That bungling Menzies government took another two weeks to get their regulations right to be able to enforce this, which gave the Communist Party two weeks to go underground. They all burnt their tickets, all the membership lists were burnt, the printing presses were moved out and they all went underground. They had underground organisers to take them. A lot of them did not go underground very well. A lot of them had their libraries chosen. One of the great elements of humour in Australian politics is to see what the police in fact seized. They seized the works of Shakespeare in some cases and left the entire works of Karl Marx on the bookshelves in others—another reason why you should never have special branches in this country.</para></talk.start><para>The banning of that political party lasted over 30 months. What it did was drive their activities underground. Their newspapers still came out, even though they were a banned organisation, and on they went. At the end of that 30-month period, the membership of the Community Party trebled. So much for the success of banning it as an organisation. It has to be said that the major increase in that membership occurred in the latter period. When you look back on the sordid history, the tawdry history, of the Communist Party of Australia, it is almost too pathetic to contemplate. There they were in 1936 and 1937 forming the popular fronts with other like-minded organisations in the march against fascism. But as soon as Ribbentrop and Molotov came to their agreement in 1939 any conflict became a conflict between capitalists.</para><para>The fascists were no longer the enemies. They almost did not exist; they were only a capitalist bloc then for the next two years. The moment Operation Barbarossa was launched it became a workers' cause versus the fascist forces again. Talk about backflips. I do not know how any of them could have rationalised that out. Fascism is the enemy; then fascism is no longer the enemy and suddenly it is the enemy again. I do not know how they ever salved their own conscience at the degree of military cooperation occurring between Stalin and Hitler from 1936 right through to 1941. That is a historical fact. Most of the German pilots did their training or learnt to fly in the Soviet Union. In many ways, it is surprising that the Communist Party could have trebled its membership when it was banned, but it did so. That just goes to prove that banning political organisations has very little chance of success. What it does is give them a bit of excitement sometimes. The clandestine nature of it means that they are in a better recruiting position. The other thing they were masters of was going and setting up front organisations—the Australian-Soviet Friendship Society, a quasi-independent body full of communists trying to manipulate the labour movement as a whole. </para><para>What comes out of all this? I will conclude on this note: who did fight the communists in the 1940s in Australia? It was not Menzies. It was not the conservative parties. It was the people in the Labor Party from the Left and Right. They are the ones who had to bear the burden of fighting the communists in the unions and all like-minded organisations while their political opponents, the Liberals, merely used it as a new 1940 wedge issue. It has a bit of resonance today when you go back and look at the political debates and see how Menzies and his cohorts exploited it as a political issue, but they never got their hands dirty. They would recommend bans. That is all they would do; they would not get into the trenches and fight the communists where they had to be fought in the trade unions. When you think of the many Labor people who were pilloried by communists, who had their reputations tarnished by them, it is a great pity, and we should reassert today that the reputations of those Labor people remain untarnished.</para><para>Look at one example in the 1940s: Lloyd Ross. I am certain Senator Faulkner knows the history of Lloyd Ross far better than I do. He was a member of the Communist Party. He found it fairly hard to accept that all of a sudden in August 1939 Stalin and Hitler could sign a nonaggression pact. When he saw the troops marching down the Champs Elysees and he eventually decided to say, `Enough is enough, we have to support the war effort; we have to be patriotic,' what did the Communist Party of Australia do? They expelled him from the party. They called him a middle-class intellectual who had gone over to the other camp as a class collaborator. That is what they said. </para><para>Banning these particular political parties I do not think achieves the end that you really want. It will probably be the same with terrorist organisations. They will simply go underground and be undetectable. So it is not a very sensible approach. I do not want to go over and over again the right of the Attorney-General to do this. Some of us may have confidence in him, some of us may not, but the real point is that we do not know who will follow him. We do not know if it will be Attorney-General Tony Abbott. Imagine giving him proscription powers. It is really not on.</para><para>I wanted to get up at least to say to Senator Brown that, when you say this is not the Australian way, unfortunately it is. We have tried it in the past. It has failed abysmally in the past. It did not succeed. I know that a lot of people these days dismiss the communists of the 1940s as slightly misguided people— really good deep down, and all the rest. They would have signed death warrants with both hands at the same time—every one of them. People naively went to the Soviet Union, saw the abysmal conditions there but praised communism to the skies. Meanwhile, whole groups of ethnic minorities were being shipped off to Siberia, never to be seen again. That is the sort of thing that we have to try to contemplate when we are considering the naivety of the Attorney-General here. He probably would have gone off to the Soviet Union himself and said that the gulags were a nice holiday camp—but they were not. The lesson from history is: the only time we banned or proscribed political parties, it simply did not work. If it did not work then, I doubt it will work today.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>2600</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Ray for those comments, because I totally agree with him. His recounting of history is correct. But his argument totally backs Senator Greig's amendment: let us get rid of proscription. When I said that it was not the Australian way, I meant that I did not agree that what Mr Menzies was trying to do in 1940-41 was the Australian way. In fact, Australians dumped on that a decade later. That is the problem with this amendment and any variety of it. It concerns me that the Labor Party is considering entertaining a variety of it, because it is open to manipulation. Do not proscribe the organisation; track down and get the criminals, if criminals are involved— get the people who are involved. That is the way to go. Senator Ray agrees that, if you proscribe organisations, they will go underground; they will take different forms. You will spend a lot of time chasing the organisations, when you should be getting the individuals who, we are concerned, will maim, mutilate and devastate other people's lives as an outcome of terrorism. That is what this legislation is about. </para></talk.start><para>I reiterate that, as it stands, we have very strong laws to track down and apprehend such individuals. I do not believe this legislation is necessary. I believe it has a lot of dangers attached to it, and proscription is one of the kernels of the matter. I agree with the previous two speakers: we should not have proscription. It will be used politically. There will come a time when, if passed into law, this power of proscription will be abused. Even if we give the parliament a veto power—require there to be an ordinance or regulation so that either house of parliament can knock it out—are we going to write in here that, before the parliament agrees to proscribe an organisation, the rights of the people in that organisation will be upheld? Are we going to turn ourselves into a court? Are we going to cross that divide? We are elected politicians; we are not judge and jury. Where is the mechanism for the right of an organisation, which has been or is about to be proscribed, to defend itself, to have its hearing and to have its democratic rights upheld? Such a mechanism does not exist. We should not be entertaining this matter of proscription.</para><para>We heard two sterling speeches before my speech on why we should not have proscription. I ask the Labor Party to reconsider entertaining it at all. The best way for us to deal with this is to support this amendment. Sure, that will mean changes will have to be made to the rest of the legislation—if you must have the legislation. Those changes would concentrate the legislation on going for those people who are terrorists or planning terrorism, instead of going for organisations that might be labelled as terrorists and have all their members effectively put under that label by a banning mechanism with no court, no jury and no defence. We should not be allowing proscription under this legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>2601</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The excellent speeches by Senator Faulkner, Senator Ray and Senator Brown referred to the legislative history of the proscription positions that have been adopted in Australia.

The Labor Party has a very proud history of defending Australia during the war, and then of bringing it out of the war and creating it in the fashion in which it appears to this day. Think about immigration, the Snowy Mountains River scheme, the Holden motor car—it goes on and on. The agenda set then has been pursued, to Australia's good fortune, since that time.</para></talk.start><para>The institution that turned back the use of proscription power in 1950 was the High Court. It would be interesting to see what they would have said about the proscription power as it was originally put forward in this legislation. I think we have to pay some tribute to the High Court at that time and to the courts today. The courts are under attack by the government, and it is well and proper to remember the position they play in keeping this a democratic society, whether in the area of migration legislation, industrial legislation or what have you.</para><para>If you look at, say, chief justices like Michael Black of the Federal Court, you understand what I mean. I have paid tribute before to Ted Laurie. He was a person I knew and who appeared in the Communist Party dissolution case before the High Court. When the lawyers went in there, they thought that the High Court would not take the approach that it did. They thought that the High Court would crumble, as it were, under the culture of the day, under the thinking of the day and under the pressure of the day, but that court stood up—and the courts do stand up, and it is great to see. But this parliament can also stand up. As I make these final few speeches, I confess that the approach taken by the parliament and by the Labor Party on this issue is something that I can go out on and remember with considerable pride.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Alan (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Ferguson)</inline>—The question is that division 102 stand as printed.</para></talk.start><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>2602</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move government amendment (16) on sheet DT340: </para></talk.start><quote><para>(16)	Schedule 1, item 4, page 12 (lines 12 to 24), omit Subdivision A, substitute:</para></quote><para><inline font-style="italic">Subdivision A—Definitions</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">102.1  Definitions</inline></para><quote><para>	(1)	In this Division:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">member </inline>of an organisation includes:</para><para>	(a)	a person who is an informal member of the organisation; and</para><para>	(b)	a person who has taken steps to become a member of the organisation; and</para><para>	(c)	in the case of an organisation that is a body corporate—a director or an officer of the body corporate.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">recruit</inline> includes induce, incite and encourage.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">terrorist organisation</inline> means:</para><para>	(a)	an organisation that is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act occurs); or</para><para>	(b)	an organisation that is specified by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph (see subsections (2) and (4)); or</para><para>	(c)	an organisation that is specified by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph (see subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6)).</para><para>	(2)	Before the Governor-General makes a regulation specifying an organisation for the purposes of paragraph (b) of the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">terrorist organisation</inline> in this section, the Minister must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur).</para><para>	(3)	Before the Governor-General makes a regulation specifying an organisation for the purposes of paragraph (c) of the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">terrorist organisation</inline> in this section, the Minister must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that:</para><para>	(a)	the Security Council of the United Nations has made a decision relating wholly or partly to terrorism; and</para><para>	(b)	the organisation is identified in the decision, or using a mechanism established under the decision, as an organisation to which the decision relates; and</para><para>	(c)	the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur).</para><para>	(4)	Regulations for the purposes of paragraph (b) or (c) of the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">terrorist organisation</inline> in this section may not take effect earlier than the day after the last day on which they may be disallowed under section 48 of the <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</inline>.

We are replacing division 102—the proscriptions that have been mentioned in debate—and we are basically defining a terrorist organisation because, if it is an offence to belong to a terrorist organisation, you have to firstly define a terrorist organisation. So the first limb, if you like, is in paragraph (a) of our amendment:</para><quote><para>... an organisation that is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act occurs) ...</para></quote><para>That will be decided by a court. That involves a trial process, one which would have the prosecution proving it beyond a reasonable doubt. I do not think the opposition is complaining about that one.</para><para>The second limb is that an organisation that is specified by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph is a terrorist organisation, and that relates to listing by the Attorney-General. It is the second limb that involves the Attorney-General, not the third, as mentioned by Senator Faulkner. That is the one that much has been made of by the opposition. The opposition says it is undemocratic. Let me make it absolutely clear: there is nothing undemocratic about this limb of the government's proposal. Firstly, in subsection (2):</para><quote><para>... the Minister must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur).</para></quote><para>That is the first requirement. It goes on in subsection (4):</para><quote><para>	(4)	Regulations for the purposes of paragraph (b) or (c) of the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">terrorist organisation</inline> in this section may not take effect earlier than the day after the last day on which they may be disallowed under section 48 of the <inline font-style="italic">Acts Interpretation Act 1901</inline>.</para></quote><para>That is saying that if the Attorney-General does act after the reasonable grounds have been established then that regulation does not take effect until the day after disallowance, thereby giving added security to the scrutiny of parliament. That is what the opposition is missing—the fact that the regulation is subject to disallowance. There is nothing undemocratic about that. In fact, important regulations are made every day in the Commonwealth's jurisdiction, and we have seen just recently that our regulations can be disallowed by this very chamber. So what you have is the purview of the parliament with the added security of the regulation not taking effect until the day after disallowance—and that is 15 sitting days, as we know. That can encompass a lengthy period of time during which the regulation would not take effect.</para><para>Another safeguard is judicial review. Judicial review is also open in relation to the exercise of the minister's responsibilities, because we have stated at the outset:</para><quote><para>... the Minister must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur).</para></quote><para>You have not just parliamentary scrutiny but also judicial review. And when you do come to review the minister's actions, those actions have to be on reasonable grounds. It spells out in subsection (2) what the minister must look at. So there are requirements made of the minister, and the minister is subject to the scrutiny of the parliament and judicial review. When the opposition very glibly says that this is giving power to the Attorney-General to ban organisations—and it implies that this could happen willy-nilly—it does not paint the whole picture. It is convenient, of course, for the opposition to do that, because it does not serve its purpose.</para><para>There are strict safeguards in relation to our second limb. Any regulation made by the minister in this case also ceases to have effect after two years so that you have a limited lifespan in relation to those regulations. These are requirements which do not normally accompany the making of regulations: the taking effect after the last day for disallowance and the fact that they only last for two years, and of course you normally have judicial review and the scrutiny of parliament. The third limb in relation to a terrorist organisation states in subsection (c):  </para><quote><para>an organisation that is specified by the regulations for the purposes of this paragraph (see subsections (3), (4), (5) and (6)).</para></quote><para>Subsection (3) says that, before the Governor-General makes a regulation under this limb which would specify an organisation as being a terrorist organisation, the minister must be satisfied on reasonable grounds that:</para><quote><para>(a) the Security Council of the United Nations has made a decision relating wholly or partly to terrorism; and </para><para>(b) the organisation is identified in the decision, or using a mechanism established under the decision as an organisation to which the decision relates; and </para><para>(c) the organisation is directly or indirectly engaged in preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not that terrorist act has occurred or will occur). </para></quote><para>Again, extensive requirements are made of the minister. But of course you have in this third limb the additional involvement of the Security Council of the United Nations. I notice that the opposition does not take issue with that.</para><para>We have here a comprehensive suite of measures for dealing with terrorist organisations. We have done away with proscription and we have created offences in relation to terrorist organisations. These terrorists organisations can be determined in a number of ways. It is very important that we have a provision in this bill which deals with terrorist organisations. If you have a terrorist organisation which meets the requirements as spelt out in this bill—that is, it is involved `directly or indirectly in planning, preparing or assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act'—the government would argue that that organisation should be listed. It should be put on notice to the public at large so that no-one would join it. If we allowed a terrorist organisation to exist per se, people would be free to join it—and perhaps unwittingly join it. It is the responsibility of the government to place the public on notice in relation to terrorist organisations. On this point I think the opposition is not in disagreement with the government. It is very important that the government do this. If the government did not, it would be irresponsible, and it would be criticised for not doing that.</para><para>We have in place three mechanisms for determining a terrorist organisation—one, by a court, established beyond a reasonable doubt; two, by the minister, after reasonable grounds have been made out in the way that I have described, subject to the scrutiny of parliament and judicial review; and, three, the involvement of the Security Council of the United Nations. We believe that these measures provide a balance. They provide security and an assurance for those people who are concerned that this great power could be abused and that there is not a check to it. The government says there is. What it does provide, importantly, is an important tool in the fight against terrorism and terrorist organisations. This is not an undemocratic provision; it is one which is loaded with safeguards and one which is directly in the interests of Australia in protecting Australia against terrorist organisations.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>2604</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Could the minister explain what is meant by the word `informal' in the definition of a member of an organisation under section 102.1?

Obviously, terrorist organisations will not be advertising their membership lists or conducting themselves as community organisations operate. If you join a community organisation, you get a receipt for your membership and they keep records. In fact, under the various incorporation of association acts some of them have to. We are providing here for a situation where you have an organisation which very well has members, and it certainly has members who are active. They know who they are. Because of the clandestine operation of those organisations they do not have lists and they do not have formal applications. I can tell you that in relation to some criminal gangs that is very much the case. They carry out their initiations in a very formal sense but there is no formal membership. I will not go into that for operational reasons, but I can tell the Senate that that is very much the case in some criminal gangs operating in Australia. This is a very important provision, because most terrorist organisations would not have formal membership as we know it. </para><para>In relation to the question about the Security Council of the United Nations, I believe that stems from resolution 1373, which deals with this. I will take some advice on that. I think Senator Brown is asking about the process of how the Security Council comes to determine that an organisation is a terrorist organisation. That, as I understand it, is on the basis that the UN will only list such an organisation if there is widespread international support. There is also an objection process in relation to the UN Security Council, and it is subject to the regulations I mentioned previously. In subsection (3), which I read to the Senate earlier, not only does the decision have to be made by the Security Council of the United Nations but also that organisation still has to be:</para><quote><para>... directly or indirectly engaged in, preparing, planning, assisting in or fostering the doing of a terrorist act (whether or not the terrorist act has occurred or will occur).</para></quote><para>As well as that, that regulation is disallowable and will stand for only two years because of the sunset provisions I have mentioned.

In response to strong objections to the government's proposed proscription regime from not only the opposition but also the Senate committee and the wider community, we have before the chamber now a proposal which puts forward a regime with three alternative limbs. It is worth reminding ourselves of the government's proposal: limb 1 is an organisation found by a court to be engaged in a terrorist act, limb 2 is an organisation which is the subject of a decision by the United Nations Security Council that it is an international terrorist organisation, and limb 3 is an organisation which the Attorney-General is satisfied on reasonable grounds is engaged in a terrorist act. Of those, limbs 2 and 3 require that the Attorney-General make a regulation and do not take effect until the disallowance period has expired. The government has said that such a decision would also be open to judicial review. I indicated earlier in this committee stage debate the very serious concerns the opposition has that the government's approach still includes an executive discretion to proscribe organisations.</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>2606</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

The Vinson report— and Professor Vinson is very highly regarded in New South Wales and has been for many years—was highly critical of the Carr government's stewardship of the New South Wales public school system, particularly the fact that—and this is the devastating point— compared with all the other states the Carr government is at the bottom of the table on virtually any measure. It is the combination over many years of neglect in spending that has put the New South Wales schools at the bottom of the class, let us say, as compared with the other states. If the New South Wales government had matched on a pro rata basis the spending of the federal government it would have put in another $202 million. Of course, it has not done that. It is really dragging the chain when it comes to matching the money put into the public school system by the federal government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>If the Carr government had been fair dinkum about a commitment to education, we would have seen much higher levels of spending in recent budgets and therefore the solution to many of the problems in this state. Despite the government's claim that it is spending another $494 million in its budget, when you look at the figures properly—and the Hon. Patricia Forsythe, the shadow minister for education and training, has certainly done this—you will discover that, for schools and TAFEs combined, the increase is a paltry $46 across this massive system, nowhere near keeping pace with inflation. Despite the government's widely proclaimed school improvement package and despite calls from the public education community for more support, funding was slashed by $100 million from what was promised in the previous budget.</para><para>This year the Carr government's appalling record on public education was exposed. The Vinson inquiry into public education was not sponsored by the Carr government. This was not an inquiry into public education by the government; this was an inquiry by the Teachers Federation and the New South Wales Parents and Citizens Associations— the P&amp;Cs. They were so concerned at what was happening in our schools in New South Wales they set up their own inquiry, chaired by the very distinguished Professor Tony Vinson of the University of New South Wales. This involved consulting staff, students, parents and carers in the course of the inquiry and visiting 136 schools and examining 760 written submissions received from parents, teachers, students and interested members of the public. I underline the fact that this inquiry into New South Wales public schools was established by outside organisations, not the government. </para><para>Two topics of current interest which came into the spotlight in this inquiry were teacher professionalism, curriculum and pedagogy, and the foundations for effective learning, including the question of appropriate class sizes. This inquiry has exposed the shortcomings of the Carr government's stewardship of public education in New South Wales. One of the most devastating conclusions in the Vinson report was the proven low morale of teachers in the New South Wales public school system. Despite this damning finding, the New South Wales budget that has just been brought down ignored this problem completely. The shadow minister for education and training, the Hon. Patricia Forsythe, said:</para><quote><para>Michael Egan was right when he called it a Labor Budget, it is one that has let workers down. The low morale of teachers highlighted in the Vinson Report will not be improved by this budget.</para></quote><para>As a result of teachers having low morale, students, schools and therefore the entire education system is in this situation. In the Vinson report, teachers also outlined concerns that were the cause of the low morale. The Carr government really must take urgent steps to put this right. Tony Vinson said:</para><quote><para>Teachers want to establish a clear focus on learning as the core task of the public education system.</para></quote><para>It came out very clearly in the Vinson inquiry that we currently have a school system which forces teachers to be `jacks of all trades'. Teachers are being pulled away from their primary role in order to be able to complete additional tasks apart from teaching. These tasks include working as road safety officers, psychologists, social workers, medical practitioners, technicians and administrators. They are doing all these things. From the hundreds of submissions to the inquiry, it was shown that this was taking up to 40 per cent of the teacher's time. Rather than concentrating on the children and effective learning, they were spending a lot of their time actually dealing with welfare problems—and they are doing this as an act of goodwill.</para><para>Maree O'Halloran, President of the New South Wales Teachers Federation, said that teachers were `running around schools with spanners' acting as technical workers. In relation to these tasks, the Vinson report referred to these teachers as `self-taught amateurs'. The most severe cases involved schools in country New South Wales which at times saw teachers paying for classroom materials out of their own pockets because of the shortage of funds and resources. The Carr government must provide funding to improve this situation and stop making empty promises.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Kumantjay Tjapaltjarri</title><title>Big Bill Neidfle</title><page.no>2608</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Big Bill Neidfle</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>2608</page.no><name role="metadata">Crossin, Sen Trish</name><name role="display">Senator CROSSIN</name><name.id>7Y6</name.id><electorate>Northern Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I rise to pay my respects on the passing of two distinguished Indigenous Territorians who, in their own very different ways, made their mark on the landscape of this country. I use the word `landscape' for an important reason: because it was their land and their connection to it that shaped the course of each of their lives and also shaped our nation and its identity— a nation that now recognises the long history of occupation of the land and the valuable knowledge of traditional owners in managing the land; a nation which increasingly recognises and celebrates the rich cultural heritage of the Indigenous peoples of this country, which is increasingly associated with Australia's identity abroad.</para></talk.start><para>Firstly, I would like to take this opportunity to mourn the passing of one of Australia's most renowned Indigenous artists, Kumantjay Tjapaltjarri, who passed away in an Alice Springs nursing home last week. I refer to this person by the name Kumantjay Tjapaltjarri out of respect for his people's culture and tradition. The ATSIC Commissioner for the Central Zone in Central Australia was quoted today in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> as saying:</para><quote><para>It's only common courtesy to the family that people not be named.</para></quote><para>She went on to say: </para><quote><para>People are going through the grieving process.</para></quote><para>That is the tradition in Central Australia. We need to respect the words of ATSIC Commissioner Alison Anderson, a tremendous and great person in that part of this country for her contribution to Indigenous Australia. Of course, the family has given permission for him to be called Kumantjay Tjapaltjarri. In Central Australia `Kumantjay' is used to refer to a dead person who cannot be named. But I am sure that those who may be listening and those in the Senate will well know whom I am referring to. </para><para>This man was born at Napperby Station around 1932. Kumantjay received very little in the way of a Western education and spent his early life working as a stockman and station hand on cattle properties around the McDonnell Ranges. His artistic career began when he started carving artefacts from wood in the 1950s, gaining a reputation as one of the finest carvers in the region. He was later employed at Papunya to teach woodcarving to the children. Eventually he moved on to painting, being one of the last men to join Geoffrey Bardon's group of painting men at the beginning of the 1970s. He was a founding member of Papunya Tula Arts and went on to become the Chairman of Papunya Tula Artists during the late 1970s and early 1980s. As one of this first group of painters in Papunya, he is regarded not only as one of the leading figures in the Papunya Tula art movement—which predominantly of course is renowned for its dot paintings—but also as a forefather of the contemporary Aboriginal art movement.</para><para>It is no exaggeration to say that Kumantjay helped to put Western Desert art as we know it today on the map. His images of the Western Desert have been widely exhibited overseas, including major exhibitions in Europe and the United States. His work is represented in major collections in Australia and overseas, including the National Gallery of Australia, the Art Gallery of New South Wales and the Queensland, Western Australian and South Australian art galleries, as well as the Holmes a Court Gallery in Perth and the Pacific Asia Museum and the Kelton Foundation collections in Los Angeles. Regarded as one of the most famous of the Western Desert Aboriginal artists, his works are highly sought after.</para><para>Kumantjay dedicated his life to ensuring Aboriginal art and culture stayed strong and alive. The significant contribution he made to Australia's cultural life was recognised recently when he was awarded the Order of Australia. Sadly, he lapsed into a coma the very day he was due to receive his Order of Australia medal in Alice Springs and never regained consciousness. I take this opportunity to express my sincere sympathy to his family and his community on their loss. But they can be reassured in knowing that his spirit lives on in his outstanding work, which not only brought his people, his community and himself international acclaim but will forever play a role in our nation's cultural heritage. </para><para>Secondly, I would like to reflect on the life of Big Bill Neidjie, a member of the Gagadju language group and a highly respected and well-known Bunitj clansman who passed away on 24 May this year. I mention him by name this evening because, contrary to Aboriginal custom, Bill actually expressed the wish that he be referred to by name after his death. He was known as Big Bill not just for his stature but for the influential role he played as a Gagadju elder. Big Bill packed a lot into his 80-plus years, and he devoted a great deal of his time and energy to fighting for land rights, to opposing mining in Kakadu and, above all, to protecting his traditional land.</para><para>Big Bill had a long and interesting life which started and ended near the banks of the East Alligator River, land now jointly managed by the traditional owners and staff of Kakadu National Park. Of course, when Big Bill was born, just after the First World War, that country was a vastly different place to the national park it is now, visited by up to 250,000 people every year. At the time of Big Bill's birth, the land was solely managed by the Indigenous owners, following traditional practices passed down through the generations. The importance of knowing the country, learning to read it and respecting it was at the core of Big Bill Neidjie's life and he was passionate about passing on to others his knowledge and understanding of the country he loved. Through the knowledge passed on to him as a boy by his grandfather and his uncles, he learned how to live off the land and how to manage it.  </para><para>During his life he worked in a range of jobs in different parts of the Northern Territory, returning from time to time to his own country. He returned permanently in the 1970s, from which time he played an important and very public role in securing the future of the land for the Bunitj people. It is a now a matter of history that, back in 1979, Big Bill was one of the principal claimants appearing before the Aboriginal Land Commissioner, Justice Toohey, in the Alligator Rivers stage 2 hearing, as a result of which the Bunitj people eventually won title over their land. Big Bill's significant contribution to advancing land rights is unassailable. Galarrwuy Yunupingu recently described Bill, together with Vincent Lingiari, Eddie Mabo and his own father Mungurrrawuy Yunupingu, as one of the giants of the land rights movement—and he was right.</para><para>Big Bill later came to be known as Kakadu Man, principally because of the crucial part he played in the establishment of Kakadu National Park, one of the few parks across the globe with a World Heritage listing for both its cultural and natural heritage values. He went on to play a key role in negotiating a joint management arrangement for Kakadu National Park between the traditional owners and the Commonwealth government. The joint management arrangement for Kakadu which he brokered, functioning under a lease-back to the Commonwealth, is still operating today. Bill also worked as a park ranger and cultural adviser in Kakadu.</para><para>In <inline font-style="italic">Kakadu Man</inline>, a book of his reflections published in 1986, Big Bill conveyed a profound understanding that, while European and Indigenous traditions each had their place, the sudden imposition of European culture had wreaked seriously damaging effects on Indigenous people which were still being felt in the Alligator Rivers region. He was gravely concerned about the loss of Indigenous knowledge and its consequences for the management of the country. His life's work was to ensure the future of the land he loved, to teach others to understand it and to pass on his knowledge and understanding of the land to future generations. His words convey a tremendous conviction about the importance of the land, of not wasting resources, of reading the signs of seasonal change in the wind and the stars. It was recently said that he is as large in death as he was in life, a reference to the enormous legacy he leaves not only for his own people but for all Australians willing to learn from this wise old man about respecting the land. </para><para>On behalf of my Indigenous constituents in the Northern Territory, I pay respects to the families and the communities of both Kumantjay Tjapaltjarri and Big Bill Neidjie.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Murray-Darling River System</title><page.no>2610</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>2610</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to use my time tonight to look at the pressing issue of water reform in the Murray-Darling Basin. It is a matter of great urgency that we leave more water in the Murray-Darling Basin; that we leave water in the rivers, particularly at times of good flow. The Murray River's Ramsar listed Chowilla flood plain and the Coorong wetlands are dying a slow death. They desperately need a decent drink. Many other areas, many other wetlands along the river, particularly parts of Banrock Station and the Gurra Lakes, are under extreme pressure. There has not been a medium flow of water across the Chowilla flood plain since 1992. Red gums can make do for two or three years without a decent drink and they can live in fairly saline water, but they certainly cannot go for 10 years. The dying red gums and black box of the flood plain indicate that we need to act now to get water into these parched areas. I spent a day recently walking through the ghostly remains of many of these red gums, in what was known as the Garden of Eden but could hardly be described that way these days. Some of those trees, many of them 200 or 300 years old, are just dropping their final leaves.</para></talk.start><para>We do need an urgent public debate on how and when we can get the fresh, unsalted water into these areas. Hopefully, that will then prompt action. I agree with Minister Anderson, the Deputy Prime Minister, that natural resource management is the most important environmental issue confronting our nation and the most important economic issue facing rural and regional Australia. I note with interest that the federal Treasury has begun to campaign for environmentally sound policies. Ken Henry, the Secretary to the Treasury, in a recent speech at the ANU, has even personally reminisced about the environmental destruction of our old-growth forests. So we have farmers who know what needs to be done; we have scientists who know what needs to be done; we have Treasury that knows what needs to be done in the Murray-Darling Basin. Basically, we should not be paying off any more public sector debt. We see the recent example of some $4.2 billion net proceeds from the sale of Sydney airport going in that direction. I noted with interest an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review </inline>today—I think it was on page 8— saying that we in fact do not have enough debt; Australia needs to be further in debt. We must find the resources, the money and the political will urgently so we can invest in the environment by leaving more water flowing through this important river system and out to sea. </para><para>Treasury, in a recent issue of its <inline font-style="italic">Economic Roundup</inline>, has acknowledged the need for public good conservation, but still the action does not match the words. Treasury is busy working within the strategic framework of COAG water reforms, which aim to achieve increased efficiency and sustainability. But efficiency, particularly with state governments hovering on the sidelines, keen to open up more irrigated agriculture, does not mean increased environment flows in the river. It does not mean sustainability. Putting on drippers and changing over to microjets may reduce one particular farmer's water consumption and may indeed help a particular orchard or vineyard but, if the water saved is simply transferred somewhere else to be spent on new irrigated areas, little—if anything—is left for the river.</para><para>Our history is one of water being almost given away, with little consideration for the destructive impact of European style agriculture on the environment. All this has to stop. We know it has to stop. Increasing efficiency has the potential to leave considerable volumes of water in the river, but the chance has to be grabbed now while programs like the Mallee pipeline and the Darling anabranch pipeline are being planned and built. It will be very expensive down the track to buy back the water that is saved by these new schemes if it is now onsold and used elsewhere for more irrigation. There will be no environmentally sensible outcomes for the landscape, for the red gum forests or for the wetlands, if water that is saved by increased efficiency is simply onsold, particularly by state and federal governments searching for an extra dollar.</para><para>By doing nothing to address the environmental costs of a water-starved Chowilla flood plain, we are building up enormous environmental debt, particularly as far as the salinity load is concerned. The public should not be left to carry this debt from government inaction from generation to generation. This is where our real debt problem is and we now need to do some serious work on it. Putting water allocations aside in an environment bank, not increasing economic efficiency, will give the badly run-down Chowilla flood plain the drink it needs. Changing our public policy to give priority to environment flows and to save Chowilla is essential, and it really is not that hard if we act quickly. The much-heralded cap on water diverted from the Murray and Darling rivers is only an interim step, since it is about management of the river and not management of the entire ecology. The Murray-Darling Basin Ministerial Council is making slow progress to increase the environment flows, but that too seems to stall far too often.</para><para>Jack Seekamp, an expert on River Murray flows and areas along the river, particularly in the Riverland region of South Australia, has detailed local knowledge to show us how to restore the flood plains. Jack is an ex-teacher, grower and researcher and a water activist for many years, who won the 2001 River Murray catchment environment award. He has built up an enormous research base and volumes of information on salinity levels, on particular areas of the forest—even down to specific trees—and on the rivers, creeks and lakes of the Chowilla flood plain. Jack's estimate is that the flood plain needs around 85,00 megalitres of water a day flowing past in that section of the Murray for about a week, once every three years. We can achieve this by boosting good flows—a flow coming down either the Darling or the Murray—and by releasing stored discharge from Lake Victoria and Menindee Lakes. He argues strongly that the policy of increasing flood peaks should be to hold back until the peak arrives and then boost this to increase downstream flow.  </para><para>At the same time that Chowilla is given a drink, the other areas further down, such as parts of Banrock Station, will at last get what they also need. When walking through Banrock, an area that has had enormous improvements made to it now that the wetland system is dried regularly, out of reach of the regular flows I saw considerable numbers of black box and grey box that are dead and dying because they too need a reasonable flow for the water to get up into those parts of the flood plain. Lake Meeriti is also an area that is being managed with drying and wetting cycles, with tremendous regeneration of red gums and great bird life flocking back to it. We can see what can be done, but there is so much more to be done. Up and down the river you find large numbers of small organisations working hard on revegetation and working hard on specific wetlands, but without water left in the river, much of their work will not reach its full potential.</para><para>One of the arguments against increasing these flood peaks and putting water aside for the environment is that it leaves farmers in the lurch. But if you are actually boosting a flood at a time when there is plenty of water around, it does not change very much for those farmers and it will not be a threat to ongoing regular farming practices in most parts of the river. But farmers need certainty; planning needs to be done now to show where this water is coming from. It does require changing the culture of the water authorities that have been dead keen on maintaining the locks at specific levels and not allowing for fluctuations. The locks should be moved about two metres up and down to make sure their banks start to regenerate and to get greater stability. It also requires local communities—particularly shack owners—to get used to living with a medium level of flooding. But all of that is easily manageable and, having talked to many of the communities in the Riverland, I think they are actually keen to see some action being taken and some changes being made.</para><para>We also need to change the land use on Chowilla itself. This is a property now that is state owned but there is unfortunately still a lease over it. It also has on it—and we saw these—wild pigs and goats. Letting them continue to roam means that what does regenerate is obviously going to be eaten out fairly quickly. So there are still a lot of land management issues to be dealt with across the flood plain. The South Australian state government needs to provide some incentives so that this area can actually be effectively managed for ecotourism. Good environment management, I argue strongly, is good economic management. Good environment management is a matter of extreme urgency. We have to actually be ready for the next reasonable flow of water down the Darling or the Murray. It is not happening at the moment—there are only about 3,000 megalitres a day going over the border. We need to be ready for when that is boosted to 40,000 or 50,000 megalitres and then to top it up with a reasonable flood that flows out over the banks and out onto the Chowilla flood plain. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>2612</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>2612</page.no><name role="metadata">Tchen, Sen Tsebin</name><name role="display">Senator TCHEN</name><name.id>86Y</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On 27 November 2000, Prime Minister John Howard and the Deputy Prime Minister and Minister for Transport and Regional Services, John Anderson, announced a historic $1.6 billion boost to the nation's road network with a major emphasis on investment in the repair and maintenance of vital local roads. $1.2 billion of the $1.6 billion would be distributed over four years directly to local councils under the Roads to Recovery program for local road construction and repair. The Roads to Recovery program is the single largest funding injection into local roads by a federal government. Its $1.2 billion over four years is over and above the Commonwealth's annual contribution through the Financial Assistance Grants Scheme. About two-thirds of the program will be spent in rural and regional Australia in recognition of the fact that this is where the need is greatest. In summary, the government's commitment is to spend a total of $1.2 billion on the Roads to Recovery program by 2004-05, starting with $406 million in 2000-01. </para></talk.start><para>At the time of the announcement of the Roads to Recovery program, the Prime Minister said:</para><quote><para>This major investment in our roads is possible because our budget position is better than anticipated. The Government believes this is the best investment of these funds for the long term benefit of the nation.</para></quote><para>In this year's budget it has been necessary to rephase some of the funds allocated to infrastructure, including the Roads to Recovery program, in order to meet important budgetary priorities over the next two years. The Roads to Recovery program will be reduced from $300 million to $200 million in 2002-03 with the same $100 million reinstated in 2004-05. Funding in 2003-04 will remain unchanged at $300 million. Every local council in Australia will receive every dollar of the funding they have been promised under this program by 2004-05.</para><para>Yesterday during the adjournment debate, Senator Forshaw complained loud and long—and ultimately futilely—that this rephasing of the program has caused severe hardship to councils. Unfortunately for Senator Forshaw, he happened to be wrong—wrong on his facts, wrong on his story, and wrong on his conclusion. He was wrong because this government stands by its commitments to Australia and Australians. For six years it has delivered what it said it would, and it will continue to deliver for Australia and Australians. No l-a-w law tax cuts for this government!</para><para>Let me put the record straight on the Roads to Recovery program. The total funding for the program at its end in 2004-05 is unchanged at $1.2 billion. What is rephased for one year will be restored in full in another year within the term of the program. Yesterday Senator Forshaw kindly read into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> statements made by the Prime Minister when the program was announced, but he rather cunningly left out the very important point the Prime Minister made that I noted earlier: that this program is made possible by the better than expected budgetary position and that the purpose of the program is for the long-term benefit of the nation. These criteria remain constant.</para><para>To minimise the effect, if any, of this rephasing, councils that will receive less than $600,000 over the four-year life of the program will not have their allocation deferred. As a result, 93 councils will receive the amount originally anticipated. This is in addition to 71 councils that have been paid their allocation in full already. Also, any councils with a life of program allocation of $600,000 to $900,000 will receive $150,000 this financial year—their funding is practically unaffected. Where problems arise as a result of rephasing the program due to commitments already made by councils, the government has put in place hardship considerations to be administered by the Department of Transport and Regional Services where each case will be considered on its merits.</para><para>I will now turn to the specific case that Senator Forshaw trumpeted last night as an example of a council having—in his overdramatic words—the `rug pulled out from under them'. Senator Forshaw cited the case of Sutherland Shire in Sydney and the upgrading of Captain Cook Drive in that shire in particular. Senator Forshaw proclaimed himself incensed that, because of the rephasing of the Roads to Recovery funding, the council will be between $250,000 and $300,000 out of pocket this financial year. He further claimed that the council's problem is going to snowball because it budgeted over the next four years to receive the funding it has been promised.</para><para>Firstly, let me repeat to Senator Forshaw that the funding the council will receive over the life of the program is not affected by the rephasing this year. That should take care of any concern about any snowballing of the council's problem. But maybe not. It depends on what sort of financial manager the council is, doesn't it? This is actually a real concern because the Sutherland Shire Council actually does not give impartial observers much confidence as to its financial management ability if it cannot handle the rephasing of its Roads to Recovery funding. The Sutherland Shire Council is no pauper. It has an annual budget of $170 million. One would have thought any halfway competent financial manager would be able to deal with a funding variation of $250,000 to $300,000 in any one year. Apparently not Senator Forshaw's council. Perhaps, like Senator Forshaw, it cannot read a simple funding statement either. I remind Senator Forshaw that a variation of $250,000 in a budget of $170 million is 0.15 per cent. It is nothing like a $10 billion black hole. </para><para>But there is more about Sutherland Shire Council's financial management skills. I put a question to the Department of Transport and Regional Services: what funding has Sutherland shire received under this program? It turned out that Sutherland Shire Council failed to make an application for Roads to Recovery funding until six months after the program started. In other words, it is $400,000 in arrears of its entitlement. I am no economist, but it seems to me that $400,000 is a somewhat larger sum than the $300,000 that Senator Forshaw was so concerned about. Maybe he is no better a financial manager than the council is. But maybe I am too hard on the council. After all, it has been able to fund a campaign to remove the Lucas Heights research station to the tune of $250,000 net payout, not counting staff and administrative costs.</para><para>Let me put the record straight for Senator Forshaw's benefit. The Roads to Recovery program is an initiative of the Howard government in recognition of the backlog of local roads needs throughout Australia. The program will provide $1.2 billion over four years to councils to use on local roads for such essential activities as resealing and regravelling, and upgrading bridges in desperate need of attention. Without the foresight of this government, local councils would still be crying out for roads funding, as the ALP would not have introduced such a nation benefiting program. Indeed, when this program was announced the Labor Party called it a boondoggle and a pork barrel. Yet here is a senior Labor senator claiming that councils are losing out. In reality, councils are winners and Australians are winners under the initiative of the Howard government.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 11.09 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>2614</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2614</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Australia-India Council—Report for 2000-01.</para><para>Australian National University—Report for 2001.</para><para>Treaties—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Bilateral</inline>—Text, together with national interest analysis—</para><para>Exchange of Notes Constituting an Agreement between the Government of Australia and the Government of the Democratic Republic of East Timor concerning Arrangements for Exploration and Exploitation of Petroleum in an Area of the Timor Sea Between East Timor and Australia, done at Dili on 20 May 2002.</para><para>Timor Sea Treaty between the Government of Australia and the Government of East Timor, done at Dili on 20 May 2002.</para><para>List of multilateral treaty action under negotiation or consideration by the Australian Government, or expected to be within the next twelve months, June 2002.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Multilateral</inline>—Text, together with national interest analysis and regulation impact statement—Agreement to Promote Compliance with International Conservation and Management Measures by Fishing Vessels on the High Seas, done at Rome on 24 November 1993.</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2614</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Disability Services Act—</para><para>Disability Services (Administration of Part II of the Act) Guidelines 2002.</para><para>Disability Services (Disability Employment and Rehabilitation Program) Standards 2002.</para><para>Disability Services (Rehabilitation Programs) Guidelines 2002.</para><para>Export Control Act—Export Control (Orders) Regulations—Livestock Export (Merino) Orders (Amendment)—Export Control Orders No. 1 of 2002. </para><para>Export Market Development Grants Act— Determination 1/2002—Determination of the Balance Distribution Date for grant year 2000/01 and Initial Payment Ceiling Amount for grant year 2001/02. </para><para>Hearing Services Administration Act— Hearing Services Rules of Conduct Amendment Rules 2002 (No. 1).</para></quote></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>2615</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following document was tabled pursuant to the order of the Senate of 25 March 1999:</para><quote><para>Australian Competition and Consumer Commission—Report to the Australian Senate on anti-competitive and other practices by health funds and providers in relation to private health insurance for the period 1 July to 31 December 2001.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
