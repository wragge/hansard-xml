Does the minister recall her claims in last Saturday's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> that the government failed to achieve a quarter of a billion dollars in supposed GST savings on pharmaceuticals because the pharmaceutical companies threatened to withdraw medicines?

That was the wholesale sales tax that Labor had in, whereby there was wholesale sales tax on advertising and wholesale sales tax on petrol, trucks et cetera, and that was fed down through the whole system. It was a ramshackle system and I think the Labor Party has now finally admitted that it is not going to support it. But the removal of the wholesale sales tax and its replacement by GST has led to cost savings for all businesses. In the 2000-01 budget, it was agreed that prices received by pharmaceutical manufacturers for their products listed on the PBS—the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme—should be reduced to reflect these costs. The Australian Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association rejected some of the price reductions and, while some individual manufacturers and some groups of manufacturers agreed to the price cuts, the rest did not, with the result that the expected savings to the budget were not achieved.</para></talk.start><para>The government has no legislative power to require companies to accept price decreases for products listed on the PBS. The only way of enforcing the price reductions would have been to push harder and risk the removal from the PBS of those products where companies did not accept the adjustments proposed. Senator Bolkus knows, and would know from other health ministers, that there is bargaining on the part of the government when it is purchasing pharmaceuticals from the pharmaceutical companies, because we purchase in bulk and we drive prices fairly low—the lowest in the world. There is a point at which the companies will say that it is not worthwhile having these medications here in Australia. This would disadvantage consumers by reducing the range of subsidised medicines available to them through the PBS, and the government was not prepared to countenance this.</para><para>While the actions of the APMA are regrettable, the government has not been able to pursue the full price reductions proposed at the time. As the Treasurer said on the <inline font-style="italic">Sunday</inline> program on Sunday, they have argued that there are other costs—increased costs in fuel, a lowering of the dollar—which affected their prices and, therefore, they passed on the GST. They suggested that it be referred to the ACCC for investigation. The Treasurer indicated that that was appropriate and the ACCC will, no doubt, look and see where the APMA and the companies have in fact passed on the GST and there are other factors involved in keeping those prices up. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1342</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Madam President, I ask a supplementary question.

It was a difficult decision, but we have seen that it has reduced the cost of producing exports and it has reduced the cost to businesses. Senator Bolkus asks me to explain or say exactly what companies were involved. Let me say to you that there is always a very healthy debate between the government and the drug companies when they are negotiating a price on a medication, because the government is driving the lowest price we can possibly get and the pharmaceutical companies are trying to get the highest price they can get. It is a healthy debate. Often, they will say, `If we do not get the price we want, we will not release this medication onto the Australian market.'</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Howard Government: Economic Performance</title><page.no>1342</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>1342</page.no><name role="metadata">Mason, Sen Brett</name><name role="display">Senator MASON</name><name.id>84M</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is directed to the Leader of the Government in the Senate.

There is no doubt that the Howard government's strong economic leadership continues to make Australia the envy of world economies. Two recent reports confirm this. In its latest economic outlook, the OECD provided a very positive assessment of the Australian economy, with an outlook for strong economic growth, moderate inflation and falling unemployment. The OECD forecast the Australian economy to grow by 3.7 per cent in 2002—significantly stronger than most other advanced countries—with growth increasing to four per cent in 2003.</para></talk.start><para>Also, in its latest world economic outlook, the IMF provided a positive assessment of the Australian economy's performance during the global slowdown and predicted Australia to be the fastest growing developed economy in 2002. According to the IMF, our strong economic growth has been underpinned by historically low interest rates, the enormously successful first home owners grant and a competitive exchange rate. The IMF also predicted that this solid economic growth would continue over the next two years, accompanied by low inflation and falling unemployment.</para><para>Under the Howard government, we have enjoyed historically low interest rates, falling unemployment rates—with almost 930,000 jobs created—five consecutive budget surpluses, the repayment of $57 billion of Labor's debt, and $12 billion in personal tax cuts from the introduction of the GST. Do we remember what the Leader of the Opposition said about this in March of last year? He said:</para><quote><para>We are in a severe downturn, the GST has mugged the Australian economy, they have given us the slowdown we did not need to have. How could the government have got it so wrong? </para></quote><para>The trouble is, he is steeped in Labor's history of economic management. What do we remember of Labor when it was in government? We remember it as a high taxing government, a high spending government, a big deficit government—nine budget deficits with an average budget deficit of $12.2 billion. There was a $12 billion black hole when it left office, despite Senator Cook telling us it was in surplus, tax increases when it promised tax cuts, interest rates up to a record high of 17 per cent, small business interest rates of over 20 per cent, unemployment the highest since the Great Depression—over one million unemployed at its highest—and $96 billion of government debt created between 1990 and 1996. What have they learned? Six years in opposition and still no alternative economic policies at all. For a while, we had roll-back. Roll-back was going to be the panacea. What has happened to roll-back? It is now on the backburner. There is apparently no urgency any longer about roll-back. So, in terms of an economic policy, Labor offers a total vacuum. What a contrast. Of course that is why the Howard government was overwhelmingly returned at the last election. It had delivered the good economic outcomes, it had promised Australians a good economic outcome for the future, which it is now delivering, and Labor offered no alternative.</para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>1343</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

I think it was half a million dollars they got for rent last year—enough to fund a couple of elections over a 15-year period. They have locked this in for a 15-year period.

They did not want to go there anyway, and I said it probably would not be on. The government has written to the RACGP and said that this agreement is a no-go, so there has been no money spent.

That is why the government recently announced a new price cap regime which will ensure that prices continue to fall, that the benefits flow on to consumers and are not captured by their union mates and others. Of course, at the same time we also announced a new more timely and transparent regime to ensure that particularly third parties in dealing with Telstra are able to get proper outcomes that will much better assist the competitive environment. </para></talk.start><para>I am asked if I know of any alternative arrangements. I should start by saying that at least Mr Tanner from the Labor Party seems to be in agreement with us on one thing: the crucial issue is proper competition, not ownership of Telstra. That immediately raises the question of why on earth you would dump the GST after you have lost two elections, and then go on to say that the only policy you will not change is in relation to Telstra, when you have lost three elections on that one. It is rather hard to follow, isn't it? But then, of course, the penny drops when you realise that basically 80 per cent of the Telstra work force is unionised. That means that you have certain commitments, preselection is coming up and you have to be seen to be doing the right thing.</para><para>But the trouble is that, whilst they are pretending they are not in favour of privatisation, Mr Tanner is in there—I do not think on a frolic of his own—with his ears pinned back. We have seen reports in the media that he is privately canvassing industry opinion on a structural separation of Telstra. This is the nuclear option. This is not a transparent accounting mechanism. This is actual break-up stuff, right? This is the nuclear option. This is all about destroying shareholder value, making sure that it no longer is able to offer full services and, effectively, going back into history in such a way that you would crucify the company.</para><para>Mr Tanner was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Business Review Weekly</inline> as having spent an hour recently talking about how structural separation might work; I can tell him now it does not. But why on earth do you think he is out there talking about it? Because it only makes sense if you want to hang on to that network where all the unionists work. You want to hang on to that, you call that Telstra, you honour your obligations and then you privatise the rest. Why on earth would you be out there exploring structural separation?</para><para>Senator Carr, well may you smirk because this is the ultimate in modernisation. As we know, Senator Carr is terrified of that, because that is a code word for neoliberalism— nd Blairite reforms, dare I say. These are shocking concepts; I understand that. But Mr Tanner, who I thought was also nominally from the Left, seems to have a fairly different view of the world. Of course, it is fundamentally different to the view of the world put by Senator Lundy. This is Senator Lundy's approach to Telstra:</para><quote><para>The way then will be clear to adopt what I like to think of as the carrot and stick approach: where Telstra is copping some necessary stick and their competitors finally having a taste of the carrot.</para></quote><para>So you have this huge dispute going on inside Labor where Mr Tanner wants to crucify Telstra by taking it back to its knitting, and so it is not allowed to get into any new media activities or to go international. Senator Lundy, on the other hand, would have it spending money like it was water on upgrading everyone and giving them world's best practice, no matter where they might live in the sticks. So it is really an argument about how you can best kill off Telstra rather than try to enhance shareholder value or improve it. Just to show they know absolutely nothing about it, Senator Lundy put a question on notice, `What strategies do Telstra have for raising equity?' Senator Lundy, the tragedy is they cannot, because they are not allowed to under the current regime.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Broadcasting Corporation</title><page.no>1345</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>1345</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is addressed to Senator Alston, Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.

Dr Sev Ozdowski, the Human Rights Commissioner, is conducting an inquiry into the detention of children in Australia. That report is due by the end of this year. In relation to Woomera, which Senator Bartlett mentioned, we contract the Department of Family and Community Services in South Australia to carry out adequate scrutiny of provisions that are made for children in that centre. In fact, we have looked at a pilot scheme at Woomera for accommodating families outside that detention centre. As I understand it, from my last briefing on the matter, there was not a great take-up of this and that was something we wanted to look at. That was an important pilot project looking at alternative ways to accommodate children.</para></talk.start><para>There has been a lot of misrepresentation in relation to how we deal with children in detention centres, particularly in relation to education. We have heard a lot of people say that there are not adequate arrangements made in relation to the education needs of children in detention centres. It is very difficult, when you have children coming from vastly different cultural backgrounds, to simply put them into mainstream Australian educational facilities. We try to do that, and it is possible to have them attend schools outside detention centres, but we also provide education facilities in detention centres across Australia, commensurate to the needs of children and having regard to their cultural backgrounds. </para><para>I noted recently that the head of the New South Wales Department of Education and Training has asked that children at Villawood attend local schools. The department held preliminary discussions between the service provider and relevant schools late last year. Concerns were expressed by the Department of Education and Training in New South Wales about what was being done in relation to the education of children in the detention centre at Villawood. It was an instance where the department was on the job. It was attending to that very issue. Difficulties were encountered with the proposed costs for such attendance and New South Wales indicated that the department may need to pay for costs at the rate of an overseas student. I understand that those preliminary discussions were held and that a meeting is scheduled with Dr Boston, who heads the Department of Education and Training in New South Wales. This indicates a number of ways in which we are addressing the detention of children in centres across Australia.

What is the minister doing to ensure that sporting fans of other codes will not be denied coverage during the World Cup?

In other words, if it is a major sporting event, then it should be available to the masses. That is the general proposition. But of course, the Labor Party goes a bit further. The Labor Party almost implies—and poor old Senator Schacht will have plenty of time to reflect on these policy indiscretions in the near future—that somehow you ought to force the free-to-airs to run everything that is on the antisiphoning list. As we know, in a situation like Wimbledon it is physically impossible because you have a number of parallel games occurring within the one event. As I understand it, with the World Cup soccer, Channel 9 has agreed to telecast 16 because it bought the rights to 16. The balance has been acquired by SBS. That is a very good outcome because it means that, between them, all of those events are potentially able to be broadcast on free-to-air. </para></talk.start><para>We actually made a change in the regime to say that, where the free-to-airs were not proposing to provide that coverage, they had to offer it to the national broadcasters in the first instance.

If you think that is outrageous, if you think that we ought to be legislating to require the AFL to simply stick to their knitting, you would have every game on Saturday—and Saturday afternoon to boot—and we would all be back where we were 20-odd years ago. Obviously your team is not travelling too well, Senator Lundy, and you are very disappointed. Maybe we are doing you a favour if you cannot actually see it on a Friday night. That is, I agree, still an outstanding issue to be resolved, and I hope that the AFL is working on that.

We have delivered the sound economic conditions and the vital tax reform that have ensured that the car industry in Australia continues to boom. Indeed, it has just revised its sales estimates for the current calendar year and it is expecting the second best ever year for total sales.

The government rejects the fact that this has just been a grant to assist the rich. The first home owner grant was a grant to enable people to enter the housing market following the introduction of the GST and also to assist the construction industry. Certainly it has been a very successful grant. It has been a very successful initiative. In fact, rather than cut it off at the end of last year, it has been extended, albeit on a reduced basis. </para></talk.start><para>The strength in the housing sector over the last couple of quarters has been supported by a combination of the government's more generous First Home Owners Scheme for new home buyers, historically low interest rates and a strong domestic economy. So it is not just rich people who can access home ownership in this country. Because of the sound economic initiatives of this government, housing has become available for people right across the economic spectrum. Dwelling investment in fact increased 4.1 per cent in the December quarter 2001, following on from a record 14 per cent increase in the September quarter. There was a peak, and obviously in Sydney, notwithstanding a slight increase in interest rates, home ownership and housing prices have been maintained, as have also occurred in Queensland and South Australia.</para><para>Strength in the broader domestic economy coupled with strong growth in employment has contributed to the recovery of the whole residential construction sector. Recent GDP outcomes confirm that the Australian economy is one of the fastest growing economies in the developed world. Strength in the domestic economy has a flow-through to employment, with total employment rising by 101,700 people over the last year, which assists people of course to buy houses. Total private dwelling commencements rose by 11.8 per cent in the December quarter, following a 33.6 per cent rise in the September quarter. Private building approvals increased by 9.6 per cent in March to be 23.2 per cent, higher than a year ago.

I go to the point: what we have exposed here is a former minister who made a $5 million deposit on his future job prospects. That is what it was all about. He made the assessment that he was not employable unless he could actually pay the organisation to which he was going, and he paid them to the extent of $5 million. He must have had a really low estimation of his job prospects.

That is what this is all about—feathering his own nest.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This sort of incident exposes this government's priorities. It is a secretive and tricky government. This is a matter that was born in secrecy. It was not announced before the election. It was kept secret for three months. It involved other ministers such as the finance minister, the Prime Minister and, for a while, Senator Patterson. It was a secret until we exposed it in the estimates process. It exposes this government as a government always prepared to rip into the taxpayers' funds to save its own skin. Once again we have here expenditure before the last federal election: a $5 million grant, not needed, to a peak lobby group, a lobby group that did have some influence in the electoral process. </para><para>It also exposes the government getting its priorities wrong. It takes money from areas of need—people suffering asthma in the mid-north of my home state of South Australia had continuing need of these funds but they were told funds were not available—and from rural and regional health and it goes to areas where there is no need. There was no need for this extravagance on behalf of the college. When you look at what the college needed in terms of office space in Canberra, you will see it needed 200 square metres. This government grant was going to give them the capacity to build an office of 4,000 square metres. They needed one-twentieth of that, but they were given money to build an office of 4,000 square metres and four floors—and you can guess who was going to be sitting on the top floor as top cocky. Michael Wooldridge had organised it all for himself, probably in there with a huge wine cellar as well, with his favourite bottles of Grange and 707 and the like. He had organised for the college to get the top floor of this four-storey building.</para><para>Does it not really epitomise this government that even as the college has been exposed and Wooldridge has been exposed as trying to rip off taxpayers' money the Prime Minister still wants to give them something to bide them by. Any other party, any other person trying to rip off government funds, would be pursued through the legal system. In this case, the Prime Minister in his statement says, `We will reimburse costs unavoidably incurred by the college in developing the proposal.' They took their risk; they should pay the costs. They entered into a secret deal; they should cop the costs of that. It should not be the taxpayer that bails them out. But in the Prime Minister's statement, on the eve of the budget when the attention of the public is on other matters, he indicates that the college will be paid off. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>1356</page.no><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator KNOWLES</name><name.id>TH4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not know where Senator Bolkus has been for most of this year.

That is a new word I have discovered for just what it is that is upsetting the senator. I do not exactly know what is upsetting her, but she is feeling snippy. I would like to take note of the answer from Senator Patterson today to the question on pharmaceuticals. I am particularly concerned about this because Senator Patterson failed completely to address what has been put out into the public for a number of weeks to soften us all up for what is coming in the budget, and that is that the cost of pharmaceuticals will rise. It will rise by an amount we do not know, but it is going to rise. Some people put an estimate of an increase of some 30 per cent. We will wait and see exactly what the figure is, but the problem is that this is going to hit Australian families very hard. It is going to hit the sickest and the poorest pensioners and families already struggling to make ends meet. As we know, if you have one or some sick children in a family or people who regularly need pharmaceuticals, this is going to be a very nasty drain on their purse. Why is it that this has to happen?</para></talk.start><para>To give credit where it is due, there have been some moves made by the Howard government to try to restrain the cost of pharmaceuticals, and to some extent they have been successful—until last year when they got into proposing things and coming up to the budget they let things happen that let the pharmaceutical cost blow out altogether. One of those things was to list Celebrex, a drug for arthritis, without any appropriate cost controls, and that cost $180 million before thought was given to looking at it again. Zyban, a drug to assist in stopping smoking, cost $70 million. Another thing has occurred. The Howard government claimed that these pharmaceuticals would go down in price, that they would cost less because of the GST to the tune of over one-quarter of a billion dollars—$288 million was to be saved by the impact of the GST on pharmaceuticals. From answers to questions in the estimates hearings and from clear evidence from the government, in the budget documents—the sort the snippy Senator Knowles was suggesting we could not understand—there are no savings, and indeed there are lost savings of an estimated $288 million from the failure of the GST to produce savings. If you like, the government's estimate of the impact of the GST is simply a make-up. It has produced none of the savings that the government have claimed for it. There is a quarter of a billion dollar bungle by the Treasurer.  </para><para>What is going to happen? What is going to happen is what usually happens: the sickest and the poorest in society are going to be forced to pay extra for their pharmaceuticals to cover that hole of the government's. That is pretty disgraceful. It is not true to say it was because the price of pharmaceuticals was rising out of control. On the evidence, as I have already said, the Howard government had taken some steps and there was a considerable restraint on—if you like, a stabilising of the rate of growth—of the pharmaceutical benefits over the last few years. But, as I said, in the run-up to the budget last year things were listed—Celebrex and Zyban— without the restraints and so there was a blow-out. That blow-out is now being used as an argument for increasing the cost of pharmaceuticals. It is not there as a restraint but to pay for the loss of revenue from the GST that was never really ever going to come. We made the claims earlier on that this was a false claim by the Treasurer. The figures in his own budget estimates now prove it. There are no $288 million budget savings from the GST and I cannot imagine where the GST savings were expected to come from or how the GST was supposed to lower the price of pharmaceuticals. It has not lowered them, and by slowing the growth of pharmaceuticals the cost is going up. This is an argument that the Liberal Party often run: that somehow if they put up the price of pharmaceuticals sick people will not need them so much. People are not in a position to bargain for pharmaceuticals: if they are sick they have to have them whatever the cost is. If the government have put up the cost, as they are proposing to do—if we can read the warnings over the last few weeks that they are going to increase the costs—it is not going to slow the rate of growth but it is going to make the sick and the poor pay more. They are paying for the government's bungles. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>1358</page.no><name role="metadata">Herron, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HERRON</name><name.id>VW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to take up where Senator Crowley left off. It is an undeniable fact that the cost of pharmaceuticals will increase because technology and the ability of pharmaceuticals to ameliorate disease, and even to prevent disease, have increased dramatically in recent years and the number of people that are accessing pharmaceuticals is increasing dramatically with the ageing population. I do not disagree with Senator Crowley about this particular aspect because it is true. We have an ageing population, we have a dramatic increase in the number of pharmaceuticals available, and their cost has increased. It is incumbent upon any government to put some brake on this situation whereby the cost to the consumer should represent in some way the increase that is occurring in the cost of production and the cost of research. The reality is that these drugs do not occur spontaneously out of thin air; they require an enormous amount of research and development before they reach the stage of being approved by the pharmaceutical committee.</para></talk.start><para>In response to matters that were raised by Senator Bolkus: I smiled to myself when he talked about this sleazy deal that was done in relation to GP House. He said `the sleaziest deal that has ever been done'. I have been around here since 1990. I remember the Labor government arranged in 1993 for the lease of Centenary House, owned by the Labor Party and leased to the Australian National Audit Office, and the lease was for 15 years—considerably longer than the usual Commonwealth lease of around five years. To make matters worse, the ALP demanded a rental increase of nine per cent a year or the increase in market rents, whichever was the larger.</para><para>Since that time Canberra leasing rates have grown at around two to three per cent a year. Last September the annual rent rose by $403,244 to an extraordinary $4,883,733.50—almost $5 million in one year ripped out of the pockets of hardworking Australians and stuffed into Labor Party coffers. The Audit Office, or more correctly hardworking Australians, has been paying $775.57 per square metre for its office space at ALP headquarters since last September. That is more than the cost of prime commercial space in Sydney's CBD. Just down the road from Centenary House there is prime office space available for less than half that rate per square metre. Over the life of the contract, Australian taxpayers will have been ripped off to the tune of $36 million—and that is $36 million above the market rates— that the taxpayer will have to pay over the 15 years of the lease. </para><para>Senator Bolkus has the effrontery to get up and talk about a $5 million agreement— which was never proceeded with—with the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners. That came about not because of any action taken by the Labor Party but because of the actions of the medical bodies themselves, who started fighting. The AMA started fighting with the College of General Practitioners and, in turn, they fought with the divisions of general practice. So it was through no action of the Labor Party that this occurred. When it was brought to the attention of the Prime Minister, he stepped in.</para><para>In relation to the money that is being spent on asthma, it is this government that brought in the first asthma control program; the Labor Party never did. It was this government that persuaded the states in August 1999 to make asthma a national health priority area. We provided $9.2 million over three years for a new national asthma initiative in the 1999-2000 budget and another $48.4 million over four years in the 2002 budget.</para><para>Finally, Dr Michael Wooldridge was attacked. He was one of the great health ministers of this country, if for no other reason than his introduction of the immunisation program. Under Labor, immunisation of children had sunk to below 40 per cent, Senator Crowley. It is now up at nearly 85 or 90 per cent as a result of the direct action of former Minister for Health and Aged Care Michael Wooldridge. It is to his eternal credit that that activity was undertaken, when the Labor Party had 13 years to bring about a change in the immunisation program, and you should be ashamed, Senator Crowley, that you did not take action within your own party to bring that about.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>1359</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—One of the reasons we have one of the best health systems in the world is our Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme. I think today that there is much anxiety amongst groups of Australians, especially pensioners and low-income earners, who, if the budget speculations are correct, may suffer the most from the anticipated budget cuts to the PBS. Recent reports suggest that the cost of essential medicines will increase by 30 per cent: three times the rate of the GST. As AMA federal president Dr Kerryn Phelps warns— and I think Senator Crowley has already referred to this—slashing $2 billion from the PBS budget over the next two years can only harm the sickest and the poorest in our community. The PBS benefits so many Australians, as described by Ben Harris in <inline font-style="italic">the Australian Financial Review</inline> last week. He said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Pharmaceuticals allow thousands of people to make a better contribution to society—witness the many who are disabled by their illness, could not work before but can now do so. Due to pharmaceuticals there are fewer people relying on social security payments and more paying tax. Consequently, there is more money circulating in the community, which in turn accelerates economic growth. </para></quote><para>The article went on to say that other benefits include fewer people waiting in public hospital queues and patients requiring less assistance from carers and family. This is an enormous bonus when people are on pharmaceuticals and they do require less care from their families, particularly for the families as well for the patients. It also allows for the new and best medications to be accessed. We saw that last year with Zyban and Celebrex. Even though that helped blow the budget out, people did have access to those newer medications. Also the Australia Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association published data last Thursday which shows that pharmaceutical costs have not spiralled disproportionately out of control compared to previous years.</para><para>It is difficult to come up with figures on the dollars saved by the PBS in, for instance, lowering the burden on the public hospital system. I suspect the savings would be significant. The President of the Pharmacy Guild suggests that a dollar spent on medication under the PBS can save $10 or even $100 in health care costs later on. One of the stories that has disturbed me in recent days being circulated by the media is that pharmacists have been inundated with queries from customers about whether their medications will increase in cost and, if so, by how much. Some pharmacists have said that they have been noticeably busier in the last week as it is obvious that people are stockpiling their medications. That is fine for people in a position to do so, but low-income workers and pensioners do not have financial resources to be able to stockpile those resources. So there again there is an inequity. </para><para>It has also been reported that this budget will see the eligibility criteria for disability support pensions tightened. I suspect some Australians will be hit doubly. There will probably be people who have their disability support pension discontinued or halved who may no longer have their health benefits card. So, in losing their disability support pension and their health benefits card, they will be hit twice in that area. It is clear that the PBS greatly benefits millions of Australians. Any cut to the PBS will impact on the sickest and the poorest: the pensioners and families already struggling. The cost of the PBS is not out of control. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Detention Centres</title><page.no>1360</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>1360</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister representing the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Bartlett today relating to concerns of children in detention centres.</para></motion><para>In his answer, Minister Ellison, speaking on behalf of the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs, Mr Ruddock, continued to say that the government takes the welfare of children in detention very seriously and that it takes very seriously the concerns that have been raised. It is very hard to believe that the government and the minister do actually take these issues seriously, because quite clearly nothing is being done to address these concerns. The minister's own self-appointed, independent advisory group on detention centres has raised serious concerns about the mental health and general wellbeing and welfare of children in the Woomera detention centre. Yet, the government continues to maintain that facility and enable and require children to be detained behind the razor wire there.</para><para>Similarly, the impact on the wellbeing and mental health of detainees of all ages, but particularly children, has been highlighted time and again, not just by medical bodies such as the Royal Australian and New Zealand College of Psychiatrists and the Australian Medical Association, but also by specific medical and health practitioners who have been inside the detention centres and have worked in there. As recently as today, an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> quoted a psychologist, Mr Bilboe, who worked at Woomera for a prolonged period of time. Also, an article in today's <inline font-style="italic">Australian</inline> detailed a suicide attempt occurring as recently as last week. The article in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> talks about a day on which seven different men tried to hang themselves at the Woomera detention centre, including two who had actually been accepted as refugees by the Refugee Review Tribunal but who were still waiting for police clearance documents.</para><para>Unfortunately, this sort of event is not a rarity; it is a common occurrence. Many of the health professionals who have worked in the detention centres and who have had the courage to speak out about what happens inside, away from the gaze of the public, say that it is a regular occurrence. Self-harm, mutilation and attempted suicides are regular occurrences in detention centres around the country, including amongst children and minors. Of course, even those minors and children who are not engaging in self-harm are in an environment where they are witnessing adults who are, and there can be no doubt that that is immensely damaging to the psychological wellbeing of those children in detention. From the Democrats' point of view, there can be no justification—there never has been any justification—for detaining children for prolonged periods of time, and this is particularly so now that the evidence has become so clear. The minister, in his answer, referred to the investigation by the Human Rights Commissioner into children in detention and said that the government was interested in that and waiting on the report. That is good; I am glad the government is interested. It did not seem too keen on the commissioner actually undertaking that investigation, I might say, but it was something that the commission chose to do itself. </para><para>Whilst it is good that the government is going to look closely at that report, there is plenty of information available now and plenty of information coming out, not just from the South Australian family services department that is responsible for the welfare of children in Woomera, but also from health professionals across the board—psychologists, psychiatrists, social workers and nurses—all of whom have worked in these centres and all of whom talk about the immense psychological trauma that is being inflicted on detainees. The government cannot say that it takes this issue seriously and yet continue to refuse to act. It must recognise that its detention regime is automatically causing immense suffering and is detrimental, particularly to the welfare of children. There is no amount of glossing over that fact or dealing with trying to make the conditions inside better; the fact is that locking people up, detaining them and incarcerating them for long periods of time will generate that stress and will generate that damage to the children. The only way of addressing it is to get the children out of detention, along with their carers, and the government needs to do it now. The evidence is clear. It has no reason not to act other than its own stubbornness.</para><para>Question agreed

Public and private hearings were conducted between 6 October 2000 and 2 March 2001. Fifty submissions were received by the Committee, with only two submissions from soldiers who had served within 3 RAR during the period of the alleged assaults. Defence witnesses included the Chief of the Defence Force and the Chief of Army, as well as fifteen current and past serving members of 3 RAR. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">INVESTIGATION REPORT</inline></para><para>The committee released its report on 11 April 2001—`ROUGH JUSTICE? An Investigation into Allegations of Brutality in the Army's Parachute Battalion'. It contains eight majority recommendations (and one minority recommendation) to be the subject of this response by Government. </para><para>The Committee observed, as follows:</para><para>“In the course of this investigation, Committee members were made aware of activities in 3 RAR that reflected no credit on the individuals involved, and sullied the reputation of an outstanding and highly decorated Army unit. There were failures of character, command and process. In its entirety the episode was poorly handled. We are now relatively comfortable, however, that pressure by this committee and subsequent action by the Chief of the Defence Force and Chief of Army have put a process in place to correct the situation.</para><para>Those specifically responsible for the incidents have been identified, and legal processes instituted where possible. While not all cases have been finalised, closure on this specific incident is in sight. </para><para>Additionally, the ADF is looking at how this type of incident was allowed to happen. The Burchett Audit and the investigation into the issue of command responsibility and the climate that allowed this type of incident to occur will allow lessons to be learned and identify if there are further issues to be addressed. Investigative and justice processes have already been amended as a result of lessons learned, and more reform is needed. </para><para>Finally, the action taken by the senior leadership of Defence to raise the profile of justice and harassment combined with the intense media scrutiny should ensure that Defence personnel are aware of their rights. This will go a long way to ensuring that this type of incident does not occur again.” (Report, paras 6.37-6.40)</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">THE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Significant contribution by Committee to Military Justice </inline></para><para>The Government considers that the Committee has played a very significant role in advancing the cause of Military Justice through its investigation of events and circumstances in 3 RAR. The Committee's conclusion is a timely reminder of the need to be vigilant in respect to Military Justice issues. The Government notes the key finding of the Committee that the allegations were confined to A Company within 3 RAR; and the Committee had no evidence that the alleged incidents within 3 RAR were common within the ADF.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Transparency within Defence of Military Justice Issues </inline></para><para>The Government wishes to reassure the Committee that information concerning the situation in 3 RAR that may have materially affected the recommendations of its 1999 Report into Military Justice Procedures was not knowingly withheld from the Committee. It is regretted that the Committee may have been concerned in this regard. The relevant information did not emerge during 1998 from within 3 RAR and become known to those responsible for managing Defence participation in the Committee's first inquiry into Military Justice. Nor did the situation in 3 RAR come to notice in the compilation of the Defence Annual Report. However, it is anticipated that the imminent appointment of an Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force in the first quarter of 2002 will greatly reduce the possibility of this situation from happening in the future. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Director of Military Prosecutions </inline></para><para>The Government notes that the Committee was substantially divided on the matter of the appointment of a Director of Military Prosecutions (DMP), with a dissenting report appended to the main report recommending the establishment of a statutory office of the DMP. In announcing publicly the outcome of the Burchett Audit of Military Justice, on 16 August 2001 the Chief of Defence Force indicated that a DMP would be appointed. Legislation to amend the Defence Force Discipline Act will be proposed once the Chiefs of Staff Committee has considered how the DMP is to be appointed and function.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Actions Taken by Chief of Army </inline></para><para>The events and circumstances revealed in 3 RAR led to the Chief of Army taking a range of measures to avoid any repetition, or other occurrence of avoidance of due process in military justice procedures. </para><para>Chief of Army's Plan for a Fair Go. In order to strengthen the equity and fairness environment within the Army, the Chief of Army issued his Plan for a Fair Go. A key element of the plan was the promulgation across the Army of his strong and clear expectations of the required standards of behaviour in the form of “Fair Go” rules. These have been supported by the establishment within Army of an additional hotline to those normally operating within Defence, for individuals to confidentially seek assistance outside of the normal command chain, if necessary. Additionally, the Plan for a Fair Go included a review of equity training, the redevelopment of equity training packages , the conduct of a baseline equity audit and two follow-up equity audits. </para><para>Legal Proceedings. A range of legal proceedings under the Defence Force Discipline Act have been conducted. The outcome of these proceedings are found at Annex A to this Government Response.</para><para>Study of Command Aspects. As foreshadowed to the Committee, a study of the command climate and related aspects into the events in 3 RAR has been undertaken. The study was undertaken by Major General Powell, an experienced operational commander. The Report was submitted to the Deputy Chief of Army in December 2001 and its outcome is anticipated in the first quarter of 2002. The Deputy Chief of Army intends to personally brief the Committee on this report.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Actions taken by the Chief of the Defence Force </inline></para><para>Military Justice Stand-Down. This unprecedented measure was held on 5 February 2001 in the midst of the Committee's concern with 3 RAR matters. Its purpose was to demonstrate to the Parliament, the public, and across the ADF that the highest standards of Military Justice and behaviour were expected. It also served to assure all members of the ADF that the law is there for their protection, and that they should respect its procedures and come forward with any personal concerns.</para><para>Audit of Military Justice by Mr Burchett, QC. This was a major and unprecedented undertaking within the ADF between January-July 2001. Mr Burchett was appointed as an investigating officer under the Defence (Inquiry) Regulations. His terms of reference were essentially to determine whether there existed in the ADF a culture of systemic avoidance of Military Justice processes. The Burchett Report was released publicly on 16 August 2001 and the Defence Sub Committee was briefed on 23 August 2001. On the basis of his extensive interviews and audit of processes, and consideration of some 500 submissions, Mr Burchett reported that there was not a systemic culture of avoidance of Military Justice processes in the ADF. The Government notes that this crucial finding aligns with the prior assessment by the Committee in its Report. Mr Burchett identified a number of matters requiring follow-up investigation and appropriate action has been initiated.</para><para>Mr Burchett made an extensive range of recommendations to improve the overall operation of the Military Justice system. The Chief of the Defence Force has decided that all of these recommendations will be implemented as a discrete project, including the appointment of an Inspector General of the Australian Defence Force early in 2002 and the establishment of an Office of a Director of Military Prosecutions, once legislation has been passed. Any model for a DMP will necessarily have to be adaptable to the command environment of the Defence Force, and be viable in the context of operations. Noting these requirements, the desired outcome is an appropriate system of Military Justice, with optimal degrees of transparency and impartiality. </para><para>Details of the Government's response to each of the Committee's recommendations follow, including a range of Military Justice initiatives pertinent to those recommendations.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">PART 2</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSES TO THE COMMITTEE RECOM-MEN-D-ATIONS</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 1 </inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that educating Defence personnel of their rights and responsibilities be part of an ongoing program, commencing at recruit training. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE</inline></para><para>Defence provides extensive equity and diversity training, from recruit training to Commanding Officer Designate courses.

As an interim measure, equity and diversity training is to be delivered to unit commanders and Regimental Sergeant Majors for them to deliver, in turn, to officers and soldiers under their command. </para><para>Formal equity and diversity courses have been part of Navy training since 1999. All Navy personnel must undergo such training on joining and annually thereafter. In 2001 an interim, tailored, course was introduced for senior officers. In addition, it is now mandatory that prior to consideration for appointment as Commanding Officers and Executive Officers and to most instructional appointments, Navy personnel have undergone equity training in the previous 12 months. </para><para>Air Force conducts equity and diversity training at all levels of its leadership and management continuum, from initial entry training to senior appointments. This training is fully intregrated into broad competencies. </para><para>A major portfolio evaluation report of Equity and Diversity in Defence will shortly be tendered to the Departmental Inspector-General. In due course once senior Defence managers have considered the evaluation report; the Committee may consider a briefing on the outcomes of this comprehensive evaluation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 2</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that officers in the direct chain of command and SNCOs responsible for the discipline system in units not be appointed as Equity Officers. The two roles cannot be adequately reconciled. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE</inline></para><para>This recommendation is broadly supported. Equity Advisers are responsible for providing support, information, advice and options for resolution to ADF members who are complainants or respondents, and management on matters relating to all forms of unacceptable behaviour. </para><para>As far as practicable, those holding command appointments are not appointed as Equity Advisers, however, the vast majority of personnel holding rank are in the direct chain of command or are responsible for discipline. The Government believes that the intention of the Committee's recommendation can be accommodated if sufficient, appropriately trained, Equity Advisers are appointed to enable all members of a unit or ship access to an Equity Adviser outside of their own direct chain of command. Army's Land Command has established, as a benchmark, a ratio of one Equity Adviser to every 50 personnel, to accommodate the number of sources of equity advice to those involved in unacceptable behaviour issues.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 3</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that Army establish a pool of investigators held centrally for the conduct of larger investigations. These investigators should not be routinely drawn from outlying areas. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE</inline></para><para>The Government does not support the recommendation that a pool of investigators be established and held centrally for the conduct of larger investigations. Whilst the number and complexity of major investigations conducted over the previous year would warrant serious consideration being given to the establishment of a central pool of investigators, this need has not been evident in previous years. Prior to FY 2000/2001 there was an average of only two Major Investigations Teams (MIT) formed per year for investigations in excess of several months. The composition of a MIT is dependent on the type, sensitivity and complexity of the investigation. As required, Army has drawn on the investigative effort from Navy and Air Force to form a MIT, and on occasions, sought the technical assistance and advice of the Australian Federal Police. The Government believes that the current arrangement is more flexible in the use of these scarce and valuable resources. </para><para>The role and establishment of the 5th Military Police Company (SIB), headquartered in Canberra was examined in late 2001. At this point in time Army's preferred approach is to increase the number of more senior investigators on the staff of the 5th Military Police Company (SIB) which should enable better co-ordination and management of investigations and continue to draw more junior and specialist investigators from regional areas as required. Action is subsequently in hand to increase the number of more senior investigators of Headquarters 5th Military Police Company (SIB).</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 4 </inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that Army investigate the feasibility of placing MPs with Federal, State and Territory Police Forces as part of their training. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE</inline></para><para>The Government supports this recommendation. A Memorandum of Understanding has already been signed by Army and the Victoria Police. It is planned to enter similar agreements with other police services including the Australian Federal Police. Additionally, Army is looking to extending the range of civil police and tertiary training courses currently attended by Military Police (MP) personnel.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 5</inline></para><para>The Committee further recommends that Army review the conditions for reserve Military Police, with the view to better utilising the investigative skills in the Military Police Reserve units, especially for major cases.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE</inline></para><para>The Government agrees with the Committee's recommendation. The Government values the contribution of Army Reserve MP's, many of whom have acquired specialist investigation skills in their civilian employment. Army is currently developing a Trade Management Plan for the Corps of Military Police, which will outline a framework for the employment of Reservists. In developing the Plan, Army will examine means to better utilise the investigative skills in MP Reserve and integrated units, especially for major cases. The Plan is due for completion in June 2002.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 6</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends there be a formal review of the Defence Legal Office, with terms of reference and timetable for completion, and that the review be made public. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE</inline></para><para>This recommendation by the Committee arose in the context whether the Military Justice System is too slow. At issue are the formal processes which comprise the Military Justice System; and the organisational arrangements for the in house delivery of legal services.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Military Justice System</inline></para><para>The Government fully agrees that the entire legal process surrounding the incidents at 3 RAR took far too long. A much more efficient system is required to centrally track and monitor the progress of all matters dealt with in the Military Justice System. The most efficient way to achieve this is through the establishment of a Registrar of Military Justice. This has been implemented within the office of the Judge Advocate General, whose statutory responsibility it is to report annually to Parliament on the implementation of Defence Force Discipline Act. The Registrar of Military Justice is implementing a case management system (with requisite Information Technology support) to capture all ADF inquiries and matters of Defence Force discipline. This information also will be available to the Inspector General of the ADF to support that office in ensuring compliance with due processes, timeliness, transparency and standards in military justice.</para><para>In addition, the Judge Advocate General has implemented a standard step in the conduct of more complex disciplinary proceedings in the form of Directions Hearings. All those responsible for bringing matters to trial will be required to appear before a judicial officer for the purpose of explaining what is involved, and how long it should take to conclude. This will provide an additional process stimulus to expedite all disciplinary proceedings. </para><para>Coupled with strong recommendations by Mr Burchett for much enhanced training in military procedures (presently in the design phase through the Military Law Centre), these measures, when fully effective, should make for the more timely, streamlined and controlled administration of military justice.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Review of The Defence Legal Service</inline></para><para>The Defence Legal Service has been undergoing a continuous program of integration and reform since the amalgamation of all in-house legal services in 1997.</para><para>In 1997 a military Director General was appointed to lead and manage the national in-house provision of legal services across Defence. A civilian General Counsel was appointed within The Defence Legal Service to provide high level legal advice across the Defence Organisation. </para><para>Studies were conducted into the provision of legal services to all bases, commands and regions in 1997. The central office in Canberra was fundamentally reviewed in 1998-99. The roles of Reserve Legal Officers were reviewed in 2001. This important review will result in a much closer relationship between the permanent and reserve officers of The Defence Legal Service. Moreover, the Reserve officers will be more closely integrated with their respective services, ideally through appointments within major formations and force element groups. The relevant Papers from each of these studies can be made available to the Committee, should this be required. </para><para>Finally, the incoming Director General undertook a national field survey of the entire organisation in 2001 and has made substantial internal organisational changes aimed at uniting all the legal resources available to the Defence Organisation into arguably the largest national in-house law firm in Australia. The shaping vision is set at “professional excellence”, in all aspects of performance. The Defence Legal Office was renamed The Defence Legal Service in March 2001.</para><para>The demand for in-house legal services seems to be outstripping available resources. Significantly, the Burchett Audit of Military Justice observed:</para><para>“It was frequently suggested that the Defence Force should have more lawyers because there are not enough in-house resources to meet the demand (para 180).”</para><para>Burchett recommended that the total number of legal officers and their location and organisation required in the modern Defence Force be reviewed. This recommendation will be actioned as part of the general implementation of all the Burchett recommendations in 2002, with special emphasis accorded to the geographical placement of ADF legal officers to ensure that it reflects sufficiently the demands on The Defence Legal Service nationally. </para><para>Should the Committee require, an extensive briefing on the reform of the Defence Legal Service can readily be provided. The Government considers that these changes need to be given further time to take effect, before any further formal review is considered.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 7</inline></para><para>The Committee recommends that officers transferring to the Defence legal specialisation on completion of a law degree necessitate relinquishment of rank commensurate with their legal expertise and experience. </para><para>RESPONSE</para><para>This recommendation is broadly supported. The remuneration and professional development of the legal specialisation within the ADF elements of The Defence Legal Service is based on legal competencies. Clients are entitled to expect that rank and legal skills are reflective of actual experience. The most usual form of entry to the legal specialisation will remain through undergraduate and graduate recruitment to the most junior officer ranks. </para><para>Transfer to the legal specialisation as late as the rank of Major (or equivalent rank) would only be in exceptional circumstances. There will be some officers at this level whose command and management experience has required them to deal extensively with legal issues as a matter of course. This experience, coupled with legal training, will enhance their capacity to contribute effectively to The Defence Legal Service. It may be necessary for certain of these officers to be held longer at the Major (or equivalent rank) level to enable them to consolidate their legal experience before they are eligible for promotion. All of these considerations would be taken into account by the Career and Professional Development Committee, which has been established to regulate the professional management of officers in the Defence Legal Service.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATION 8</inline></para><para>The Committee further recommends that legal officers' selection boards have a legal officer on the panel.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE</inline></para><para>This is fully endorsed.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">DISSENTING REPORT RECOMMEND-ATION</inline></para><para>In light of the recurrence of issues relating to brutality and Military Justice, and noting the recommendations of the committee's previous report into Military Justice procedures in the ADF, those dissenting members now strongly recommend that the ADF establish a statutory office of the Director of Military Prosecutions, for Defence Force Magistrate trials and Courts-Martial (for criminal and quasi criminal matters).</para><para>As has been announced and advised to the Committee previously, a DMP will be established after selection of an appropriate model suitable to the ADF needs, and when the necessary legislation is in place. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Annex A</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">OUTCOMES OF TRIALS CONCERNING THE THIRD BATTALION ROYAL AUSTRALIA REGIMENT (3 RAR)</inline></para><para>Fourteen members and former members of 3 RAR were charged following investigations into allegations made.

This evidence made it very clear that the replacement reactor will underpin Australia's future role in nuclear science and technology and, consequently, our capacity to reap benefits in emerging areas of advanced technology. The submission by the Australian Vice-Chancellors' Committee expressed this view concisely:</para><para>“The AVCC believes that Australia's possession of a modern research reactor supports our standing as a technologically sophisticated society able to play its role in the new economy.” (submission number 164).</para><para>Scientists in Australia have been contributing to research and development in nuclear science and technology since 1896, immediately after the discovery of x-rays and radioactivity. Indeed, Sir Lawrence Bragg, the first Australian-born Nobel Laureate, received (together with his father) the Nobel Prize in 1915 for work in this area of physics.</para><para>Since 1945, successive Australian Governments have sought to ensure that Australians were able to benefit from applications of nuclear science and technology and, since 1958, operation of the HIFAR nuclear research reactor and associated facilities at Lucas Heights has been central to this objective. </para><para>The replacement nuclear research reactor will build on Australia's substantial investment in nuclear science and technology during the last 100 years. It will be a major facility for the nationally important research activities that will continue to be undertaken in Australia in a wide range of scientific disciplines. It will provide a practical base to enable young Australians to be trained in neutron science, thereby supporting the future development of Australia's scientific and industrial capabilities. The replacement reactor will also contribute to providing Australians with a first class standard of health care via reliable supply of radioisotopes for use in nuclear medicine. </para><para>The operation of a research reactor in Australia has also enhanced Australia's capacity to participate effectively in international nuclear non-proliferation, disarmament and safety matters by ensuring that Australia is able to attract, develop and maintain a broad, multi-disciplinary range of nuclear expertise. This capacity to provide government with expert scientific and technical advice across the nuclear fuel cycle enables Australia to make independent judgments about nuclear matters, both within the region and globally, that are timely and informed. It also positions Australia to contribute at a technical level to international arrangements. </para><para>Australia's contributions to the development of the International Atomic Energy Agency's (IAEA) strengthened safeguards system, arrangements to protect the people and the environment from the potentially harmful effects of nuclear facilities, radioactive materials and radiation sources, the Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty International Monitoring System, and the verification regime for a future `fissile material cut-off treaty', are salient examples where Australian technical expertise has significantly advanced Australia's security and non-proliferation interests. </para><para>The Committee stated that it was “not convinced that Australia needs a new research reactor to make a positive contribution to nuclear disarmament”, and it found “that the justification for the new research reactor solely on national interest grounds is not strong where national interest is defined on purely `security' and non-proliferation grounds”. However, the Government does not argue, and never has argued, that the research reactor is justified solely on security and non-proliferation grounds. </para><para>Nevertheless, the Government considers that operation of a research reactor significantly enhances Australia's capacities to contribute to international arrangements to prevent nuclear proliferation; to ensure that nuclear activities are carried out according to appropriate standards of safety and physical protection; and to evaluate and influence developments in nuclear technology. The Government considers that the level of Australia's technical nuclear expertise would decline rapidly in the absence of a domestic nuclear research reactor and, consequently, Australia's ability to achieve its nuclear policy objectives would be seriously diminished.</para><para>The Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works concluded unanimously in 1999 that “A need exists to replace HIFAR with a modern research reactor.”1</para><para>In summary, the Government is firmly of the view that it is in Australia's national interest to have a modern, multi-purpose nuclear research reactor and it is proceeding with the replacement of the High Flux Australian Reactor (HIFAR) on this basis. The national interest is premised on the range of benefits that the research reactor offers to Australia—domestically, in the fields of science, industry, education, medicine, and the environment—and internationally, by augmenting Australia's capacity to effectively engage in international nuclear affairs. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response to individual recommendations from the Majority report</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Chapter 11, p. 224</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee notes that the Government has failed to establish a conclusive or compelling case for the new reactor, and recommends that before the Government proceeds any further it undertake an independent public review into the need for a new nuclear reactor</inline><inline font-style="italic">.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE:  DISAGREE</inline></para><para>The “need for a new nuclear reactor” has been subject to extensive assessment commencing with the Research Reactor Review in 1993. The Government, having closely examined the issues associated with such a major national infrastructure investment, concluded that it is in Australia's national interest to have a modern, multi-purpose nuclear research reactor. </para><para>The Government's position has been supported by evidence provided to the Committee by Australia's peak scientific, educational, medical and industry bodies, all of which strongly supported construction of the replacement reactor. The consistent message from this wide range of bodies— which included the Australian Research Council, the Australian Academy of Science, the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering, the Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee, the NSW Branch of the Australian Medical Association, the Australian New Zealand Society of Nuclear Medicine, the Australian and New Zealand Association of Physicians in Nuclear Medicine (Inc), the Institution of Engineers, Australia, the Federation of Australian Scientific and Technological Societies, the Business Council of Australia and the Business/Higher Education Round Table—was that there was a demonstrated need for a replacement reactor. </para><para>It is significant that the Minority Report highlighted the fact that the evidence to the Committee overwhelmingly supported the Government's decision to build a replacement reactor. The Minority Report also noted that the conclusions and recommendations of the Majority Report were quite inconsistent with the body of the Committee's Report.  </para><para>The Government would also emphasise that the Parliamentary Public Works Committee, which examined the replacement reactor project in 1999, unanimously concluded that there was a need to replace HIFAR with a modern research reactor. The Parliamentary Public Works Committee also unanimously concluded that the need for the replacement of HIFAR arises as a consequence of national interest considerations, research and development requirements and the need to sustain the local production of radiopharmaceuticals. </para><para>The Chief Scientist, in his submission to the Committee said that Australia's “ability to retain world-class researchers or to attract them in the first place is not helped if a due process for approval of a world-class facility is repeatedly revisited”.</para><para>The Government considers that a compelling case has been made for proceeding with the replacement reactor. The call for a further inquiry is unnecessary and designed to serve the purposes of those opposed to the replacement reactor.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Summary, Part I, page 92 and Chapter 11, p. 225</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that before the Government proceeds any further with the proposed reactor, it undertake a thorough and comprehensive public review of funding for medical and scientific research in Australia with a view to assessing priorities including the role, if any, a research reactor would have in contributing to Australia's scientific, medical and industrial interests.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE:  DISAGREE</inline></para><para>As indicated in the Government's response to the previous recommendation, it is firmly of the view that the need for a replacement reactor has been clearly established and has acted accordingly in proceeding with its construction. </para><para>The proposed “thorough and comprehensive public review of funding for medical and scientific research in Australia” is unnecessary. Undertaking such a broad review is not a normal precursor to proceeding with major national infrastructure projects. The funding requirements for medical research in Australia was subject to such a review by Mr Peter Wills in 1999 (<inline font-style="italic">The Virtuous Cycle</inline>) and for scientific research by the Chief Scientist, Dr Robin Batterham in 2000 (<inline font-style="italic">The Chance to Change</inline>). These reviews were undertaken in consultation with the medical and scientific communities and other interested parties, including the general public. The Government has responded to the reports in the 1999-2000 and 2001-02 Budgets, with substantial increases in funding. </para><para>However, concerning the contribution that the replacement reactor would make to Australia's scientific, medical and industrial interests, the following points provide a clear indication of the extensive contribution that the replacement reactor will make in each of these areas. </para><para>Maintenance of an indigenous neutron source is an important aspect of Australia's overall research infrastructure. The Australian Vice Chancellors' Committee stated in its submission that “A modern state of the art Australian facility supporting leading edge beam instruments and providing for a range of irradiation is essential to advance the application of science and technology to the benefit of industry, health, the environment and education within Australia.” ANSTO's HIFAR reactor is not only used by ANSTO's research staff, but also by university staff and post-graduate researchers from 36 universities in Australia and New Zealand who make extensive use of the instruments on the research reactor. </para><para>The replacement reactor will have more instruments and higher neutron flux than HIFAR and will be able to provide a level of support for Australian science, higher education and industry that is comparable to the support enjoyed by their USA and Japanese counterparts. As an example, a cold neutron source which will be a feature of the replacement reactor. These sources are now providing the basis for many of the current advances in neutron science, especially in structural biology and in such emerging fields as nanoscience and engineering, and novel materials.</para><para>The irradiation capabilities of the existing HIFAR reactor are used to produce isotopes that have applications in most industries. Radioactive isotopes are used as sensors in process control systems for performing on-line, non-contact and non-destructive measurement and can also be used to analyse materials such as mineral ores or coal. In 1997, Access Economics identified gross economic benefits in the range of $140 million to $230 million annually from selected activities impacting on health, mining and other industries. Neutrons generated by research reactors also have particular utility in probing the structure of solids and liquids and, as indicated above, the replacement reactor will potentially underpin developments in materials science with application in emerging technology platforms such as biotechnology and nanotechnology. </para><para>It is estimated that, on average, every Australian will have a reactor based nuclear medicine procedure in their lifetime. On the basis of Medicare data, an estimated 326,000 nuclear medicine procedures using reactor-derived isotopes were undertaken in 1996. In the USA, the use of nuclear technologies has reduced the annual number of patients treated using surgery for hyperthyroidism from 3000 to 502. The Government, together with relevant medical specialists, considers that it would be quite imprudent not to proceed with the replacement reactor as this would expose delivery of isotope based medical therapies to unacceptable risks in terms of security of supply and reliability of distribution. The President of the Australian New Zealand Society of Nuclear Medicine summed these issues up in a press release issued on 3 May 2001 “There is really no viable alternative to a local research reactor as the source of radiopharmaceuticals for medical use.”   </para><para>In short, the importance of the replacement reactor to Australia's scientific, medical and industrial interests is very clear.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 226 </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee strongly recommends that there should be full disclosure of the termination provisions of the contract signed with INVAP so the Parliament and the Australian people will know what obligations have been entered into.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE: AGREE—THIS HAS BEEN DONE</inline></para><para>ANSTO provided the Committee with a significant amount of material relating to the contract with INVAP.

The Government considers that, generally speaking, parties to contracts with Government agencies are aware that this accountability could result in scrutiny of contractual arrangements, either through the audit function of the Australian National Audit Office or direct scrutiny by a Parliamentary Committee. However, for its part, ANSTO has sought to deal with this explicitly in the Conditions of Tender for the replacement reactor, which not only made reference to the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Freedom of Information Act 1982</inline> but also specifically canvassed the possible need to provide information to the Commonwealth Auditor-General. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 228 </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee further recommends that any future contract entered into by ANSTO, include provisions that require contractors to keep and provide sufficient information to allow for proper Parliamentary scrutiny of the contract and its management.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE: AGREE WITH QUALIFICATIONS </inline></para><para>As indicated in the response to the previous recommendation, the Government notes that ANSTO's approach to arriving at a contract for construction of the replacement reactor displayed due regard to its accountability obligations as a Government agency. The Government is confident that ANSTO will ensure that where it can be reasonably concluded that particular information associated with a contract would be material to proper evaluation of the contract and its management, the necessary steps will be taken to ensure that the information was available for that purpose. However, should the information have commercial confidentiality implications, as is the case with much of the content of the contract for the replacement reactor, consideration would also need to be given to the basis on which the information might be provided. </para><para>The Government considers that failure to recognise and respect the rights of non-government parties to have commercially sensitive information handled appropriately could lead to perceptions of an increased level of sovereign risk associated with dealing with the Commonwealth. This might result in the objectives of the Commonwealth's procurement process being placed at risk.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Chapter 11, pages 228-29</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that, if the new research reactor project is to go ahead, the Government put in place a number of mechanisms to ensure that full and thorough public scrutiny of the proposal takes place during the licensing process. This is to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the construction and operation of the proposed reactor would not adversely affect the health of the community or damage the environment. At a minimum, these mechanisms must include:</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-weight="bold">publication of all submissions made to ARPANSA during the licensing process;</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-weight="bold">publication of ARPANSA's responses to concerns raised in these submissions, detailing in what way those concerns have affected the CEO's decision;</inline></para><para>·	<inline font-weight="bold">release of the full details of the design and the construction contract except for those items which are determined as truly commercial-in-confidence.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE:  AGREE WITH QUALIFICATIONS</inline></para><para>Arrangements are already in place under relevant legislation to ensure, to the greatest extent practicable, that the construction and operation of the replacement reactor will not adversely affect the health of the community or damage the environment. </para><para>The potential environmental impact of the replacement reactor was rigorously examined in accordance with the relevant legislation, the <inline font-style="italic">Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act (1974)</inline>. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage decided that there were no environmental reasons preventing the granting of Commonwealth approval for the replacement reactor. On the basis of the environmental impact assessment process, the Minister made a number of recommendations to ensure that the replacement reactor is constructed and operated in accordance with best international practice. All the recommendations were accepted by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. They now not only apply to the construction of the replacement reactor but, in some cases, will extend throughout the reactor's lifetime. </para><para>Radiation health issues are now being specifically addressed via the licensing procedures of ARPANSA, under the provisions of the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety Act</inline><inline font-style="italic">(1998)</inline>.</para><para>In relation to the specific recommendations that all submissions made to ARPANSA during the licensing process and that ARPANSA's responses to concerns raised in these submissions be published, the Government considers that the extent of publication of information proposed by ARPANSA is appropriate in the circumstances. </para><para>ANSTO's construction licence application, its Preliminary Safety Analysis Report (PSAR), a detailed summary of the PSAR have already been made available to the public. The ARPANSA and International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) reviews of those documents, together with the outcomes of the review of the PSAR by the nuclear regulatory authority of Argentina will also be made available to the public. Formal questions and answers between ARPANSA and ANSTO/INVAP will be placed on the public record, and advice provided by the independent ARPANSA Nuclear Safety Committee will also be published.</para><para>ARPANSA's consideration of the licensing application will involve two rounds of submissions from the public, the first covering submissions on the application and related documents, and the second to allow comment on the main issues arising from the first round of submissions and from reviews of ANSTO's PSAR undertaken by ARPANSA and IAEA experts. Submissions other than those outlined in the previous paragraph, which will primarily consist of other submissions from the general public, will be available on request subject to the agreement of the submitter. </para><para>The CEO of ARPANSA, in making his decision on the licence application, must take all submissions into account. The CEO will publish a report setting out how he did so.</para><para>Regarding the specific recommendation that full details of the design and construction contract except for those items which are determined as truly commercial-in-confidence be released, the Government notes that, in all cases where the Committee requested the text of specific provisions of the contract, ANSTO provided that material. Release of the termination provisions is a case in point. ANSTO also provided the Committee with a table of the contract's contents and a summary of the contract. The text of certain subclauses was provided in response to a question taken on notice during the Committee's hearings. </para><para>The Government would emphasise that, by their very nature, a number of the remaining matters covered in the contract would raise commercial-in-confidence concerns from INVAP's perspective. This point was made by INVAP itself in evidence to the Committee. Consequently, the Government considers that the public interest would not be well served by a process that would effectively yield little additional information. As indicated above, all safety issues associated with design and construction of the replacement reactor will be subject to public scrutiny during ARPANSA's consideration of ANSTO's application for the construction licence. A considerable volume of material relating to the design and construction of the replacement reactor has already been released and, as noted above, further material will be made public during the licensing process. The Government considers that this body of material will provide a sound basis for ensuring that neither the health of the community nor the environment are adversely affected by construction and operation of the reactor.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 229 </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Given that there are doubts about privilege and the powers of such an inquiry to obtain documents because the </inline><inline font-style="italic">ARPANS Act</inline><inline font-weight="bold"> is silent on these issues, the Committee recommends that the Government appoint a panel including the CEO of ARPANSA under other legislative powers to conduct the inquiry.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE:  DISAGREE </inline></para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">ARPANS Act 1998 </inline>sets out a process for considering ANSTO's construction and operating licence applications.

The Government notes in this context that the purpose of the licensing application process is to provide the necessary support for a decision by the Chief Executive Officer of ARPANSA on ANSTO's licence application. The Government does not accept that a judicial inquiry represents a superior approach to arriving at a decision as to whether or not to issue a licence.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 229 </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee further recommends that, in the longer term, the Government undertake a public review of the kinds of public consultation process required in other jurisdictions and in relation to other proposals with public health and environmental implications.

This was done on the basis that it was only to be used for the purpose of the French court proceedings. Subsequently, Greenpeace Australia provided the Committee with details from the contract without COGEMA's knowledge or agreement.  </para><para>Given the erroneous claims about the contractual relationship between ANSTO and COGEMA that followed disclosure of this information, COGEMA agreed to ANSTO's proposal that the Senate be provided with a copy of the contract and a related exchange of letters from August and September 2000 in order to clarify the situation. This information was provided in the course of the Industry, Science and Resources portfolio estimates hearing on 4 June 2001. </para><para>The Government would, however, like to register the point that the contract contained commercially and technically sensitive information, and an express provision as to confidentiality that was binding on both parties. The Government understands that similar confidentiality provisions are contained in all COGEMA's reprocessing contracts. While the Government accepts that ANSTO has obligations to be accountable to Parliament for its handling of the reprocessing of spent fuel from Lucas Heights, due acknowledgment also needs to be given to the legitimate concerns that other parties to contracts, such as COGEMA, might have over protection of their commercial position. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 230 </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that, in light of the growing opposition overseas, ANSTO prepare and fully cost a contingency management plan for spent fuel conditioning and disposal within Australia.

Successive governments then allowed spent fuel to accumulate at Lucas Heights. </para><para>The strategy for management of spent fuel from research reactor operations was determined by the Labor Government in 1995, in respect of the management of spent fuel rods from HIFAR. That Government announced in October 1995 that it had decided “to make full use of international opportunities” by exporting the spent fuel and that Australia would manage the long-lived intermediate waste that would arise from reprocessing. It authorised the negotiation of a contract to ship 114 spent fuel rods to the United Kingdom for reprocessing, and the return to Australia of the resulting waste. The shipment was despatched in April 1996.</para><para>A domestic conditioning option for research reactor spent fuel was fully evaluated by the Government in 1997. In the event, the Government decided against this option, announcing on 3 September 1997 that it had: </para><para>“decided not to establish a reprocessing facility at Lucas Heights or anywhere else in Australia. </para><para>Instead, $88 million has been set aside to remove spent nuclear fuel rods from Lucas Heights and meet the cost of reprocessing offshore.” </para><para>Since that announcement, ANSTO has negotiated contractual arrangements with COGEMA for the reprocessing in France of spent fuel from both HIFAR and the replacement reactor, and with the US Department of Energy for the return of US-origin spent fuel. Shipments of HIFAR spent fuel were sent overseas in 1998 (USA), 1999 and 2001 (France). </para><para>USA-sourced spent fuel rods are shipped back to the USA in accord with US nuclear non proliferation policy and the US has agreed to take back for storage all US sourced spent fuel arising from research reactor operations until May 2006 as part of that policy.</para><para>France has undertaken, via an exchange of letters at ministerial level, to facilitate the reprocessing of Australian spent fuel by COGEMA. The Government has no reason to doubt those undertakings. COGEMA is the world's largest provider of spent nuclear fuel reprocessing services. It has contracts to reprocess spent nuclear fuel with about 29 utilities from six countries. The Government notes that COGEMA has recently signed a contract with the French State Electricity Company, EDF to reprocess waste until 2015. The reprocessing of all the spent fuel produced by HIFAR over its lifetime will amount to about 0.02 percent of the annual processing capacity of the La-Hague facility.</para><para>As a contingency measure, INVAP is also contractually committed to arrange, on request, for the processing of spent fuel from the replacement reactor in a way that complies with ANSTO's requirements. That provision would be invoked if, for any reason, the COGEMA route for reprocessing becomes unavailable. However, given current circumstances, it is unlikely that this will need to be invoked.</para><para>The Government considers that these contractual arrangements, which are supported by governmental commitments from the French and Argentinian Governments, demonstrate that adequate provision has been made for the management of Australian spent fuel. A domestic contingency management plan is therefore unnecessary. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation	Chapter 11, page 230 </inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that the Government satisfactorily resolve the question of the safe disposal of new reactor spent fuel before approval to construct a new reactor is given.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RESPONSE:  DISAGREE</inline></para><para>The CEO of ARPANSA has a statutory responsibility for deciding on the issuance of a licence to construct the replacement research reactor. The Government notes in this context that the CEO of ARPANSA stated on 26 October 2000 in testimony to the Inquiry that, in terms of licensing, he “would need to be satisfied that Australia will have such a store (ie for long-lived intermediate level waste) and that those arrangements are progressing in such a way that I can be satisfied that it will have such a store.” </para><para>The Government is confident of meeting the ARPANSA CEO's requirement, which diverges from the recommendation in requiring adequate progress rather than ultimate resolution of the issue of the disposal of replacement research reactor spent fuel. The Government notes that, the first shipments of waste from the processing of spent fuel from HIFAR and from the replacement research reactor will not be returned to Australia for storage until around 2015 and 2025, respectively. </para><para>ANSTO advised the Committee that, in accordance with Government policy, spent fuel from the replacement reactor will be managed in the first instance by processing overseas through the contractual and inter-governmental commitments referred to in the response to the previous recommendation. The long-lived intermediate level wastes that result from processing will then be managed in Australia with, and form a very small portion of, the Commonwealth's holding of this type of waste. The storage facility is needed for the management of more than 400 cubic metres of long-lived intermediate level waste that is currently held by Commonwealth agencies. The vitrified (glass) residues and compacted waste arising from both HIFAR and the replacement research reactor spent fuel will amount to an additional 46 cubic metres. ANSTO made it clear that, as was discussed in the Environmental Impact Statement for the Replacement Research Reactor, management of spent nuclear fuel from the replacement reactor will not involve direct disposal in Australia, nor reprocessing in Australia, nor indefinite storage in Australia. </para><para>The Government has decided that the most appropriate way to manage the Commonwealth's holding of long-lived intermediate level radioactive waste is to house it in a purpose-built above-ground storage facility. The facility will be designed to accommodate the current holding of this class of waste and future arisings, which include the small amount of waste that will arise from reprocessing of spent fuel from HIFAR and the replacement research reactor.</para><para>The Minister for Industry, Science and Resources, Senator Minchin, announced a process to establish such a store in August 2000. In February 2001, the Minister announced that the national store will be sited on Commonwealth land, and the earliest the preferred site could be announced would be late 2002. A public discussion paper on methods for choosing the site was released recently. </para><para>Waste arising from the processing of spent fuel from the replacement research reactor will be returned to Australia from France in purpose-designed transport and storage casks as vitrified residues and compacted waste. The casks will be appropriate for storage in the national store, and will remain in this facility until a geological repository is established for the ultimate disposal of long-lived intermediate level waste. Given the amount of the Commonwealth's holding of this type of waste, and the likely rate of arisings in the foreseeable future, a geological repository cannot be justified for such waste at present.</para><para>1 	Report of the Parliamentary Standing Committee on Public Works, August 1999, paragraph 2.65, p34.</para><para>2 	Australian Nuclear Association submission to the Senate <inline font-style="italic">Select Committee Inquiry into the contract for a new reactor at Lucas Heights</inline> (number 81)</para><para>—————</para><para>379th REPORT OF JOINT COMMITTEE OF PUBLIC ACCOUNTS AND AUDIT: CONTRACT MANAGEMENT IN THE AUSTRALIAN PUBLIC SERVICE</para><para>WHOLE OF GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO RECOMMENDATIONS 1-5</para><para>The 379th report of the Joint Committee of Public Accounts and Audit—Contract Management in the Australian Public Service—was tabled in the Parliament on 2 November 2000.

The key objective of the inquiry was to “analyse a range of examples in order to develop better practice approaches to contract management that can be applied across Government agencies”.</para><para>The Government notes the importance that contract management now assumes in the Australian Public Service (APS) and the enhanced benefits that it can offer. The Government is also keenly aware of the importance of transparency and accountability when managing Government contracts.  </para><para>The Government further notes that agencies remain accountable for the delivery of services, even where the service delivery is provided by the private sector. Central to the accountability principle is the need to maintain awareness of client needs and how they are being met.</para><para>It is appropriate to re-emphasise that APS agencies operate under a robust accountability framework that enables detailed scrutiny of any contracts that they may enter into. The legislative and policy framework governing APS agencies includes the:</para><para>·	Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997;</para><para>·	Financial Management and Accountability Regulations;</para><para>·	Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines;</para><para>·	Commonwealth Authorities and Companies Act 1997;</para><para>·	Chief Executive's Instructions;</para><para>·	Freedom of Information Act 1982;</para><para>·	Ombudsman Act 1976;</para><para>·	Auditor-General Act 1997;</para><para>·	Public Accounts and Audit Committee Act 1951;</para><para>·	Public Works Committee Act 1969; and</para><para>·	Mandatory Reporting of Commonwealth Contracts.</para><para>The diversity of agency function, structure and purpose, however, poses a unique challenge for broad scale contract management reform across the APS. In this regard, the Government is aware that the positive economic benefits of contract management need not be lost through excessive or unworkable administrative requirements. With this in mind, the revised production of the Commonwealth Procurement Guidelines and Best Practice Guidance—February 2002 is aiming to set workable and succinct guidance for Commonwealth agency contract management. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para>That the Ombudsman Act 1976 be amended to extend the jurisdiction of the Ombudsman to include all government contractors.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Response: Partially Agree</inline></para><para>The Government agrees that the Ombudsman should have jurisdiction to investigate the actions of private sector organisations that are contracted by Commonwealth agencies to provide goods and/or services to the public and will examine options for amending the Ombudsman Act 1976. </para><para>However, the Government considers that Government contractors who provide goods and/or services to agencies rather than to the public, should not be subject to the Ombudsman's jurisdiction as members of the public would not have sufficient interest in the actions of those contractors to warrant extending the Ombudsman's jurisdiction to them.</para><para>The Government considers that the Ombudsman should ensure that agencies are informed about investigations relating to their contractors.

The Government agrees that when an agency receives a request to disclose details on any contract that it has entered into, only the actual information in the contract that can legitimately be classified as commercial-in-confidence (CIC) should be classified as CIC. The Government does not support the view that commercial information is inherently confidential. Any decision to withhold information on CIC grounds needs to be fully substantiated, fundamentally stating the reasons why such information should not be disclosed.</para><para>To assist agencies with the process, the Government will be issuing further guidance material that will better clarify how agencies should assess contracts to determine what should be classified as CIC to further enhance the existing robust accountability framework. </para><para>As a general approach the consideration of what should be CIC is normally done by assessing whether the release of information could unreasonably disadvantage the Commonwealth or a contractor and advantage their competitors in future tender processes, for example, details of commercial strategies or fee structures, details of intellectual property and other information of significant commercial value. The case by case assessment of what is CIC is appropriate as what may be assessed as CIC will vary over the life of the contract and after the contract has expired. Any documents that are produced as part of the contract can also contain information that may be classified as CIC and these need to also be assessed when an agency receives a request to release information.</para><para>The Government has agreed in principle to the Senate Order on departmental and agency contracts of 20 June 2001, which requires:</para><para>·	information to be placed on an agency's website, including details of:</para><para>·	a list of agency contracts of $100,000 or more which have been entered into by the agency which have not been fully performed or which have been entered into during the previous 12 months;</para><para>·	the contractor and the subject matter of each contract;</para><para>·	whether each contract contains provisions requiring the parties to maintain confidentiality of any of its provisions, or whether any provisions of the contract are regarded by the parties as confidential, and a statement of the reasons for confidentiality; and</para><para>·	an estimate of the cost of complying with the order.</para><para>The Government tabled a statement that compliance with the order will be based on the following terms:</para><para>·	agencies will use the Department of Prime Minister and Cabinet guidelines on the scope of public interest immunity (in Government Guidelines for Official Witnesses before Parliamentary Committees) to determine whether information regarding individual contracts will be provided;</para><para>·	agencies will not disclose information if disclosure would be contrary to the Privacy Act 1988, or to other statutory secrecy provisions, or if the Commonwealth has given an undertaking to another party that the information will not be disclosed; and</para><para>·	compliance with the Senate order will be progressive as agencies covered by the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 refine arrangements and processes to meet the new requirements. </para><para>Under the Financial Management and Accountability Act 1997 Chief Executives are accountable for procurement decisions, including decisions on the disclosure of information.

The government concurs with the Committee in its hope that this will contribute to the healing process for those who have conflicting or painful memories of the schemes.</para><para>The legacy of the child migration schemes must be addressed. An important and necessary follow-on from this report is that the needs of child migrants continue to be recognised by government agencies and that they receive appropriate support and assistance, as they need it. </para><para>In responding to this report we understand that former child migrants are not a homogenous group and their needs for support or assistance may vary considerably. Some may be happily settled and not want or need assistance, some may be living abroad, or deceased. Others may have been scarred by their experiences and have suffered long-lasting effects throughout their lives. </para><para>The Commonwealth government's focus therefore is on practical support and assistance, with a package of key measures: notably a contribution towards a new travel fund for former child migrants; maintaining funding for family tracing and counselling services; and contributing to a memorial(s) to recognise former child migrants in the Australian community. This is in response to the Committee's strong emphasis on the importance of family tracing services, counselling and public recognition of child migrants. These are key initiatives the Commonwealth can be involved in to acknowledge its past role in the schemes.</para><para>Some recommendations are clearly directed to State governments or sending and receiving agencies. The Commonwealth Government urges State governments and other agencies involved to respond in spirit and in practice to the Committee's recommendations. The Commonwealth Government looks forward to working with these agencies cooperatively and will raise these recommendations further with State governments, as well as referring the Committee's report and this response to the UK government.</para><para>Finally, it is acknowledged that State governments, receiving agencies and a variety of archival institutions have already taken steps to support child migrants in various ways and assist them to rebuild their family histories. The government considers that this report will focus efforts to build on these positive steps, (some of which are referred to in this report), and urges all organisations involved to do so. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE COMMUNITY AFFAIRS REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT:</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">LOST INNOCENTS: RIGHTING THE RECORD</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATIONS</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para><inline font-style="italic">That the Commonwealth Government urge the State and Territory Governments to undertake inquiries similar to the Queensland Forde inquiry into the treatment of all children in institutional care in their respective States and Territories; and that the Senate Social Welfare Committee's 1985 inquiry be revisited so that a national perspective may be given to the issue of children in institutional care.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government response </inline></para><para>The government supports this recommendation and will bring the recommendation to the attention of the Community Services Ministers Advisory Council, acknowledging that children in institutions are the primary responsibility of the States and Territories. </para><para>The number of children in institutional/residential care has decreased markedly from approximately 27,000 in 1954 to less than 2,000 currently.

Child migrants are not a homogenous group in terms of their needs—some may be happily settled and not want to be identified or need assistance, some may be living abroad, or deceased. The government's focus has been, and continues to be, on addressing needs through the provision of counselling where child migrants have presented seeking support.</para><para>In terms of providing further statistical information, DIMIA provided as accurate an estimate as possible of the numbers of child migrants to Australia in its submission to the Senate inquiry. The statistics were taken from quarterly statistical bulletins published from 1947 to 1961. After 1961 these statistics were no longer published in this format and instead were aggregated with other more general migration statistics, presumably because the numbers of child migrants had declined substantially by that stage. </para><para>DIMIA also provided post 1961 statistics, taken from various reports to Parliament recorded in Hansard over the next decade. However these reports were intermittent and did not provide exact numbers involved. In view of this, DIMIA is unable to provide more accurate historical figures than those already provided to the committee.

Recovery of documents held by State and Territory authorities is obviously a matter of consideration for those governments.

The first option is that the Senate could determine that the matters disclosed in Senator Scullion's letter do not give rise to a possible disqualification and that, therefore, no further action should be taken in relation to the matter. The second is that the Senate could refer the matter to the High Court, sitting as the Court of Disputed Returns, under section 376 of the Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Before deciding on which of those options we collectively should pursue, I propose that in this case it would be appropriate for the President of the Senate to convene a meeting of senior senators to draw up a recommendation to the chamber for debate, if necessary, and endorsement. This is a procedure that we have used on a limited number of occasions. Effectively, we have had two options: either that such a meeting be convened by the Leader of the Government in the Senate or that the President—as has happened on at least one occasion—take the initiative. I believe in this particular case it is appropriate for the President to take that initiative. I do accept that it would be important for such a meeting to be held as quickly as possible, because there is an urgent need to resolve Senator Scullion's situation. As senators dealing with this sort of issue, we need to approach this having a mind to Senator Scullion's request and interests in relation to the matters that he has placed before the President of the Senate.</para><para>I think the approach I am suggesting to the Senate—and I have informally indicated to Madam President that I would be proposing such a course of action—is appropriate and sensible in the circumstances. It means that a small group of senators can come together and propose a course of action to the Senate and, in the final analysis, it does give us an opportunity to look at appropriate recommendations leading up to the two options that have been identified by the Clerk. I commend that course of action to Madam President, and to the Senate more broadly. It is, as I say, an absolutely appropriate and sensible way of dealing with this particular matter. I would certainly argue that we do that as quickly as we can so that we can resolve this issue in relation to Senator Scullion's status. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>1394</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will just speak briefly to this matter.

I note he has not sought to use this occasion to argue that the facts amount to a breach of that particular provision of the Constitution, section 44(v). Therefore, I also will not seek to use this occasion to argue that matter. On the question of the law, the government side of the chamber has been taking some advice. We have received some preliminary advice, and I have sought further advices arising out of the opinion that we have received. Therefore, after a short while, I think that we on this side will be better able to appreciate the legal consequences.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Having said that, in case this matter is misinterpreted because of the little information that is on the public record, it is important that I make the point that, to me, clearly this is not a case of any deliberate breach of the provisions of the Constitution. This is a case of a now honourable senator who clearly had an interest in a small business which was incorporated in Darwin in the Northern Territory and operated in the marine servicing area. His interest, as we know, was just over one-third of the shares. He was secretary and he received benefits as a director of the company. That family company, in turn, contracted with a range of bodies. Those included the Australian Fisheries Management Authority and some incidental, one-off contracts with bodies such as the ABC and naval services. The honourable senator is now aware that there can be an argument that because of his indirect interest in that company, from which he received a benefit and the company in turn contracts with those bodies, a question might arise under that particular provision of the Constitution.</para><para>It has been brought to the Senate and the Senate now, obviously, has it before it. I think the proposal that it be considered calmly and rationally by senators, not in the first instance on the floor of this place, is a sensible one and one with which I concur. I am not quite so sure I would give the President the obligation to draft a proposed resolution and, thus, lead in the process. It might be better for honourable senators, through the party process and together with the Independents, to discuss the facts of the matter, and the matters pertaining, perhaps separate and distinct from the President. The President has received the letter and has brought it to the attention of the Senate. It is now in the hands of the Senate as to what action it will take.</para><para>I have noted the advice given to Senator Faulkner by the Clerk. It was provided to me by Senator Faulkner during question time. The Clerk sets out two options. I think there is a third option—that is, that senators might determine that, on the facts, the matter is not such that it should be pursued in the chamber. The Clerk sets out two options for the Senate, which seem to me to be in terms that the Senate could determine—in other words, resolve—that the matters disclosed do not give rise to possible disqualification. Alternatively, the Senate could resolve to refer the matter to the High Court. I am suggesting there may be a third option that, on the merits of the matter, senators might simply not pursue the matter. There may not be a resolution moved in this place but that is something that can be discussed in the next day or two.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name></talker><para>—It requires some caution.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name></talker><para>—You have expressed a view; I am expressing a view which, in this instance, differs slightly from yours.

Therefore, if there is no benefit to be gained between the parties, that is another good reason why the matter could be better settled outside the public political forum of this chamber. That is all I want to say at the moment. I am pleased that Senator Scullion has brought it to the attention of the President. I do not know that I would quite have used Senator Faulkner's terms of throwing himself at the mercy of the Senate. Certainly, he has recognised that it is the appropriate thing in the circumstances, having become aware of these matters and the possible consequences, to bring it to the attention of fellow senators. He has done that. I believe now, hopefully, in a calm and rational way, honourable senators can decide how the matter should be further progressed. </para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>1395</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I say at the outset that I take a liberal view of matters like this. I have been in parliaments long enough to know how easily inadvertence can lead to serious outcomes. I would like to point out again that section 44 of the Constitution needs changing. Clause after clause of that part of the Constitution needs changing. The Australian people are sensible enough to see that that is the case. I have had before this chamber legislation to change section 44 of the Constitution insofar as it prevents probably five million Australians from standing for parliament because they have some arrangement with the Crown—they get a pension, they are under a wage or, indeed, they have dual citizenship. There is a whole range of reasons why Australians cannot stand for parliament and, 100 years after the Constitution was written, not only is that a nonsense; it is a great injustice. We ought to change it. When it comes to section 44(v), which is the case in point, the terms used are that any person who—</para></talk.start><quote><para>Has any direct or indirect pecuniary interest in any agreement with the Public Service of the Commonwealth otherwise than as a member and in common with the other members of an incorporated company consisting of more than twenty-five persons—</para></quote><para>shall lose their seat. Does this mean that, if I go down to the ABC Shop, buy some CDs and get a receipt from the cash register, I have definitely entered into an agreement? If I set up an account there, does this mean that I have lost my seat? I think that would be highly arguable in the High Court. The matter ought to be subject to clearer enactment, so that people know exactly where they stand. That is my view of the matter at this stage. I admire Senator Scullion for his presentation to the President and, therefore, to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>1395</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are remarkable similarities between Senator Scullion's circumstances and those of the Webster case in 1975. On that occasion, evidence was inadvertently given to a joint committee and had to be sent on to the Senate. It pointed the finger at Senator Webster for being in possible violation of section 44(v). Since then, there have been two other cases referred by the Senate to the Court of Disputed Returns; that is, the High Court acting in that capacity. There was the Woods case in 1988, which was based on citizenship, where Senator Woods was disqualified from this chamber. Then there was the reference—albeit a qualified one—of the matter of Ms Jeannie Ferris, who was then a senator-designate, on the basis of office of profit under the Crown. There were broad hints dropped by this Senate—not the least of which were by me and others—that the most appropriate way to deal with that was to resign and be renominated.</para></talk.start><para>Those above cases were reasonably clear cut in terms of the Constitution. But in this case, section 44(v) is quite confusing. In the Webster case, Justice Barwick sat alone. It was an incomprehensible decision to anyone how, on such a major constitutional issue, he could sit alone. Nevertheless, he did. We would say he did so because he was a spear carrier for the coalition on all occasions. In reading his judgment in the Webster case, I admire the convoluted rationalisations he went through to come to his conclusion, but I also recognise the conservative bias that was involved.</para><para>There were two questions that went to the High Court, which would be similar in this case if it ever got to that stage. They were:</para><quote><para>(a) Whether Senator Webster was incapable of being chosen or of sitting as a senator; and (b) Whether Senator Webster has become incapable of sitting as a senator.  </para></quote><para>In that case, some pretty well-known people appeared. Ted Hughes appeared for the attorney-general of the day and one William Deane appeared for Senator Webster. Both of them went on to greater heights. In the Webster case, though, Justice Barwick ruled that transactions were indeed with the Public Service, but that they were consequences of `open and competitive quotation'—in other words, a competitive tender. He went on to say that the transactions were `uninfluenced by the fact that Senator Webster was a member of the company'. In other words, his role as a senator had nothing to do with that company winning the contract. Barwick argued that section 44(v) was designed so that MPs cannot be unduly influenced by the Crown. He went back to the founding fathers debate to get that. Barwick went on to argue that `casual or transient' contracts are not enough to trigger disqualification. He said:</para><quote><para>The agreement, to fall within the scope of section 44(v), must have a currency for a substantial period of time, and must be one under which the Crown could conceivably influence the contractor in relation to parliamentary affairs by the very existence of the agreement.</para></quote><para>He went on to say:</para><quote><para>I am clearly of the opinion that no standing or continuing agreement was created by them.</para></quote><para>With regard to the pecuniary interest, either direct or indirect—which Senator Brown just overlooked—he came up with a fairly strange ruling. He said that, unless there was a pecuniary interest in the day-to-day transactions, it would not in fact apply. So what we have coming out of the Webster case is a very restrictive interpretation of section 44(v).</para><para>Just a few years later, the very distinguished Senate committee on constitutional and legal affairs produced a report on the qualifications of members of parliament. The report said that the Chief Justice's judgment was narrow in scope and was based on the particular facts before him. I think that is quite important. The report strongly disagreed with the Barwick judgment, saying that he was far too concerned with the ability of the Crown to influence members of parliament, rather than the other way around. That is why, if one of these cases ever goes back to the High Court, it may be interpreted entirely differently from the Barwick case. It was also critical of Barwick's tendency to isolate contracts as being transient; in fact, when you put them all together they almost certainly constituted a rather large agreement between the two parties. </para><para>Today we have seen a letter from Senator Scullion tabled in this parliament. It begins by saying, `I am writing in connection with a possible breach by me of section 44(v) of the Constitution.' Once that letter is tabled here, it has to be dealt with. We cannot ignore it once Senator Scullion has put it before us. It is a bit of an attention grabber. In the letter, Senator Scullion questions whether AFMA and the ABC come within the ambit of arrangements with the Public Service—as does, I think, the government's first legal opinion. I would have to say that it does, and I do not think that argument will hold water. If Senator Scullion worked for AFMA or the ABC and ran for parliament without resigning, he would be regarded as having an office of profit under the Crown. Similarly, I do not think any court would rule that this is not an arrangement with the Public Service, notwithstanding the legal views—pretty puerile views—put in the first cut of legal advice to government. </para><para>Senator Scullion offers three courses of action in the letter. For the first, he says that it is open to the Senate to decide that there is no breach of section 44(v). That is true, and that may well be where we get to. I must say that the suggestion of Senator Faulkner and Senator Hill, who both said that this is a classic issue and we could take it off-floor for a while and consider it, is very sensible. This may not mean, though, that the matter does not go to the High Court. Any Australian citizen can take this matter to the High Court, with the temptation, of course, that they can be rewarded at the rate of 100 a day—I do not know where you get the 100 from these days—but the risk of losing and paying legal expenses balances that. But you can never be certain, and we cannot say that the matter cannot go to the High Court. Any citizen could take it to the High Court.  </para><para>Senator Scullion went on to say, with respect to the second course of action he put, that we could be dealing with the situation of a casual vacancy if he were to resign. I really think that is not on. That would be a very silly course of action. If there is an offence, it not only is an offence now but also was an offence at the time of the election. If there was an offence at the time of the election, the High Court will rule for a recount. So there is no purpose in resigning and being reappointed—which I went through before, Senator Ferris, saying that I believe it was appropriate in your case, although if it had eventually gone back to the High Court I do not know what they would have ruled in terms of your initial eligibility. I think it would have been all right. But it is not an option that I would recommend to the senator in this case. It just simply would not work.</para><para>Senator Scullion then talks about a third course of action, and that is that we could do what we normally do in these cases: refer it to the Court of Disputed Returns. We have done so before, and we could do so again. I do not think we should do that today. I think it should be considered to see whether it is necessary. In the case of it going to the Court of Disputed Returns, there is not a requirement on Senator Scullion to stand aside. Senator Webster did; Senator Woods did not. I personally think that you continue here until you are rubbed out—if you are ever rubbed out, I should say. </para><para>The biggest problem with this, in terms of Senator Scullion's correspondence, goes to the company's long-term relationship with the AFMA—going back to 1991—and the fact that it provided three-quarters of the company's income in 2001. I do not think any of the other contracts entered into will qualify under section 44(v). They all seem to me to be transient, to be at arms-length, to be the result of a tendering process. They cannot be described as agreements between that company and the Public Service. The only one that might be able to be so described is the AFMA one that goes back over something like 11 years.</para><para>Finally, it has to be said—and I think Senator Hill touched on this—that there is absolutely no advantage for the Labor Party in this saga. If for some reason Senator Scullion were to be eliminated, the CLP would send some other dalek along to replace him. What is the benefit for us in that? We do not even want to play mischief on this, because there is absolutely no political benefit to play mischief on this. So, in the end, we just have to do our duty—what is best by this Senate chamber; what is best in recognising what the Constitution meant. In the end, that judgment will be that we do not think there is a case or we think the High Court should hear it. Other than that, it really has very little relevance to the way the chamber operates.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>1397</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Democrats are well informed by the proposition put by Senator Faulkner and varied somewhat by Senator Hill—but still in the same direction—and by the remarks of Senators Brown and Ray.

I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>The proposed amendments to sections 46 and 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974 were referred to the committee by the Senate on 8 August last year on the motion of Senator Murray. They follow directly from the recommendations of the Joint Committee on the Retailing Sector which in 1999 inquired into the growth of large supermarket chains and their impact on small and independent retailers. A number of that report's recommendations were subsequently adopted, but two significant recommendations were not. These form the basis of the amendments which this committee has been examining.</para><para>The first amendment considered by the committee proposes an addition to section 46 of the Trade Practices Act. Section 46 deals with the misuse of market power. At present, where it is alleged that a corporation with a substantial degree of market power has used that power for a purpose prohibited under the act, such as eliminating or damaging a competitor or preventing a new entrant into the market, the person or organisation making the allegation must prove their case against the corporation. If this amendment were implemented, the onus of proof would pass to the corporation. It would have to prove that it did not engage in such conduct. Evidence to the committee from those opposing the amendment suggested that the current section 46 provisions were perfectly adequate to prevent corporations misusing their market power. They cited a number of successful prosecutions of offending corporations.</para><para>Evidence from those supporting the amendment claimed that it was very difficult to bring successful prosecutions. Many of them felt that even with the reversal of the onus of proof, as proposed by the amendment, successful prosecution would remain difficult. Some evidence therefore suggested that, in addition to reversing the onus of proof, the purpose section should be replaced by an effects test. This would mean that the prosecution would not have to establish that an offending company acted for a purpose prohibited under the act but only that this was its effect. That is a much lower barrier and one wholeheartedly opposed by some witnesses. </para><para>The other amendment proposes an addition to section 50 of the Trade Practices Act. Section 50 deals with divestiture. The purpose of section 50 is to prohibit acquisitions that would result in `a substantial lessening of competition'. It is intended to block mergers or takeovers that would have such an effect, although those may be permitted if they were deemed to be in the public interest. Concerns have been expressed by some that the current section 50 provisions, while they may act as a brake on market concentration achieved through mergers or acquisitions, do nothing to prevent companies achieving such domination by gradual acquisition. This amendment, it is suggested by some, if implemented would prevent creeping acquisitions which result in a substantial lessening of competition. Business organisations advised the committee that such an amendment was both unnecessary and potentially very damaging to business because of the uncertainty it would create and its likely impact on business confidence and investment.</para><para>All those providing evidence to the committee recognised the seriousness of the divestiture remedy and the need to limit its use to the courts. After these amendments were referred to the committee, the parliament was dissolved for the election. During the election campaign the Prime Minister foreshadowed an inquiry into the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act. Details of this inquiry, to be chaired by Sir Daryl Dawson, were announced last week. Given the breadth of that review and the fact that it will encompass sections 46 and 50 of the act, the committee has decided not to make recommendations on its findings at this time. It will await the report of that review and any recommendations that may be contained therein. The committee proposes to refer its public submissions, the transcript of its public hearing and its report to that review committee.</para><para>With the assistance and cooperation of all those who lodged submissions and gave evidence to the committee, the committee has provided a short, readable and balanced report. I express my gratitude to my committee colleagues for their assistance during the course of the inquiry. Lastly, I want to particularly thank the members of the committee secretariat who have worked under very difficult circumstances in the last few weeks in order to bring this report to the chamber today. It was not this report that caused the difficult circumstances for the committee and its sister committee, the legislation committee; it was the number of very important and very serious references from the chamber which we had to complete in very short periods of time. I must say that when some of the references were made I was not actually in the chamber or, indeed, in the country at the time or I might have had something to say about the workload that was imposed upon the two committees and the secretariats of the committees.</para><para>I am happy to say that members of the secretariat did have a free weekend last weekend, something they have not had for a number of weeks in order to manage the preparation of the various reports that have been brought to the chamber today and during the course of the last few days. These are instanced on pages 6 and 7 of today's <inline font-style="italic">Order of Business</inline> that has been distributed in the chamber. On behalf of all members of this committee and the legislation committee, I thank all members of the secretariat—there have been a number of people engaged in the preparation of this report and the other reports and in the sifting of the evidence we have received—for their efforts in bringing this report, and the other reports, to the chamber.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>1402</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I wish to commence by talking briefly about the chair, Senator McKiernan, who is leaving us on 30 June. I was a substitute member for my party—the Australian Democrats—to this committee; it is not my normal committee, but since I had referred the terms of reference in question I sat through it. I have previously sat on the committee and had the pleasure of working under Senator McKiernan. I would acknowledge again for the Senate that there are a number of excellent chairs with differing styles on all sides of the chamber, but Senator McKiernan ranks very highly, in my opinion, and amongst the best. I would refer the kind of conduct he normally carries through to those couple of shocking chairmen who I also have experienced who might benefit from his style and the style of some others who are good at that job. I also thank the secretariat: I am conscious that they have been under great pressure, and they have done a credible and thorough job on what is a very readable report. </para></talk.start><para>Turning to the report, I and my party are unashamedly supporters for a stronger Trade Practices Act. The two sections which were referred—46 and 50—are the subject of weaknesses and we think they could be improved. We would argue strongly for that to happen, and we recognise that our view is not supported by big business, which is a sure sign, I think, in matters of trade practices that we are on the right track. We do accept the chair and the committee's view that the government inquiry overtakes this one and does need to be finalised and heard from before we either recommence or reappraise our own term of reference, or perhaps broaden it to consider what the government inquiry is going to come up with.</para><para>These trade practices issues go to the very heart of relationships between business and consumers and between businesses of a large size and those of a small size. They also go to the very heart of what should be regulated in relation to competition. In my view it is not entirely an economic matter; it is also a question of social values. The areas under consideration are always contentious and always have very large effects on the conduct of business. I have noted a small level of feeding frenzy on Professor Fels recently. I want to put on the record that I continue to be a strong supporter of the way in which the ACCC are conducting themselves and are pursuing the economic interests involved in competition policy as well as the consumer interests involved in making sure that Australians get a fair go. I would say to those corporate bureaucrats who populate big business: the more you give him a hiding, the more I think he is on the right track. So let's put that on the record.</para><para>I do not think now is the time for me to come to conclusions as to the best direction to go as a result of the committee's considerations. They have not come up with recommendations. I sense in some members of the committee a real interest in further reform. I thought that the senators participating in the committee were well informed, had experience and had a strong background in this area. I think there is a great deal more that needs to be said on these two issues of section 46 and section 50.</para><para>One thing I will say, though, right up front is that I do not think there can be any consideration of this country having the complete equipment which should go with a trade practices act until the divestiture issue is better addressed. It seems to me passing strange that the United States are continually lauded by those who value the operations of the free market, yet the contribution of their divestiture laws—their antitrust laws, as they are known—is passed by in terms of our own laws. That is one area where I think some form of addressing the divestiture issue better than under section 81 as at present needs to be found. I also believe that section 46 continues to be inadequate for the job it is required to do.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—What about predatory pricing?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name></talker><para>—Senator Boswell knows, having sat with me through the Baird inquiry, that there are not many senators fiercer than I am on predatory pricing and how it performs. Senator Boswell, I recall that my recommendations to the Baird inquiry went far farther than those you ticked off at the time. But, hopefully, you are coming along in my direction now. That would be good to see.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The other matter I wish to address briefly is the difference in consideration given to corporate executives under the law versus the consideration that they would get as ordinary citizens. It is my view that it is appropriate for large corporations to have less protection than is available to a citizen in the normal course of events—because without that less protection you cannot get behind the corporate veil. Accordingly, I agree with the parliament as a whole which has passed various provisions reversing the onus of proof requiring the production of documents and various matters which require people behaving in a corporate capacity to comply with the law more fully than they would otherwise have to as individuals—and I think that is necessary. Giant corporations with their resources and their powers need to be prised open where it is in the public interest. I will address these matters further at another time. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>1404</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise to speak to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee report relevant to the inquiry into section 46 and section 50 of the Trade Practices Act 1974. Senator McKiernan did provide an overview of the report—and I want to add specifically that we will be saying goodbye to Senator McKiernan at the end of this sitting and that we wish him well in his future endeavours; however, that is for another day—but it is worth commenting that the experience he brought to the inquiry benefited everyone in understanding the issues. He chaired the committee well and a report has been produced that explores the issues well.</para></talk.start><para>I detected a slight note from Senator Murray—perhaps wrongly, so do not take it adversely—of disappointment in that the report did not provide the conclusion that he was hoping for or that the committee might have come up with. From my perspective, when we started the inquiry we found that the terms of reference which were provided, although specific, limited in some respects the direction in which the committee could go because in truth we were looking at section 46 and section 50. In doing so, we had two issues in mind: the issue of market power and the misuse of market power under the Trade Practices Act and, linked to that, the requirement that the ACCC be the holder of the power that Senator Murray was seeking to provide them with—the reversal of the onus of proof in the misuse of market power in that section. Similarly, divestiture would be a matter that the ACCC would hold.</para><para>The question more broadly is in relation to part IV, the restrictive trade practices that occur in industry, and whether those issues should have been canvassed and explored. We found during the inquiry that other issues started to intrude—other issues were raised in the many submissions before the committee—such as whether or not an effects test, which I will go to later, might be a better answer. The committee, at least in my mind, was in the position of having to not only look at suggestions by Senator Murray and the reversal of the onus of proof but also consider whether an effects test might be a better outcome or whether a combination of a reversal of the onus of proof or an effects test might be an even better outcome.</para><para>It led me to the conclusion that what was really needed was a broader inquiry to ensure that the area of restrictive trade practices is effective in dealing with the downside to competition. What we discovered in the submissions was that competition in itself can be quite brutal and that it can have effects: businesses can go to the wall in pure competition and businesses can suffer great harm—in fact the ultimate harm of being put out of business—as part of the competitive process. The question is of course: where do you draw the line between fair and effective competition, which might have that result, and unfair competition, which does have that result? The genesis of the Trade Practices Act seems to have been to try to at least put all those balancing positions into the legislation to ensure that competition is fair, effective and reasonable. But it is very difficult to take those sorts of broader concepts and coalesce them into an act that works for everybody.</para><para>I discovered during this inquiry that there are many different views about what is fair and effective competition. What kept recurring was that an effects test might be a better approach and, specifically, whether an effects test is a better approach. The proposition that was put forward for section 46(8), misuse of market power, was to reverse the onus of proof. Reversal of the onus of proof would mean that a corporation would have to demonstrate that they had not taken advantage of their power for a purpose referred to in subsection (1)—effectively, that they had not misused their market power to some end. The effects test is where you have the effect—in other words, the end point—of getting to the misuse of market power. The ACCC indicated that, although they would prefer or seemed to enjoin Senator Murray's case of having a reversal of onus of proof, they did not want to rule out the ability to also have an effects test. In fact, as far as I could understand, they would prefer both in the end. That in itself left me in enough doubt to say it is not clear-cut that Senator Murray's proposal should succeed but, equally, it is not clear-cut that Senator Murray's proposal should fail. </para><para>It was pointed out during the inquiry that the effects test is currently in the Trade Practices Act in sections 45, 47 and 50. The ACCC pointed that out to the members of the committee and they were, to put it in my words, minded to that uniformity in the Trade Practices Act. The witnesses, on the other hand, were equally divided. There were some strongly in favour of the reversal of the onus of proof. There were many against the reversal of the onus of proof. Some of those who were against it preferred a different test such as the effects test. A number of submissions also foreshadowed that there may be a government inquiry as part of a wider inquiry into the process.</para><para>This report has had a long gestation period. It started in the last parliament and continued into this one. Because of that long delay, we got caught up with an election. There was an intimation during the last parliament that the policy of the government was to have a wider inquiry into the Trade Practices Act. Then, close to the completion of the report, the government did announce an inquiry. The scope of the inquiry is quite wide ranging. That, hopefully, will provide an analysis of the area. It will hopefully provide some concrete direction. It will allow the submitters to our inquiry to broaden their approach outside the terms of reference that the Senate had in relation to this report. It also will give this Senate an opportunity to provide the information and evidence to the wide-ranging inquiry, which I hope will assist that inquiry. In conclusion, it will provide the wide-ranging inquiry, which is to be commenced soon, with a direction which will not be so confined as our terms of reference—although I do understand the reasons. There is no backhander in that comment in relation to Senator Murray; I do understand the reasons why they were framed in the way they were. The wider inquiry, hopefully, will provide a greater direction and perhaps assist some of those submitters who did point to what could only be considered unfair competition or competition which seemed, at least from the evidence, to harm their business in ways that were certainly unforeseen when the legislation was initiated many years ago. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>1405</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As has been said by the previous speakers, this was a Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into two matters of great importance in the world of business. It was initiated by Senator Murray who, to me at least, seems to have a great natural understanding of the world of business. It is important that we in the Senate do have that understanding available to us because business is the driving heart of the economy. It is because of that, because we as a community depend so much on how business acts, that this is so important and it is why Senator Murray initiated this inquiry, which was well chaired by Senator McKiernan, and the things that Senator Murray said about him I say again. </para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Barney should have been the chair.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>SF4</name.id><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name></talker><para>—Senator Abetz, you have been on this committee, as indeed has every senator in this chamber, excepting you, Mr Acting Deputy President Chapman. Nor has Senator Ferris but I have served with her on other committees and she is outstanding. In any event, how to get fair competition in the business world is an important issue. As section 46 stands now, it is not working as well as it might, even under the considerable skills of Professor Fels, and I think he has been outstanding in the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission. He has been outstanding as the person who does most of the planning and who runs that very important commission so well. I hope he continues for a good time into the future.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue, as has been described, is whether in talking about whether competition has been fair we ought to look at the intention of a particular company that has pursued a course of conduct. That raises the question whether or not it has been acting fairly and whether we should test that in terms of the intent of the company or whether we should look at it in terms of the effect. Sir Daryl Dawson, a very eminent jurist and a former member of the High Court, is going to conduct an inquiry into this issue and people have already spoken of wanting to wait to see what happens in that area before a final commitment is given here. In the meantime it would seem more logical, if you are looking at whether the marketplace is operating as is best for competition, that the test you should take is the effects test because it does not depend on the intent as to whether competition is good but on the effect of the company's conduct as to whether the competition is free and flowing as we want it. I just make that as a preliminary point. </para><para>On the other question of whether we should be able to divest a company of part of its operations, that matter will be looked at, but it seems to be highly dramatic surgery indeed. It will be interesting to see what finally happens there. I congratulate the committee. It has been absolutely dedicated to the proper attention of how the law operates and Senator McKiernan needs credit for that.

Labor Government members would regularly involve themselves in the authorisation process. In 1997, the Howard Government replaced this system of appointment with one based on regional or special community need. </para><para>However, the current system remains far from perfect. Authorisation based on regional or special need excludes many people who would make excellent celebrants from entering the profession. </para><para>The over-arching catalyst for reforming the program is to ensure that couples intending to marry have wide access to thoroughly professional marriage celebrants. </para><para>This is the philosophy and intent behind the review process. It is a philosophy the Government shares with the celebrant community.</para><para>The bill has two major focuses.</para><para>The first and most significant, is to improve the Marriage Celebrants Program through a range of reforms designed primarily to raise the level of professional standards required of celebrants and to capitalise on the unique position of celebrants in the community to encourage and promote pre-marriage and other relationship education services. </para><para>These reforms will be given effect by the provisions contained in Schedule 1 of the bill and by regulations to be made under the Marriage Act. </para><para>The second focus is given effect by amendments in Schedule 2 of the bill, which will provide for a series of technical amendments to the Marriage Act. These changes are primarily in relation to the Notice of Intended Marriage; the introduction of passports as an acceptable means of identification for overseas couples; guidelines concerning the shortening of time between the lodgement of a Notice of Intended Marriage and when a couple can marry; and the removal of redundant provisions in the Act. </para><para>The development of the reform package for the Marriage Celebrants Program which has culminated in the introduction of this bill has been a long and at times difficult process. Throughout this process the celebrant community has remained engaged and, in the main, very constructive in its approach to what the Government had in mind. The celebrant community has recognised the need for change and has responded appropriately. </para><para>There were doubts expressed when the Attorney-General released the Proposals Paper in November of 2000 that the Government would pay sufficient attention to the concerns of celebrants. This bill demonstrates that the Government has listened and acted upon the concerns expressed by celebrants. This is evident in the changes made to the package of reforms. These include the maintenance of lifetime appointments, the removal of the requirement for existing celebrants to satisfy the new core competencies, the introduction of a five year transitional period for the phasing in of the new appointments system and the removal of the proposal for a fee to be paid in order to be authorised as a marriage celebrant.</para><para>By the year 2010, if present trends continue, some 60% of weddings will be performed by civil celebrants under this reformed program. It is also expected that the number of smaller religious groups seeking their own religious expression will continue to increase. Reform of the program to satisfy the community of the quality and integrity of the program into the future is critical.</para><para>I believe that this package of amendments will be fundamental to ensuring this outcome but it will only be with the assistance and co-operation of celebrants that the outcome can be assured.</para><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator

in Statutory Rules 2001 No. 248 and made under the <inline font-style="italic">Commonwealth Electoral Act 1918</inline>, be disallowed.</para></motion><para>These regulations are at the core of the government's expensive, bureaucratic and disenfranchising electoral enrolment witnessing regime and, accordingly, the opposition is moving to disallow them. The regulations are misguided and they are not needed. The Auditor-General has recently examined the integrity of the electoral roll. His report was released on 18 April this year. Mr Barrett found that the electoral roll is not abuser-friendly; it is more than 96 per cent accurate and is of `high integrity'. Further, he found:</para><quote><para> ... that internal AEC procedures to ensure roll security and to prevent tampering with roll data were robust and effective.</para></quote><para>Australians are among the most mobile people in the world, with a high level of internal migration which translates into high levels of enrolment change. Given the normal delays in updating enrolments, a roll that is over 96 per cent accurate at any one time is a significant achievement. The Australian National Audit Office further data-matched the electoral roll to Medicare's residence records and found a more than 99 per cent match. The Electoral Commissioner, Mr Andy Becker, said in a press release on 19 April:</para><quote><para>The report states emphatically that the electoral roll can be relied on for electoral purposes, which I believe confirms the AEC's and community's longstanding view on the reliability of the roll.</para></quote><para>So why does Senator Abetz—after the electoral roll has received the tick of approval from no less than the Commonwealth Auditor-General—want to continue to mess around with enrolment forms? The new regime is intended to apply to all new enrolments and transfers of enrolment. It is a very big change to the enrolment system and will affect over three million people a year. An applicant for enrolment or transfer of enrolment will have to find a witness from a certain class of people, with the classes described by their employment. New enrolments will also have to show the witness a prescribed original form of ID.</para><para>To make such a change, one would think that the government would be reasonably sure that its new system would actually stop enrolment fraud and that people would not be disenfranchised. Unfortunately, the fact is that the government has ignored advice from experts that its proposed system will not stop fraud. Alarmingly, the government appears to have also ignored advice as to the disenfranchising effect of its proposed electoral enrolment scheme.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Why do you protect rorters?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—The opposition strongly believes that the integrity of electoral enrolment can only be assured if all Australians can easily get onto the roll, if the roll is secure and if electoral fraud is deterred. These matters are equally important: enrolment has to be fair and the electoral roll has to be safe.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The opposition, of course, is moving to disallow the Electoral and Referendum Amendment Regulations for one principal reason: these regulations will not improve the integrity of the roll. In fact, they are going to have the opposite effect. They will not stop fraudulent enrolment but they will stop honest enrolment. Senator Abetz put out a statement a few weeks ago—it sank without trace of course—in which he said that this disallowance motion was being run on budget day because Labor was trying to hide from its past. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>N26</name.id><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name></talker><para>—Exactly right.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—Senator Abetz, when the Senate only has 21 sitting days in the space of nine months—in the face of chronic chamber mismanagement from you and your colleagues—it is amazing that we get any chance at all, frankly, to debate a disallowance motion.

Premier Beattie did an excellent job in that and it was one reason why he was absolutely overwhelmingly re-elected last year. The fact is that Senator Abetz's regulations would not prevent the Ehrmann affair from happening again. The AEC says so. In fact, what Senator Abetz proposes will create a whole new set of problems—quite deliberate on his part. The government has trumpeted the regulations as a major weapon against enrolment fraud. The government says that requiring a person enrolling to show their ID to a witness is so logical and so simple that it is just unarguable. There are three very big holes right in the middle of this government's logic. Firstly, the AEC has no way of checking that a witness falls into the prescribed classes of witnesses. The classes of witnesses are defined by their employment and the AEC does not have a database of employment. I asked the AEC to advise on that very point, and I would like to indicate what the response of the AEC was. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Debate interrupted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.00 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUDGET</title><type>Budget</type><page.no>1410</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Statement and Documents</title><page.no>1410</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>1410</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table the documents on the list circulated in the chamber:</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Budget Documents—</inline></para><para>No. 1—Budget Strategy and Outlook 2002-03.</para><para>No. 2—Budget Measures 2002-03.</para><para>No. 3—Federal Financial Relations 2002-03.</para><para>No. 4—Agency Resourcing 2002-03.</para><para>No. 5—Intergenerational report 2002-03.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Ministerial statements—</inline></para><para>Australia's overseas aid program 2002-03— Statement by the Minister for Foreign Affairs (Mr Downer), dated 14 May 2002.</para><para>Putting Australia's interests first: Honouring our commitments—Statement by the Treasurer (Mr Costello), dated 14 May 2002.</para><para>Indigenous affairs 2002-03—Statement by the Minister for Immigration and Multicultural and Indigenous Affairs (Mr Ruddock), dated 14 May 2002.</para><para>Regional Australia: A partnership for stronger regions 2002-03—Statement by the Minister for Transport and Regional Services (Mr Anderson) and the Minister for Regional Services, Territories and Local Government (Mr Tuckey), dated 14 May 2002.</para><para>Towards a sustainable Australia: Commonwealth environment expenditure 2002-03—Statement by the Minister for the Environment and Heritage (Dr Kemp), dated 14 May 2002.</para><para>Women's budget statement 2002-03—Statement by the Minister for Family and Community Services (Senator Vanstone), dated 14 May 2002.</para><para>Growing stronger: Agriculture, fisheries and forestry 2002-03—Statement by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry (Mr Truss), dated 14 May 2002.</para><para>I seek leave to make a statement relating to the 2002-03 budget.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name></talker><para>—Tonight the Treasurer is delivering in another place his Budget Speech for 2002-03.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Madam President, the past year has again reminded us all that world events can move dangerously and unpredictably.</para><para>Last year when the Treasurer delivered the Budget we did not know that four months later our world would change in such a devastating way. </para><para>The terrorist attacks of 11 September shocked us all and showed that terrorism can strike even the most powerful of nations.

Our trading partners—Japan, the United States and Europe— all turned down. Australia found itself in a very difficult economic environment. </para><para>We were not untouched by the global slowdown. But tonight the Treasurer can report to the House that Australia is strong. Other countries went into recession but our economy grew.</para><para>The hard work of the last six years helped to shield our country and keep people in work. It gave us the capacity to respond swiftly with measures to stimulate the economy like the additional First Home Owners Grant. It allowed us to respond swiftly with a major contribution to the War Against Terrorism.</para><para>But we must continue strong economic policy if we want to be able to respond to the unpredictable events of the future. Strong economic policy has been the hallmark of this government. By the end of this coming financial year we will have paid off $61 billion of the Labor Government's debt. Our Budget for the year is in surplus, a surplus of $2.1 billion. </para><para>The Budget will lay out a programme, not always easy, but fair, to sustain important health and welfare services into the future.</para><para>And this year we will fund measures to upgrade security, to secure our borders, to strengthen our defence forces and deliver all of the Government's election commitments in full, on time, on budget.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Strong defence</inline></para><para>Madam President, last year the Treasurer announced the largest and most comprehensive upgrade of our defence capabilities for any Australian government in over 25 years. Under that plan set out in a White Paper an additional $1 billion is included in the 2002-03 defence Budget. But, the Government has added to that programme to fund the deployment of Australian troops in the War Against Terrorism.</para><para>The deployments are being carried out as part of our contributions to the US-led operation against international terrorism and the Gulf blockade in support of United Nations sanctions against Iraq. They involve around 1,100 Australian Defence Force personnel and comprise land, sea and air operations. The initial deployment includes:</para><para>·	an Australian special forces task group and other personnel participating in operations in Afghanistan against the Taliban and Al Qaida networks;</para><para>·	a naval task group of an amphibious landing ship (until mid 2002) and a frigate, and the continued presence of a guided missile frigate in the Persian Gulf to support the Multinational Maritime Interception Force; and</para><para>·	an Air Force deployment of B707 tanker aircraft to support air-to-air refuelling operations and F/A-18 aircraft deployed to Diego Garcia until mid 2002 to support air defence of coalition forces.</para><para>The composition of the deployment is subject to strategic requirements and is continuously under review.</para><para>The additional funding over the base funding and over the White Paper for this deployment in 2001-02 and 2002-03 is around $524 million.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Upgrading domestic security </inline></para><para>But as we have seen terror and crime can also strike at home. The Government's first responsibility is to defend our citizens and our national security assets. We must do it in a careful way hoping for the best, but preparing against the worst. In this Budget we are allocating an additional $1.3 billion over five years to upgrade security within Australia. </para><para>Australia's airport security will be upgraded. Armed, plain clothed, Australian Protective Service officers now travel on selected flights. Additional Australian Protective Service officers provide heightened security at Australia's airports with enhanced capacity for detecting explosives.</para><para>The Budget provides an additional $539 million to the Australian Federal Police, Australian Protective Service and Australian intelligence agencies to assist in identifying potential security threats. There will be increased screening of imported goods, enhanced cooperation with overseas law enforcement agencies, and improvements in screening arriving and departing international passengers.</para><para>The Government is also investing in the development of leading edge technology that has the potential to significantly improve passport verification processes. If successfully developed, a biometric identifier could record individual features on a magnetic strip on passports and provide distinctive matching for that individual at airports and other points of entry. This will be funded by an increase in the Passport Fee.</para><para>The Government will be improving the secure communications system of the Department of Defence and taking measures to protect our critical information infrastructure from attack.</para><para>The Government will double the Australian Federal Police strike team capability, allowing for the rapid deployment of more than 200 federal agents around Australia dealing with crimes such as terrorism and politically motivated violence.</para><para>We will establish a permanent Australian Defence Force Tactical Assault Group on the east coast of Australia, to supplement the existing group on the west coast. The Tactical Assault Group is a special forces unit with specialist counter-terrorist training, including hostage recovery.</para><para>And we will establish within the Australian Defence Force a permanent Incident Response Regiment. This will be a highly trained group able to respond to chemical, biological, radiological, nuclear and explosive incidents. To support our capacity to respond to such an incident—one we hope will never occur—the Government has also authorised a national stockpile of chemical antidotes and vaccines.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Securing Australia's borders</inline></para><para>Madame President, Australia operates a substantial immigration programme which in the coming year will offer permanent migration places at a base level of 105,000 places. In addition we offer around 12,000 places under the humanitarian category for refugees. This is one of the largest offshore humanitarian programmes of any country in the world.</para><para>But to maintain the integrity of that programme humanitarian places should be reserved for those assessed as genuine refugees and those that have complied with Australia's offshore processing arrangements. The Government does not intend to allow people smugglers to determine the intake under this programme. </para><para>Last Budget we proposed spending $1,635 million over five years on border security. The measures we have taken since, together with the measures the Treasurer is announcing tonight, will increase that expenditure to $2,872 million.</para><para>This will include $219 million to construct and maintain a purpose built Reception and Processing Centre on Christmas Island which will allow downsizing of other centres at Curtin and Woomera. The Government has allowed $455 million over the next four years for receiving and processing asylum seekers at the new facility on Christmas Island and, if necessary Cocos Island.</para><para>Madame President, the Government has decided to double National Marine Unit surveillance, it has increased Coast Watch surveillance, and it has allocated additional funding to the Australian Defence Force to patrol Australia's northern waters to deter unauthorised boat arrivals.</para><para>Madame President, it is also important to take steps to reduce the flow of unauthorised immigrants to these Australian waters. To this end, the Government has committed $75 million to fighting people smuggling and unauthorised migration through the interception of unauthorised migrants in transit countries. </para><para>·	The Government is increasing the capacity of authorities and international organisations in transit countries to detect and intercept illegal people movement.</para><para>·	The Government is also increasing support to international organisations, such as the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the International Organisation for Migration, for the detention, processing and subsequent removal of people in transit countries.</para><para>There is evidence that these comprehensive measures are showing results.</para><para>In August last year arrival numbers surged, with some 1,212 arriving in the first three weeks alone.</para><para>Since the introduction of the Government's strategy to secure our borders, there has been a dramatic slowdown in unauthorised arrivals. There have been no unauthorised boat arrivals to Australia since December 2001.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Intergenerational report</inline></para><para>Madame President, tonight, as part of the Budget, the Treasurer is releasing the landmark Intergenerational Report.

What challenges will our children and their children have to confront in forty years time? What shape will Australia's finances be in 2042 based on current policies? And what should we do now to prepare for the generations ahead?</para><para>One of the big changes to our society will be that the number of older people will increase, and with falling birthrates, the number of younger ones will not grow. The ratio of old to young in our society will increase.</para><para>The increase in medical science will make more and more treatments available and prolong our capacity to live longer.</para><para>Our strong Budget position means we are better placed than most other advanced societies to cope with these changes. But we must start now to put in place measures which will sustain a decent health system and aged care system into the future. If we ignore moderate changes now the challenges will only get greater, the decisions will get harder, and the solutions will slip outside our grasp.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Making the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme more sustainable</inline></para><para>The cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme is growing rapidly as medical science improves and we have a greater ability to treat more conditions. Since 1991 the cost of the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme has nearly quadrupled from $1.2 billion to $4.2 billion. The Intergenerational Report projects that the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme could be the most significant area of pressure in the health budget and in forty years time grow to around $60 billion in today's dollars.</para><para>So the Government is taking some small steps to help put the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme on a more sustainable basis so it can deliver access to medicines at affordable prices over the longer term. These measures will ensure that consumers, industry, doctors and pharmacists all contribute to containing the rate of increase in the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>From 1 August this year, co-payments for concession cardholders such as pensioners and Seniors Health cardholders will rise by $1 to $4.60 and co-payments for others will rise by $6.20 to $28.60 per prescription. While a concession cardholder will only pay $4.60 for a prescription this is only a small part of the cost of many Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines.</para><para>·	Humulin NPH, widely used in the treatment of insulin dependent diabetes costs $229.13 per prescription.</para><para>·	Avonex, a drug used for the treatment of multiple sclerosis costs $1,090.81 per prescription. A patient on this drug would normally take 13 prescriptions per year.</para><para>·	Zyban, used for the treatment of nicotine addiction, costs $238.85 per prescription. </para><para>New drugs with high costs are coming on to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme all the time.  </para><para>Notwithstanding the cost of the prescription the co-payment will only be $4.60 for concession cardholders.</para><para>Safety net arrangements will continue to protect people who need a large number of medicines. Consistent with the current arrangements, once concession cardholders have paid for 52 Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme prescriptions in the year, they will receive further Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines free for the rest of the year. Non concession cardholders who pay $874.90 in a year for their Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines will be eligible for further PBS medicines at the concessional rate for the rest of the year.</para><para>The Government is also introducing changes to ensure Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme medicines are used appropriately.</para><para>·	Doctors will be required to provide additional information about patient eligibility when they seek approval to prescribe particular drugs.</para><para>·	The pharmaceutical industry will provide information about prescribing restrictions directly to doctors through the network of medical representatives employed by the industry.</para><para>·	The Government will undertake discussions with individual manufacturers of generic medicines to secure a price reduction for products they have listed on the PBS. This price reduction will be in return for the Government facilitating greater use of generic medicines listed on the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme.</para><para>·	The Government will also introduce further initiatives to identify and target fraud in the PBS system.</para><para>By making the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme more sustainable, the Government can continue to fund the listing of new, highly effective, but expensive medicines.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Assisting job seekers</inline></para><para>Madam President, the Government has a policy of equipping our young in the best possible way for the workforce. That is why we invested in improving literacy and numeracy in the education system. That is why we revived the apprenticeship system. And in this Budget we will focus that further with an extra incentive of $750 to employers willing to take on a new apprentice while he or she is still at school, and a bonus of $750 to keep them after they have completed Year 12.</para><para>We will offer an incentive of $1,100 to employers to take on a new apprentice in information technology. For mature age people we will offer training assistance of up to $500 to attain basic skills in computers and information technology. One of the great barriers for mature age workers getting into the workforce is lack of computer skills. This training will be available to 11,500 people each year.</para><para>Our policy is to encourage people to get job ready so that as the growing economy creates more jobs, they have the chance to get those jobs and move into the mainstream of the Australian workforce.</para><para>The Government's Work for the Dole Scheme has been a very successful programme to develop work skills. At a cost of $81.5 million over three years we will fund 8,500 additional Work for the Dole places.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Next steps in welfare reform</inline></para><para>Madam President, in last year's Budget the Treasurer announced a major programme to reform our welfare system called Australians Working Together.</para><para>We want to take the next steps in this programme. There are many people who are out of work and on a Disability Support Pension who have no support or encouragement to get back into employment. Since 1990, the number on Disability Support Pensions has doubled.</para><para>We want to take measures to encourage those who are capable of work, including part time work of more than 15 hours a week, to get back into the workforce. This will improve their esteem and self-reliance. At present eligibility for Disability Support Pension is assessed as the incapacity to work 30 hours per week. This will be reduced to 15 hours. Disability Support Pension rates and the means test are unchanged. </para><para>To provide people with greater opportunity to improve their work capacity 73,000 new training and work programme places will be created for those who are currently on Disability Support Pensions. This will cost additional money, but in giving people access to these services it is expected more people will re-enter the workforce and in the longer term it will save the taxpayer. </para><para>This new measure will apply to all new Disability Support Pension applicants from 1 July 2003. Those currently on Disability Support Pension (except those severely disabled with no work capacity or those who are within five years of Age Pension age) will be assessed under the new criteria within five years of implementation.</para><para>The Government will continue its commitment to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged citizens in our society. A new five year Commonwealth State Disability Agreement is proposed with the Commonwealth providing the States an extra $547.5 million over five years for unmet need. This Agreement funds the States and Territories to deliver Specialist disability services such as accommodation, community support and respite. This means the Commonwealth will allocate $2.7 billion to the new Agreement—$743 million more than the previous Agreement.</para><para>For their part, the States and Territories must at least match the Commonwealth's increase, including increases already announced in our disability employment services. They must also provide better accountability, quality, efficiency and effectiveness in the delivery of their services. Over the same five year period the Commonwealth intends to spend another $2 billion in support of its responsibilities for employment support for people with disabilities.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Supporting Australian families</inline></para><para>When Labor left office the home mortgage interest rate was 10½ per cent. Today it is 4¼ percentage points lower. Low interest rates have supported Australian families giving them reductions on their mortgage repayments and helping them to make ends meet. </para><para>The First Home Owners Scheme has helped many young Australians to buy their first home. This grant which continues at $7,000 from 1 July will help thousands of young Australians buy a house for the first time. These grants are expected to total $784 million in 2002-03.</para><para>And the Government is going to introduce new measures to help those starting a family. This is in addition to the higher payments of Family Tax Benefits which were introduced back in July 2000.</para><para>One of the financial pressures facing those who are starting a family is that they generally lose their second income as the mother goes out of the workforce to have the child. Our baby bonus is going to allow mothers who are out of the workforce with their first child to claim back tax they paid while they were in the workforce. The amount they can claim is up to $2,500 per year for five years depending on the amount of tax they have paid before leaving the workforce. There is a minimum payment of $500 per year for five years for low income parents.</para><para>It is expected that around 245,000 families will benefit from this initiative in the first year with 600,000 Australian families eventually benefiting.</para><para>Madam President, we also know that access to health services is a major concern for families—particularly the families in the outer suburbs of our major cities.</para><para>That is why the Government has a plan to encourage an additional 150 doctors to work in the outer-metropolitan areas of the six State capital cities. Under this plan, doctors who agree to work in a designated outer-metropolitan area and register on an alternative pathway to achieve vocational registration will be eligible for higher Medicare rebates. Specialist trainees will be able to access Medicare provider numbers if they work in outer-metropolitan areas. In addition, doctors in the `general stream' of the GP vocational training programme will undertake a supervised placement in an outer-metropolitan area. This is an $80 million plan for more doctors for the families of the outer suburbs of our major cities.</para><para>And we want to make our public places safer for our children. So the Government will fund a strategy for the introduction of retractable needle and syringe technology into Australia. This means that exposed needles cannot be left lying around in public places or anywhere else where children are at risk from needle stick injuries. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Health care in the regions</inline></para><para>In the Budget two years ago the Treasurer announced a Regional Health Package designed to make a practical difference in improving health services to the regions and the bush. This year we want to add some additional practical, on the ground, services in regional Australia.</para><para>We want to build six new facilities, outside the capital cities, to improve patient access to radiation oncology services. A programme of $72.7 million over four years to do this will include training staff to international best practice to operate these local services.</para><para>Another of the services that needs improvement in rural areas is the provision for aged care. Older Australians do not want to move away from their local communities in their twilight years. This Budget has a programme to upgrade or replace high care homes in rural, remote and urban fringe areas and also includes funding to encourage more people to take up aged care nursing with 250 aged care nursing scholarships at rural and regional university campuses.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Better care for older Australians</inline></para><para>Our Intergenerational Report shows that aged care will require increasing attention as the proportion of older people in the community increases. Again this year there are new measures—$654 million over four years—to provide better care for older Australians.</para><para>·	Subsidies for residential aged care will be increased to allow better pay rates to be offered to aged care nurses so providers can attract and retain more aged care nurses.</para><para>The Government's aged care policy is, whenever possible, to improve and expand community care services to enable older Australians to choose to stay at home and live as independently as possible in the community.</para><para>·	The Government will provide an additional 6,000 Community Aged Care Packages over four years. These packages are tailored to meet the needs of frail older Australians who want to remain in their own homes, and can do so if they receive home help, laundry, meals and bathing.</para><para>·	The Government will also provide funding to support the carers of older Australians, carers of people with dementia, and ageing carers of people with disabilities.</para><para>This Budget will also aim to improve the standard of palliative care offered in the community. Funding of $55 million over four years will be provided for better coordination between hospital and community care; improved education and further support for general practitioners and other health professionals in palliative care; and further assistance for families of people who choose to spend their final years in their home setting.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Veterans</inline></para><para>Madame President, over the years this Government has taken major decisions to recognise the contribution made by our veterans. Tonight, we want to go further. The Government is extending eligibility for the war veterans' Gold Card (which provides comprehensive free health care) to Australian veterans aged 70 years and over who have qualifying service from post World War II conflicts.</para><para>In this Budget we are introducing twice-yearly indexation of the ceiling rate of the Income Support Supplement for War Widows. The ceiling rate will be increased by the same percentage as the age or service pension. This increase in income support for our war widows is expected to cost $85 million over four years. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sustainable revenues</inline></para><para>The Budget surplus announced tonight has not required any major new tax initiatives nor an increase in the overall tax burden. The Government's tax reforms have secured the tax base, proving one of the keys to the strengthening of Australia's economic foundations. </para><para>The Government remains committed to its tax reform strategies and will press ahead with the business tax reform agenda, including a review of international tax arrangements.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Economic outlook</inline></para><para>The Australian economy is expected to continue its strong performance in the year ahead, with robust economic growth of around 3¾ per cent forecast for 2002-03. This is higher than forecast growth for any of the major developed (G7) economies of the world and reflects Australia's sound economic fundamentals.</para><para>Business investment is expected to grow very strongly in 2002-03, to be a key driver of overall economic growth. Household consumption is also expected to remain strong.</para><para>In line with the outlook for robust economic growth, the unemployment rate is forecast to decline gradually to 6 per cent in the June quarter of 2003. An unemployment rate below 6 per cent would be achievable over the next couple of years, provided that economic growth remains strong and progress is maintained on labour market and welfare reforms. Since the Government came to office over 900,000 jobs have been created in the Australian economy. We expect over one million jobs to have been created by Christmas.</para><para>With only moderate increases in wage costs and continued strong productivity growth, inflation is expected to be around 2¾ per cent in 2002-03 and 2½ per cent by the June quarter 2003, within the medium-term inflation target band. Largely reflecting the strength of the domestic economy, the current account deficit is expected to increase slightly to around 4 per cent of GDP, which is below the average over the 1990s.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Concluding comments</inline></para><para>Madame President, the last year has been difficult in an uncertain world, with a global economic downturn. But Australia has emerged much stronger than comparable countries.</para><para>This Budget is designed to meet the continuing challenges of today, and to project forward so we can set ourselves a path that will address the challenges of the future.</para><para>This is a Budget to keep Australia safe, our borders secure, and to keep our economy strong.</para><para>I seek leave to make a statement relating to the 2000-01 budget.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the statement and documents.</para></motion><para>Debate (on motion by <inline font-weight="bold">Senator Faulkner</inline>) adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Proposed Expenditure</title><page.no>1417</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration by Legislation Committees</title><page.no>1417</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>1417</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table the following documents:</para></talk.start><para>Particulars of proposed expenditure for the service of the year ending on 30 June 2003 [Appropriation Bill (No. 1) 2002-2003]</para><para>Particulars of certain proposed expenditure in respect of the year ending on 30 June 2003 [Appropriation Bill (No. 2) 2002-2003]</para><para>Particulars of proposed expenditure in relation to the parliamentary departments in respect of the year ending on 30 June 2003 [Appropriation (Parliamentary Departments) Bill (No. 1) 2002-2003].</para><para>I seek leave to move a motion to refer the particulars documents to legislation committees.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>JX4</name.id><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><para>That:</para><para>(1)	the particulars documents be referred to legislation committees for examination and report in accordance with the provisions of the order of the Senate of 13 February 2002 relating to estimates hearings; and</para><para>(2)	legislation committees consider the proposed expenditure in accordance with the allocation of departments to committees agreed to on 11 November 1998, as varied on 13 February 2002.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Portfolio Budget Statements</title><page.no>1418</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I table the portfolio budget statements for 2002-03 for the following parliamentary departments:</para></talk.start><para>Senate</para><para>Joint House</para><para>Parliamentary Library</para><para>Parliamentary Reporting Staff.</para></interjection></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Portfolio Additional Estimates Statements</title><page.no>1418</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>1418</page.no><name role="metadata">Minchin, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator MINCHIN</name><name.id>JX4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Finance and Administration</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I table the portfolio additional estimates statements 2001-02 for portfolios and executive departments in accordance with the list circulated in the chamber.

But, before I do, I want to take this opportunity to pay my respects and express my condolence to the family of Ruth Cracknell, a great Australian who unfortunately passed away last night. I do not think there would be anyone on any side of politics in this chamber who would not want, at an appropriate stage over the next few days, to pay tribute to this great Australian. She was not only an outstanding actress but also an outstanding contributor to Australian society over her long distinguished life in Australian acting. Without being too provocative, I have to say that, though the Senate today paid a tribute to the passing of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, I believe that Ruth Cracknell's contribution to Australian society far outweighed the contribution by the Queen Mother, who was a citizen of another country.</para></talk.start><para>I now turn to the National Gallery issue. From November 1997, Senator Kate Lundy and I, in the Senate estimates committee, had raised issues about the administration of the art gallery. Those issues dealt particularly with the operation of the airconditioning system and the complaints made by staff. It was a tedious and, at times—even for me— boring process, but it seemed to me, from the information I had received from a number of former employees of the gallery, that they had a substantial case to put to the gallery that was not being answered through the normal procedures. I am reminded, seeing Senator Boswell here, of the attitude he and I took when dealing with the COT cases of Telstra, and I took a similar one here. There seemed to be a case that only the estimates committee could raise and force some answers.</para><para>Through all of this, I placed many questions on notice. I spent hours questioning Mr Kennedy and other senior staff. At times I got answers I was not satisfied with and at times the written answers were not satisfactory, but I kept pushing on. I have to pay tribute here to former employees Brian Cropp and Bruce Ford, who quite openly provided me with information and background on many of the questions I asked.</para><para>Earlier this year, on 20 April, an article written by Alan Ramsey appeared in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>. His Saturday column went on at great length about how I had been obsessed and unfair in questioning Mr Kennedy and asked what I was doing. He said that I had the temerity to call Dr Kennedy `Mr Kennedy', that I had made snide remarks and generally had not performed well at the estimates committee. He did have the courtesy to ring me before he published the story. I did point out to him, because he was unaware of it, that only a month earlier Comcare Australia, in an investigation into the sacking of Brian Cropp, found that the National Gallery of Australia had contravened section 76 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991 and recommended that procedures change in the gallery so that what happened to Mr Cropp would not happen to any other employee who had the temerity to question process and management issues to do with the health and safety of not only the staff but also the many visitors who go to our pre-eminent gallery. Mr Ramsey in his article made no mention of the fact that the Comcare investigator had found that the gallery had breached the act in the way it had forced Mr Cropp out of his job. </para><para>I take this opportunity of the adjournment debate—the first opportunity since the article appeared—to put the record straight. I certainly will be asking further questions of the gallery at estimates in June about what they are doing to compensate Mr Cropp for being dismissed and forced out of an occupation at the gallery. For the record, I will read a section of the report. I will also seek leave at the end of my remarks to table this report, and I have checked with the various whips and they will give me leave to do so. The conclusion of the report into Mr Cropp's dismissal by the independent investigator appointed by Comcare reads:</para><quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>All the evidence suggests that Mr Cropp would have been able to perform the duties of the fittest position as it related to the HDAC—</para></quote><para>that is, the airconditioning system—</para><quote><para>in a technically competent manner. The question then arises: is Mr Cropp being excluded from the position because he complained about the safety of the systems or because his conduct suggested that he may not carry out his duties objectively? Given the evidence on the other matters above, it is difficult to conclude that only Mr Cropp's objectivity was in issue.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Overall conclusions</inline></para><para>As indicated above, in my view, the onus falls on the NGA to show that the reason Mr Cropp was unsuccessful for the position was not for the reason that he complained about the health, safety or welfare of employees at work. I do not consider that that onus has been discharged.</para></quote><para>The report, and I will not read it all, concludes:</para><quote><para>I conclude—</para></quote><para>that is, the investigator—</para><motion><para>that the NGA has contravened section 76 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991 by prejudicially altering Mr Cropp's position as an NGA employee by not appointing him as the recommended applicant to the permanent position with the NGA because he had complained about a matter concerning the health, safety and welfare of employees at work, namely the state of the NGA's heating, ventilation and airconditioning systems. The NGA, of course, is not subject to prosecution or penalty under the provisions of section 76 of the act.</para></motion><para>There are then a number of recommendations made in the report to ensure that the NGA does not again act pre-emptively against Mr Cropp's activities. </para><para>Mr Cropp is in the best traditions of a whistleblower. He was concerned about the safety and health of the employees and he was concerned about the safety and health of all the people who visit the gallery, and because of that they forced him out of the job. It is now up to the National Gallery of Australia to invite Mr Cropp back to the job he applied for or, if that is not available, to offer some other suitable recompense to Mr Cropp for the loss of his job and the indignity that he has suffered. I only hope that Mr Ramsey has the courtesy to report again, now that I am tabling these reports on Mr Cropp's dismissal. </para><para>I also want to mention that a further Comcare report, from the end of last year, found:</para><quote><para>The National Gallery of Australia had breached section 16 of the Occupational Health and Safety (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1991 by failing to take all reasonable practical steps to protect the health and safety at work of the employees.</para></quote><para>So there are two breaches by the National Gallery of Australia of a Commonwealth act. If ever there is evidence that justifies the questions Senator Lundy and I asked at estimates over 3½ years, Comcare has proven that we were right. Comcare has proven that the estimates committee is the last place left standing when all other measures have been exhausted and when individuals cannot get justice.</para><para>This is a great defence of the estimates committee. Whether we are in opposition or government, the operation of the Senate estimates committee may be, in my view, the greatest thing that justifies the existence of the Senate itself. And here again I am very proud of the fact that I kept asking the questions. Mr Ramsay failed to mention that in February this year I went to the Senate estimates on Comcare and put the pressure, I have to say, on the head of Comcare. He agreed that a further broader inquiry into the management of safety and health issues at the gallery would be conducted. That inquiry is now under way, I think conducted by Mr Wray. I look forward to that report becoming available. </para><para>Above all else, I call on the government to ask the gallery board and its director to take action to stop the mismanagement that has been going on that is affecting the reputation and standing of the pre-eminent art gallery of Australia. All of us who have asked questions at estimates have never questioned the artistic merit of the director or of the gallery board or its acquisitions policy. We have only questioned whether the management and the processes are fair to the employees and to the Australian people. I seek leave to table these two reports.</para><para>Leave granted. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><page.no>1420</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>1420</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The last six months has seen the worst upsurge in Middle East violence outside the declared of wars 1948, 1967 and 1973. The stream of Palestinian suicide bombers targeting Israeli citizens, the siege of the Bethlehem Church of the Nativity and the occupation by the Israeli army of key townships on the West Bank, along with the siege of Yasser Arafat in his headquarters at Ramallah, has yet again taken the area to new heights of terror and hatred.</para></talk.start><para>We could dismiss these events as just another chapter in the cycle of violence in the Middle East. However, on any analysis, the last wave of terror has been more profoundly murderous and sustained than at any other time. Moreover, we are all more directly related and involved in these events than at any known time in the past, for we now know that terrorism unchecked, particularly terrorism in the Middle East, involves the whole world. We learnt that lesson on September 11 when 55 Australians were killed by terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre in New York. In total, 60 countries lost lives in this barbarous and indiscriminate act. Today the continual Middle East showdowns, and with no lasting peace in sight, handicap America's and Australia's declared war on terror.</para><para>With yet another push for peace under way in the Middle East it may be believed that this time it will be different. As the world wants to win its war on terror, urgent peace will be demanded of the parties involved. But this is a delusion, a false hope, because if the latest events in the Middle East show us one thing it is that peace will never be achieved so long as Yasser Arafat is around. Yasser Arafat is a leader of a corrupt regime and is a terrorist himself. How can you ever negotiate with this man? He hates peace. As a result, the people of Israel live every second of their lives in fear, and his own Palestinian people live in poverty and under a dictatorial and corrupt administration. </para><para>In its most basic and fundamental form, the Middle East conflict can be put in this way: the Jewish leadership want peace and coexistence and will pay a price for it; the Palestinian leadership do not want peace at any price. I am convinced of this proposition after a long watch on this conflict. This belief was borne out when Yasser Arafat rejected a peace agreement in 2000 brokered by the United States and offered by former Israeli Prime Minister Barak. It would have given the Palestinian authority a state in a slightly enlarged Gaza Strip and 95 per cent of the West Bank as well as the Palestinian parts of Jerusalem, and the right of return to the Palestinian state of refugees. This deal was the absolute outer limits of what was possible. </para><para>This is just one of so many examples that show Yasser Arafat's rejection of peace over his reign of some 30 years. He has fooled, cajoled and manoeuvred world leaders to believe his good intent, right up to the delusion of the Oslo agreement, for which he, laughably, received a Nobel prize. This once heralded peace agreement is now assigned to the trashcan of history. As for the most recent comment of Yasser Arafat, taken from an interview from CNN this week, that he does accept a Jewish state of Israel, well, this should be taken with a grain of salt. In the words of one Israeli diplomat:</para><quote><para>What is it about a Jewish state that he doesn't understand? </para></quote><para>Meaning: why haven't his words ever been put into action before? Yasser Arafat has led us down this dead-end alley before. The truth is the Palestinian regime wants nothing less than the destruction of the state of Israel and the return of the whole of Jerusalem to Palestinian control. In private conversations with former Indonesian president Wahid, as distinct from his public rhetoric, Yasser Arafat has said:</para><quote><para>... even if it takes 150 years we will throw the Jews into the sea.</para></quote><para>What choice does Israel have but to respond and to use its obvious might to protect its land and its people, a people under relentless terrorist attacks by the Palestinians who themselves are supported by corrupt and extreme regimes in the Arab world. What other country would not respond the same as Israel? Australia would do the same. Look at how America responded to the September 11 attacks; it is the moral equivalent for Israel.</para><para>Equally, we have joined America in their fight against terrorism. Just as the Americans went into Afghanistan to root out the Al-Qaeda from their caves, so too was it necessary for the Israeli army to cross into the West Bank, into the towns and houses to destroy the cells of terrorism. If the Americans had not gone into Afghanistan, the Al-Qaeda would have found somewhere else to retreat to. If the Israelis had not gone into Jenin, for example, the Hamas terrorists and others would have found refuge somewhere else. Claims of a massacre occurring in the township of Jenin are typical of the chorus of rhetoric that is so often levelled at the Israelis' response to terrorism—not only from the Arab world but from so many in the international community. The operation undertaken by the Israelis in Jenin was paramount to routing the terrorist cells that threatened the Israeli citizens and the state's existence.</para><para>The evidence is undeniable. In Jenin and the surrounding villages, a Hamas network operated which was responsible for the perpetration of a number of lethal suicide attacks inside Israel. The most recent attack was in Haifa on 31 March 2002 in which 15 Israelis were killed. Until the Israeli defence force operations, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad infrastructure in Jenin was the strongest in the Palestinian territories, mostly due to the massive financial aid received from the Palestinian Islamic Jihad leadership in Syria. Given this, I believe there is no moral equivalent to the Palestinian response to Israel's attacks and Israel's response to the Palestinians' aggression and terrorism. Yet Israel has proven that it will cease using armed forces against Palestinian targets if the campaign of terrorism against their citizens and state stops. The opposite is not true.</para><para>History shows that throughout Yasser Arafat's reign, right up until today, peace between the Jews and Palestinians has always been within reach—a peace that gives the Palestinians a state, the West Bank clear of Jewish settlements and financial support for the Palestinian government and economy. But, if the Palestinian people want it, they have to really want it and it must come with the price of co-existence. What must be done can only now be done without Yasser Arafat. As long as Yasser Arafat and his terrorist regime remain, lasting peace will never be brokered to the detriment of the welfare of his own people, who slip and slide further into poverty while he reigns.</para><para>The real answer lies in a new generation of Palestinian moderate leaders who will accept the one basic tenet that will bring peace: that Israel has a right to exist and that terrorist groups like Hamas are purged. Therefore, I call upon the Australian government to recognise that the existing Palestinian regime can never be reformed and must be confronted. Our present policy of equal engagement in the Middle East should be replaced with a frank engagement with the Palestinian government. This means we can no longer support the legitimacy of the current unreformed Palestinian regime with its links to terrorism. It may be said that Australia has little influence in Middle East politics—but this is not true. We are a major player in the war against terrorism, we are a close ally of the United States and, equally, we can influence the international forums within our region. If we believe in a robust defence of, and existence for, the state of Israel, then a fundamental shift in policy is needed. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Family</title><page.no>1422</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>1422</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are others following me tonight, so perhaps I can come back later in the week, but I have one matter to raise which I noticed in the budget papers tonight under a heading `Intergenerational Report'. It says that one of the big changes in our society will be that the number of older people will increase—I am very aware of that, Madam President, but you can get old with grace— and that, with the falling birth rates, the ratio of old to young in our society will increase. My daughter, Megan Cooney, and my son-in-law, Joe Ragg, have recently done something about that problem. On 24 April this year they had a daughter, Emma. Senator Troeth will be very pleased with that. That was on the very day, 24 April, on which my wife and I celebrated our 40th wedding anniversary, a ruby anniversary. I bought her a ruby ring and she got me a lithograph by Sidney Nolan of <inline font-style="italic">Stringybark Creek</inline>, one of the Ned Kelly series. So it was a very happy occasion for us. My mother-in-law, who is now into her 90s, Lalla Gill, was celebrating her great-grandchild. It was a great occasion.

This matter now confronts this chamber in the form of a notice of motion calling for the establishment of a Senate committee into the Lindeberg grievance, which flows out of an extensive submission presented to the Senate by Mr Robert F. Greenwood QC shortly before he fell terminally ill.</para></talk.start><para>I want to return to the issues set out by Mr Greenwood QC because recent developments have made the establishment of this select committee a litmus test on the federal parliament in respect of its commitment to equal justice under the rule of law, the right to a fair trial, and the proper protection of children within Australian borders from physical and sexual abuse. It is also a litmus test for this chamber concerning the protection of its privileges and whether or not this chamber is quite happy to be deliberately misled by a state government and a law enforcement agency in respect of withholding vital evidence and telling untruths to a Senate committee in order to obstruct justice and act out of political expediency instead of public interest and truth. This committee if established also has the potential to be a litmus test for this chamber to see how far it will go to protect its privileges when a matter of contempt may give rise to a possible offence of obstructing justice or perverting the course of justice, going to the offence of covering up criminal paedophilia in a state-run institution and lesser forms of child abuse and denying a citizen their right to a fair trial.</para><para>Since I last spoke on this matter, several important matters have occurred which strengthen Mr Greenwood's submission and make it more imperative than ever for the Senate to establish this Senate select committee, if we take ourselves seriously and if we are here to serve the public interest and the truth and not just crude political interests. Since I read the Greenwood QC submission into the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> because ALP senators refused me leave to have it tabled, damning evidence pointed to by Mr Greenwood has come to light. It was first revealed in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> in November 2001 and appeared as recently as on 8 May 2002 on a web site coming out of the School of Journalism and Communication, University of Queensland. The address of that is http://www.sjc.uq.edu.au/about_journalism/staff/grundy.htm. Those interested senators should then go to `Shreddergate—Great Is Truth And Mighty Above All Things'. I invite honourable senators to listen very carefully. In particular I ask the women senators to listen carefully, especially those on the opposite benches because of their alleged concerns about child abuse and the welfare of our indigenous Australians. What investigative journalist Bruce Grundy discovered concealed behind the walls of this youth detention centre, and aided in its evil enterprise by the shredding of the Heiner inquiry documents by the Goss ALP cabinet, was the pack-rape of a 14-year-old Aboriginal female inmate by other male inmates during a supervised bush outing. According to the evidence, it was never properly investigated, despite being known to the inmates, and it was covered up. </para><para>When this matter flared up in the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline>, the Queensland Department of Families found a file on the matter and forwarded it to the CJC.  Despite its falling within the jurisdiction of the Queensland Crime Commission, on 16 November 2001 the CJC issued a media release stating there was no cover-up, because the matter was referred to the police and a paediatrician at the time. I advise honourable senators to note those last three words carefully. The CJC, Queensland's premier law enforcement agency, oversighting proper conduct in Queensland's public administration, said there was no cover-up or misconduct because the pack-rape was referred to the police and a paediatrician at the time. It said nothing about why the alleged rapists were not charged. It gave everybody a clearance. I ask honourable senators to remember that this is the same CJC which Messrs Greenwood QC and Lindeberg have said misled this chamber.</para><para>When you read the web site you will start to get the real story. It is a grubby, sordid story which has been covered up through systemic corruption for over a decade, save that the whistleblowing Mr Lindeberg has never given up and save that the journalist Bruce Grundy has been true to his profession and kept looking for the truth. We find that the doctor and the police were called in at the time—but three days and four days after the incident occurred, despite those in authority at the centre knowing the girl had been pack-raped within hours of it occurring. Everybody knows that when a rape occurs it is absolutely vital for body and clothing samples to be gathered and preserved swiftly. To suggest that over three and four days can elapse during which time the girl would have showered several times is an insult to anyone's intelligence—but not so to the CJC, it seems.</para><para>We find this little girl wanted the known alleged rapists charged for about the first two days but on the third day she changed her mind. Why? The record shows that she was threatened with violence by the inmates. She was not removed from the centre but had to suffer further indignity by being threatened by the inmates, possibly the same people associated with the incident. If that is not bad enough, when the police interviewed the girl on the fourth day, they managed to get her to sign a document saying she did not want anyone charged. This was a 14-year-old girl, a minor under the law, suffering from intimidation by thugs, and it was not her call. She was held in the care and custody of the Crown and she was fully entitled to be protected by the Crown's servants. No-one was held to account, not even the public servants who breached their duty of care. What were the public servants concerned about? According to the evidence, they were concerned it might hit the media. They were also concerned that she might fall pregnant, so they administered a double dose of a contraceptive pill.</para><para>According to the evidence gathered by Mr Grundy, this matter came before the Heiner inquiry. A witness to the inquiry has attested to this fact and that was one of the reasons why the Goss government shredded this damning evidence—so it could not be used against the carers or the staff of the centre. They were union mates. What an outrage. What about the girl's rights? What about the known relevance of the material to any legal action?</para><para>I now turn to another event in April 2002: the landmark McCabe v. British American Tobacco decision. This was handed down by His Honour Justice Eames. I appreciate it is to go to an appeal but the decision is wholly relevant to the Heiner affair. This chamber should know that Justice Eames found that the document retention policy adopted by BAT on alleged legal advice—namely, destroying records that it knew would be required in anticipated litigation from prospective litigants over the health effects of tobacco smoking—was a calculated act which prevented Mrs McCabe and others from getting a fair trial. The lawyers are now under investigation by their respective law societies because it appears that they may be in breach of their oath of office as officers of the court. </para><para>In the Heiner affair, the Goss cabinet absolutely knew that the Heiner inquiry documents were being sought by solicitors at the time of the court but yet had not served the writ so they shredded them to prevent their use in those proceedings. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order, Senator.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>8HC</name.id><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name></talker><para>—I seek leave to include the remainder of my speech in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard.</inline></para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave not granted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senator Cooney</title><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><title>Visit to Republic of Ireland</title><page.no>1424</page.no></subdebateinfo><title>Middle East: Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</title><title>Visit to Republic of Ireland</title><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>1424</page.no><name role="metadata">McKiernan, Sen Jim</name><name role="display">Senator McKIERNAN</name><name.id>1I4</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to make a couple of comments about previous speeches—although not the last one. I am not certain that we should be using this forum for the purposes it has just been used for. However, I am sure that all honourable senators will join me in congratulating Senator Cooney on the birth of his grandchild, Emma, some weeks ago and in congratulating him and his wife, Lillian, on their ruby wedding anniversary, which occurred on the same day as baby Emma was born. What a lovely coincidence. I am sure everyone joins us in wishing them a very long and happy life from here on.  </para></talk.start><para>I listened to Senator McGauran's contribution very carefully. I wish I knew as much about the Middle East as Senator McGauran seems to. If I did I would probably join him in some of his remarks of condemnation. I have been appalled by the acts of terrorism that have occurred in recent times in that part of the world and that have been reported in our media and on our television. But I am not so certain that I would join him in saying that terrorism occurs only on one side. If the events in Jenin refugee camp were as Senator McGauran described, I wonder why the state of Israel—the government of Israel—did not allow the observers in at an early time. If it was so clean, I suspect the Israeli government would have done. I hope that peace will come to that area soon, that it will be a long-lasting peace and that further acts of terrorism will not occur and will therefore not be reported in our media in Australia.</para><para>In recent times I represented the Australian parliament at a conference of the Interparliamentary Union in Marrakech in Morocco. I will speak on that at a later time, but while I was in that part of the world I took the opportunity to fulfil invitations that had been extended to me from the government of the Republic of Ireland and from certain individuals in Ireland. My wife, Jackie, and I went to Ireland at the conclusion of the conference in Marrakech. What happened to me during the few days I was in Dublin, in particular, and in my home town of Cavan really made me very humble. </para><para>I have in my time in this parliament represented the people of Western Australia, but I have not forgotten where I came from—not that I have been allowed to forget because people do remind me from time to time that I have an Irish accent despite the fact I left that country over 40 years ago. In fact, I have now been in this country of Australia for over 33 years. While I was there, certain individuals, whom I will name, took the opportunity to thank me for some modest efforts I have made over my time in the Australian parliament to build and cement relationships between the Republic of Ireland and the Commonwealth of Australia.</para><para> I was met by and spent quite an extended period of time with the Secretary-General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, Mr Dermot Gallagher, at their headquarters at Iveagh House in St Stephen's Green in Dublin. He gave me a very detailed briefing on what was occurring within the Republic of Ireland and within the parliamentary system, in particular in foreign affairs. He also took the opportunity to remind me of my efforts over quite a period of time to get the then Australian government to make a contribution to the International Fund for Ireland. We were successful in getting a modest contribution to that fund, and that fund did make a contribution towards the bringing about of a peaceful resolution to the conflict that was occurring on the border between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, and in other parts of the United Kingdom as well. I am very pleased to see that things are very peaceful over there at the moment and were at the time I was there. </para><para>Perhaps the highlight of my and my wife's visit to Ireland was the audience we had with President Mary McAleese at Aras an Uachtarain in Phoenix Park in Dublin. President McAleese spent nearly three-quarters of an hour with us and was very well briefed on some of the work I had been able to do on behalf of the two countries, as I said before. At the conclusion of our meeting she was not satisfied with just shaking my hand as we were leaving; she actually gave me a hug, and that is something I will remember very dearly for many years to come. It is a bit of a risk for people to do that with me, but it happened and I will treasure that memory for a long time to come. </para><para>The Deputy Secretary-General of the Department of Foreign Affairs, who will be the next Irish Ambassador to Australia, Mr Declan Kelly, hosted a lunch in my honour at, again, Iveagh House in St Stephen's Green. The lunch was also attended by a number of individuals whom I have had contact with over a period of time, including the Australian Ambassador to Ireland, Mr Bob Halverson, and his wife. That was another memory I will treasure for many years to come.</para><para>We then had a meeting with Minister Brian Cowen, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, who again thanked me and recognised some of the efforts I have put in over the years. I also met with the Cathaoirleach, the President of the Senate, Senator Brian Mullooly—your counterpart in Ireland, Madam President. The Comhairle, that is the Speaker of the Dail Eireann, Mr Seamus Pattison, hosted a private dinner in honour of my wife and me that evening. Our final meeting in Dublin was with the Taoiseach, Mr Bertie Ahearn, who kindly remembered that some 15 years ago, when he was a member of the first delegation of Irish parliamentarians to formally visit this country, I was the representative of the Australian parliament who met him in the early hours of the morning at Perth airport when they arrived here.</para><para>All of this was brought about by the efforts of His Excellency Ambassador Richard O'Brien, the Irish Ambassador to Australia. He will be leaving Australia very shortly to take up another appointment in another part of the world. Richard has served his country very well in this country over a period now of seven years. He is leaving with the warmest regards of the parliament. Regrettably, I was not one of the people who were able to be at a very well attended farewell dinner that was given in his honour some weeks ago. I am indebted to all of the individuals that I have mentioned but in particular to Richard and Bernadette O'Brien for making it all possible.

Active sonar is the principal technology used by naval surface platforms worldwide to detect hostile underwater platforms and weapons (submarines, torpedoes, mines, etc.). Active sonars in the form of sonobuoys are also used by maritime fixed and rotary wing aircraft to detect and localise submarines. Warships are also usually fitted with underwater telephone, which emits active transmissions for voice communication with submerged submarines. Most ships also use high frequency active sonar in echo sounders used for navigation. Research into techniques for improving the ability of active sonar systems to detect underwater threats and so protect and preserve the ships and personnel of the Royal Australian Navy (RAN), and those put in its charge, is therefore a priority and necessity for the Department of Defence.</para><para>(2)	Low frequency active sonar (LFAS) is a generic term. It is generally used to identify a sonar system that emits sound at a frequency of 1 kilohertz (kHz) or less. The particular type of LFAS that has been linked in the media to environmental impacts on whales and dolphins is the Surveillance Towed Array Sensor System (SURTASS LFA sonar) used by the United States Navy (USN). SURTASS LFA is not a system used by the RAN and it has not been deployed in Australian waters. </para><para>	(a)	It is understood that the source level of SURTASS LFA is such that the intensity received by a whale, diver etc. at a distance of 10 meters from the source is approximately 215 decibels, relative to one micro Pascal (215 dB re 1 Pa). At a distance of 100 meters, the received sound intensity would be one one-hundredth, or 20 dB less, of the received sound intensity at 10 meters, i.e. 195 dB re 1 Pa. The received sound intensity will continue to decrease as distance to the source increases. To help place these numbers in context, it should be noted that common occurrences such as lightning strikes on the ocean produce received sound intensities approximately three hundred times this level (approximately 240 dB re 1 Pa at 10 meters) and sperm whales, in communicating, regularly produce total received sound intensities of 215 dB re 1 Pa at a distance of 10 metres.  </para><para>	(b)	The distance any sound can travel (be detected) in the marine environment is highly variable and depends on numerous, changeable ocean characteristics such as salinity and temperature profiles. With respect to the impacts that arise from underwater sound propagation it is considered that the most relevant distance is that at which the received sound intensity is safe for the sensitive hearing possessed by marine mammals etc.</para><para>For marine mammals (whales, dolphins, dugongs and seals), it is generally accepted by scientists that a received level of 178 dB re 1 Pa for intermittent or pulsed sounds is considered to be the best estimate of a safe exposure level. In the deep water in which the USN SURTASS LFA system would operate, a conservative estimate of the distance corresponding to this received sound level would be approximately one kilometre.</para><para>(3)	Yes. Testing mid-range frequency active sonar equipment onboard warships is a routine practice common to Navy's around the globe, to ensure correct system functioning and to train operators in the use of the system. The RAN has routinely tested equipment installed on its ships since the advent of sonar during World War II. </para><para>Because testing mid-range frequency active sonar equipment is a routine practice, specific records of individual equipment tests are not kept in any consolidated form. Routine mitigating strategies are being put in place on RAN ships that ensure the use of sonar equipment does not have a significant impact on the environment. Where it is considered that the use of sonar has, will have or is likely to have, a significant impact on the environment, or where such operation might cause interference with a cetacean, then all relevant environmental approvals will be sought and obtained. To date there has been no requirement to seek such approval for the use of active sonar by Defence ships or aircraft.</para><para>(4)	(a)	Impact assessments have been conducted into sources of underwater noise. These are:</para><para>Environmental Impact Assessment of Underwater Acoustic Noise Trials, Timor Sea. PPK Environment &amp; Infrastructure Pty Ltd. October 1998.</para><para>Environmental Impact Assessment of Underwater Sonar Operations and Mitigation Procedures. PPK Environment &amp; Infrastructure Pty Ltd. September 2000.</para><para>	(b)	Yes. In light of the continual worldwide development in understanding the impact of anthropogenic noise on marine creatures, the most recent of these assessments is under review. This updated report is likely to be released to the public when complete. </para><para>(5)	See response to Question 3.</para><para>(6)	The RAN does not use low frequency active sonar (LFAS) (that is, the USN SURTASS sonar), nor is any information held on its impacts on marine mammals and other marine life. Information on this equipment is available on the USN website at http://www.surtass-lfa-eis.com/.</para><para>(7)	As noted in question 2b, “safe distances” for exposure to underwater sound are highly dependent on the conditions prevailing in the marine environment. The most meaningful quantitative measure for assessing safety is the received sound intensity (“level of exposure”).</para><para>For marine mammals (whales, dolphins, dugongs and seals), a received level of 178 dB re 1 Pa for intermittent or pulsed sounds is considered by scientists to be the best estimate of a safe exposure level in general, although significantly higher levels might apply to some species, such as dolphins.</para><para>For humans, a conservative estimate of the safe level is 150 dB re 1 Pa. A safe exposure level for fish is considered to be 170 dB re 1 Pa, and turtles 175 dB re 1 Pa. No information is available for marine birds, however, since their ears have developed for sound in air it is expected that safe levels would be higher than those of marine animals, because of their insensitivity to sound under water. </para><para>(9)	No.</para><para>(10)	No application to test LFAS (the USN SURTASS LFA) in the Rottnest Trench has been made. An application to test the medium frequency RAN Australian Surface Ship Towed Array Sonar System (ASSTASS) was made in December 2001 (EPBC Referral 2001/538) when trial assets became available at short notice. The RAN ASSTASS receives across a wide spectrum but has an active mode, which transmits at 1.5 kHz. A series of test sites, south of the Rottnest Trench were selected and mitigation procedures developed. It was intended to scientifically validate these proposed environmental mitigation procedures in conjunction with an independent Blue Whale Research Project Team from Curtin University. Internal Defence environmental consideration concluded that there was not sufficient certainty that the activity could be undertaken in a way that would not interfere with the Blue Whale population resident in the area at that time. The test therefore did not proceed.</para><para>(11)	The RAN has no planned tests for the USN SURTASS LFA. Further tests of the Australian ASSTASS system are intended; details of all Department of Defence active sonar tests covered by the EPBC Act (1999) will be publicly obtainable from the Environment Australia website. RAN ships will continue to test their mid-range frequency active sonars as operational circumstances dictate and consistent with newly implemented mitigation procedures.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Offshore Seismic Surveys and Noise Pollution</title><page.no>1433</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 21)</subtitle><id.no>21</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1433</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 12 February 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	How many seismic tests have been conducted in Australian waters in the past 5 years.</para><para>(2)	Can details of those tests be provided, including:</para><para>	(a)	the nature of impact assessment that took place;</para><para>	(b)	locations of all tests;</para><para>	(c)	duration of all tests;</para><para>	(d)	intensity of sound (including decibel level);</para><para>	(e)	permits applied for and received by the proponent;</para><para>	(f)	mitigation measures imposed;</para><para>	(g)	the monitoring program in place during the testing;</para><para>	(h)	conclusions of any monitoring;</para><para>	(i)	the purpose of the tests; and </para><para>	(j)	the companies undertaking the tests.</para><para>(3)	What is the current state of knowledge regarding noise pollution in Australia; in particular,</para><para>	(a)	(i)	are the impacts of marine noise on different species of mammals established, and</para><para>		(ii)	can details of studies and reports that investigate potential harm to marine life as a result of marine noise be provided;</para><para>	(b)	is there any data on the levels of noise in Australian waters from all sources, natural and human; if so, can details be provided; and</para><para>	(c)	is there any data on the cumulative impacts of those noise sources, if so, can details be provided.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1433</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Geoscience Australia's national seismic database PEDIN records 205 offshore seismic surveys in the five calendar years 1997-2001 inclusive.</para><para>Included in these 205 surveys are: </para><para>·	192 surveys conducted under the Petroleum (Submerged Lands) Act of 1967.</para><para>·	4 surveys in the Zone of Cooperation (located between Timor and Australia.)</para><para>·	9 scientific surveys conducted by Geoscience Australia in Australian territorial waters (including Antarctic territory).</para><para>The 205 recorded surveys do not include petroleum exploration surveys conducted within three nautical miles closest to the shoreline.

This approval is subject to meeting the requirements of the P(SL)(ME) Regulations 1999 and any other conditions of the exploration permit, production licence, retention lease or special prospecting authority. </para><para>The information in relation to the EPBC Act, was provided in the response to a previous question on notice (No.3900), which appeared in the Senate Hansard on 12 February 2002.</para><para>	(f)	My Department does not keep records of all past seismic activities, and I am advised that it would take considerable resources to provide specific advice on every proposal. As such I am not willing to authorise the expenditure of significant resources to undertake such a task. </para><para>However, in general terms, seismic companies adopt a number of strategies to mitigate impact on cetaceans which may include avoiding certain times of the year or certain localities where feeding, breeding or migrating whales may be present, adoption of `soft-start' procedures and the use of observers on vessels. A key mitigation strategy is the adherence to the Guidelines for Interactions Between Offshore Seismic Operations and Whales, which outline in considerable detail mitigation strategies that are required for all seismic activities.</para><para>	(g)	All whale sightings are recorded by exploration companies and forwarded to Environment Australia. Monitoring programs vary with the nature of the activity, and the time and place in which it is undertaken. </para><para>A number of companies have conducted additional, comprehensive monitoring programs, some including the use of aerial and acoustic surveys, as part of their survey activity.  </para><para>	(h)	See answer (2)(g) above. Information from previous surveys has been instrumental in development of Guidelines for Interactions Between Offshore Seismic Operations and Whales. </para><para>	(i)	Petroleum reserves are found in sub-surface sedimentary structures that trap and hold hydrocarbons. To find these structures, seismic data provide a series of vertical slice views of the substrata beneath the seafloor. Interpretation of these images allows for potential hydrocarbon bearing structures to be identified.</para><para>Seismic techniques may also be applied to geo-technical studies, sediment analysis, international boundary delineation, and environmental research. </para><para>	(j)	Operators and contractors for surveys are provided in Table 1.</para><para>(3)	(a)	(i)	Knowledge on the impacts of marine noise on different marine species is continuing to expand. Impacts can range from incidental disturbance through to observed changes to behaviour, and in very rare cases injury and possible death. To date, in Australia, there has been no known death of a cetacean or other marine mammal scientifically attributed to seismic operations.</para><para>		(ii)	There are numerous studies available that attempt to determine the impacts of noise on marine life. Many of the reports are not published, as they are commissioned by companies. Several reports and publications are available and are detailed below:</para><para>Swan, Neff and Young (Eds) 1994.

APPEA Journal 2000.</para><para>There are several journals which, from time-to-time, contain information/papers on marine noise. Marine Mammal Science published by the Society for Marine Mammalogy is an example.</para><para>	(b)	Background oceanic noise varies according to a number of factors (wind, wave action, rain, fish populations etc), and is generally considered to be in the vicinity of 80-120dB depending on circumstance. The addition of anthropogenic noise (in particular shipping) to any ambient level will add to the total noise spectrum. Swan, Neff and Young (Eds) 1994 (see answer to (3) (a) (ii)) provides a general overview of natural and human oceanic noise.</para><para>	(c)	There is, to my knowledge, no evidence or data on the cumulative impacts of noise in the marine environment. </para><para>Table 1

question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	The Department has found child care award rates vary considerably across all States and Territories. Whereas the initial rate of $13 per hour was a generous contribution to towards the employment of an additional worker, increasing costs have meant that child care services must now utilise the subsidy more efficiently. The $13 per hour subsidy is still considered to be a valuable contribution towards the employment of an additional worker in a child care service.

The cost of family law litigation would depend on the amount of time taken by the court to resolve the issues in dispute between the parties. It is important to acknowledge that only 5% of all applications to the court actually go to a defended hearing.</para><para>The Australian Bureau of Statistics, in its publication Australian Social Trends 2001 provides the following data on the numbers of children under 18 affected by divorce:</para><para>1999	53,400</para><para>1998	51,600</para><para>1997	51,700</para><para>1996	52,500</para><para>1995	n.a.</para><para>1994	47,500</para><para>(2)	I am unable to confirm or deny the accuracy of the statistics as, as far as I am aware, there is no data available that would enable me to do so.</para><para>(3)	The Family Court of Australia, in all States except Western Australia, is the main court that deals with family law issues.

If the evidence provided demonstrates a prima facie case, the allegations are forwarded to the Australian Federal Police for consideration, in accordance with the operational priorities of that organisation. If the AFP provides a brief to the Director of Public Prosecutions, then that organisation has the responsibility, in accordance with Commonwealth prosecution guidelines, for prosecuting the alleged offender. There is no data available on the number of convictions for perjury in family law proceedings since 1976, when the Family Court of Australia was established.</para><para>(5)	Section 121 of the Family Law Act 1975 provides a prohibition on publication of identifying material in reports of family law proceedings. The policy intention is to protect parties involved in family law proceedings, particularly children, from publicity. Section 121 is effective in implementing this policy. </para><para>Pursuant to recent amendments, the Family Court can, when a child has been abducted, lift restrictions that would otherwise stop the names of people involved in family law proceedings from being published. This is done specifically to locate a missing child. For missing children to be listed on the Family Court web site, a judicial officer must have made an order permitting names and photographs to be released to the public in an effort to help find the child.</para><para>The Government is considering minor amendments to the section that will not effect the underlying policy intention.</para><para>(6)	I am unable to confirm or deny the statement as, as far as I am aware, there is no data available that would allow me to do so.</para><para>(7)	The Family Law Act 1975 provides that each of the parents of a child has parental responsibility for the child, and that parental responsibility is not affected by any changes in the nature of the relationships of the child's parents. Parental responsibility does not, however, mean equally shared residence of the child, as the question suggests. The Family Law Act 1975 provides that a court may make a parenting order that, amongst other things, deals with the person with whom the child is to reside and other persons with whom the child is to have contact. In making such an order the court is required to regard the best interests of the child as the paramount consideration.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Parliamentarians' Entitlements</title><page.no>1457</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 87)</subtitle><id.no>87</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1457</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Murray</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Special Minister of State, upon notice, on 12 February 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Can the full details of all use of entitlements by retired members of parliament (on the same reporting basis as applies to current members of parliament) for the 2000-01 financial year be provided.</para><para>(2)	With reference to the revelation in the Australian National Audit Office's report Parliamentarians Entitlements: 1999-2000 that a number of parliamentarians had used entitlements that significantly exceeded the average, could the Minister please indicate (with respect to those that did significantly exceed the average): (a) whether the use of these entitlements by those parliamentarians has been investigated to determine if it is proper; and (b) what action is being taken with regard to the use of these entitlements that significantly exceeded the average.</para><para>(3)	Without limiting the scope of the questions above, which apply to all relevant entitlements, could the Minister please address the questions outlined in (2)(a) and (2)(b) with respect to the following entitlements: (a) personalised stationery, newsletters and other printing; (b) photographic services; (c) photocopy paper; and (d) flags for presentation to constituents.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1457</page.no><name role="metadata">Abetz, Sen Eric</name><name role="display">Senator Abetz</name><name.id>N26</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Special Minister of State</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Yes, the Government has decided to table the usage of travel entitlements by former Senators and Members in a parallel way to that which applies in respect of serving Senators and Members.

follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	No decision was made by Telstra on 4 April 2001 concerning staffing structures in the Sydney Metro Service Area. However in October 2001, Telstra announced that ninety-five positions in the Sydney Metro Service Area were in excess of requirements. Subsequently sixty seven staff elected to take voluntary redundancies. These redundancies were first notified to the NSW CEPU on 25 October 2001. </para><para>On 19 December 2001, Telstra notified the union that twenty-six staff would begin the established redeployment process and those who do not find suitable positions would be retrenched involuntarily. </para><para>(2)	Telstra has advised that some 8,000 of its customers in the Sydney metropolitan area were affected in mid-February 2002 by an abnormal period of severe storms, resulting in prolonged rain and subsequent minor flooding and severe wind damage. According to Telstra, fault levels have now returned to normal.</para><para>(3)	Telstra's Board and Management are responsible for the day to day running of the company's operations, including decisions of an operational nature such as staffing levels. Telstra maintains that its decision is based on the need to more closely align staffing levels to average workloads. </para><para>(4)	Telstra has advised that during February 2002, 80 Telstra staff came from other parts of Australia to assist with the additional workload in Sydney caused by the storms. Additionally, Telstra employed contractors to assist during this period—these contractors ceased work for Telstra on 2 March 2002.</para><para>(5)	(a) and (b) Telstra currently uses permanent staff for installation of telephone services in the Sydney Metro area. However, Telstra will use a contractor workforce in extraordinary circumstances, such as floods, to handle unexpected peaks. Telstra considers that this practice offers the best value for its customers. It would obviously not be effective to employ full time staff to cover extraordinary peak loads as, during normal periods, there would not be enough work for them to do.</para><para>(6)	Telstra has advised that the level of service provided to its customers will not be impacted by this decision. </para><para>(7)	No. While Telstra is partially Government-owned, Telstra has been an independent corporation since 1992. Telstra's Board and Management are responsible for the day to day running of the company's operations. The Government's role is to establish the legislative framework within which all telecommunications service providers (including Telstra) must operate. Decisions about how the company carries on business, staffing levels and investment decisions belong rightfully with the Board. </para><para>(8)	See answer to Part (3).</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: 1800 Prefix</title><page.no>1461</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 107)</subtitle><id.no>107</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1461</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator Harris</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts, upon notice, on 15 February 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Why did the testing procedures fail to detect inherent data faults with the Telstra 1800 prefix `conditioning' from and/or prior to 1 September 1993.</para><para>(2)	Why have the `008-1800' subscribers still not been advised of the conditioning faults.</para><para>(3)	Is it a fact that the above conditioning faults were the result of exchanges not being conditioned by 1 September 1993, and one of those not conditioned was Salisbury ARE in Brisbane (Mr Ivory's 1800 prefix exchange) thus preventing incoming 1800 calls to all Telstra subscribers who were reliant on the Salisbury exchange.</para><para>(4)	Is it a fact that exchanges that were not conditioned by 1 September 1993 and/or by 20 September 1993 would have then not been conditioned except in response to a customer complaint that callers could not get through; if not, can evidence to the contrary be provided.</para><para>(5)	Please advise, with documented evidence, the specific date of the initial complaint that was lodged by Mr Ivory, on 11 May 1994, in relation to the Solar-Mesh 1800 777 592 service, and what date it was finally conditioned to rectify the initial 1800 prefix fault.</para><para>(6)	From 1 September 1993, was there also a problem with the DMS accepting 1800 numbers for trunking in some exchanges.</para><para>(7)	If the above referred to `DMS 1800 accepting faults' existed, could it have adversely affected incoming (Australia Wide) Telstra subscribers' calls after the initial conditioning fault had been rectified, and/or from day one for the few 1800 services that were lucky enough not to have suffered damage from a conditioning fault.</para><para>(8)	Did 10-digit number faults occur pertaining to numbers beginning with `1'.</para><para>(9)	If 10-digit number faults occurred on numbers beginning with `1', would Telstra subscribers' customers have been prevented from receiving calls when 1800 prefixes were dialled.</para><para>(10)	During the 10-digit number faults and during the conditioning fault periods, could Telstra subscriber's freecall customers still have received incoming 008 dialled calls if customers knew to dial 008 in front of the number instead of dialling the new 1800 prefix.</para><para>(11)	(a) Is it correct that Telstra `number length difficulties' caused further faults with 1800 numbers from 1 September 1993 in relation to the CPE problems; (b) did these faults still exist on 16 March 1995; and (c) would the ANP have escalated these systemic fault difficulties.</para><para>(12)	(a) Is it a fact that Telstra has 1800 `cyclic storage problems' with ARF common register and KS failure that prevented proper digit transfer (eg. 1800 123 456 will be changed to 1800 123 418, i.e. The first two digits will be reinserted after the 8th digit); (b) was this cyclic storage problem another 1800 prefix systemic fault; if so, did Telstra have difficulties with having sufficient maintenance staff trained to be able to attend the faulty exchanges for rectification; (c) would this fault have occurred not just when dialling 1800 code prefix numbers but also where more than 8 digits are dialled (eg. 100, 1800, ANP 1818 etc.); and (d) was this another very major fault covered up by Telstra.</para><para>(13)	If the cyclic storage fault existed, could it have adversely affected incoming Australia Wide 1800 customer calls.</para><para>(14)	Is it a fact that Telstra also had another 1800 prefix systemic fault called a `no progress fault' whereby the switching of 1800 calls takes a longer switching time than 008 calls, leaving customers to believe that their calls had failed.</para><para>(15)	If the above referred to `no progress fault' existed, would it have adversely affected incoming Australia Wide 1800 customer calls.</para><para>(16)	Is it a fact that Telstra also had another 1800 prefix fault, called a `congestion tone fault' route fault for 18 codes not graded to sufficient capacity, causing 1800 customers to have insufficient answering capacity to receive incoming 1800 code prefix calls. </para><para>(17)	If the `congestion tone fault' existed, could it have also adversely affected incoming Australia Wide 1800 customer calls.</para><para>(18)	Between 1 December 1994 and 31 December 1994, over its entire 008-1800 network, did Telstra calls received total 27 565 289;

(b) if no such advertising was published nationally to the public by Telstra, could it have adversely restricted nationally the number of incoming 1800 customer calls being received by Telstra's subscribers from their potential customers and/or from the general public who were not informed by Telstra (the then trusted fully Commonwealth-owned carrier), which was still promoting the use of 1800 prefix numbers nationally; (c) did Telstra keep concealing from its 1800 subscribers and from the public that Telstra's 1800 prefix network was not fit for use from the 1 September 1993 change-over commencement date; if so, why was a large pool of Telstra's subscribers not informed of their daily accruing potential damage;

	(c) was the above conflict of interest revealed in Telstra's public offer documents; if not, why not; and (d) were the above systemic faults in Telstra's 1800 network and computer software disclosed in the Telstra public offer documents; if not, why not.</para><para>(27)	(a) As the Minister responsible for the T1 and T2 share sell-off by the Commonwealth, why did the Minister not ensure to have disclosed in the T1 and T2 offer documents the fact that Telstra's then Chairman, Mr David Hoare, was at the same time Chairman of Telstra's legal advisory firm, Mallesons Stephen Jaques; (b) as the Minister responsible for the T1 and T2 share sell-off by the Commonwealth, why did the Minister not ensure to have disclosed in the T1 and T2 offer documents the fact that Telstra's then in-house Counsel, Mr Stephen Mead, was at the same time a partner of Telstra's legal advisory firm, Mallesons Stephen Jaques; and (c) as the Minister responsible for the T1 and T2 share sell-off by the Commonwealth, why did the Minister not ensure to have disclosed in the T1 and T2 offer documents the fact that the Commonwealth's legal advisory firm, Freehill Hollingdale and Page, was also on a Telstra retainer in relation to the concealment of the potential liabilities to the COTs (Casualties of Telecom/Telstra) in other COT related matters, including the few COT cases settled just before the T2 sale.</para><para>(28)	(a) Is the Minister aware that Mr Stephen Mead was a good friend of a Mr Simon Dudley Williams who, along with the firm (Spruson and Ferguson), were, since before Mr Ivory's 11 May 1994 1800 conditioning fault complaint to Telstra, being sued by Mr Ivory's company for professional negligence;

(b) was it possible for any single 10 000 lot 1800 number ranges to have been missed completely in the 1 September 1993 conditioning; (c) is it a fact that the 1800 universal exchange conditioning defects could have accidentally allowed a single number to have been completely missed in the 1 September 1993 conditioning of the 1800 prefixes; and (d) is it a fact that Telstra would have been reliant on receiving a customer complaint to enable it to rectify any numbers that were not conditioned.</para><para>(30)	(a) Is the Minister aware: (i) that the Solar-Mesh 1800 777 592 code conditioning fault occurred from 1 September 1993, but was not initially uncovered and reported until 11 May 1994, when it was first reported to Telstra's faults department by Telstra's Miss Hatton and also by Mr Ivory, and (ii) it was then not rectified until the 31 May 1994 when Miss Hatton, witnessed by Mr Ivory over the telephone in a three-way conversation, bypassed Telstra's faults department and went straight to Telstra's exchange; (b) is the Minister aware that the phantom fault testing done on 1 June 1994, by Telstra's Mr Adam Sears, was done the day after the conditioning fault had been rectified; and (c) Given that these matters could be proven to the Minister if he were to instigate an internal investigation into Telstra and/or have a face-to-face meeting with Mr Ivory, is the Minister prepared to do so. (a) Is it a fact that Telstra's Operational Processes Support People, Network Operations Manager and Product Integration Management, during October 1993, each became aware of many major 1800 code implementation fault problems that had resulted in no access to a large number of 1800 services right across Australia, not just in country areas but also in metropolitan areas; (b) did these problems stem from system failures, equipment failures, planning failures and/or managerial neglect prior to and from 1 September 1993; (c) is it also a fact that, by 8 October 1993, Telstra knew that some of these implementation faults and network faults existed and were likely to worsen unless some rationale and co-ordination was introduced at high level to the product introduction process; and (d) is it a fact that Telstra has concealed these faults and defects.</para><para>(32)	How many Australia Wide 1800 customers did Telecom/Telstra have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 31 August 1993 at the Salisbury Queensland exchange.</para><para>(33)	How many Australia Wide 1800 customers did Telecom/Telstra have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 31 May 1994 at the Salisbury Queensland exchange.</para><para>(34)	How many Australia Wide 1800 customers did Telecom/Telstra have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 31 August 1993 at the Valley Queensland exchange.</para><para>(35)	How many Australia Wide 1800 customers did Telecom/Telstra have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 31 May 1994 at the Valley Queensland exchange.</para><para>(36)	How many Australia Wide 1800 prefix exchanges did OPTUS have as at 1 September 1993.</para><para>(37)	How many Australia Wide customers did OPTUS have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 1 September 1993 in their Queensland exchanges.</para><para>(38)	How many Australia Wide customers did OPTUS have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 1 September 1993 in their New South Wales exchanges.</para><para>(39)	How many Australia Wide customers did OPTUS have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 1 September 1993 in their Victorian exchanges.</para><para>(40)	How many Australia Wide customers did OPTUS have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 1 September 1993 in their South Australia exchanges.</para><para>(41)	How many Australia Wide customers did OPTUS have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 1 September 1993 in their Western Australia exchanges.</para><para>(42)	How many Australia Wide customers did OPTUS have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 1 September 1993 in their Tasmanian exchanges.</para><para>(43)	How many Australia Wide customers did OPTUS have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 1 September 1993 in their Northern Territory exchanges.</para><para>(44)	How many Australia Wide customers did OPTUS have as 008-1800 prefix subscribers as at 1 September 1993 in their Australian Capital Territory exchanges.

The environmental impacts appear to have been as predicted, primarily local smothering of benthic communities. There are also several reports on the subject which discuss options for tailing placement and water management, particularly in the tropics and which are readily available.

If the latter, the recommendations should include any revisions or clarifications that need to be made to the NRTC Act and the Heavy and Light Vehicle Agreements, to make them function more effectively.</para><para>(c)	Having regard to the broad aims set out earlier in these Terms of Reference, consider the breadth of, and priorities for, future road transport reform needs including consideration of alternative approaches to regulatory arrangements (for example, accreditation and co-regulation):</para><para>·	The issues considered in any future regulatory reform arrangements should include pricing, charges, cost neutrality and the externalities associated with choices of transport mode. </para><para>(d)	In addressing future institutional arrangements for transport regulatory reform, explicitly consider whether those arrangements should apply only to road transport or be extended to any aspects of other modes and to cross-modal issues. </para><para>(e)	Consider also the degree to which any change in institutional arrangements should encompass issues beyond regulatory reform. In this context the Review should also address the role of the National Transport Secretariat and its place in any recommended future institutional arrangements.</para><para>(f)	If recommendations are made to broaden the current regulatory policy framework (for example by replacing the NRTC by a Land Transport Commission) the Review should specifically address what steps and arrangements are necessary in order to ensure that this does not result in a lessening of attention to ongoing road transport reform.

This has occurred through industry representation on the National Plantation Inventory Reference Committee. This committee advises on the structure, content and data collection method for NPI reporting. A key issue is to ensure that grower interests and confidentiality are maintained as data is provided directly by the growers. Industry representation includes the Standing Committee of Forests (now the Forest and Forest Products Committee), National Association of Forest Industries, Australian Forest Growers, Plantation Timber Association of Australia and the Regional Plantation Committees. Consultation has also occurred through a series of plantation Data Collection Workshops that were conducted by the National Forest Inventory in four States where plantation expansion is rapidly occurring, during 2000. The purpose of the workshops was to identify industry and stakeholder data requirements and identify an agreed methodology for plantation data collection and collation at a State level for regional, State and national reporting.</para><para>The Department, on behalf of the Commonwealth, and industry stakeholders are partners in the Plantations for Australia: the 2020 Vision.

In accordance with the Meat Program Agreement 2000-2002 AQIS also engages contract inspectors to handle seasonal peaks in the workload, relief work and other contingencies. The Australian Government Solicitor prepared the contract document that AQIS uses for these engagements.

For the 2001/02 financial year over three hundred individual contractors expressed a willingness to accept the terms of the contract offered by AQIS. When the draft contract was provided recipients were invited to discuss its contents with an AQIS representative nominated in each State.</para><para>(4)	(a) A draft contract was provided to potential contractors during the month outlined in the response to Question 2. (b) contractors willing to accept the terms of the contract offered by AQIS indicated their acceptance by returning a signed agreement by a nominated date.

Contracts are therefore only offered for a short period each year. (b) potential contractors are invited to have contact with regional AQIS management to discuss the terms of the contract. Most of the contractors have had a long-term relationship with AQIS and as a result few questions were asked of AQIS with regard to the contract offer prior to the commencement of the 2001/02 financial year.</para><para>(7)	(a) Yes.</para><para>(b) Yes. </para><para>(c) Yes.</para><para>(8)	AQIS is not aware of the total income derived by any contractor.

In November 2001 the issue of the Superannuation Guarantee Levy (SGL) was raised for the first time when updated legal advice was sought by AQIS.

The Australian Delegation advised it would raise the suggestion with the Alligator Rivers Region Technical Committee (ARRTC), and subsequently referred the issue to the Chair of ARRTC on 30 January 2002 for their consideration. ARRTC resolved that, on the basis of the information supplied to the Committee, an additional member from conservation non-government organisations would not significantly enhance the standing of the Committee, as suggested by the IUCN. The Government is currently considering the resolution of ARRTC.</para><para>(2)	As noted above, the Government is currently considering the resolution of ARRTC, which is an independent statutory committee. </para><para>(3)	The Northern Territory Government approval to irrigate water on defined areas within the disturbed area of the Jabiluka Mineral Lease, subject to water quality criteria and other conditions defining when irrigation could take place derived on environmental protection grounds, was supported by the Office of the Supervising Scientist and the Northern Land Council. That support was given on the basis that compliance with the conditions attached to the approval would ensure that there could be no risk to the environment nor to the health of people living downstream of Jabiluka. </para><para>The verified extremely low levels of uranium and other constituents detected in Swift Creek downstream of the Jabiluka mine and detected in Magela Creek downstream of Ranger mine did not pose any risk to the environment or to human health. This has been confirmed by the Supervising Scientist and agreed to by the Northern Land Council and the Gundjehmi Aboriginal Corporation representing the Aboriginal Traditional owners of the Ranger and Jabiluka areas. Clearly, the approval was successful in ensuring that the environment and human health remained protected. </para><para>(4)	No. The mining company's initial monitoring data for Swift Creek on 22 January 2002 indicated a uranium concentration of 0.06 parts per billion immediately downstream of the Jabiluka site and a uranium concentration of 0.01 parts per billion upstream of the Jabiluka site. Independent environmental monitoring data collected by the Supervising Scientist on 22 January 2002 showed a uranium concentration downstream of Jabiluka of 0.01 parts per billion at the same monitoring point. Upon analysis of this data, and other data, the Office of the Supervising Scientist expressed doubt as to the validity of the 0.06 parts per billion result on 4 and 5 March 2002. Subsequent analysis of duplicate samples returned a result of 0.01parts per billion, consistent with both the upstream concentration and the Supervising Scientist data. The company responsible for analysing the mining company's samples has advised that they consider the erroneous result was probably caused by contamination of the sample in the analytical process. Highly sensitive analytical techniques are used to measure these extremely low concentrations however great care must be taken to avoid contamination and thus an erroneously high result.</para><para>(5)	The environmental protection limit for the concentration of uranium in waters downstream of the Jabiluka mine is a very conservative 5.8 parts per billion. This limit was derived according to the procedures recommended in the recently revised Australian and New Zealand Water Quality Guidelines for aquatic ecosystems of high conservation value using local ecotoxicological data. Aquatic ecosystems of high conservation value are subject to the strictest requirements in the Australian and New Zealand Water Quality Guidelines. A uranium concentration of 5.8 parts per billion is very low. For comparison, the concentration of uranium in the Jabiru town water supply is between 6 and 7 parts per billion, and the drinking water standard for uranium is 20 parts per billion. </para><para>(6)	Please refer to the answer to Question (4) above.</para><para>Mr Kevin Keeffe, Assistant Secretary, World Heritage Branch, Department of the Environment and Heritage, wrote to Mr Francesco Bandarin, Director of the World Heritage Centre, UNESCO, on 6 March 2002.

Dr Switkowski, CEO of Telstra, in his speech to the market on 6 March 2002 concerning the half year company results reported that the Telstra Board's decision on the dividend payment was a reflection of the Directors' confidence in the future of the Company's performance and its cash generation.</para><para>(2)	There is general recognition that over the past twelve months there has been a considerable downturn in the telecommunications sector worldwide. This is reflected in the trading difficulties being experienced by all telecommunications service providers and the large-scale rationalisations of the sector that has been occurring globally. The CEO and the Telstra Board have the responsibility for the day to day running of the Corporation and there is no reason to doubt their forecasts on the anticipated timing of a rebound in Company profits. </para><para>(3)	The Telstra dividend payment is not hypothecated for any discrete purpose and is placed in consolidated revenue. Since 1996 the Government has provided $1 billion in funding to improve Australian telecommunications infrastructure, particular in rural and regional areas. The most recent program of initiatives was provided in response to the Telecommunications Service Inquiry (TSI) into the adequacy of telecommunication services. The TSI response builds on successful Networking the Nation and Social Bonus programs.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs</title><page.no>1503</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 194)</subtitle><id.no>194</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1503</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Bolkus</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Prime Minister, upon notice, on 15 March 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Were the issues of Cyprus and the Parthenon Marbles raised by the Prime Minister, or any Australian government minister, at any stage in either bilateral or multilateral discussions at the recent Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Queensland; if so: (a) when and by whom; (b) what was the detail of the Australian government's position and how was it pursued; and (c) what was the response and outcome.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1503</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Prime Minister has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1) Yes.</para><para>(a) I raised the issue of the Parthenon Marbles in my bilateral talks with Mr Tony Blair, the British Prime Minister, on 1 March 2002 at Coolum immediately prior to the start of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM).</para><para>The issue of Cyprus was discussed by leaders during a CHOGM Executive Session on 2 March 2002 and again on 5 March 2002, both of which I chaired.

However, the Minister is aware that there are ongoing concerns about the eligibility criteria for veterans' entitlements and the adequacy of benefits provided under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Accordingly, the Minister has recently established a high profile and independent review to consider these matters. The Government is also aware of concerns and special needs of Vietnam veterans. In the 2000-01 Budget, the Government announced a $32.3 million package of support for veterans and their families in response to the validated findings of the Vietnam Veterans' Health Study. More recently, the Minister announced an update of the mortality study of Vietnam Veterans conducted in 1994/95.</para><para>(4)	There are no provisions in the current legislation which provide compensation for loss of income as a result of conscription.</para><para>(5)	The Department monitors its performance in processing claims for benefits under the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 through regular satisfaction surveys.

This compares with a 16 per cent dissatisfaction rate reported in September 2000. The Department continues to take steps to address this level of dissatisfaction, particularly in relation to service and specific skills training for staff. These surveys did not include compensation claims made through the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Service (MCRS). Improvements in Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986 claims processing are now being applied to MCRS claims.

Counselling services were also offered by unit chaplains and by medical and nursing staff. This support is ongoing. Following the deployment of an Egyptian medical team in February 2000, ADF personnel also had access to a psychiatrist.</para><para>(2)	From early October 1999 to the end of December 1999, six Army psychology staff were operating in East Timor. During January 2000, another five Army psychology staff were added, and they remained in country until 6 March 2000. Since then, two Army psychology staff have been operating within the Australian Battalion Group structure and they are reinforced by up to six additional psychology staff when the battalion group returns to Australia. </para><para>(3)	Psychology support in East Timor was available to ADF personnel from all three services. The psychology support included counselling services, critical incident stress debriefing (as required) and periodical debriefings for high risk personnel such as Military Police and chaplains.</para><para>(4)	(a)	Current policy requires all ADF members on deployment to East Timor to be given the opportunity to participate in the debriefing process both prior to their return, and approximately three months after their return to Australia. This process includes an educational briefing, an individual screening interview and the completion of a number of psychometric screening instruments. However, participation in the debriefing process is not mandatory.</para><para>(b)	The briefing element lasts for approximately 30 minutes and the key message relates to the types of issues that members will face on their reintegration into family, work and life on their return to Australia. It also presents signs and symptoms of poor adjustment and the range of services available in Australia for returned servicemen and women.</para><para>(c) 	This process is not mandatory and some personnel may not have received the brief. Overall, 8,511 personnel have had the brief since operations in East Timor began.</para><para>(5)	(a)	On return to Australia, all ADF personnel have access to the full range of support services. This includes Defence health, psychology, social work and chaplaincy services. They also have access to the Vietnam Veterans Counselling Service (VVCS) because of their “veteran” status.</para><para>Veterans in this group who have an accepted mental health disability also have access to the Department of Veterans' Affairs mental health services, including private medical and psychiatric support and psychiatric hospital admission where this is required. Veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder and/or with clinical depression or severe anxiety disorders can access the department's mental health services automatically, that is, without the need to establish a successful claim with the department.</para><para>While it is not mental health service per se, veterans also have access to various forms of rehabilitation through the Military Compensation and Rehabilitation Scheme and the Veterans Vocational Rehabilitation Scheme.</para><para>(b)	ADF personnel have access to all ADF military, civilian and contracted health professionals. The number of support staff available through the VVCS is 80 clinical staff in VVCS centres, as well as 330 contract counsellors in rural, remote and outer metropolitan areas. Free treatment is available for any period of time for any psychological injury that occurs as the result of operational service, either through the ADF for members, or through the Department of Veterans' Affairs for ex-service personnel. </para><para>(6)	There are a number of organisations within Defence offering support services (medical, psychology, social work, and chaplains) to returned ADF members. At this time, composite statistics regarding the use of support services are not gathered. Also, due to the voluntary nature of many of these referrals (meaning that such a visit might not be formally recorded on the member's official record, as per the Privacy Act), the total number of personnel using any of these support services cannot be ascertained. The ADF Mental Health Strategy will work towards addressing these issues in the future.</para><para>The Department of Veterans' Affairs does not maintain the detail of individuals' units and regiments. The department provides health care to veterans who have left the armed forces and who have an accepted claim for disability. Veterans without a claim have access to the VVCS.</para><para>VVCS figures indicate a small intake of East Timor veterans, primarily in the Townsville and Darwin offices. The average monthly counselling intake at Townsville over the last 12 months has been between 12 and 15 veterans. The Townsville office has also conducted group programs for current serving peacekeepers and their partners.</para><para>(7)	Manual records of individual counselling sessions are maintained, however they are not collated. Electronic records are not maintained at present, but will be available in the planned ADF health information system.</para><para>The VVCS Townsville office is conducting an evaluation of all East Timor peacekeepers for the period 1 January 2002 to 30 July 2002, investigating suicide risk, trauma, alcohol abuse and relationship difficulties.

Defence staff numbers in the System Program Office that manages the project will be maintained at a higher level for longer than otherwise planned for the acquisition phase, due to the slippage. However, the impact will be relatively minor since a considerable portion of that organisation's current workforce will be needed to perform the ongoing Through Life Support of the Network when delivered, and to manage future enhancement phases of JORN programmed in the Defence Capability Plan. The entitlement under the contract to liquidated damages is expected to cover additional project office costs, and other costs, arising from the delay.</para><para>(4)	Because of the JORN contract's firm price, the contractor is liable for any additional contract costs incurred due to the slippage. The Defence Materiel Organisation has initiated a program to mitigate consequential Defence impacts and meet expenses through the application of liquidated damages provisions in the contract. </para><para>(5)	By mid 2001 it was clear that the contractor had under-estimated the level and complexity of the technical integration effort required for JORN. Attempts by the contractor RLM to reduce schedule impact by undertaking integration and test activities, essentially in parallel, proved unsuccessful. The contractor has now opted for a more conventional lower risk integration and test strategy. Based on experience to date the contractor has replanned and rescheduled its activities to develop a realistic, but still demanding schedule, aimed at achieving delivery between February and June of 2003.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Stuart Oil Shale Project</title><page.no>1512</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 211)</subtitle><id.no>211</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1512</page.no><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name><name.id>AW5</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 22 March 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Will the Minister table copies of all correspondence from him or the department to the proponents of Stage Two of the Stuart Oil Shale project requesting additional information under the provisions of the Environment Protection (Impact of Proposals) Act 1974.</para><para>(2)	Has Environment Australia received the additional information requested; if so, when; if not, when; if not, when is this information expected.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1512</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	A copy of all correspondence has been provided to the honourable senator.

This means that Australian personnel in the Kyrgyz Republic will enjoy privileges and immunities as if they were administrative and technical staff of the Embassy of Australia. Accordingly, Australian personnel will enjoy immunity from the civil and administrative jurisdiction of the Kyrgyz Republic for acts or omissions in the course of the person's official duties except in the following cases: </para><para>i.	A real action relating to private immovable property situated in the territory of the Kyrgyz Republic, unless the person holds it on behalf of Australia for the purposes of the mission.</para><para>ii.	An action relating to succession in which the person is involved as executor, administrator, heir or legatee as a private person and not on behalf of Australia.</para><para>Iii	An action relating to any professional or commercial activity exercised by the person in the Kyrgyz Republic outside the person's official business.</para><para>Pursuant to the `Agreement', Australian personnel also enjoy other privileges and immunities while in the Kyrgyz Republic such as: the inviolability of their person, the person's private residence and the person's papers and correspondence; exemptions from local social security provisions; exemption from all dues and taxes, personal or real, national, regional or municipal; exemption from all personal services; and exemption from all public services and from military obligations (see article 37(2), and articles 29-36, Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of April 18 1961).</para><para>(4)	(The statement that `The Krygyz Republic advised that it required a SOFA [Status of Forces Agreement] of treaty status as a precondition to the deployment of ADF personnel in its territory' is not included in Clause 7 of the `Agreement', but rather in Clause 7 of the National Interest Analysis (the `NIA'). Pursuant to Australia's treaty processing procedures, the department with primary carriage of the treaty is responsible for preparing a NIA for tabling in Parliament at the same time as the treaty outlining the foreseeable effects that the treaty will have on Australia, the consultation that has occurred in relation to the treaty and the direct financial costs to Australia, how the treaty will be implemented domestically and so on.)</para><para>No. The Krygyz Republic has not recanted on its original position that it requires a SOFA of treaty status as a precondition to the deployment of ADF personnel in its territory.</para><para>The Krygyz Government recognises (as does the Australian Government) the usual international practice that a treaty enters into force once both parties fulfil their respective internal treaty procedures pursuant to their respective domestic laws and procedures. </para><para>Pursuant to Article 18 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 which is binding on both Australia and the Kyrgyz Republic, the parties are obliged to refrain from acts that would defeat the object and purpose of the `Agreement' prior to the `Agreement's' entry into force. </para><para>Article 25 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties of 23 May 1969 provides for the provisional application of the `Agreement' pending its entry force because the `Agreement' itself so provides.
