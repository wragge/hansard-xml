It will continue to be driven by a belief that self-reliance, individual endeavour and choice must be encouraged and rewarded. It will maintain a strong social security safety net for the more vulnerable in our society. It will champion the concept that families, workers and communities striving together towards shared goals create capacities far more potent than any other arrangements. </para><para>It will continue to believe that Australian society is fundamentally built upon principles of fairness and decency and the premise that opportunity should be available equally to all, regardless of background, gender, race or religion. It will support the creative talent and entrepreneurial spirit of Australians as they seize the unprecedented opportunities available in the years ahead.</para><para>The government's priorities throughout the coming term will also be based upon an acknowledgment that it must set in place the foundations for national success well beyond the life of a single parliament—addressing such serious long term issues as the changing age composition of Australia's population and environmental sustainability.</para><para>Above all, its decisions will recognise that a government is charged with two over-riding responsibilities, namely providing for the security of, and delivering prosperity to, the nation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Security</inline></para><para>The national consciousness of security issues has understandably risen in the wake of the tragic and momentous events of September 11, 2001. The world is sadly neither the safe nor certain place we would all wish it to be.</para><para>Australia has joined the United States in an emphatic international response to terrorism.</para><para>The government will ensure that Australia maintains a strong and flexible Defence Force, able to act in the nation's interest whatever circumstances may arise and in support of the principles of democratic freedom that Australians value so highly.</para><para>I acknowledge the professionalism, the commitment and the courage of all Australian servicemen and women but particularly those currently on active duty overseas—in the war against terrorism, in East Timor and as peace-keepers in countries throughout the world.</para><para>Through the implementation of the 2000 Defence White Paper, which provides for real increases in defence spending of $32 billion over the next 10 years, the government will ensure Australia's Defence Forces are properly trained, equipped and supported, and that they remain capable of contributing both to the cause of political stability within our region and broader international endeavours.</para><para>The government will continue its fight against transnational and organised criminal efforts to boost trafficking in illicit drugs, people smuggling, money laundering, major fraud and other crimes. </para><para>Modern terrorism clearly presents a new and dangerous threat. Determined and strong responses are needed. To this end, Commonwealth law enforcement and national security agencies are being reviewed and will be allocated additional resources to achieve even higher levels of effectiveness.</para><para>Priority will be given to collaborating with other nations on security and law enforcement issues, enforcing proper control of our borders, ensuring greater efficiency within Commonwealth agencies and providing clear leadership for the states and territories in these vital areas. The Prime Minister will host a summit of state and territory leaders in April to advance new national frameworks for dealing with these challenges.</para><para>Both Australia's security and its prosperity will be enhanced through constructive international relations and Australia's network of bilateral relationships will remain the foundation of the government's foreign policy. These relationships are in good order, but will require careful ongoing attention over the term of this parliament.</para><para>Our ties with the United States are of immense importance to Australia's security and economic interests and the government continues to recognise the ongoing relevance of the ANZUS alliance for regional stability. Maintaining our support for the coalition against terrorism and, more generally, our relationship with the United States will be priorities for the government.</para><para>Developments in Asia, of course, are of enduring importance to Australian interests. The government will ensure that our already considerable economic and political ties to North and Southeast Asia continue to be strengthened for the benefit of all Australians. </para><para>Australia's Pacific neighbours have faced many difficult challenges in recent years and the government will continue to work with the region to help it address these issues. Australia has strong economic and diplomatic relations with nations around the earth. The government will continue to foster these relations in the interests of domestic prosperity and global security.</para><para>Australia is honoured to be hosting the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in Coolum in March and is committed, as Chairman, to ensure that the Commonwealth meets the challenges ahead and encourages members to maintain their shared values of good governance, human rights and economic development. Her Majesty The Queen, as Head of the Commonwealth, will visit Australia for this meeting.</para><para>This year marks the Golden Jubilee of the Queen's accession to the Throne. There can be little doubt that, during the past fifty years, Her Majesty has fulfilled her duties with great dedication, skill and remarkable energy. Australians will wish her well on the occasion of her Golden Jubilee. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Shared prosperity</inline></para><para>The second fundamental obligation of government is the pursuit of prosperity in which all citizens may share. The government remains committed to achieving higher living standards and more jobs for Australians over the next three years.</para><para>The resilience of the Australian economy, despite a global slowdown, is a strong endorsement of the government's disciplined approach to economic management and the structural reforms it undertook to improve the efficiency and flexibility of Australia's product, labour and financial markets.</para><para>Since 1995-96, the government has repaid over $55 billion of public debt. A key priority in the government's third term will be to maintain a strong fiscal position.</para><para>While Australia's recent economic performance has been extremely impressive, the process of economic reform is ongoing and the government will vigorously pursue economic policies which further strengthen and reform our economy. </para><para>The government will continue to vigorously advocate genuine trade liberalisation. Securing additional market access through WTO and bilateral trade agreements will be a high priority. The government will continue to explore the prospects of achieving a free trade agreement with the United States. This will be very difficult but, if such an outcome can be realised, the benefits for Australia will be significant.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A thriving business sector</inline></para><para>At home, competitive, well-functioning markets, supported by good regulatory frameworks, encourage economic growth. </para><para>The proposed review of the competition provisions of the Trade Practices Act, and their administration, will examine whether they adequately encourage growth and international competitiveness, protect the balance of power between small and large business and support the growth of regional business.</para><para>Attracting overseas direct investment to Australia will also be an important activity of government. The government will continue to develop strategies to promote and attract investment, promote new venture capital arrangements and focus efforts in sectors of high growth potential, such as information and communications technology.</para><para>The government will consider appropriate changes to current foreign ownership and control of Australian media laws and the cross media rules, aimed at opening up the broadcasting sector to new investment while ensuring continued diversity of opinion.</para><para>The government will continue to pursue reforms that deliver an efficient, cost competitive energy sector. This will include an improved national energy market for both electricity and gas. The government will also actively promote the responsible development and export of our abundant minerals and energy resources.</para><para>The government will also undertake a review of the current governance arrangements for statutory authorities and office holders. The government will focus on improving their structures and practices, particularly of those authorities that impact upon the business community, to ensure more efficient and effective operations and the highest standards of accountability.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Families</inline></para><para>Policies that support families and provide them with effective opportunities and choices are crucial to Australia's economic and social future. The government will continue to provide practical assistance to families in their day to day needs and in support of their longer term aspirations.</para><para>The government will take early legislative steps to implement its election promise to introduce a First Child Tax Refund, recognising the loss of family income that generally results from the arrival of a first child. Tax initiatives aimed at improving Australia's superannuation system and securing family income throughout retirement will also be priorities.</para><para>The government remains committed to supporting the right of parents to choose the type of education that best suits the needs of their children and to quality schooling for all Australians. In particular, it will maintain its strong emphasis on literacy and numeracy for all young Australians, including indigenous children. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Choice and access in health care</inline></para><para>The government will continue its commitment to improving choice and access to high quality health care for all Australians regardless of their personal circumstances. </para><para>Australia's world-class public Medicare system will continue to provide access for all to high quality health care, complemented by a vibrant private health sector. This mix of public and private health provision means that Australia's health system will be viable in the long term and able to adapt to our nation's changing needs.</para><para>In its third term, the government will negotiate new Australian Health Care Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories. The aim of the Agreements will be to achieve improvements for people who use public hospitals to ensure that they receive appropriate treatment in a timely and responsive way.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Welfare Reform</inline></para><para>Welfare reform remains a key focus of this government. It believes all Australians should have the opportunity to become more self-reliant and attain higher standards of living for themselves and their families.</para><para>The government's commitment to welfare reform is expressed through the <inline font-style="italic">Australians Working Together</inline> package. Using Centrelink as a gateway, this package will provide increased assistance and improved incentives for people on welfare to get paid work, at a cost of $1.7 billion over four years. </para><para>The government will maintain a strong social security safety net and increase opportunities for people with disabilities wishing to work to their fullest potential.</para><para>In addition, Work for the Dole will remain a vital element of Australia's new active welfare system. The government will strengthen Mutual Obligation arrangements to focus on what people can do, rather than what they cannot.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Flexibility and reward in the workplace</inline></para><para>The government considers that further workplace reform is essential to deliver higher living standards and create more jobs.</para><para>In the first weeks of parliament, the government will introduce bills to ban compulsory union fees, ensure secret ballots before strikes, prevent one-size-fits-all industry bargaining and establish fair dismissal procedures. The Autumn sittings will also include the introduction of bills to improve protection for workers in Victoria, ensure more democratic and accountable unions and employer organisations, and give more workers a say on workplace safety issues. </para><para>The government will also provide an effective safety net of minimum wages and conditions that can be relied upon by low paid employees whilst contributing to workplace bargaining above that safety net. The government will consult further about ways to give employees priority over secured creditors in the event of company failures. It will also work with employers to extend opportunities for workers to more effectively balance their family and workplace responsibilities.</para><para>In its third term, the government will give particular attention to addressing the challenges of an ageing population through helping mature aged people remain in and/or get back into work.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Innovation, technology and higher education</inline></para><para>Recognising the vital link between science and business in building a prosperous future, an important focus for the new Education, Science and Training portfolio will be the continuing implementation of <inline font-style="italic">Backing Australia's Ability</inline>, which commits an extra $3 billion to supporting research, commercialisation and skills development. As part of this effort, the government has initiated a process to develop national research priorities to assist and guide research funding decisions across a range of government funded research programmes. The government expects to announce these national research priorities towards the end of this year. </para><para>The government understands that the higher education sector is critical to maintaining Australia's international competitiveness, economic prosperity and cultural development. It will work with universities, the business sector and the broader community to ensure that its policies enhance the quality of teaching and encourage universities to develop their particular teaching and research strengths and areas of specialisation.  </para><para>In today's global economy, knowledge and skills development provide the essential platform for business competitiveness and community prosperity. In the time that the government has been in office, the number of people undertaking new apprenticeships has more than doubled from about 143,000 to an estimated 330,040 in September 2001. The government's support for vocational education and training will be further strengthened in its third term.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">A stronger country Australia</inline></para><para>This will be a government committed to creating greater opportunities for country Australia.</para><para>An important priority for the government is to help improve the profitability and competitiveness of Australia's rural industries. A strong, vibrant primary sector will not only create jobs and earn this country valuable export income, but will also help revitalise many rural and regional communities across Australia.</para><para>The government will continue to improve the transport system, an important social and economic issue for country Australia. It will maintain its commitment to national highways and roads of national importance and seek further progress in rail reform.</para><para>Domestic and international aviation will be reviewed, to ensure that the government's approach to competition and regulation recognises the major changes in the aviation operating environment. Australia will also participate in international efforts to strengthen aviation security.</para><para>The government remains committed to ensuring adequate levels of telecommunications services across regional, rural and remote Australia. It will build on the significant improvements achieved through the <inline font-style="italic">Networking the Nation</inline> programme and other Social Bonus initiatives. These programmes, combined with the $163 million response to the Telecommunications Service Inquiry, will mean that almost $1 billion will have been spent on improving regional communications services over the life of the government. In response to the Telecommunications Service Inquiry, the government is also introducing further enhancements to the regulatory safety net, achieved through the Universal Service Obligation and the Customer Service Guarantee, to ensure that all Australians have timely, affordable and reliable access to basic telecommunications services.</para><para>The government's programme of telecommunications sector reform has encouraged greater competition and given Australians access to a wide range of high quality, innovative and low cost telecommunications services. The government's priority is to ensure more services for rural and regional Australia.</para><para>The government will not proceed with any further sale of Telstra until it is satisfied that arrangements are in place to deliver adequate services to all Australians.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Our citizens</inline></para><para>The government recognises the special place indigenous people occupy in our society as the original inhabitants of Australia and will continue to implement its practical reconciliation agenda, sustaining its focus on tackling disadvantage in the key areas of education, employment, health and housing.</para><para>These important endeavours will be pursued in partnership with indigenous people. Our joint goals should be to improve outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. </para><para>The government will continue an immigration programme that places a strong emphasis on attracting people with skills. Australia will also continue to be one of the very few nations in the world to maintain a refugee programme.</para><para>Whilst continuing to work for solutions that give help to those most desperately in need, the government is committed to following the fundamental principle, accepted in international law, that Australia alone has the sovereign right to determine who is allowed entry. </para><para>Australia will continue to seek effective co-operation with nations in our region to combat people smuggling. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Protecting the environment</inline></para><para>A whole of government approach to sustainable environment issues is to be one of the highest priorities in the government's third term. To this end, the government has established a new Sustainable Environment Committee of Cabinet, chaired by the Prime Minister.</para><para>Immediate action to tackle salinity and water quality problems is essential and, for this reason, the Commonwealth, state and territory governments will jointly invest $1.4 billion over seven years under the National Action Plan for Salinity and Water Quality. The Plan will target some of Australia's worst affected areas and will support action by regional communities and local landholders. The Plan will be complemented by the extension of Australia's largest ever environmental rescue effort, the Natural Heritage Trust.</para><para>The government's ongoing funding package of $1 billion over five years for greenhouse gas abatement is among the largest by any government in the world. These funds are assisting to develop strong government-industry and government-community partnerships that are beginning to reduce the rate of greenhouse gas emissions. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>Honourable Senators and Members, in the pursuit of success in all areas of national endeavour, the government will maintain its characteristic pragmatism, drive and determination. It will seek to defend all that is best within Australian society today whilst initiating the bold reform necessary for a prosperous and secure future.</para><para>Its overarching goal will be to better the lives of all Australians, wherever they may live and whatever their own aspirations may be.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">His Excellency the Governor-General and members of the House of Representatives retired.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 3.41 p.m. to 5 p.m.</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The PRESIDENT</inline> took the chair at 5 p.m., and read prayers.</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>GOVERNOR-GENERAL'S SPEECH</title><type>Governor-General's Speech</type><page.no>7</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—I inform the Senate that I have received a copy of the opening speech which His Excellency the Governor-General was pleased to deliver to both houses of the parliament.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that consideration of the Governor-General's opening speech be made an order of the day for the next day of sitting.</para></interjection></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>MINISTERIAL ARRANGEMENTS</title><type>Ministerial Arrangements</type><page.no>7</page.no></debateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>7</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I have the honour to inform the Senate that, following the election held on 10 November 2001 in which the coalition was returned, the Governor-General commissioned the Prime Minister, Mr Howard, to form a government.

follows—</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">GOVERNMENT RESPONSE TO THE SENATE COMMUNITY AFFAIRS REFERENCES COMMITTEE REPORT ON PUBLIC HOSPITAL FUNDING “HEALING OUR HOSPITALS”</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">COMMONWEALTH DEPARTMENT OF HEALTH AND AGED CARE</inline></para><para>September 2001</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">INTRODUCTION</inline></para><para>Australians are well served by a public hospital system that provides universal access to high quality care on the basis of clinical need and regardless of geographic location. This reality led the Senate Committee to conclude that neither the Australian health system, nor the public hospital system, are in or face a crisis. 1</para><para>The Commonwealth's commitment to the nation's public hospitals is reflected in the Australian Health Care Agreements (AHCAs). Although Australia's public hospital funding arrangements are complex and reflect our unique cultural and institutional background, the Agreements are at the core of the successful national framework that is Medicare. </para><para>The Howard Government's commitment to the public hospital system is evident at three levels. </para><para>Firstly, under the current AHCAs negotiated by the Coalition Government in 1998, the Commonwealth has made significant real increases in funding to the States and Territories to run the nation's public hospitals. These funding increases greatly exceed the growth provided by the previous Labor Government under the 1993-1998 Medicare Agreements.</para><para>Secondly, the Coalition Government has restored the balance to Australia's health system through the 30% Rebate, Lifetime Health Cover and measures to `Close the Gap', which give Australians greater choice in their health care. </para><para>Thirdly, beyond generous real funding increases and more of a balance between the public and private hospital sectors, the nation's public hospitals also benefit from the Government's decision not to enforce the original Agreement strictly as worded, whereby the Commonwealth's contribution would have been reduced as private health insurance participation increased significantly to current levels. Over the last three years of the Agreements, this would have entitled the Commonwealth to reduce hospital funding to the States and Territories by almost $3 billion. The Government has chosen not to do so.</para><para>In this combined sense, the Commonwealth's contribution to the nation's public hospitals is unprecedented. </para><para>Notwithstanding this funding position, there is an ongoing requirement to find ways to improve the capacity of the health system to respond to patient needs. Things can always be done better and, working with the States, Territories and the Australian community, the Government is committed to ongoing improvement of the quality and accessibility of public acute care and related services.</para><para>Such commitments should not be trivialised by partisan politics. Genuine consideration of these issues should be welcomed by any Government, but using parliamentary processes for short-term political advantage rather than genuine debate on policy directions can often be unwise. The Government therefore hopes that although the Committee's inquiry was established by the Senate with short-term political motives in mind, it nevertheless becomes a stepping-off point for positive dialogue on hospital funding matters between those with a genuine interest in Australians' health care needs.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">RECOMMENDATIONS OF THE REPORT</inline></para><para>Recommendation 1: That, as a short term measure, the Commonwealth provide additional funding under the Australian Health Care Agreements, in line with the recommendations of the independent arbiter. This funding should ideally be provided for the remaining two years of the agreements, 2001-02 and 2002-03. On the basis of data available to the Committee, this funding would be of the order of $450 million over the two years. </para><para>The Commonwealth remains committed to the nation's public hospital system, which is the flagship of Medicare.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>It is therefore already making funding commitments under the Australian Health Care Agreements that exceed its strict responsibilities in terms of the provisions of the Agreements themselves.</para><para>Australia's public hospitals will benefit significantly from the Government's unilateral decision not to claw back funding as private health insurance participation has increased.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>As part of the Lifetime Health Cover arrangements, the Commonwealth agreed to modify the AHCA arrangements for recovering funds from the States and Territories due to increases in private health insurance participation.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The effect of this is that the Commonwealth has chosen not to exercise its formal recovery options under the AHCAs in line with the strict interpretation of the Agreements.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>Consequently, about $3 billion will be effectively retained by the States and Territories over the last three years of the Agreementsfunds which would otherwise have been clawed back under conditions on which they signed in 1998.</para><para>Beyond this decision, the nation's public hospitals also benefit from generous real increases in Commonwealth funding.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Over the life of the 1998-2003 AHCAs, it is currently estimated that the Commonwealth will pay around $31.6 billion to the States and Territories to assist with the provision of public hospital services. The AHCAs provide a real increase in financial assistance to the States and Territories of around 28 per cent, compared with the 17 per cent real increase of the 1993-98 Medicare Agreements negotiated by the Keating Government.</para><para>The Commonwealth therefore is more than meeting its funding obligations to public hospitals.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>It sees this commitment as no less important a part of its overall contribution to financing the health care of the Australian community as its commitments to Medicare, the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and its support to patient flexibility and choice through private health insurance.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2: That the provision of this additional funding by the</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Commonwealth should be linked to a commitment by each State and Territory to publicly report their total spending on public hospitals and to match the percentage increase in Commonwealth funding over the two years.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth welcomes this recommendation.</para><para>The Australian Health Care Agreements lay down the size and scope of the Commonwealth's commitment to provide Health Care Grants to help fund public hospital services.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Since 1998, much of the funding debate has centred on the Commonwealth's funding contribution, while the States and Territories have largely escaped scrutiny. </para><para>Nevertheless, the Commonwealth stands by its performance, and does not dispute the need for the Agreements to define its funding commitments in terms of funding formulas and weighted population variables.</para><para>As noted in the response to Recommendation 1, by not applying the original clawback arrangements the States and Territories will receive an extra $3 billion more over the final three years of the Agreements than they would otherwise have been entitled.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The response of the States and Territories is to accept this unilateral decision, without acknowledgment that this is a voluntary gesture by which the Commonwealth has foregone its entitlements.</para><para>The Commonwealth would not disagree that the time has come for the States and Territories to consider making the same public obligations to fund their public hospital services that the Commonwealth willingly accepts under the Agreements.</para><para>The Government therefore considers that State and Territory governments should report publicly their own source contributions in a nationally consistent form, and that this commitment could be incorporated in future funding arrangements between the Commonwealth, States and Territories.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Additionally, and as recommended by the Minority Report, the States and Territories should be expected to match the rate of growth in Commonwealth funding, including over the remaining years of the current Agreements.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>This would be beyond the scope of the strict Agreement framework, but it would be no less a positive recognition of the value of public hospitals as the Commonwealth's own decision to forego its clawback rights.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 3: That negotiations on the next Australian Health Care Agreements between the Commonwealth and the States and Territories commence as soon as is practicable.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">To provide a framework for discussion, each State and Territory should prepare a health needs and priorities plan setting out the necessary funding for the period of the next Agreement.</inline></para><para>The Government notes the principle of this recommendation, although the Government believes that there is no single right time to start formal negotiation arrangements that will succeed the current Agreements.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The development of broad policy in relation to negotiating the next round of Agreements is an ongoing process and, as highlighted in the Committee's report and elsewhere, involves governments' consideration of complex care planning, delivery and funding issues.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Beyond this, the timing and commencement of actual negotiations between the parties will need to be as flexible as possible to meet the</para><para>interests of both the wider Australian community and of the negotiating governments.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>As June 2003 approaches, each government will be considering its position on public hospital funding in general and arrangements succeeding the current Agreements in particular.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>They no doubt will be exploring these positions in and out of formal negotiation processes, whenever these begin.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 4: That these new Agreements should progress beyond the scope of the current agreements and encompass other health services, including the Medicare Benefits Scheme, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, community health services and aged care.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Consideration should be given also to the inclusion of funding for public health programs following the expiry of the current Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">The inclusion of funding for most health programs should enhance flexibility, enable greater transparency and promote care across the continuum.</inline></para><para>The Government does not support the specific recommendation that the new funding arrangements necessarily extend to other health services covered by the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS), Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme and aged care.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>These are Commonwealth programs and areas for which the States and Territories have no funding responsibility.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Government also notes, from evidence to the Committee itself, that there seems to be little enthusiasm at the State or Territory level for accepting any direct responsibility for open-ended programs such as the MBS and PBS. </para><para>The Government therefore does not support the notion that the new Agreements necessarily include funding for public health programs following the expiry of the current Public Health Outcome Funding Agreements (PHOFAs).<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Funding under the PHOFAs is essentially a contribution to eight specific public health programs.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>This funding is a small but critical investment in areas that lead to long term improvements in the health of all Australians.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Funding under the PHOFAs is equivalent to approximately three per cent of Health Care Grants.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>It is important that this funding is not subject to the pressures of the acute care sector.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>If this funding were to be included in broader agreements, there could be some risk that public health funding would become less transparent and secure by being absorbed in hospitals' budgets.</para><para>However, scope does exist for the Agreements or similar arrangements to be adapted in the future to meet changing community needs and care trends, particularly in relation to better linkages and care coordination across acute and other health care settings.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Care needs and delivery arrangements evolve continuously: funding mechanisms, including those like the Australian Health Care Agreements, need to be sufficiently flexible to evolve with them.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 5: The Committee recognises that funding for additional patient care is necessarily the first priority of the States and Territories.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">However, the Committee recommends that each jurisdiction give urgent consideration to the immediate upgrading of their IT infrastructure to enable improved collection of data on hospital performance, particularly in relation to patient outcomes.</inline></para><para>In terms of public hospitals, the States and Territories have funding and management</para><para>responsibilities for capital and supporting infrastructure, while the Commonwealth's responsibility is overwhelmingly limited to funding services through the AHCAs. Matters relating to public hospital management and associated IT systems fall wholly within State and Territory responsibilities.</para><para>On the other hand, the National Health Development Fund (NHDF) and the National Demonstration Hospitals Program (NDHP) are two Commonwealth-funded initiatives that illustrate the Government's commitment to enhancing and expanding best practice within public hospitals.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The NHDF is funded through the AHCAs, with the Commonwealth providing over $250 million over the life of the Agreements to provide States and Territories with a separate source of funding to promote health system restructuring. </para><para>The third phase of the NDHP was completed in 2001. This phase identified innovative models that improve the quality, coordination and integration of all services provided by the hospital sector, including models that provide effective two-way links between hospitals and community providers. The success of the NDHP in identifying and promoting new approaches to hospital-based care has resulted in the Government's decision to extend the program for a fourth phase until June 2003. Projects funded under the extension of the NDHP could include specific data improvement initiatives which assist clinicians in better meeting patient needs.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 6: That the Commonwealth address several other priorities that have emerged during this inquiry.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">These include the need for strategies to better meet the needs of older patients by increasing the availability of more appropriate care arrangements at home or in residential aged care accommodation and thereby decreasing reliance on acute public hospital beds for these patients.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">Also identified as priorities are the need for increased resources for emergency departments of public hospitals and the national shortage of nurses.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth is working with States and Territories through the Australian Health Ministers' Advisory Council (AHMAC) to consider the care of older people in hospitals. A collaborative workplan has been agreed to, which includes: </para><para>·	a stocktake of current care options and levels of provision in each State and Territory; </para><para>·	the identification of models which can be piloted to improve care; </para><para>·	assessment of the influence of availability of alternative forms of care on patterns of service use; and </para><para>·	examination of current assessment practices for establishing needs for care, type of care required and care delivery setting so that frail older people will get the care they need.</para><para>The specific resource requirements of emergency departments and the size of the nursing workforce fall within the responsibilities of the States and Territories.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The current National Review of Nursing Education being conducted by the Commonwealth is broadly examining nursing education and training issues.</para><para>Recommendation 7: That the Commonwealth, in conjunction with the States and Territories, find ways and means to maintain and sustain teaching and research in public hospitals. </para><para>The Commonwealth recognises the importance of public hospitals as venues for essential teaching and research.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Skilled and trained health professionals are the backbone of public hospital service provision, and a key to the ongoing promotion of quality and safety improvements in acute care.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>These issues are also recognised as important by State and Territory governments that manage and run teaching hospitals.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The training role is additionally a key to hospitals attracting and retaining high calibre professional staff. This is therefore a complex and broad issue involving national dialogue and coordination, which is best provided by the Australian Health Ministers' Conference.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8: The Committee notes the Australian Health Ministers' recent agreement to improve the links between hospital and community based care.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee recommends that the Commonwealth and the States and Territories consider the inclusion of all stakeholders in the early implementation of this proposal.</inline></para><para>Under the Australian Health Ministers' Conference decision, the Commonwealth, States and Territories are already working with key stakeholders to consider and design improvements to the hospital and community care interface.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Government welcomes this positive and cooperative approach. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 9: The Committee recommends the establishment of a National Advisory Council which brings together the major players in the health sector and provides them with a voice in the formulation and development of new Commonwealth-State health funding agreements.</inline></para><para>The Australian Health Care Agreements are agreements between the Commonwealth and State and Territory governments, which together fund the public hospital system.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Government does not believe there is a need for another consultative body to participate in the formulation and development of these agreements.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Governments should consult and listen to stakeholders in every aspect of their health policy involvement, both in and out of formal structures, before taking final responsibility for their decisions.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Successive Commonwealth governments have certainly applied this approach.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10: That the new Agreements be a vehicle for the introduction of transparent financial reporting by all parties to the agreements.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">The agreements should provide for annual reporting of the financial commitment by each jurisdiction in each area of patient care covered by the agreements.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">The emphasis of this financial reporting should be on transparency rather than obfuscation, which characterises much of the reporting at present. </inline></para><para>A productive and constructive relationship between the Commonwealth, States and Territories depends on appropriate information sharing and exchange.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Nevertheless, the dynamics of Commonwealth-State relations are sometimes a disincentive to information sharing.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>It is important that, in the public interest, there is more </para><para>consistent financial reporting on Agreement-related activities, just as there is output-based performance reporting.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Government therefore supports this recommendation.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 11: That the Commonwealth Minister for Health and Aged Care discuss with his State and Territory counterparts an amendment to the performance reporting requirements of the Australian Health Care Agreements with a view to requiring each State and the Northern Territory to report on the number of patients assisted for travel for essential public hospital services and the average expenditure per patient so assisted.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth Isolated Patients Travel and Accommodation Assistance Scheme was abolished in the 1986-87 Budget and sole responsibility for the management of such schemes was transferred to the States and Territories. It is not a matter covered by AHCA arrangements. As such, reporting on performance in this area is a matter for the States and Territories. </para><para>It is important that adequate, consistent data collection and reporting methods are present in all areas of health services provision, including patient travel assistance. The Commonwealth is therefore committed to promoting and encouraging good data management processes in this and other areas through appropriate forums, while noting the States' and Territories' direct responsibilities in this area.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 12: That after the first such report that includes data on patient assisted travel, if a substantial degree of variance is apparent between jurisdictions, that the Senate consider referring the funding and administration of patient assisted travel schemes to the Committee for inquiry.</inline></para><para>This is a matter for the Senate.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Government would not, however, support such a reference being given to the Committee because it would be inquiring into a matter of State and Territory jurisdiction.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 13: That the Australian Health Ministers' Conference examine the option of combining the funding sources for health programs which currently separately draw funds from State and Commonwealth sources.</inline></para><para>Along with the States and Territories, the Commonwealth is committed to exploring new models of funding and service delivery with the potential to improve standards of patient care. Recent examples of this commitment include developing the second round of Coordinated Care Trials.</para><para>Although the issue of funds pooling received considerable attention by the Committee, particularly through the roundtables convened in August and November 2000, it remains only one of a range of policy options to address the challenges of better integrating service planning, provision and delivery with funding structures.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 14: That the Commonwealth advance the integration of payments for pharmaceuticals in public hospitals by establishing trials with at least one public hospital in each State and Territory, to enable different models to be tested.</inline></para><para>The Commonwealth is continuing to advance this option with the States and Territories in relation to discharge pharmaceutical arrangements. This possibility is provided for under Clause 35 of the Agreements.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Clause 35 recognises that the existing arrangements, whereby pharmaceuticals are subsidised by the </para><para>Commonwealth through the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme for community patients and by the States for public hospital patients, have the potential to lead to inequities in the range of drugs available in each sector and perverse incentives for cost-shifting between the States and the Commonwealth.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>One jurisdiction, Victoria, is well advanced in negotiating an arrangement with the Commonwealth. Other jurisdictions have expressed an interest.</para><para>The participation of the States and Territories in Clause 35 arrangements is encouraged by the Commonwealth because it promotes patient-centred reform. This process may well be the forerunner of future reform and innovation in funding arrangements. Nevertheless, it is important to let these arrangements operate and be evaluated before judgments are made.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 15: That all such projects be subject to independent assessment and public reporting in order for the lessons learnt to be transferred to a wider stage.</inline></para><para>While acknowledging the intention of this recommendation, the Government notes that this is a matter that would need to be agreed to by the Commonwealth and those States and Territories that participate in Clause 35 arrangements.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>It could be expected that performances under these arrangements will be monitored and evaluated.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 16: That Health Ministers give urgent consideration to the development of a national health policy, informed by community consultation, that offers an overarching articulation of the values of the Australian health system and that provides a framework for linking all of its component parts.</inline></para><para>Medicare is at the core of Australia's national health policy and is informed by community values and a broad national consensus.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Strongly supported by the Government, Medicare is a successful national framework, providing all Australians with high quality health care that is equitable, affordable and accessible.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Australian Health Care Agreements, and their fundamental principles of public patient access to public hospital services, form part of this national Medicare framework.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>By signing those Agreements, States and Territories accept a commitment to the underlying national policy goals and principles that they represent.</para><para>The Government is itself committed to ensuring that the Commonwealth leads the further development of national health policies and promotes those that exist in areas as diverse as mental health and injury prevention, as well as universal access to health services. Nevertheless, the States and Territories already have clearly articulated funding and service delivery responsibilities: it is important that these are respected in planning and delivering policy outcomes, nor that the freedom of sovereign Commonwealth, State and Territory governments to determine policies in their areas of jurisdiction are not restricted unduly.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 17: That Commonwealth, State and Territory Health Ministers commence a process of community consultation on health care issues, such as the values that should inform the development of a national health policy.</inline></para><para>The Government supports the principles of consultation and community engagement implied by this recommendation.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>As noted in respect of Recommendation 9, the Government already consults and listens extensively to stakeholders and the community in developing health policy and programs.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 18: That the Department of Health and Aged Care commission research on the `hospital of the future' to examine alternative models for acute care and options for managing demand on hospitals for in-patient and out-patient services.</inline></para><para>The Government appreciates the intent of this recommendation.</para><para>The Department of Health and Aged Care supports innovation in acute care service delivery through the National Demonstration Hospitals Program, which provides funding for hospital-based projects. The three phases of the program have achieved impressive outcomes in relation to waiting times for elective surgery, integrated bed management, and integration across the continuum of acute and primary care.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>Building on this success, the 2001-02 Budget provides an additional two years' funding for innovative hospital-based projects to improve the quality of patient care and encourage the transfer of best practice in care delivery, including linkages between regional and rural hospitals and leading metropolitan hospitals.</para><para>The Government also notes that over and above and such programs, and other research that may be commissioned, there is already a great body of research and literature in Australia and overseas reflecting on all aspects current and future hospital activity, and health care delivery.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>This body of expertise and advice is available to Commonwealth, State and Territory governments, policy-makers and other stakeholders.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 19: That Health Ministers ensure that the additional Coordinated Care Trials be designed to include adequate and appropriate data for collection and analysis to enable informed conclusions about the effectiveness of these trials.</inline></para><para>The Government agrees with this recommendation, and notes that it has already effectively been implemented. The evaluation of the second round of Coordinated Care Trials is being designed in consultation with, and to meet the needs of, all relevant stakeholders, including Commonwealth, State and Territory Governments. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 20: That the Federal Government confirm its statement that no funds will be withdrawn from public hospitals through use of the `clawback arrangements' in the Australian Health Care Agreements.</inline></para><para>As highlighted in response to Recommendation 1, the Government is honouring the undertaking the Minister for Health and Aged Care made to Senator Lees in September 1999.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The result is that, in terms of the clawback provisions of the Australian Health Care Agreements, the States and Territories effectively will retain around $3 billion in funding that is rightfully due to the Commonwealth under the strict terms of the Agreements. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 21: That the health insurance industry takes urgent steps to adequately inform their new members about the features of the policies they have sold.</inline><inline font-weight="bold">There is currently a high level of confusion in the community about the extent of coverage, waiting periods, the rules on pre-existing ailments and the limitations on cover for many products.</inline></para><para>The Government agrees that consumers should have reliable information about private health insurance products and their benefit entitlements.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The Government has implemented several initiatives to ensure that health fund members have access to such information.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>These include requirements that health funds notify members in plain English of changes to their policies and that, in respect of both the 30% Rebate and Lifetime Health Cover, annual statements be provided stipulating entitlements and levels of cover.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The first of these Lifetime Health Cover statements are in the process of being issued to members by private health insurance funds.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>Hospitals and health funds are also working together to institute systems to confirm health fund members' benefit entitlements for hospital treatment prior to admission.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 22: That the health insurance industry take urgent steps in relation to providing wider availability of gap free products so that a large proportion of their members can access medical services on this basis.</inline></para><para>In the course of the passage of the Private Health Insurance Incentives Act 1998, measures were introduced requiring health funds to offer at least one no or known gap policy by 1 July 2000 in order to continue to offer the 30% Rebate as a premium reduction.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>By this time, 43 of the 44 health funds had met this requirement. </para><para>As a further way to promote flexibility in the provision of gap free products, the Government introduced additional legislative reforms enabling health funds to develop gap cover schemes that enable them to pay doctors above the MBS schedule fee without the need for contracts.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Gap cover schemes under these new arrangements have been approved for 33 health funds, which represent approximately 80 per cent of the national market.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>It is understood that other funds are developing proposals.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 23: That independent research be commissioned by the Department of Health and Aged Care to examine the strengths and weaknesses of current examples of co-location and cooperative sharing of resources between nearby public and private hospitals.</inline></para><para>The administration of the public hospital system, including their siting and co-location with private hospitals, is a matter for State and Territory governments.

AND TORRES STRAIT ISLANDER LAND FUND: `CERD AND THE NATIVE TITLE AMENDMENT ACT 1998'</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Government Response</inline></para><para>On 18 March 1999 the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (the CERD Committee) at its fifty-fourth session, published its decision 2(54) on Australia, in which it expressed concern about `the compatibility of the Native Title Act, as currently amended' with Australia's obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination (the CERD).1<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The central obligation on a member State under the CERD is to prohibit and eliminate racial discrimination, and to ensure that its citizens enjoy their fundamental human rights.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The CERD Committee queried Australia's discharge of this obligation in relation to the protection of the rights of indigenous Australians to own and inherit property.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The CERD Committee also expressed concern at the `lack of effective participation by indigenous communities in the formulation of the amendments' to the original <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Act 1993</inline> (NTA), and the apparent absence of the informed consent of indigenous people to the amendments.2</para><para>On 9 December 1999 the Senate referred the findings of the CERD Committee to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund (the Committee) for inquiry and report.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The report of the majority Government members of the Committee (the Committee report), together with a report prepared by the minority non-Government members of the Committee (the minority report) was tabled in Parliament on 28 June 2000.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Committee's Report</inline></para><para>The Government welcomes and endorses the Committee's report.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The report concluded that the NTA as amended by the <inline font-style="italic">Native Title Amendment Act 1998</inline> `is consistent with Australia's international obligations and, in particular, its obligations under the International Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination'.3<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>In arriving at this conclusion the Committee gave careful consideration to the CERD Committee's findings, and both the original and the amended NTA.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Committee also considered international jurisprudence on the principle of equality at international law. </para><para>Importantly, the Committee report confirmed that, at international law, States have a `margin of appreciation' in their implementation of their international obligations.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The margin of appreciation refers to the discretion that States have to determine how to implement their treaty obligations.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>This discretion exists in recognition of the fact that `States are in the best position to determine the appropriate measures required to implement treaty obligations and to balance competing interests within their jurisdictions'.4 </para><para>In the case of the NTA the Committee report noted `... that [a]mong lawmakers, indigenous and non-indigenous interests there was general consensus that the [original] Native Title Act needed to be amended', although opinions differed as to the extent of the amendments that were required.5<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Amendments to the NTA were necessary to address, amongst other things, the effect of certain court decisions since 1993 which had an adverse effect on the efficacy of the original Act.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>These decisions included most notably the High Court decisions in <inline font-style="italic">Brandy v Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</inline> (1995) 183 CLR 245, <inline font-style="italic">North Ganalanja Aboriginal Corporation v Queensland</inline> (1996) 185 CLR 595 and <inline font-style="italic">Wik Peoples v Queensland</inline> (1996) 187 CLR 1, and the Federal Court decisions in <inline font-style="italic">Northern Territory v Lane</inline> 1995) 138 ALR 294. Amendments were also necessary to provide a better framework for binding agreements within the provisions of the NTA.</para><para>The CERD Committee described the original NTA as `delicately balanced between the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous title holders'.6<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Committee report confirmed that the amended NTA also achieved an appropriate and equitable balance between the protection of the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous Australians.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Further, the report noted that the amended NTA also provides indigenous interest holders with many beneficial measures `designed to take account of the special nature of native title', which are not generally available to non-indigenous interest holders.7<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The Committee report concluded that the CERD Committee, in reaching its decision, did not take into account the significant additional benefits provided to indigenous people by the amended NTA.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>This omission, the Committee argued, was indicative of a fundamental flaw in the CERD Committee's approach to assessing the amended NTA.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Committee report noted that:</para><para>An assessment of whether our native title legislation is discriminatory cannot be made without regard to the position of other land holders in Australia.8<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>Accordingly, the Committee identified the correct approach as being to ask whether the amended NTA as a whole provides the interests of indigenous people with a level of protection that is equivalent to the protection provided to comparable non-indigenous interests under Australian law. The CERD Committee did not consider this question.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Committee report found that:</para><para>The amended Native Title Act strikes a balance between native title interests and other interests.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>It provides protection to native title that is at least the equivalent of the protection provided to comparable non-Indigenous interests, and provides significant benefits to native title holders which non-Indigenous title holders do not enjoy.9</para><para>In its decision 2(54), the CERD Committee appeared to suggest that the CERD requires the informed consent of indigenous people to any decision affecting their rights.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The CERD Committee's decision also suggested that there had been a lack of `effective participation' by indigenous people in the formulation of the amendments to the NTA. 10 The Committee report found that international law does not require States to obtain the informed consent of groups that are affected by measures, before such measures are implemented, rather it is for Parliament to decide whether and what measures are necessary and appropriate.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>However, the Committee report noted the fact that indigenous people participated in both the extended period of public consultation, and the parliamentary consideration given during the process of amending the NTA.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Committee report concluded that:</para><para>... to the extent that Article 5(c) of the CERD may require equality in relation to effective participation in public affairs, indigenous Australians did have that right.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>They not only participated in the extensive public policy development process that went on, and the lengthy parliamentary process, but had a significant input into that outcome. 11</para><para>The Committee report confirmed that the 1998 amendments to the NTA accord with Australia's international obligations and, in particular, the obligations arising under the CERD. The findings of the report confirm that, in amending the NTA, the Australian Government continues its commitment to the principles of justice and equity, which are expressed in the preamble to the Act.  </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The Minority Report</inline></para><para>The non-Government members of the Committee found that the NTA as amended conflicts with Australia's international legal obligations, and recommended amendments to `the substantive and procedural provisions to render the legislation non-discriminatory and consistent with Australia's international obligations'.12 The Government does not accept the conclusion reached by the non-Government members of the Committee.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The NTA was amended to deal with problems that arose in the operation of the original Act subsequent to its enactment in 1993.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>In amending the Act, the Government has acted within its margin of appreciation and has achieved an equitable balance between the rights of indigenous and non-indigenous interest holders.</para><para>The minority report made a total of 10 recommendations (<inline font-weight="bold">Appendix</inline>).<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Government does not accept any of the recommendations. In particular, the Government rejects recommendations 3-7 on the basis of the findings contained in the Committee report. </para><para>The Government specifically responds to recommendations 1, 2, 8, 9 and 10 of the minority report as follows:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 1</inline></para><para>In the light of evidence presented to this Committee, the non-Government members find, and recommend that the Government acknowledge, that the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (the CERD Committee) is an expert and independent body, competent to receive and consider complaints regarding violations of rights protected under the Convention for the Elimination of All Forms of Racial Discrimination.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 2</inline></para><para>The non-Government members find, and recommend that the Government acknowledge, that individuals and groups in Australia had, and still have, the right to bring to the attention of the CERD Committee alleged violations of Australia's undertakings as a signatory to the CERD, such as those inherent in both the substance of the amended Native Title Act<inline font-style="italic"></inline>and in the process through which it was drafted.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 10</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The non-Government members of the Committee recommend that the Government, consistent with its obligation to protect Australia's international reputation, desist from any attacks on UN expert bodies, and renew positive dialogue with them on a range of matters, including Australia's native title legislation.</inline></para><para>The CERD provides for the establishment of a Committee `of eighteen experts of high moral standing and acknowledged impartiality'.13 The role of the CERD Committee is to monitor and assist member States with the implementation of the Convention, chiefly through its consideration of periodic reports submitted by States.</para><para>Under Article 14 of the Convention the CERD Committee can receive communications containing complaints against a State from individuals and groups within its jurisdiction, only where that State has made a declaration acknowledging the competence of the CERD Committee to receive and consider such communications.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Where a State has made such a declaration, communications from individuals/groups may be made to the CERD Committee only when available local remedies have been exhausted. Australia made a declaration to this effect on 28 January 1993 and the declaration remains in force. The Government observes that, to date, there has been no individual communication registered with the CERD committee under Article 14 regarding the effect of the amended NTA.</para><para>The Government accepts that the CERD Committee is intended to be an expert and independent body competent to monitor compliance with the Convention.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>However, the Government has already indicated its concern at what appears to be a political and partisan approach adopted by the CERD Committee in its consideration, in recent times, of Australia's compliance with the CERD.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>An indication of this partisan approach adopted by the CERD Committee is its reliance on the information provided by non-Government organisations in its assessments of Australia, its lack of analysis of the arguments put by the Australian Government, and its disregard of the information provided by the Australian Government on the significant range of policies and measures undertaken to address indigenous issues.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The partisan approach of the CERD Committee to its assessment of Australia is further underscored by the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee. The report has concluded, contrary to the conclusions reached by the CERD Committee, that the amendments to the NTA have not breached Australia's obligations under the Convention.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Further, the report has revealed that the CERD Committee did not apply principles of international law relevant to the Convention, such as the margin of appreciation.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The Australian Government is concerned that the approach taken by the CERD Committee can have the effect of compromising its intended role as an expert human rights treaty body.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Since 1996 the Australian Government has, through diplomatic channels, actively promoted reforms to the United Nations treaty body system in order to increase the effectiveness of bodies such as the CERD Committee. In addition, early last year the Australian Government announced a whole of Government review, aimed at improving Australia's interaction with the UN human rights treaty committees.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>As a result of that review, the Government announced in August 2000 a range of measures aimed at reforming the UN treaty body system and improving Australia's interaction with the system.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>These measures were supported in April 2001 by the announcement of Australia's high level diplomatic initiative; a long-term commitment aimed at practical, achievable benefits to the committee system and the cause of international human rights.</para><para>The Government does not accept the implication in recommendation 10 that it has been involved in attacking UN expert bodies.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The Australian Government considers its role in encouraging reform of the UN committee system an important part of its continuing commitment to international human rights obligations.</para><para>Concerns expressed by the Australian Government about the effectiveness and impartiality of the UN human rights treaty bodies, such as the CERD Committee, have been supported in a recently released report on the UN human rights treaty system.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The report entitled <inline font-style="italic">The UN Human Rights Treaty System: Universality at the Crossroads </inline>was prepared by Canadian academic Professor Anne Bayefsky, in collaboration with the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The report reviews the performance of human rights committees and depicts a system which is overburdened with national reporting, inefficiently structured with resultant duplication of effort, and often characterised by excessive focus on high-performing states and inconsistent treatment of different states.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>Importantly, the report also recognises the political bias in the concluding observations of committees (which provide an assessment of states).<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>This political bias was most evident in the concluding observations of the CERD Committee which, according to the report, demonstrate “differential depth of treatment of some states (in the absence of corresponding justification in terms of human rights conditions)” and include recommendations that are “ad-hoc and apparently driven by whatever external source spoke the loudest.”</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Recommendation 8</inline></para><para><inline font-weight="bold">The non-Government members acknowledge that native title, as recognised by Australian common law and as dealt with in statute, is capable of, and is vulnerable to, extinguishment. They contrast this with the fact that extant traditional title emerging from, and contained within, the laws and customs of Indigenous Australians remains for so long as those people and their beliefs survive. They therefore recommend that the Government enact legislation that recognises and respects that fact, irrespective of findings that courts may make from time to time.</inline></para><para>The Government does not accept recommendation 8 of the minority report.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The non-Government members appear to be advocating further legislation which would provide a more extensive recognition of traditional title than that already provided by the common law and the NTA, particularly in relation to the question of extinguishment of native title.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>The minority report provides no other indication of the extent of this proposed legislative recognition of traditional title or how it would inter-relate with non-indigenous interests.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>The High Court decision in <inline font-style="italic">Mabo v Queensland (No 2)</inline> (1992) 175 CLR 1 and subsequent decisions have established both the recognition of native title at common law, and that the grant or reservation of interests in land by the Crown could extinguish native title.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>As the Committee report concluded, the Native Title Act achieved a balance between the protection of indigenous interests from extinguishment at common law, and the protection of non-indigenous interests in land.

The NTA provides a framework for the resolution of native title issues through agreement whether resulting in a consent determination by the Federal Court or an Indigenous Land Use Agreement: it includes provisions which ensure that agreements reached will be binding and enforceable on all parties; and a National Native Title Tribunal is established to facilitate the negotiation of agreements.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline></para><para>Therefore the Government envisages that, pursuant to the NTA, there will be an increasing reliance on agreements between native title holders, governments and third party land users.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>In this way the NTA allows for agreements, negotiated over time to deal with native title issues throughout Australia.<inline font-weight="bold"></inline>However, the Government does not accept any implication in recommendation 9 that a treaty with indigenous people is necessary. The Government rejects the concept of a treaty as divisive and lacking the support of the majority of Australians.

He was educated at Geelong Grammar School until he entered the Royal Australian Naval College as a cadet at the age of 13.</para><para>David Hamer had a distinguished career in the Royal Australian Navy, serving as a gunnery officer on ships during World War II. There are many stories of his bravery. One that I will mention is about when he was serving in the Philippines on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline>, which was being dive-bombed by six Japanese Kamikaze dive-bombers. David stood up in the gun turret and broadcast to the ship's crew exactly what the Kamikaze pilots were doing as they attacked his ship, thus advising all around him of the danger and how they might respond. That is just one of many stories that are told of his bravery in service. For this distinguished command and leadership in action, he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross. He also served in Korea on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Tobruk</inline>, and later was the Director of Naval Intelligence and commander of the 10th destroyer flotilla. He retired from the Navy in 1967 with the rank of captain.</para><para>David Hamer was elected as the Liberal member for Isaacs in Victoria in 1969. He was defeated in the 1974 election and was re-elected in 1975. He retired from the House of Representatives in 1977. In that same year he was elected as a senator for Victoria and served as a senator until his retirement in 1990. He was a member of a number of parliamentary delegations and served on a number of parliamentary committees. He was Deputy President of the Senate and Chairman of Committees from April 1983 until his retirement. In his first speech in the House of Representatives he spoke of the need to develop Australian industry through capital investment, industrial relations and conservation of the environment. In fact, long before environmental activism became fashionable, David Hamer caused some public panic when he advocated the need for a standing royal commission on environmental pollution.</para><para>His time in the Senate will be remembered for his commitment to this institution and for the reformist role he played on the Procedure Committee and its predecessor to try to improve the operation of the Senate and enhance it in the public eye. Not long before his departure from this place, he played an active role in the establishment of the Selection of Bills Committee as a mechanism to refer more bills to the Senate committees for consideration. I particularly remember David Hamer in this place in his role as Deputy President and for the reforms he brought to the Senate. He was an effective and serious senator who believed that it was important that each and every individual senator made a contribution to the best of their ability.</para><para>David Hamer was also one of the more influential people on the Victorian arts scene as well as being a highly respected businessman. From 1970 until 1985 he served as President of the Australia Day Council, President of the Arts Council of Victoria, Federal President of the Arts Council of Australia and Chairman of the Australian Film Institute.</para><para>I remember him as a charming and dignified man and am particularly saddened by his departure. On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife Barbara; his children Richard, Fiona and Andrew; and other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>57</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate the opposition with this condolence motion, as moved by Senator Hill on behalf of the government, on the death of former Senator David Hamer DSC. I served with David Hamer for only a very short time in the Senate, but I certainly found him to be a good and effective Deputy President and Chairman of Committees. </para></talk.start><para>As Senator Hill said, David Hamer came to the Commonwealth parliament with a very distinguished naval career behind him. He entered the Royal Australian Naval College as a cadet at the age of 13 and finished his training as a junior officer at the time of the outbreak of World War II. He had a very distinguished career on <inline font-style="italic">Canberra</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Napier</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Norman</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> as a gunnery officer during World War II. We heard about the incident on HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> during the attack on the Philippines, when HMAS Australia was hit by six Kamikaze pilots. It sounds like a very remarkable act of bravery indeed. David's naval service extended to the Korean War, when he served on <inline font-style="italic">Tobruk</inline> and was, I think, the fleet operations officer on the aircraft carrier HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline>. David went on to become the Director of Naval Intelligence, commanding officer of HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Vampire </inline>and commander of the 10th destroyer flotilla. It was a remarkable career for someone who joined the Navy at the age of 13. </para><para>David Hamer was one of a very small number of Australians who have served in both houses of the Australian parliament. He entered federal parliament in 1969 as the member for Isaacs but lost the seat in 1974. He was re-elected in 1975, retiring in 1977. He was elected as a senator for Victoria in that year and retired from the Senate in 1990. During the period that I served in the Senate with David Hamer he was, as I mentioned, the Deputy President of the Senate, and I think it is fair to say that he was highly regarded in that role by both sides of the chamber. It is quite clear, when you read about some aspects of David Hamer's parliamentary career, that he had a strong, independent streak and caused a few problems over the years for governments—not only governments of the Labor persuasion.</para><para>The opposition acknowledges David Hamer's distinguished career and achievements both inside and outside the parliament. On behalf of the opposition I extend sincere condolences to David Hamer's family and friends. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>57</page.no><name role="metadata">Bourne, Sen Vicki</name><name role="display">Senator BOURNE</name><name.id>TW4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Democrats, I join my colleagues in this condolence motion for former Senator Hamer. I have been asked by my colleagues to speak today because, as we are such a young party, I am the only one who actually met David Hamer. I found him to be a very charming and decent man. He was elected to the Senate in 1977 and was a senator until 1990. He left just as I was coming in. He was Deputy President and Chairman of Committees from 1983 to 1990. My former employer, the former Senator Colin Mason, was very fond of David Hamer, and I am sure he would have liked to join me in this condolence motion today.</para></talk.start><para>I was reading obituaries as I was preparing for this, and I thought the heading on the obituary in the Australian was quite remarkable: `David Hamer: Parliamentarian, naval hero and arts administrator'. What a life. That sounds like almost the perfect life, really—although I am not sure how perfect being a naval hero would be. I also noticed in the same obituary that he had recently completed an autobiography, but his friends say it is so hot that it is unlikely to be published soon. That is a great pity. I would really love to see that autobiography; I think it would be well worth reading. I want to read one very small quote from his last speech, when he said, addressing the President at the time:</para><quote><para>You, Mr President, are presiding over what is potentially the most important chamber in the Westminster system. </para></quote><para>I will not go on and embarrass anybody in the chamber by reading the rest of it, which says how brilliant the Senate is and how the House of Representatives pales into dreadful insignificance next to it, but I think senators should read it—and I agree absolutely with every word. The most significant thing about his last speech, and the thing that really reflects the man, is that the very last thing he said in his last speech was a joke. I think that reflects him: when you met him, he appeared to be very serious and a very stolid person and then, as you got to know him, you realised what a charming and funny person he was. I recommend reading that valedictory speech; it ends very nicely. I will end by extending our condolences to his family, his wife Barbara, his sons Richard and Andrew and his daughter Fiona. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>58</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As Leader of the National Party in the Senate, I would like to associate the National Party with the condolence motion for David Hamer, moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate.

On these occasions, we usually list some things from a person's life. This story is one of the things that struck me about the life of David Hamer.

The person he defeated had a wife and family and no bread on the table, so David donated his winnings to him. </para></talk.start><para>He entered the Navy at 13 years of age, went through the naval officers procedure until well after the war, when was promoted, and was a very successful Navy officer. He was a proud and upstanding member of the Liberal Party. I can recall him from when I first entered parliament, and I knew him quite well. He held the seat of Isaacs in Victoria from 1969 to 1974, entered the Senate in 1977 and served until 1990 as Deputy President. He was very proud of that position. He took it very seriously and I believe he would have thought that being elected Deputy President was one of the best achievements of his life. In fact, at one stage—I do not know how the circumstances evolved—he became the President for a couple of months until the Senate was recommissioned.</para><para>He was a delightful person, as other people have said. He had his own ideas and he was very forceful in promoting those ideas. I believe he was a great asset to Australia—a great asset to his country—and a great asset to this chamber.

It was a memorable funeral because, as I say, it was not a politician's funeral; it was a friend's funeral.</para></talk.start><para>I remember David Hamer. He is very fleeting in my memory, as I was only briefly in the Senate in 1987 when he was the Deputy President, but I remember a man who had a great love of the arts and of reading. That was certainly borne out—and we have heard the biographies given of him—in the autobiography and the other books he wrote on military history and military strategy. He was not just a politician; he was a very rounded gentleman. He had a great number of interests and pursued those after he had left this place as well.

He will be remembered for the remarkable contributions he made to Australian society and for the diversity of those contributions. In our current age of specialisation, I remember David Hamer as a man who could really turn his hand to anything. He brought an enormous set of skills and life experience to his work in this parliament— and I guess that is something that those who are given the responsibility of preselecting people ought to think carefully about: the value of preselecting people who have a wide range of skills and backgrounds. People have mentioned the distinguished career he had in the House as the member for Isaacs before finding a home in this chamber. I think he had a special affinity for the Senate; maybe it suited him best. Those of us in the Senate always think that we have a different culture from those in the House of Representatives. People make the transition this way better than they make the transition the other way. He was very committed to the Senate committee system and his interest in the Senate—and I suppose his understanding of the staff of the Senate—was expressed in a poem he was known to recite at odd moments:</para></talk.start><quote><para>When the great of the Earth</para><para>Go off to their dinner</para><para>The clerk remains</para><para>Growing thinner and thinner.</para><para>Racking his brains</para><para>As he tries to report</para><para>what he thinks, they think</para><para>They ought to have thought.</para></quote><para>I think that says something about David's view about us, and his view about what the clerks have to do. </para><para>We have many lives outside parliament. In his youth he was a keen boxer, as we found out at his funeral. He was also especially interested in the arts and is credited with being a major force behind the establishment of the National Film and Sound Archive, and those of us who have visited that facility realise the importance of it. We also realise how we have aged when we listen to <inline font-style="italic">Blue Hills</inline> and some of the editions of <inline font-style="italic">When A Girl Marries</inline> and those sorts of things, or when a girl doesn't marry maybe; but it was a great tribute that he put so much effort into the National Film and Sound Archive. He will be best remembered for his outstanding achievements in the Navy, where he was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, and as a parliamentarian who served with distinction for over two decades. </para><para>I want to refer to a speech that was made at his funeral by David Leach, one of his colleagues, and I want to do that in reasonable depth because I think it says something about the man. I quote:</para><quote><para>... when I joined the Naval College at Flinders Naval Depot as a cadet midshipman in 1942, David was already a legend. He joined the College in 1937 aged 13—</para></quote><para>Something Senator Faulkner mentioned—</para><quote><para>from Geelong Grammar, graduating in 1940 gaining maximum time for promotion to Lieutenant, the grand aggregate prize for studies, prizes for mathematics and navigation. </para></quote><para>He was to use that skill and navigation throughout his life in the Navy. David Leach's speech continued:</para><quote><para>He was also top in English and history. </para><para>He was also a good sportsman and gained his colours for rugby. During his career he played rugby for Combined Services and in all the teams of ships in which he served. </para><para>As reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper, David was an undefeated professional boxer. On leave from the RANC he went to a boxing troupe in West Melbourne Stadium and won 30 shillings and his opponent 10 shillings. David gave his winnings to his opponent after he had told him that he was counting on the prize money and without it his family would be short of food. </para></quote><para>So he ended up with the 30 shillings and the 10 shillings as well. David Leach's speech continued:</para><quote><para>His first ship was the cruiser HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Canberra</inline> and during a patrol in the Indian Ocean, a German tanker was in and he was sent as part of the boarding party. Midshipmen in those days carried a dirk, a sort of short dagger. The sides of the ship were steep and access was by a rope ladder. Finding his dirk was impeding his progress, he put it between his teeth and boarded the ship like a modern-day pirate, much to the surprise of the German crew.</para></quote><para>This all came out at the funeral. I could not imagine David climbing up the side of a ship with a dirk between his teeth, but apparently he did. I quote again from David Leach's speech:</para><quote><para>In 1941, he was posted to the destroyer <inline font-style="italic">Napier</inline> in the Mediterranean where he served on the Malta convoys. The next year, he joined the British battleship <inline font-style="italic">Revenge</inline> and was promoted to sublieutenant in the same year. </para><para>In 1943 he was sent to England to do the sublieutenant's courses and once again he showed his academic brilliance by gaining five first-class passes and was awarded £10 by the Naval Board. He was the only Australian to win the coveted Beaufort and Wharton prize for navigation and he was a winner of the Ian McDonald prize—</para></quote><para>I do not think it was this Ian Macdonald—</para><quote><para>for signals. </para><para>David had an extraordinary photographic memory and although he was reticent about it, no-one was surprised to hear that after completing an IQ test his results came out in the genius class. </para><para>1943 saw him posted to HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Norman</inline> and promotion to Lieutenant before he was 20—quite an achievement. </para><para>The next posting was to HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline> in 1944 where he saw action in the Leyte Gulf and Lingayen operations. The first Kamikaze of the war crashed onto the Bridge. The captain and navigator were among the 23 killed and 39 wounded. Hamer made his way to the Bridge which was in shambles. Seeing he could do nothing there he went to the aft control position where he was appointed navigator. This was quite a task because all the charts had been destroyed and the gyro had a 20-degree error, but he soon sorted this out.</para></quote><para>Thank heavens for his mathematical ability. The speech continued—</para><quote><para>Later during the invasion of Lingayen in the Philippines, Lieutenant Hamer in his role as Air Defence Officer was positioned above the Bridge, warning of and directing fire on approaching enemy aircraft. He stood his ground when a Kamikaze pilot targeted the <inline font-style="italic">Australia</inline>, reporting the approaching enemy. The plane past 6 feet above his head, the wing hitting the mast and the aircraft veered into the forward funnel and over the side. </para></quote><para>As has been mentioned by others, for devotion to duty in the face of the enemy David was awarded the DSC, the citation reading: `For outstanding efficiency, courage and coolness.' David Leach's speech continued:</para><quote><para>But for American pressure that no significant awards should be made that highlighted the effectiveness of the Kamikaze attacks, he may well have been given a higher award.</para><para>After the war finished in Europe, David was selected as part of an Allied technical mission that went to occupied Germany to assess any German military designs that might be useful in the war against Japan.</para><para>On completion of this task he returned to England and did a Fighter Direction and Pilots Course. </para><para>In 1946 David was selected for the year-long Gunnery Specialist Course at Whale Island in Portsmouth and with RN, RAN, RNZN and RCN students he topped the course and was sent to Greenwich later to do postgraduate studies with other outstanding students.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>On return to Australia he served in the destroyers <inline font-style="italic">Bataan</inline> and <inline font-style="italic">Warramunga</inline> during which time he was involved with British and Commonwealth forces in Japan. </para><para>His next posting was to HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Tobruk</inline> in 1951 as First Lieutenant and Admiral Peek was his captain.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>In 1960 when he was on the staff of the late Admiral Harrington as Fleet Operations Officer in HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> ... he introduced fighting efficiency competitions and the proper analysis of exercises.</para></quote><para>...	...	...</para><quote><para>Under his leadership the ship won 4 out of 7 fleet efficiency competitions and the sporting shield.</para></quote><para>You wonder, if he set them up, whether there might not have been a conflict of interest. The speech continued:</para><quote><para>His last job in the Navy was coordinating all Navy projects, which was a demanding task.</para><para>It was during this period that he considered his future in the Navy. He could see that he wouldn't be spending much more time at sea and he was not happy with Navy Administration.</para><para>He had talked to Sir John Gorton who had been Minister for the Navy who encouraged him to take up politics and so in November 1967 ... David left the Navy to embark on his political career.</para></quote><para>I have obviously shortened that speech, but it was a tremendous summary of David's outstanding contribution to the Navy and also his academic ability and the way in which he was able to put those skills that he had, especially in mathematics, to incredible use in Australia's defence.</para><para>Dame Margaret Guilfoyle also spoke at the service, and I want to quote from her speech:</para><quote><para>I remember David firstly as a candidate for the new electorate of Isaacs in the 1969 election. John Gorton was the Prime Minister and I was State Chairman of the Women's Section of the Party. It was an important election for the government and the Hamer win in that seat was part of a small majority of 7, following a 7% swing against the government. This was the beginning of more than two decades of David's Parliamentary Service. He won Isaacs again in 1972 and regained it in 1975.</para></quote><para>She went on to talk about his career. She talked also about his support in particular for the establishment of the Australian Defence Force Academy. She said:</para><quote><para>... I vividly recall his support of the proposal and his personal contribution through the debate ... he regarded as vitally important changes upon made to the Defence Services retirement benefits. </para><para>The changes were not to benefit him but to develop a better and fairer scheme for the future. He served on the Committee and was satisfied when the changes were made. He described the outcome as being achieved `after some trauma'. He was an effective advocate. </para><para>David did not seek re-election for the seat of Isaacs in 1977 and was elected as a senator for Victoria in 1978.</para></quote><para>Former Senator Guilfoyle went on to say:</para><quote><para>His seven years as Deputy President of the Senate during Hawke governments wore recognition by his colleagues of his capacity to maintain the reputation of the Senate as an important part of our legislature. He continued to press for reform and, in his final speech, insisted that we must use extensively the public hearings of our Senate committee system. </para></quote><para>Senator Guilfoyle went on to say that the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Button, said in his valedictory speech to Senator Hamer that his long term as Deputy President and Chairman of Committees had been carried out with fairness and distinction and had helped greatly with the smooth running of the chamber.</para><para>Margaret Guilfoyle also said, as has been said here in this chamber, that he was courteous and considerate. She did recall one characteristic that he brought with him from the Navy. She said—and it must have been nice in the old Parliament House when everyone used to have breakfast together there:</para><quote><para>He said to me once that he thought that breakfast should be `a private experience'. If we were in the Members Dining Room before an early meeting, he preferred to read the morning paper alone and not to be part of a group. He told me that in the Navy a superior officer had the same view and David said that whenever the officer was joined for breakfast and the chatter began he said `Good morning' rapidly seven times and then that should do you for the week. We know that David's view was that discussion of the headlines could be held later in the day!</para></quote><para>Despite bringing some of those characteristics from the Navy, David did make a major contribution to this place. I do not believe it is possible to sum up anyone's life in a few sentences. As parliamentarians and Australians we owe David Hamer a debt of gratitude for his contribution to this country, in particular bringing his intellectual skills to bear in the area of Australia's defence, and also for his contribution to the parliament. Personally I found him to be a very supportive colleague. When I first came as a tyro senator he was always available to answer questions. His staff assisted me enormously. I remember his willingness to step in on a couple of occasions when I had the flu and was not able to attend. Often when one rings somebody says, `Oh, no, I'm busy, I can't help you out.' As we all know in this house, that can happen. David was always prepared: he was free to assist. At his funeral, Dame Margaret Guilfoyle summed up his life most appropriately when she said:</para><quote><para>His was a life that will be long remembered.</para></quote><para>To his wife, Barbara, and his family I extend my deepest sympathy and condolences.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>62</page.no><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator KEMP</name><name.id>WW4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Arts and Sport</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I, too, join my colleagues in supporting the condolence motion for David Hamer. I knew David while he was a senator. I knew David after he left this Senate. In 1990 we were political rivals for a Senate spot. It was a vigorous occasion for both of us. But I do have to say that following 1990 we had many meetings and we got on well together. Our conversations were always courteous, polite and productive. That was a measure of the man— that he would act in that particular fashion despite the disappointment he obviously felt.</para></talk.start><para>Each of our colleagues has mentioned many aspects of David Hamer—his very distinguished naval career, his work in the parliament. The matter I would like to draw attention to is that, as everyone mentioned, David Hamer had a great passion for this chamber and was a great promoter of Senate reform. Some of the reforms David Hamer was promoting went far beyond what I think the community would accept at this point in time and perhaps what the Senate would consider. One of those reforms was the abolition of ministers from the Senate and the elevation of committee chairs to an even more senior and powerful position in this chamber. The reason I mention it is that it shows his particular passion for the Senate and for the parliament and for the reform process. He was always willing in later years to lead debates on those matters.</para><para>The other issue I bring to the attention of the chamber was his particular love and affection for the arts. As my colleague Senator Patterson correctly said, this was given some attention at the funeral. Dame Margaret Guilfoyle, who was one of the speakers at the funeral, indicated that he was deeply involved in the arts, which Dame Margaret said stemmed from his wife's love of music. They held various positions in tandem, with David Hamer being President of the Arts Council of Victoria from 1970 to 1977 and federal president from 1977 to 1982. It has also been mentioned in this debate that he was President of the Australian Film Institute from 1980 to 1985.</para><para>I would like to join with the Senate in supporting this motion. David Hamer was a very distinguished senator from my home state of Victoria. He made a very important contribution to this parliament. He is survived by his wife, Barbara, and three children, Richard, Andrew and Fiona. We send our condolences to his family. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>63</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I was extremely grateful that Senator West was able to attend the funeral of David Hamer, accompanied by Black Rod, as I was away on a delegation at the time.

He attended the Brisbane Boys College and the University of Queensland, where he received a Bachelor of Commerce. Prior to his being elected to parliament, he was a dairy farmer, a public accountant and a councillor on the Kingaroy Shire Council. Outside his work, I understand he was an avid cricket fan. He married Joan in 1951. They had three sons and two daughters. He was elected as the member for Fisher in 1972, following the retirement of his father, the late Sir Charles Adermann. As a member of the National Party, he held the seat until 1984, when he was elected as the member for Fairfax following the 1984 electoral redistribution, and retained this seat until his retirement prior to the 1990 election. He was a member of several parliamentary committees and delegations.</para><para>In his first speech he spoke about primary industries, mining, tourism and the delivery of telecommunications services—nothing has changed, Senator Boswell will remind me. He had a strong personal interest in issues affecting rural and regional Australia. This was reflected in the ministries he held. He was opposition spokesman on customs and excise during 1974-75. He then served as Minister for the Northern Territory, Minister Assisting the Minister for Natural Resources, Minister for Veterans' Affairs and Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industry. During his time as Minister for the Northern Territory he worked on the re-establishment of Darwin after Cyclone Tracy and helped guide the Northern Territory to self-government when the federal government transferred a significant number of functions to the Northern Territory Legislative Council. He retired from parliament in 1990.</para><para>A man of strong Christian faith and values, Evan Adermann was a devoted member of the Church of Christ. He gave much of his time to the Church and was a lay preacher. In the 1999 Queens Birthday honours, he was appointed an Officer in the Order of Australia for service to the Australian parliament, to the community, particularly through the Church of Christ in Queensland, and to local government. I understand that the principal loves of his life were his church and his family. </para><para>On behalf of the government I extend to his wife Joan, children Joanne, Jenny, David, Peter and John and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</para><para>Gordon Freeth was born on 6 August 1914 at Angaston in rural South Australia. He attended Sydney Church of England Grammar School, Guildford Grammar School in Western Australia and the University of Western Australia, where he gained a law degree. He also competed in the Sydney Empire Games where he rowed in the winning four.</para><para>In 1939 he married Joan Baker and they had twin daughters, Felicity and Susan, and a son, Robert. In 1939 he also set up his law practice in Katanning in Western Australia.</para><para>During World War II he enlisted as a pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force and flew Beauforts in New Guinea. He was a flight lieutenant until 1945. He then returned to Katanning where he was prominent in local affairs.</para><para>In 1949 he was elected to federal parliament as the Liberal member for the West Australian seat of Forrest. He was returned to parliament seven times and held the seat until 1969.</para><para>He was a member of a number of parliamentary committees and delegations and served on the backbench for several years before being appointed to the outer ministry in 1958 as Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works. Over the next 10 years he also held the positions of Minister Assisting the Attorney-General, Minister for Shipping and Transport, Minister for Air and Minister Assisting the Treasurer. In 1969 he was appointed to the senior position of Minister for External Affairs, replacing Sir Paul Hasluck, and held this position until shortly after his defeat at the October 1969 election.</para><para>Sir Gordon was appointed Ambassador to Japan from 1970 to 1973 and High Commissioner to Great Britain from 1977 to 1980. In 1978 he was appointed a Knight Commander of the British Empire for distinguished public and parliamentary service.</para><para>Sir Gordon was a fitness fanatic who was known in parliamentary circles for his prowess on the squash court. He excelled in rowing, as I mentioned, and also enjoyed boxing, running, swimming and golf. I am told he was well regarded for his ability to do 10 press-ups on his fingertips.</para><para>On behalf of the government, I extend to his children and other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</para><para>Sir Fred Chaney was born on 12 October 1914 at Fremantle in Western Australia. I understand life was difficult for young Fred and his widowed mother during the Great Depression. Those years and the immense human suffering he witnessed ultimately influenced his decision to enter politics.</para><para>After completing his primary education at state and Catholic schools, he was granted a scholarship to the CBC Aquinas College. In 1932, when he finished school, not being able to afford to attend university he joined the state education department and pursued a career as a teacher. He married Mavis, a fellow teacher, in 1938 and they went on to have four sons and three daughters. In 1941, Fred enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force where he trained as a pilot and became a flight instructor. He served in Australia, New Guinea and Borneo. For a time he also performed RAAF reconnaissance as a member of the legendary Z Force commando unit. He was decorated for bravery after he made a daring aircraft landing on a small clearing in Borneo to rescue some stranded persons. Even though his plane was damaged, Sir Fred managed to fly them to safety. As a result of a number of daring rescue missions such as these, Sir Fred was awarded the Air Force Cross for `courage, skill and resourcefulness'.</para><para>After his discharge in 1945, Fred returned to teaching and became a deputy headmaster. His strong involvement in the Returned and Services League led him to becoming a state president, the first World War II veteran to do so. It was during this time that he enthusiastically embraced politics. </para><para>A member of the Liberal Party of Australia, he was elected as the member for Perth in 1955 and retained the seat until 1969. In his first speech in parliament he spoke of our nation's common respect for law and our common love of freedom and stated:</para><quote><para>...free nations of the world must pledge themselves that the rights of free men will be protected wherever they are threatened.</para></quote><para>During his parliamentary career, he was a member of several parliamentary committees and delegations. He had notable challenges during his parliamentary career, being the Government Whip from 1962 to 1963 at a time when the coalition had a majority of one, and being appointed as Minister for the Navy shortly after the <inline font-style="italic">Voyager</inline> disaster. After being defeated in the 1969 election, Fred was appointed as Administrator of the Northern Territory, a position he held from 1970 to 1973. Whilst administrator, he became closely involved in indigenous issues. The strong interest he developed in indigenous issues continued through his life.</para><para>Whereas most people are involved in local politics before entering federal parliament, Sir Fred entered local politics in 1978 after his federal career. He was elected Mayor of Perth for two terms until 1982. He received recognition for his significant contribution to the nation. He was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire in the 1970 New Year's honours list for long political and public service. In 1981, he was appointed Knight Commander of the British Empire for community service.</para><para>On behalf of the government, I extend to his wife, Mavis, children, Robin, Fred—who we know well—Karen, Richard, Michael, John and Jillian, and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>65</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I associate the opposition with the condolence motion that the Leader of the Government has moved on the deaths of the Hon.

Evan Adermann was elected to the House of Representatives for the seat of Fisher in 1972 and held that seat until 1983. He was re-elected as the member for Fairfax after the 1984 electoral distribution and held that seat until his retirement from the federal parliament in 1990.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Evan Adermann also had a strong family background in politics, succeeding his father, the Rt Hon. Sir Charles Adermann, who had himself been member for Fairfax—I think for a couple of decades. Evan Adermann served as a minister in the Fraser government. He was Minister for the Northern Territory from 1975 to 1978 and Minister for Veterans' Affairs from 1978 to 1980, and held a number of other portfolio responsibilities as `minister assisting'. He was the Minister for the Northern Territory when the Northern Territory attained self-government in 1978, and that would have been a highlight of his ministerial career. I can say that colleagues in the House of Representatives remember Evan Adermann as an unassuming man who worked very hard in the interests of his constituents, his electorate and his party. Our condolences go to his family at this time.</para><para>We also remember the career of Sir Gordon Freeth in this condolence debate. He graduated in law from the University of Western Australia—a busy year for him, as he represented Australia in rowing at the 1938 Sydney Empire Games during the same period. He was a pilot in the Royal Australian Air Force, stationed mostly in New Guinea flying Beauforts, and was involved in the air bombardment of Rabaul. He had attained the rank of flight lieutenant when he was demobilised in 1945. </para><para>He was first elected to parliament in 1949 for the West Australian seat of Forrest, which he held for 20 years, and was a minister in the Menzies and Holt governments. He was Minister for the Interior and Minister for Works in 1958, and later was appointed Minister Assisting the Attorney-General, Minister for Shipping and Transport, Minister for Air and Minister for External Affairs.</para><para>In relation to his role as Minister for External Affairs, there would be a lot of sympathy for him in the Labor Party, because Gordon Freeth became the target of the DLP and the extreme right of the Liberal Party following a speech in which he was accused of being soft on Russia. Many in the Labor Party having had the same elements of criticism, I suppose there would be a level of sympathy for that. That was significant, because there it had the effect of costing him his seat in the 1969 election. After that, he continued his public life. He was Ambassador to Japan from 1970 to 1973, and in 1977 he became the High Commissioner to Britain. On behalf of the opposition in the Senate, I offer condolences to his family.</para><para>Finally, I turn to the death of Sir Fred Chaney and offer our condolences to his wife and family. He also was a son of Western Australia. As we have heard with so many of those we have spoken of in the condolence debates today, he had a very impressive early life. Due to sporting ability, he was able to win a scholarship to Christian Brothers Aquinas College. He had hoped to study engineering at university but, like so many Australians of his generation, as a result of the Great Depression, that was not to be. He accepted a job with the education department in Western Australia. He started at the bottom of the pile there and his career saw him graduate as a teacher and go to a one-teacher school. After what was very distinguished service in the Second World War, he returned to teaching and rose to become a deputy headmaster. During that time he became the first World War II veteran to become RSL state president.</para><para>Sir Fred Chaney's political career began in 1955, when he won the seat of Perth. He went on to hold that through to 1969, and he had distinguished service in the House of Representatives as Chief Government Whip. He was appointed by then Prime Minister Menzies as Minister for the Navy in 1964, and was caught in a unique situation waiting for legislation to pass the parliament to enlarge the size of the ministry to allow him to be sworn in as Minister for the Navy: it was precisely at that time that HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Melbourne</inline> collided with the destroyer <inline font-style="italic">Voyager</inline>, resulting in what was to be our nation's worst peace-time disaster, with 82 lives lost. At the time, the Minister for the Army, Dr Forbes, was made Minister for the Navy in order to attend to formal matters, but it was Fred Chaney who had to deal with the aftermath of that naval disaster. In 1966, when the Holt government was elected, he was not appointed a minister. He lost his seat in the 1969 election.</para><para>Sir Fred Chaney, like his son Fred Chaney, who we know and have served with in this chamber, had a very strong interest in Aboriginal issues. He was appointed Administrator for the Northern Territory in 1970 and he was a strong advocate for and supporter of Aboriginal land rights. Like other former members of the federal parliament, he had a term as Lord Mayor of Perth before retiring from public life in 1982. Even though I did not know Sir Fred Chaney personally, I, like many other senators in this place, knew his son, who was the leader of the Liberal Party in the Senate when I first joined this chamber. On behalf of the opposition, I again offer condolences to Sir Fred Chaney's family. </para><para>To the families and friends of the Hon. Albert Adermann, the Hon. Sir Gordon Freeth and the Hon. Sir Fred Chaney, who have served their party and this parliament with distinction, I again offer our sincere condolences. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>66</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to associate the National Party with the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. Today we are moving this condolence motion for three outstanding men who served their country as ministers. Two of them served their country in war and in parliament, and after their parliamentary careers they served their countries as ambassadors or as administrators.  </para></talk.start><para>I would first like to talk about Evan Adermann. Evan Adermann was born on 10 March 1927 in Kingaroy, the son of Sir Charles Adermann, who held the seat of Fisher for over 20 years and was a senior minister and deputy leader of the National Party, or, as it was then, the Country Party. Sir Charles Adermann, his father, was a forceful character and was the person that influenced Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen to stand for state parliament. Evan took over the seat after his father relinquished it and served in the seat of Fisher and later, due to a redistribution, in the seat of Fairfax. </para><para>Evan was a very quiet and gentle person, a person who gave great support to the National Party, and he was a family man. When I attended his funeral service, which was held during the middle of the last election campaign, I was impressed to see so many people attending from all walks of life. He was a substantial member, even a leader. I think the person administering the Church of Christ alternates each five years between a minister of religion and a person who is not a minister of religion. For some time Evan Adermann ran the Church of Christ in Queensland. He had five children, three sons—one of whom is also a minister in the Church of Christ—and two daughters. He had nine grandchildren. At the funeral his son said that his family and his grandchildren were the light of his life. </para><para>Evan left parliament in 1990. I can recall the trauma the National Party was experiencing in the `Joh for Canberra' era and the trauma that the National Party went through in its party room. I can remember the counsel of Evan Adermann when it got rough in there. One person at that particular time was causing confusion—it had never happened before in the National Party—and it was Evan's counsel that calmed us down. I can remember times when Evan would lead us in prayer. That has not happened since. Evan had a calming influence. He could take over a situation that was getting very serious and he could calm the party room down. </para><para>I think if you asked him about the highlights of his parliamentary career he would mention that, along with my colleague Senator Harradine, he re-formed the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. That has gone on from that day and it is still offering services to the parliament. Today, many of us attended a church service organised by the Parliamentary Christian Association, which Evan reconstructed. In the <inline font-style="italic">Courier-Mail</inline> Evan Adermann was described as the gentle man of politics and as a staunch member of the Church of Christ. </para><para>He had quite serious responsibilities as minister. Taking the Northern Territory into self-government in 1976 was something, which he saw as being a great contribution. He was appointed Officer of the Order of Australia in June 1999 for his service to the Australian parliament, local government and the community. He was a member of local government before he came into parliament. He was born into politics. He served the National Party well, as he served the electorate of Fisher and, later, the electorate of Fairfax, well. He came into parliament in 1972 and stayed in the parliament until 1990. He served as Minister for the Northern Territory from 1975 to 1978, as Minister Assisting the Minister for Natural Resources from 1975 to 1977, as Minister for Veterans' Affairs from 1978 to 1980 and as Minister Assisting the Minister for Primary Industries from 1977 to 1980. His ministerial career finished around 1989. He then became a backbencher and served and represented the people of his electorates of Fisher and Fairfax for another 10 years until his retirement in 1999. </para><para>He had a daughter who was hearing impaired and he was outspoken in his representation on behalf of the deaf and the hearing impaired. He put a great deal of effort into the societies for the deaf and the hearing impaired. </para><para>He was an honourable man in every sense of the word. To his wife, Joan, his sons, David, Peter and John, his daughters, Joanne and Jenny, and his nine grandchildren, I pass on our sympathy and condolences.  </para><para>I did not know Sir Gordon Freeth. He was well and truly before my time. He was born in 1914. He served Australia well in war, in peace, in politics and as an ambassador in Japan. He was an outstanding member of the Liberal Party and a great Australian. I would like to pass my condolences and those of the National Party to his family and friends.</para><para>Sir Frederick Chaney was born in October 1914. Again, I never knew Sir Frederick, but I did know his son Fred Chaney and I served with him for a great number of years. Sir Frederick had seven children—four sons and three daughters—23 grandchildren and 14 great-grandchildren. He was another great Australian who served his nation in peace and in war. We in the National Party pass on our condolences, particularly to his son Fred, who many of us know so well, but also to his other friends and all his family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>68</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I do not think that I can add to the words that have been expressed here in this chamber in this condolence motion.

As you have said, Madam President, Ralph Jacobi was the Labor member for the seat of Hawker from 1969 to 1987. During much of that time, I was a South Australian party official of the Labor Party, either state secretary or state organiser. I got to know Ralph Jacobi very well indeed, and I can say unequivocally that he represented the cream of the working class of Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Ralph was an outstanding representative of the people of his electorate, and he was an outstanding representative of the people of South Australia. He had unbelievable integrity, directness and honesty—often a rare commodity in politics, some people would say, but no-one would ever dispute Ralph Jacobi's integrity. Prior to winning the seat of Hawker in 1969, he was an official of the Australian Government Workers' Association in South Australia, a state based union that covered blue-collar workers in the hospital and health care industry and workers in daily paid employment in the water supply department.</para><para>Ralph Jacobi won the new seat of Hawker in 1969, even though his opponent, well-known Adelaide businessman Alan Hickenbotham, spent an extraordinary amount of money in that campaign. It was my first election campaign as state organiser and I, like others, was extremely worried about whether Ralph could withstand the onslaught of what was a very sophisticated election campaign by Mr Hickenbotham. But, fortunately, in that year, 1969, there was a very big swing to Labor in South Australia. It was probably the best federal result in the history of that state. I think there was a two-party preferred vote of about 54 per cent. We won eight out of the 12 seats in South Australia, and Ralph's was one of them.</para><para>Subsequently, Hawker had redistribution changes that made it more and more marginal. In 1975, despite a big swing to the Liberal Party, Ralph narrowly held the seat by 500 votes. He held the swing in the seat to less than the state average. If it had been the state average he would have lost his seat, so we all cheered him for his great achievement. Then in the 1977 federal election we found that the boundaries had been changed again, and the seat had been made weaker for the Labor Party. Steele Hall announced that the Liberal Movement Party was being wound up and that he was rejoining the Liberal Party, giving up his Senate seat and standing for the seat of Hawker. The media in South Australia took that as the automatic end of Ralph Jacobi, believing that Steele Hall would bolt in, being a former premier and high personality within South Australian politics. Again, I was heavily involved in the campaign.  </para><para>When we offered Ralph Jacobi lots of support—shadow ministers to come and visit his electorate, funding for television ads and leaflets—he simply said, `Go to buggery; I'll win this campaign in my own way just as I've done in the past.' He then went out and endlessly doorknocked at the local level. Of course, to the surprise of the media in Adelaide and nationally, when the votes were counted he won the seat by 800 votes. He effectively increased his majority and again won in the face of a very expensive campaign against him. </para><para>After that, people realised that Ralph Jacobi was more than just a backbencher. This man was an outstanding parliamentarian, an outstanding member who, somehow, had the ability to connect to ordinary people in the electorate—people who did not need glossy pamphlets to be told how good Ralph Jacobi was. They did not need television ads or radio ads to tell them why they should vote for Ralph Jacobi.</para><para>In the 1980 election, when there was not such a high profile Liberal candidate, I was state secretary and I again discussed with Ralph what the campaign should be. He said, `Schacht, go away, leave it to me. I do not want any interference.' I said, `Bill Hayden wants to visit your electorate as the new parliamentary leader in this campaign.' He said, `I don't need the parliamentary leader.' I said, `What about a couple of shadow ministers?' `I don't need any shadow ministers. They are just a nuisance. Send them off to a marginal electorate where they can be useful. I don't need them.' I then discussed with him other tactics, leaflets and so on. He ignored every piece of advice. On the Friday night before the election I sent him a telegram saying, `All the best for a big victory tomorrow, Ralph. Congratulations on taking no notice of the state campaign director, the state ALP, the federal ALP. I am sure you will have a great victory.' He did have a great victory, a substantial victory. He took my telegram, framed it and put it on the wall of his office. It hung there proudly while he held the seat until 1987.</para><para>In the time he was in this parliament, despite the fact he had a blue-collar background, Ralph Jacobi was a visionary in a number of areas that are now taken for granted in federal politics. He was one of the first to debate and raise the issue about securities and Corporations Law, about the need for decent regulation to stop corporate crooks robbing ordinary Australians and to stop misleading information in prospectuses and to stock exchanges. He was at the forefront of that. It was very odd for someone from the Labor Party to get into the detail of Corporations Law in thousands of pages. Ralph Jacobi did it.</para><para>The next area he got involved in was insurance reform. Again, it was not a big sexy issue—if I can use that term—within the Labor Party. He was one of the visionaries to demand regulation to protect consumers, ordinary Australians, from being robbed by crook insurance companies. Ralph Jacobi would have said that he was not surprised at HIH falling over last year. He would have predicted that if you do not have strong regulation the crooks and conmen will get away with it.</para><para>He was also a very active member of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. He was one of the most knowledgeable men there is on Middle East issues. I can remember him saying on many occasions, `One of the reasons you will not get a peace settlement in the Middle East is the problem of water.' He said the allocation of water between what is claimed as Palestine, and Israel, Jordan and Syria was an issue that had to be resolved. Ralph was one of very few people who would talk unemotionally about the detail of Middle East politics. He was not a proselytiser for either side. He supported the right of Israel to exist, he supported the right for the Palestinians to have a homeland, but it had to be negotiated. He raised very sensible proposals. Ralph could talk to you about this for hours. </para><para>It has to be said that, for all of us who have been involved in factions in the Labor Party, it was a very bad moment when, after the 1984 election, Ralph should have become chairman of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade. But he was not in a faction; he flatly refused to join a faction. He said, `I am a member of the Labor Party. That is enough. That is my commitment.' And, because of that, he was not able to be allocated the chairmanship of that committee. As a result of that, on principle he then resigned from the committee. He said, `If I can't be on a committee or be a chairman without being in a faction, then I think it's time for me to stand down.' That was a loss to the committee and a loss to the Labor Party.</para><para>On Ralph Jacobi and factions, in the article written by Barry Jones, one of his close colleagues and close friends, Barry relates the story of Ralph being lobbied for votes in a leadership ballot. And this is the measure of the man. Despite being, I claim, a friend of Ralph's, I never found out how he voted in any internal ballot in the federal caucus of the Labor Party. He flatly refused to tell anybody how he voted, even when it might have been to his advantage to curry favour, as we all do, to say, `I'll vote for you if you vote for me for something else.'</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—You didn't do that too well, Schachtie!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>4J4</name.id><name role="metadata">Schacht, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator SCHACHT</name></talker><para>—As I say, Senator Hill, we have all done it—sometimes successfully, sometimes unsuccessfully. But there was an occasion in mid-1977 when Bill Hayden challenged Gough Whitlam for the leadership. Ralph, who was sitting up at the back the chamber, said something that meant that he might have been favouring voting for Gough Whitlam. So Gough wandered up from the front bench and chatted to him. Ralph listened and basically sent him away. Because it looked like he had rejected Gough, some halfwit, who was a supporter of Hayden, said to Hayden, `Look, we think Ralph is a chance.' So Hayden goes up—the story says—and says, `If you vote for me, Ralph, I'll put you on the front bench.' And he said, `Actually, Hayden, that has convinced me to vote for Gough.' That was Jacobi.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Then there was the ballot after the 1978 election, when I spoke to Ralph—I supported Bill Hayden to be the new leader—and I lobbied him. He listened for 30 seconds and then hung up the phone without saying anything. Up until the day he died, I do not know how he voted in that important ballot or in any subsequent ballot between Hawke and Hayden. He was the one person whose vote no one could guess. That was the mark of the integrity of the man. That is why for many of us his passing is extremely sad.</para><para>For South Australia, he was the first person to raise the issue of water quality in the River Murray, way back in 1981. In the seventies, we were still arguing in South Australia about building the Chowilla Dam. But he actually demanded that the River Murray Commission have its powers amended to deal with the issue of not just the volume of the water in the River Murray but the quality of the water. He predicted in 1981 that unless it was dealt with the River Murray would die. He was ignored. People said, `What is this man talking about?' Now, everybody in politics agrees with the issues he raised. In the seventies he pushed for several years for the establishment of a national crime authority. After years of pushing, he succeeded in having it established.</para><para>When we knew that Ralph was dying with cancer it was very sad for us. He went quietly to the Daw Park hospice. Some of us rang him in the days before he passed away and, to the very end, Ralph was still his modest self. He said to me when I rang, `Don't worry about ringing me, Schachtie. Thanks for ringing, but it's all okay. Thanks, friend. Good luck to you.' He left very clear instructions with his wife and family that, after his death, there was to be no publicity; none of us was to say anything to the media in South Australia about his passing until after a very small private funeral was held for just the family. Those were his clear instructions. </para><para>It is a measure of the man that that modesty also meant he was one of the best politicians that South Australia ever sent to the federal parliament. His contribution in so many areas has been so significant. It is not often we can say that someone is the cream of the working class, but Ralph Jacobi certainly was. I have to say that it has been a humbling experience that, for over 30 years, I considered him a friend. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>71</page.no><name role="metadata">Cooney, Sen Barney</name><name role="display">Senator COONEY</name><name.id>SF4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—I would like to say a few words on this condolence motion, as Ralph Jacobi is one person I want to be on the record as having spoken about, for the sorts of reasons that Senator Schacht has given. </para></talk.start><para>I would adopt everything that Senator Schacht has said.

Any time I think about him, I smile. He used to come in and out of my office to keep me honest—in between asking me if I could `possibly find this book' for him. In fact, when I went to New York I had a list of books that he could not find anywhere else. He asked if I could please see if I could pick them up in New York, because `they are bound to have some source there'. If I could have, I would have, but I could not.</para></talk.start><para>He was an avid reader and a wonderful person for ringing up or dropping a note that had just a quote, a sharp line or a reminder. He had, as we heard in Senator Schacht's contribution and also Senator Cooney's, a really fierce integrity. He could smell cant a mile off, if he could not hear it, and he tolerated it not at all. I remember his arguing—I think probably Senator Cooney and I would have been interested in his argument—about whether or not you should deny a passport to a person who was suspiciously likely to leave the country, taking huge wealth with them. People like Christopher Skase earned Ralph Jacobi's huge antagonism. He reckoned that Skase's right to his passport mattered not at all; thousands of people in his electorate lost their life savings of $1,000, $5,000 or $10,000. Ralph reckoned that, when it came to a balance, he knew which side was right. That was one of the many conversations I had with him. He also had a wicked sense of humour, and I am unfortunately unable to repeat here most of the jokes he told.</para><para>As Senator Schacht said, he was a person who pushed and persisted with inquiries even when they were not popular, such as inquiries into reform of insurance and superannuation—and, as Senator Schacht said, he was one of the first to raise concerns about the Murray-Darling. Unfortunately, I did not remember to ask Ralph for permission to enter him in Peoplescape as part of the Centenary of Federation celebrations. I think that, if I had asked him, he would have said `No!' in an absolutely gravelly voice. But he was extremely pleased when we told him that we had succeeded in getting permission, and he was one of those many people standing on Parliament House who could be biffed, appreciated or photographed. He was extremely pleased, and in his Peoplescape figure we featured his integrity and his concerns about insurance reform and the Murray-Darling. That Peoplescape figure has been returned to Adelaide, and I will make sure that it finds an excellent place—hopefully with his family.</para><para>I want to read part of a letter that I believe captures a large part of Ralph Jacobi. He wrote this letter on 6 April 2001 and asked if I would pass it to Simon Crean, the then Shadow Treasurer. The letter reads:</para><quote><para>Throughout my time in the Canberra Bear Pit one of my reform passions was in the area of Insurance, stemming from the collapse of the UK owned Vehicle &amp; General Insurance Group in 1971, and the resultant losses for people insured with this company here. </para><para>Then, you will recall a host of collapses, but particularly Bishopgate Insurance Australia. Initially, I was able to persuade Caucus support for an enquiry into the industry back in 1973, regrettably then and throughout be it the Insurance Act, an Insurance Contract Law or Insurance Brokers &amp; Agents, all were persistently opposed and consistently opposed by Treasury. It took from 1970 until 1986 before we were able to get any meaningful reform on the Statute Book. </para><para>As I recall the Minimum paid up by Capital for such companies was about $200,000: Solvency margin of assets on liabilities equal to 15% or $100,000 of Premium income which ever was the greater. Re-insurance arrangements subject to approval.</para><para>I also submitted proposals for the “Winding up of Insurance Companies” again without success.</para><para>However, reflecting the causes behind the collapse of GIO and HIH, I firmly believe that the community would be saved a vast expense in the supervision of General Insurance (Insurers) if the entry point was raised to a minimum of say $10 million capital to keep the rogues out. </para><para>In addition all companies to contribute just 0.1% of their premium income per year to a fund that would meet the claims of a failed insurer. This would raise some $15 million per year.</para><para>In addition I would insist that we adopt as a matter of urgency the `Fit and Proper Person' of the UK Act which was inserted into the UK Act following the clean up of the Vehicle and General collapse. During the year I repeatedly sought to have this provision inserted in our Act, but the Treasury and Treasurers repeatedly rejected it.</para><para>Reflecting on the track record down the years of both Treasury and the Industry to these and similar initiatives, I have no doubt that the joint response will be a consistent negative. The consequence will inevitably be repeat cases of the above. </para><para>As I have claimed many times as to the role of Auditors one of the reasons auditors have failed to subscribe to what ought to be the basis of all accounting standards—`that sunlight is the best disinfectant.'</para><para>Auditors of integrity should apply the Smell Test, which is a pretty good rule of thumb in this situation—if it smells bad, then dig deep for the source of the stench, then expose it.</para><para>I have a number of observations to make:</para><para>Regulators: If there is one lesson that flows from this debacle it is that it's `high time that Regulators took on board that wise old dictum: the soft approach is in the long run the cruellest.'</para><para>An old Italian proverb puts it more cogently: `Fish always begin to stink at the head.'</para><para>Politicians/Legislators ought to repeatedly ask themselves: `Why is it that we are always shutting the stable door after the horses have bolted.'</para><para>People who are obliged to insure against a contingent liability are entitled to demand a legislative framework within which they can feel secure and confident that their policies are both secure and protected from fraud, plunder or incompetence.</para><para>As legislators it is time we took on board one central factor in this so-called `deregulation saga'.

I cannot speak well enough of Ralph Jacobi. I very much regret his passing and I miss him, as do my staff and everyone I know who knew Ralph. I pass on my sincere condolences to his wife Stella and his family and I thank them for their support over the years.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>72</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—by leave—Lest it be thought that it is only Labor senators or some Labor senators who thought highly of Ralph Jacobi, I would like it to be known that I greatly respected him also.

Even after he retired, he wrote to me on a number of occasions with a bit of helpful advice. He probably did not tell his former Labor colleagues that he was doing that.

We saw a lot of each other during that period because a number of the community and local organisations in that part of metropolitan Adelaide overlapped the two electorates. We were often together at functions relating to those organisations and also on a number of occasions worked together on issues that were affecting those organisations. </para></talk.start><para>Apart from his skills and integrity, as have already been mentioned today, what I appreciated about Ralph Jacobi was the way in which he worked, in that context, in a completely nonpartisan way. As far as he was concerned, he was the member for Hawker, I was the member for Kingston, and we were both there to serve our local communities and those organisations and do our best for them irrespective of which party we belonged to. In that regard, he always treated me affably and with great courtesy and respect, which was reciprocated on my part. Between us, I think we achieved quite a lot for the south western suburbs during that period. This was due in no small measure to Ralph's experience, having served some years before I was elected. By observing Ralph in my early years as the member for Kingston, I learned a lot about how to serve an electorate effectively and how to look after it as a marginal seat, and I want to associate

Before that, I would like to note that I was very pleased to see that one Australian media outlet took up the challenge of presenting to the Australian community, in an interesting and informative way, a process as important to us as the opening of parliament. Sky News took it upon themselves to televise live the opening of parliament today. It is a commendable initiative and something that we should encourage.</para></talk.start><para>As I said, I want to make some remarks about trade policy—in particular, about some of the more recent moves in Japan to involve Australia as a key member in future regional economic partnerships. I particularly want to note and commend the importance of the efforts and work of Minister Vaile and Austrade in regional trade engagement. In a recent speech, Japan's Prime Minister, Junichiro Koizumi, acknowledged our longstanding efforts to deepen relationships with countries in South-East Asia by saying we should `act together as a community and advance together' to further dialogue between Australia and ASEAN countries.</para><para>The speech of the Prime Minister of Japan signified a recognition within our region of the successful economic endeavours of the coalition government since 1996. It also rejected—as the Australian electorate wisely did last November—statements from the opposition that we have not focused adequately on relations with our near northern neighbours in recent years. Both Australia and Japan have made significant efforts to strengthen economic relations for some time, including the publishing of two recent reports—one released by Australia and one by Japan—on strengthening economic relations. The reports cover the revitalising of the bilateral arrangements in a broad range of areas, focusing on economics as a fundamental pillar of our relationship. Both of those reports recognise that, while the relationship remains strong, there is more to be done to negotiate a framework trade and economic agreement between the two countries. </para><para>This idea was picked up at the Australia-Japan conference last year, which was a Prime Minister Howard-Prime Minister Mori bilateral initiative, jointly convened by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. I was fortunate to be a delegate to that conference, and it recommended that we look at this idea. Under the excellent chairmanship of Jerry Ellis, there was significant and valuable input by a number of participants, not least by my coalition colleague Kay Hull but also by Australians like Helen Nugent, John Moriarty, Mark Paterson, Paul Twomey and, of course, John McCarthy, the current Australian Ambassador to Japan.</para><para>The concept of entering into a trade and economic agreement fits naturally into Prime Minister Koizumi's vision for a growing East Asian community and agrees well with the direction taken up at that conference. This vision is multilayered. It has an economic focus, but the Japanese are also looking towards a network of cooperative agreements between individual countries that will build a whole network of much stronger collaboration. That may be cooperation in the security and strategic field but also in regional efforts to combat transnational crime, piracy, money laundering and people smuggling. As we know well in the current climate, these are very important. It is not about creating a new institution but rather about encouraging habits of cooperation that are already there and strengthening them—in Koizumi's words `to take meaningful actions for regional cooperation'.</para><para>We could, for example, start by focusing on what is in the new partnership agreement just concluded between Japan and Singapore, because Japan will be looking towards Australia to conclude similar agreements. Piece by piece, we can construct a patchwork quilt or a jigsaw puzzle of stronger relations, both on the economic and non-economic fronts. It fits very well with our own priorities; our own economic interests are fairly and squarely in the Asia-Pacific region. Japan is our No. 1 trading partner, China our No. 3 and Korea our No. 4. We are advancing not just our economic interests but also our strategic interests in this process.</para><para>The strengthening of economic partnerships in our region will be complementary to our pursuit of other global trade goals. The Doha round of multilateral negotiations is a very high priority for Australia and in some areas—such as reducing agricultural tariffs— it might be that the multilateral track is the most effective, but there are a number of things that Australia can do by way of both facilitation and cooperation to complement those reductions through the multilateral round. For example, we can look at linkages between industry and new sectors like IT, environmental management or establishing linkages between stock markets. There is a range of facilitation agreements to support and complement improvements that we can get through the new round. Even on questions like agriculture, we can look at harmonising quarantine procedures or streamlining custom standards or requirements so that those bilateral agreements can complement what is achieved through the multilateral round. I note that many of those subjects were covered in the report of September last year of the Senate References Committee on Foreign Affairs Defence and Trade, <inline font-style="italic">Japan: Politics and Society: Report 2 in the inquiry into Japan</inline>.</para><para>In the context of other regions which have set up economic community structures, we must acknowledge that the Asian region is much more diverse and uneven in its differing styles of government and development of economies, particularly in comparison to Europe. From my perspective, what Prime Minister Koizumi has in mind is a more loose and flexible arrangement because conditions are not right to move towards something along the lines of the European model of integration. The Embassy of Japan in Canberra has a new and able leader in incoming Ambassador Atsushi Hatakenaka. He is strongly focused on economic activity, given that that is the bedrock of the bilateral relationship, and so the mission is acting in the spirit of the recommendations that came out in the conference. For example, in May of this year there is a planned dialogue between higher education institutions and another on issues that plague both our countries such as ageing populations, the hollowing out of our regional areas and policy solutions for people who do not live in urban areas. </para><para>About 800,000 Australians speak an Asian language. This should be a very valuable resource in future trade with countries in our region and in attracting foreign investment. The importance of language teaching in Australia and fostering links between young Australians and young people from our region cannot be overstated. It is an investment of time and effort for the sake of effective future relations which we cannot afford to ignore. There is a very active program by the Asia Education Foundation to improve the standard and quality of Asian teaching in Australia which involves study trips for Australian teachers to visit Asian countries. I know from the reports of those who have participated that it is regarded as a very positive and valuable program. The Australia Japan Foundation has a broad range of cultural and sporting exchange programs and strongly encourages English as a second language in Japan.</para><para>The Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, has energetically and effectively pursued a number of important tracks for Australian trade. For example, on the World Trade Organisation multilateral track we have taken a lead in working through the Cairns Group of nonsubsidising agricultural exporters to get reduced subsidies on agricultural product. Within the regional organisations, of which APEC is our primary focus, we have achieved a strong level of influence in the region. Our CER agreement with New Zealand has been concluded, and last year's agreement to link the CER with the ASEAN Free Trade Area represents for the first time a much more comprehensive approach to promoting trade and investment linkages that will underpin both future growth and prosperity in Australia and throughout the region. We have made significant advances in maintaining and advancing new bilateral relationships since the coalition was elected in 1996. There are a number of examples in that regard: we are currently in negotiations for a free trade agreement with Singapore; we are conducting a scoping study on a free trade area with Thailand; and, as senators would know, we are also talking to the United States about a free trade agreement. These are important foci for the government and the minister. I look forward to the emphasis that will be placed on strengthening relationships with our region and that looks likely during this 40th Parliament.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Lloyd, Mr Clem</title><page.no>77</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>77</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On New Year's Eve at Gympie, in Queensland, the great Labor loyalist Clem Lloyd died. He was in Gympie working on a biography of Andrew Fisher. It was to be his 12th book. Clem was a journalist, political staffer, historian, academic, teacher and writer. At 15 he joined the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Telegraph</inline> as a police rounds copy boy. He took his cadetship on the <inline font-style="italic">Daily Mirror </inline>working again on the police rounds. For 12 years, Clem worked in Sydney and Canberra, with the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Daily Mirror</inline>, Sydney <inline font-style="italic">Sun</inline>, <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline>, Consolidated Press, the <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> and the Melbourne <inline font-style="italic">Truth</inline>. He studied at university part time, first completing a degree in economics, then an arts degree. By the end of his life he had completed bachelors, masters and doctoral degrees in political science and bachelors degrees in law and economics.</para></talk.start><para>In 1966, he began working for the federal Labor Party when he was offered the position of principal private secretary to Labor's Senate leader, Don Willesee. When Willesee lost the leadership a few months later, Clem joined Lance Barnard, the opposition's deputy leader and spokesman on defence. He worked with Lance Barnard until 1973. In the lead-up to the 1972 election, Clem played a key role in formulating Labor's defence policy. The policy included bringing an end to conscription and developing a well-equipped, decently paid volunteer army, as well as restructuring Australia's defence establishment—a massive job which meant reorganisation and integration of five defence departments.</para><para>Richard Hall was right when he said that Clem was `the brains behind a credible alternative Labor defence policy' in the lead-up to the election of the Whitlam government. Clem resigned from Barnard's staff when Sir Arthur Tange, the permanent Secretary of the Department of Defence, refused to allow Clem to attend a briefing by British Defence Secretary Lord Carrington. As Graham Freudenberg wrote in <inline font-style="italic">A Certain Grandeur, </inline>`his resignation was a deep blow to Barnard and the whole government'. </para><para>On three more occasions in the ensuing 10 years he was to work at Parliament House: twice with Tom Uren as press secretary and then as principal private secretary to Bill Hayden. By the 1980s, his attention had turned to academia. He spent eight years at the ANU, and then from 1989 to 2001 he was professor of journalism at the University of Wollongong's Graduate School of Journalism. Late last year he moved to the University of Canberra after being appointed research professor. His was an extraordinary career.</para><para>Given Clem's legendary capacity for food and drink, it seemed appropriate that a memorial gathering for him last month would be held at the Members Dining Room at Old Parliament House. As Andrew Clark said then, `Boldness and bigness were hallmarks of Clem Lloyd. He was a man of big appetites in food, political argument, imbibing, public policy, racing, teaching, music, history, reading and writing.' We heard then of a man who once said, `We may not have the best governments in the world but we sure have the funniest.' We heard of a man who put his lounge furniture out on the nature strip to air, only to be aggrieved when he thought it had been stolen. Not so—just permanently removed because he had managed this exercise on the local rubbish collection day.</para><para>I had a lot to do with Clem last year when we celebrated the centenary of the Federal Parliamentary Labor Party. In fact, Clem Lloyd was the only person to contribute to both the Liberal and Labor Centenary of Federation publications. Clem was one of 26 contributors to our caucus history <inline font-style="italic">True Believers</inline>. I have got to say that I became very agitated when Clem's chapter was the last to arrive. But wasn't it worth waiting for! It was very Clem. He found fascinating new material to open up and explain how caucus and the press gallery interact. At the time of the <inline font-style="italic">True Believers</inline> launch, Clem's research on the relationship between Ben Chifley and the Murdochs—both Sir Keith and Rupert— received much attention. The insights and sharp asides on some familiar national figures included in this chapter were enjoyed by many. Professor Stuart Macintyre said to me recently that Clem had a closer familiarity with the archives than most historians do and a shrewd understanding of the secrets they would tell as well as those they would withhold. All this, and so much more, will be missed.</para><para>At this difficult time we think of Clem's family: his sister Genevieve, his daughter Frances and his wife Beverley, who are in the chamber this evening. Beverley herself has made such a significant contribution to the Labor Party, not least her work with Pat Weller in editing and publishing our caucus minutes from 1901 to 1949 and our Federal Executive minutes from 1915 to 1955. To them goes our very deep and sincere sympathy.</para><para>So, vale, Clem. Your work in the cause of Labor will never be forgotten.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Immigration: Asylum Seekers</title><page.no>78</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>78</page.no><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name><name.id>84P</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This evening I wish to speak about one of our colleagues who I believe has had a series of different public positions on the refugee issue. Madam President, you may recall that in the dying days of the last parliament Michael Gordon in the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> of 22 September 2001 said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Senator Marise Payne, one of a minority of Liberals with serious concerns about the government's approach to asylum seekers, choked up while putting the case for compassion to the Senate.</para></quote><para>Madam President, you may recall that speech. I certainly do, because I think that at that stage Senator Payne, as she had been relegated to No. 3 on the Senate ticket for the coalition in New South Wales, did not think she would be re-elected. So I suppose Senator Payne had the opportunity then to get off her chest, so to speak, what she actually believed about the issue that is confronting political life in Australia today. I will quote Senator Payne from her speech of 19 September. She said: </para><quote><para>I think there are popular commentators in this country who are now exploiting this debate in a most disgraceful fashion.</para></quote><para>That is not her Prime Minister; that is popular commentators. Later she said:</para><quote><para>I want to emphasise, as the Prime Minister has, that we and every country have the right to decide who comes to our country and in what circumstances. That must be the basis of our approach. In terms of asylum seekers and refugees, we must be able to return the non-genuine refugees.</para></quote><para>In the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> article of September, once again Senator Payne is quoted by Mr Gordon as saying that it is crucial to deal with our current challenges in a considered, logical and positive way, not by scaremongering or engendering discrimination.</para><para>This is what Senator Payne had been saying, as she believed she would not be re-elected to the Senate. She may be a person of conscience who put her heart on her sleeve and told us and the Australian public what her position was about refugees. We also have today's report in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> where Senator Payne was one of four Liberal MPs who allegedly spoke in favour of a softer approach on detention at yesterday's Liberal party room meeting. As I say, Senator Payne may or may not be a person of conscience. That may be the situation for some inner-city trendies like Senator Payne, where she has been addressing rallies and she has been making it clear in the party room what her position is, so we are advised by the newspapers. No doubt she has been advising her inner-city constituents where she stands on this great political issue of the day. </para><para>As I said, in September Senator Payne did not think she would be re-elected. But as the election unfolded Senator Marise Payne, who happens to be the Liberal duty senator for Eden-Monaro, issued this letter. She spent probably thousands of dollars sending direct mail letters to constituents in the Liberal held marginal seat of Eden-Monaro. Let me tell you what Senator Payne was saying to those constituents. She said that she supported the Prime Minister's belief that Australians should decide who comes to this country and the circumstances in which they come and that she shared his commitment to upgrade our maritime surveillance capability by purchasing new long-range surveillance aircraft and state-of-the-art radar and telecommunications technology.</para><para>For anybody reading that letter, that was the line Prime Minister was putting out, which is so inconsistent with what Senator Payne allegedly had been arguing privately in her party room and had been arguing subsequently in the press. Senator Payne has used thousands of dollars to advocate the party's position advocated by the Prime Minister which has been a hardline attitude on the refugees and the detention centres. Let us make no bones about it: it is the hard line. We have been told by Senator Payne through the press and through her bleeding heart speech here on 19 September that she thinks there should be some sort of more compassionate position. But when her bottom was on the line, due to the fact that if she did not get that third Senate spot, if she did not get the votes in New South Wales, she was going to exit this place on 1 July, she wrote that letter.</para><para>You may well recall, Madam President, that after the election the federal Liberal Party director Mr Lynton Crosby revealed that 10 per cent of people who voted Liberal did so because of the boat people issue. Here we have a juxtaposition where one of these holier than thou Liberals, one of these `small l' liberals, came in here and said what she thinks may be her conscience, and had leaked in the papers what her `small l' liberal colleagues would have us believe, yet when her bum is on the line she writes to her constituents in the Liberal-held marginal seat of Eden-Monaro and advocates the hard line that the Prime Minister has been pushing around the country since the <inline font-style="italic">Tampa</inline> crisis started.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Senator, I would ask you to watch the language.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>84P</name.id><name role="metadata">Hutchins, Sen Steve</name><name role="display">Senator HUTCHINS</name></talker><para>—I will, Madam President. I apologise. All I would ask of Senator Payne is this: I would like to know what her current position is. Now that she is well ensconced in her seat for another six years after 1 July, I suppose she feels she has some liberty to run around and say what she really feels. These letters were sent to people and funded by the taxpayers of Australia. I would ask that Senator Payne come in here at some stage and repudiate this letter that she sent to the constituents of Eden-Monaro and tell us exactly where she does stand. In her public statements she is advocating a position that is held by the Prime Minister and the majority of the government, yet in all the press reports and leaks that we see she is totally opposed to it. On 19 September in this Senate—it was reported in the papers that she nearly broke down in tears—when her seat was on the line she advocated a position she believed to be harsh and unconscionable. I ask her to come in here at some stage and repudiate this letter and tell us where she stands. </para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.19

To date, $5.13 million has been spent on both legal and compensation costs. It is not possible to provide a further breakdown of legal and compensation costs.</para><para>(5)	The Special Administrative Scheme was announced on 4 September 1989 and is administered by the Minister for Industry, Science and Resources. Changes to the Scheme were announced on 10 February 1995 and it now provides for the payment of compensation to those Australian participants (or their dependants) in the British atomic tests program who developed leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) in the first 25 years after participation in the tests program.</para><para>The decision to commence the Scheme was based on the results of a study undertaken by the UK National Radiological Protection Board (NRPB) of the health of participants in the British atomic tests program. The study, published in 1988, showed a possible increase in risk of test participants developing multiple myeloma and leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia). The UK Government then extended its war pensions scheme to cover British test participants with these conditions. As the activities of Australian and UK personnel at the sites were similar it was decided by the Australian Government to introduce a scheme to cover Australian participants.</para><para>Following the publication of a follow-up NRPB study in December 1993, the UK Government decided to accept new claims only where leukaemia (other than chronic lymphatic leukaemia) had developed in the first 25 years after participation in the atomic tests. On 10 February 1995 the Australian Government announced changes to the Special Administrative Scheme to reflect these later findings. </para><para> (6)	and (7) The Government will consider reviewing the Special Administrative Scheme and the Act of Grace Scheme if the results of the current health study suggest this is appropriate.</para><para>(8)	The preliminary version of the Nominal Roll of Australian participants in the British Atomic Tests Program conducted in Australia from 1952-1963 at present contains 16,716 names. The names on the Roll are in the following categories:</para><para>·	Navy—3,268;</para><para>·	Army—1,657;</para><para>·	RAAF—3,201; and</para><para>·	8,590 civilians, including 10 indigenous people.</para><para>Pastoralists are not identified separately within the civilian group.</para><para>(9)	It is not possible to provide an answer to this question at this stage. However, the Cancer Incidence and Mortality Study will match data with national cancer registers and death certificates. The information obtained from the Study will provide an estimate of the number of atomic tests participants who have died since the tests.</para><para>(10)	The preliminary Nominal Roll referred to in (8) has categories for civilian personnel, defence service personnel and indigenous people. </para><para>The definition of an Australian 'Atomic Participant' for the purpose of the Roll is someone who was present, either working or as a visitor, in at least one of the testing areas whilst a test or tests were conducted in that area, or were there within a 2-year period after the explosions.</para><para>The Roll has been compiled by examining Department of Defence records (including ship lists of the involved HMA Ships, Routine Orders from the Army Units known to have been involved, and identified RAAF Squadrons and Squadron members), personnel records of private firms engaged for the purposes of conducting and supporting the tests, the Report of the Royal Commission into Atomic Testing (1986) and records of the issue of Maralinga Security Cards. Documents prepared previously for the purposes of listing participants in the tests and other documents provided by the various 'nuclear veteran' associations were also examined for any additional names and identifying details.</para><para>The names on the Roll have also been checked against the list of radiation-exposed personnel compiled by JR Maroney in the Australian Radiation Laboratory document `<inline font-style="italic">Personal Monitor Records From Exposure To Beta And Gamma Radiation During Engagement In The Program Of British Nuclear Weapons Tests In Australia</inline>', dated 10/12/1984.</para><para>The Roll contains the names of ten aboriginal residents who were present in the testing areas. Obtaining a comprehensive list of aboriginal people who were exposed to the tests because they were in the area is extremely difficult. It is recognised, therefore, that there are names of aboriginal people, who were in the area, that are missing from the Roll. This is partly because population information from the relevant communities (Yalata, Koonibba, Ernabella, Maralinga Tjarutja, Pitjantjatjara, Yankunytjara, Wallatinna, Ngaanyatjarra, Marble Bar and Cundeellee) was not sought or obtained at the time of the testing program and partly because movement of indigenous people through the restricted area during the testing period, may not have been effectively policed.</para><para>Similarly, a lack of contemporary population information on the residents of pastoral properties, which may have included some aboriginal people, means that the Roll may not include that group if they were not included as part of the information in other documents. However, the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Commission (ATSIC) have a representative on the Atomic Tests Participants Consultative Forum chaired by the Department of Veterans' Affairs (DVA). Officers from DVA and ATSIC are working together to identify sources from which this information may be obtained.</para><para>(11)	The Department of Industry, Science and Resources holds records for defence personnel and civilians involved at both the Emu Plain and Monte Bello Island Atomic Tests. These documents include a Nominal Roll for Australian participants at Emu Plain, Australian Radiation Laboratory records of radiation dose readings, Ship Lists for the 1952 and 1956 Monte Bello Island tests and RAAF lists for both Emu Plain and the Monte Bello Islands. </para><para> (12)	and (13)</para><para>(a)	No comparison has yet been done between the Atomic Tests Participants Nominal Roll and DVA data bases to determine the number of atomic tests participants in receipt of a disability pension. Such a comparison would be time consuming and could not be completed until the Nominal Roll was finalised.</para><para>(b)	No disability pension paid by DVA would be paid for illnesses relating to atomic testing. Atomic testing is not service covered by the Veterans' Entitlements Act 1986. Therefore, all pensions paid by DVA are for conditions arising from service other than atomic testing.</para><para>(14)	The Special Administrative Scheme and the Act of Grace Scheme were announced through the issue of separate Ministerial media releases. In addition, the plaintiff for common law actions, Maurice May and Company, has been regularly provided information on the two schemes for distribution to their clients. The Government has also directly provided potential claimants with details of the two schemes in response to requests for information through correspondence with Ministers or officials, and has provided information directly to Atomic Test Veterans' groups for circulation to its members. </para><para>Senator Gareth Evans, the then Minister for Resources and Energy announced the then Government's response to the Royal Commission into British Nuclear Tests in Australia, as recorded in Hansard on 17 September 1986. In that response, Senator Evans announced the Government's intention to establish a scheme to allow claims to be considered under the Compensation (Commonwealth Employees) Act 1971, to be administered by the Department of Social Security. The Minister also extended an invitation to the Aboriginal communities' legal representative to submit claims for compensation.</para><para>Australian defence personnel have previously been made aware of the role of the MCRS through media releases and information made available to members at their workplace. </para><para>(15)	This allegation received media attention in 1984 and was brought to the attention of the Royal Commission and is referred to in the list of exhibits at the back of the Report.

In every case, the second community nursing providers accepted the veterans and war widows at the original funding level offered. </para><para>The Department is not aware of any veterans or war widows going into nursing homes or hostels because of the funding offered to community nursing providers. </para><para>(6)	At the time of the implementation of the reform process in the community nursing program, the Department entered into a limited and fixed term contract for the management of exceptional cases with MACSEARCH LTD, the research and consulting company of the University of Western Sydney, Macarthur. At the cessation of the contract, the Exceptional Case Unit (ECU) was established to manage applications for exceptional cases. While the ECU is attached to the Department, independent contractors staff it. These contractors have specialist community nursing skills.</para><para>(7)	(a)	For the 2000/2001 financial year, the Department expended $49,756,944.74 on the community nursing program.</para><para>(b)	The expenditure for administration and the audit process was $567,677 or 1.14 % of the total expenditure. </para><para>(8)	Clause 2, Section 2 in the current contractual arrangement relates to the replacement of personnel by the contractor. The Clause neither mentions free speech nor places any restrictions on it.</para><para>(9)	The Department removed consumables from the community nursing fee in the May 2001 contract. The decision was based on findings of the Fees Review that identified a number of issues with the system including significant variations between organisations in expenditure on consumables. These variations indicated that some providers were obtaining the consumables used during nursing visits through the Rehabilitation Appliances Scheme (RAP) or through the Rehabilitation Pharmaceuticals Benefit Scheme (RPBS), despite their inclusion in the fees.</para><para>The removal of consumables from the schedule of fees also allowed providers equal access to consumables at no cost to themselves. </para><para>(a)	The removal of consumables from the fee has led to a reduction in some fees. There were other changes in fees, both increases and decreases, associated with the findings and recommendations of the Review of Fees.</para><para>(b)	All veterans and war widows are required to pay a co-payment of $3.50 for pharmaceutical products that are supplied under script by the RPBS. However, when all pharmaceutical purchases exceed the safety net of $182, veterans and war widows do not pay any contribution for further prescriptions.</para><para>Veterans and war widows requiring equipment and “equipment based”consumables such as diabetic or continence products, are supplied through the Rehabilitation Appliances Program (RAP) and do not contribute to the cost of these products.</para><para>(10)	(a)	Assessments are built into the fee for each community nursing classification. Before any community nursing is provided, the provider undertakes a full assessment of the veteran to identify any particular needs and care requirements. With those veterans who have complex care requirements, more than one assessment may be necessary. Often this includes discipline specific or targeted assessments such as for wound assessment, occupational therapy, continence or an Aged Care or ACAT assessment. </para><para>(b)	No, there is no cost shifting to the Aged Care or to state health budgets. Where a veteran or war widow may be unsafe or unable to be cared for any longer at home, they, like all Australian citizens, require an ACAT assessment as an essential and necessary step in gaining appropriate hostel or nursing home admission.</para><para>(11)	Clause 2.2, Section 3 is contained within the Showering Guidelines. The Showering Guidelines reflect current best practice in the aged care field that is to shower a frail, elderly patient two to three times a week. This clause must be read in the context of the provider undertaking a full nursing assessment of the veteran and their living conditions.</para><para>As a person ages, their skin becomes drier and less supple. Frequent washing can strip the body of moisture, causing unhealthy, dry skin in the elderly. Additionally, the process of showering can be fatiguing for the elderly, especially for those people suffering from certain chronic conditions (ie. Chronic Airways Limitation). This creates a situation whereby it is clinically appropriate to limit the number of showers taken by an ageing person. </para><para>Of course, in some circumstances the nursing assessment may identify a need for more frequent showering. This may be because a veteran or war widow has a clinical condition, for example incontinence, or lives in a climate which necessitates a greater level of showering. In these circumstances, funding is available to deliver the appropriate level of showering. </para><para>(12)	The contractual arrangement with community nursing providers outlines the Department's administrative and care requirements. To ensure the adequacy of service arrangements, the Department utilises the services of the state based community nursing advisers, the external audit program and clinical reviews undertaken as a part of the exceptional case process. Combined with industry consultations, and regular surveys of the veteran community, the Department identifies any problems in care so they can be responded to appropriately.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Royal Australian Air Force</title><page.no>114</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3899)</subtitle><id.no>3899</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>114</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 18 September 2001—Further to Senator Brown's Question on Notice No. 3861 (Senate <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline>, 30 August 2001, p.23):</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	(a) When was the last engagement in which RAAF pilots were involved in low-level flying attacks; and (b) does the Minister anticipate that such flying will be used in future engagements with a sophisticated and well-equipped enemy; if so, can the Minister explain the advantages of this form of use of RAAF aircraft; if not, can the Minister explain why training in this form of aircraft use is still being undertaken at the Salt Ash air weapons range.</para><para>(2)	Can the Minister explain why there have been no compensation packages or noise attenuation packages, or even a noise amelioration plan offered to communities which are adversely affected by RAAF operations at the Salt Ash air weapons range.</para><para>(3)	Can the Minister explain why the RAAF base at Williamtown has no dedicated Community Liaison Officer and why there are no lines of direct communication between the RAAF base and the general public.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>114</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	(a)	The last occasion when RAAF fighter pilots were involved in low-level flying attacks, coincident with the last time our fighter force was committed to combat, was during the Korean War.</para><para>	(b)	The professional experience of the RAAF and other air forces shows that fighter pilots must be prepared for a wide range of operational tasks, including low level attacks with basic weapons. The tactical experience and skills acquired in low level attack training with basic weapons are fundamental and critical in allowing fighter pilots to progress to the successful employment of more sophisticated precision weapons.</para><para>(2)	The Salt Ash Air Weapons Range (SAWR) has been used to support training operations from RAAF Williamtown since 1953. The responsibility for land use on non-Commonwealth land resides with local planning authorities. Since 1976, Defence has assisted Port Stephens Council by providing noise exposure forecasts in relation to Defence activities at both the base and SAWR. The noise exposure forecasts enable Council to determine the type of development that would be appropriate in areas in the vicinity of the Range.</para><para>The Air Force has been responsive to community concerns about aircraft noise at the base and SAWR. The outcome of measures previously implemented are that no flying on the Range takes place on weekends unless there are exceptional circumstances, flying is presently limited to approximately 115 days per year and use of the Range by foreign aircraft no longer occurs. </para><para>As part of the noise management process, Defence has engaged a consultant to examine target relocation at SAWR to determine whether this might lessen the overall noise impact on the nearby community. Noise exposure cannot be forecast until possible relocation of targets within SAWR and any associated changes to flight tracks are finalised. In addition, further noise monitoring will be conducted as part of the Hawk Lead-In Fighter Environmental Impact Study.</para><para>The offer of noise attenuation measures for those dwellings in higher noise zones around SAWR is being contemplated. This would apply to residences in the noise zones classified by the Australian Noise Exposure Forecast (ANEF) as being above 30 ANEF and there are expected to be very few dwellings in this classification. These attenuation measures would only be implemented after planning for any target relocation has been finalised. </para><para>The department does not acquire noise-affected property unless there are exceptional circumstances or as part of a voluntary program as has occurred at RAAF Base Williamtown. Notwithstanding, it is not Defence policy to compensate owners of such properties.</para><para>(3)	The Base Commander Williamtown remains the Defence spokesman on base domestic issues and normal lines of communication remain open. Senior military staff at RAAF Base Williamtown continue to fulfill the important task of community liaison and representation, and develop the close relationship with local communities. Information on flying programs, the use of the SAWR and communication procedures is made available to the public through an 1800 telephone number. For nearly three years, RAAF Williamtown has participated in a consultative committee convened by Port Stevens Council to address issues or concerns raised by the community over the RAAF's use of SAWR. The committee has been successful in addressing concerns from residents over SAWR and has just recently been expanded to address a wider range of issues that affects the base and the Port Stephens community, not just issues relating to the Range. The general public is able to make their views known to either the consultative committee or in writing to the Base Commander at RAAF Williamtown.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Seismic Testing</title><page.no>115</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3900)</subtitle><id.no>3900</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>115</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator Bartlett</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for the Environment and Heritage, upon notice, on 19 September 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	How many applications have been received by the Minister under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act for seismic testing in Australian waters.</para><para>(2)	What are the details of applicants and the purposes of the seismic activities.</para><para>(3)	What level of assessment is required for each application.</para><para>(4)	How many, and which, applications have been approved under the Act.</para><para>(5)	How many applications have been refused.</para><para>(6)	How many approvals have been reconsidered.</para><para>(7)	Has the Minister sought any independent advice from experts in marine acoustics in relation to seismic testing in marine waters and assessment of seismic testing applications.</para><para>(8)	Can copies of any independent advice received in relation to seismic testing be provided.</para><para>(9)	When reconsideration of a decision is sought, is further independent advice sought; if so, can details be provided.</para><para>(10)	Are submissions weighted in different ways.</para><para>(11)	What weight is given to different forms of submissions.</para><para>(12)	Did the Minister seek expert advice as part of his reconsideration of the decision in relation to the Strike Oil seismic survey in blue whale habitat off Victoria.</para><para>(13)	What was the source of the advice and the nature of the advice, and what were the recommendations made by all experts</para><para>(14)	If no expert evidence was sought, why not.</para><para>(15)	Was there evidence made available to the Minister that this activity would take place in the blue whale feeding season.</para><para>(16)	What was the evidence, the source and any recommendations made in relation to the evidence.</para><para>(17)	How is this decision seen to be in concert with the provisions to protect endangered species under the Act.</para><para>(18)	Is it correct that Environment Australia is negotiating guidelines for the interaction with seismic vessels.</para><para>(19)	Are these guidelines to be legally binding.</para><para>(20)	When will these guidelines be completed.</para><para>(21)	How will the guidelines ensure no long-term impacts on cetaceans.</para><para>(22)	Will these guidelines consider the cumulative acoustic impacts on cetaceans. </para><para> (23)	Will the government make a commitment to use data collected to review and update the guidelines through an open and independent process.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>116</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for the Environment and Heritage</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for the Environment and Heritage has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	A total of 14 proposals for offshore petroleum-related seismic survey programs were referred under the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 (EPBC Act) up to 16 November 2001. A proposal by the Department of Defence to undertake offshore acoustic trials was also received.</para><para>(2)	Details of the applicants, purpose of the survey and decision under the EPBC Act are in the table below.</para><para>(3)	See table below.</para><para>(4)	Of the 14 proposals for offshore petroleum-related seismic survey programs, 11 have been determined as not controlled actions and do not require approval under the EPBC Act. Of these 11 proposals, 9 must be undertaken in a particular manner to avoid significant impacts on cetaceans. This manner requires specific stated measures to be implemented to avoid and minimise interactions with cetaceans. A number of proposals must also be undertaken within a specified time limit, to avoid periods when whales may be present.</para><para>(5)	The EPBC Act does not provide for referral applications to be 'refused' as such. Proposals determined as likely to have a significant impact on matters protected under the EPBC Act must be assessed and approved under the Act before they can proceed.</para><para>(6)	One offshore petroleum-related seismic program has been reconsidered under section 78 of the EPBC Act to date. This is a survey by Strike Oil NL over about 620 km2 in the Otway Basin, Bass Strait. The then Minister for the Environment, Senator Hill, originally decided that the proposal was a controlled action on 10 January 2001. Strike Oil subsequently provided substantial new information stating that the survey would be timed to avoid the key Blue Whale feeding season and migrating Southern Right Whales. After considering this new information Senator Hill made a new decision on 15 August 2001 that the proposal was not a controlled action provided it was undertaken in accordance with stringent conditions to avoid times when whales were likely to be present, and in accordance with specified cetacean interaction procedures to minimise risks to any whales that could incidentally be present.</para><para>(7)	Independent expert advice is available to my Department and is called on as required. In addition, independent comment is frequently received from outside agencies or individuals on specific proposals. All referrals, where the person making the referral states their belief that significant impacts on matters protected under the EPBC Act are not expected or likely, are made available on my Department's web site for public comment.</para><para>(8)	I do not propose to provide copies of advice at this stage. The extent and type of any independent advice varies from proposal to proposal and some may be confidential. My Department advises that providing this advice for every proposal would take considerable resources.</para><para>(9)	See answers to question (6) and question (7). Independent advice will be sought if required to make a decision.</para><para>(10)	All submissions will be considered, if relevant to matters protected under the EPBC Act, in deciding whether or not actions are controlled actions. </para><para>(11)	See answer to question (10).</para><para>(12)	Expert advice and information, relevant to the likely presence of Blue Whales, was obtained from a variety of sources by my Department and taken into account by Senator Hill in reconsidering the Strike Oil NL proposed seismic survey in Bass Strait (see also answer to question (6)).</para><para>(13)	See answer to question (12).</para><para>(14)	See answer to question (12).</para><para>(15)	The reconsideration decision took into account available information about Blue Whale feeding patterns and timing.

These guidelines are available on the Department's web-site and published.</para><para>(19)	No. The guidelines identify how seismic operations should be carried out so as to minimise the likelihood of the operation having a significant impact on a cetacean species or interfering with an individual cetacean. It is, however, the responsibility of the company to determine how they undertake their operations in order to comply with the Act.</para><para>(20)	See answer to question (18).</para><para>(21)	The guidelines identify world's best practice methods of minimising the likelihood of interfering with individual cetaceans. The guidelines also identify stringent operational constraints in migratory pathways, feeding areas, breeding areas and resting areas for cetacean species where these are known. By minimising the impacts on individual animals, the guidelines ensure that there will be no long-term impacts on cetaceans arising from seismic surveys.</para><para>(22)	My Department has received no evidence to support cumulative acoustic impacts on cetaceans. </para><para>(23)	Yes. </para><para>Offshore Seismic Proposals Referred under EPBC Act </para><para>(up to 30/09/01)

The Minister has been advised that this will mean that the total number of Tiger helicopters to be procured by the French Government over the period 2003 to 2008 is 50 HAP variants. This information was received by the Australian Government in the Eurocopter International Pacific tender submitted on 30 April 2001 and at briefings with the members of the joint Franco-German Tiger Project Office on 6 August 2001.

This means that there will obviously be some to and fro between the short-listed tenderers and us'; and (b) was the same procedure described to Aircraft and Aerospace and reported in its August 2001 issue (p.14), in these words by Colonel Patch, the Defence Materiel Organisation's director of Project AIR 87: `Following the short-listing, the project team will work closely with the two finalists to ensure their respective contracts were the best possible “value for money” packages, before a winner is selected'.</para><para>(2)	On what date were the Senate, the defence community and the unsuccessful tenderers informed that the procedure described by the Under Secretary and the project director had been dispensed with.</para><para>(3)	Why was the procedure dispensed with. </para><para> (4)	Did the Minister state, at a press conference on 10 August 2001, that the successful tenderer `was chosen because it was good value for money'.</para><para>(5)	By what means was the Minister or the department able to determine what was good value for money when all tenderers were given to understand (see (1) above) that the precise issue was only going to be addressed after the short-listing to two alternative contracts had been decided.</para><para>(6)	By what means was the Minister in a position to determine that a `premium' for interoperability (Defence White Paper, paragraph 6.35) was not appropriate in the present case, given that the possible size of any such premium could not have been determined at the time of his announcement on 10 August 2001.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>122</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—the answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	(a) and (b)	On the release of the Request for Tender on 18 December 2000, Defence has continually emphasised that the Request for Tenders document has primacy over all other forms of communication between the Commonwealth and the AIR 87 tenderers. In the Request for Tenders it states that “The Commonwealth reserves the right to shortlist tenderers at any time during the evaluation process” and further “The Commonwealth reserves (the right to) conduct negotiations with one or more shortlisted tenderers. At the time of both statements being made, the expectation was that the process would be as described by the Under Secretary and the project director. Subsequently, the evaluation of the tenders indicated that there was a stand-out tender which offered better value for money than the other three. In accordance with the conditions of the Request for Tenders, and to minimise the cost of tendering, the Commonwealth opted to shortlist to a single tenderer and set a further tenderer aside for further evaluation if required.</para><para>(2)	The decision to accept only one tenderer into the detailed evaluation phase of Project AIR 87 was noted by the Government on 8 August 2001. To my knowledge, the Senate has not been informed formally of the decision. The unsuccessful tenderers were advised of the decision by letter on 9 August 2001. The Defence community was advised formally at the Minister's Press Conference on 10 August 2001.</para><para>(3)	Defence has not dispensed with its published procedure which allows the Commonwealth to shortlist and enter into negotiations with one or more shortlisted tenderers. </para><para>(4)	Yes.</para><para>(5)	The tenderers were advised in the Request for Tenders that the “Tenders are to be evaluated on the basis of best value for money consistent with Commonwealth purchasing policies.' Again, the expectation was that this would evolve in the comparison of shortlisted tenders. However, the evaluation showed that one tenderer stood out as offering best value for money. As a result, and in accordance with the conditions of the Request for Tenders, only one tender was progressed to the detailed evaluation phase with a second tender set aside for possible further evaluation.</para><para>(6)	The term premium as used in the Defence White Paper (paragraph 6.35) refers to the emphasis placed on interoperability with our allies. As indicated in paragraph 6.34 of the Defence White Paper, interoperability is about more than just the helicopter itself. The Tiger helicopter is based on NATO standards and axiomatically offers a high level of interoperability. But interoperability is also about training, support and maintenance, logistics, intelligence, doctrine and many other contributing elements. In this regard the Tiger will be fully integrated into the Australian Defence Force and will share the interoperability our forces currently share with our allies and other countries with whom we might want to operate in coalition. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics</title><page.no>122</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 3910)</subtitle><id.no>3910</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>122</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, upon notice, on 27 September 2001:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Does the Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics receive any private sector funds and/or sponsorship and/or payments for the development of its climate change models or climate change economic projects; if so can details be provided about the private sector sources of funds.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>122</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator Alston</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>In the calendar year 2001 ABARE has received private sector funding in the form of consultancy contracts from the following private sector clients: the Minerals Council of Australia, the Western Australian Minerals Council, Meyrick and Associates, and the World Bank.

The Department is a tenant in a number of buildings including the heritage listed John Gorton building located in the Parliamentary Triangle. The Department of Finance and Administration, the building owner, is ultimately responsible for maintaining the heritage values of the property. The Department's other Canberra based tenancies are modern privately owned commercial buildings of no heritage significance. The Department has responsibility for a number of Commonwealth National Parks and other areas, Antarctic and sub-Antarctic properties and Marine Protected Areas. Some of these areas contain places of indigenous heritage significance or historic heritage significance. The Department also has responsibility for historic shipwrecks. The Department does not own or have responsibility for any other properties. Heritage values are addressed in Plans of Management and other management arrangements for reserved areas. The Australian Antarctic Division (AAD) examines the Antarctic and sub-Antarctic properties for which it has responsibility on an ongoing basis as visits to these remote sites allow. The most recent was a visit by the AAD to Heard Island over the summer of 2000-01 during which information was gathered for the purpose of revising the management plan for this World Heritage listed property. A draft revised management plan is expected to be made available for public comment in 2002. The heritage values of shipwrecks are documented in cooperation with the States on an on-going basis; (b) see answer to question (a).</para><para>(2)	Yes, the Department gives full consideration to the requirements of the Australian Heritage Commission Act in relation to the John Gorton Building before making any recommendations or requests to the building owner for any changes. The ultimate responsibility for ensuring the requirements of the heritage order are met lies with the Department of Finance and Administration as the building owner. For areas for which the Department has responsibility, heritage values are protected by statute and through management arrangements. For example, Parks Australia has responsibility for Commonwealth managed national parks and reserves and Calperum, part of the Bookmark Biosphere Reserve, all of which have arrangements in place for conservation of heritage values covered through the Plans of Management and other management arrangements. </para><para> (3)	(a)	Reserved areas do not have specific budgets for maintenance and conservation works on any contained historic properties. Budget for maintenance and conservation works on heritage properties for which the AAD is responsible is not differentiated from the Division's general operating expenses.

In 2001-02 the value of the program is $381,000;</para><para>	(b)	Specific grants of $250,000 in 1997-98, $250,000 in 1998-99 and $60,000 in 2000-01 were provided to the Australian Associated Press (AAP) Mawson's Huts Foundation for the conservation of the Mawson's Huts historic site in Antarctica.
