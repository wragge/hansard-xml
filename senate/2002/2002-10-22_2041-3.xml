I am not sure of the date of the email. I now will have to go back and check that. I repeat what I said yesterday: it is my understanding that it was a response to Defence staff who had sought advice in relation to Defence travel, and in their request for advice at least some had made mention of Bali. Therefore, the response was couched in terms of a request that had been received for travel advice to Indonesia, including Bali. That was the way in which the reference to Bali was included.

Of course, there are now daily operational updates from the Australian Federal Police which are concerned with more operational matters. I thank Senator Macdonald for his question, which really relates to a wider context, and that is in relation to the ongoing cooperation that is needed between Indonesia and Australia with regard to counter-terrorism. We welcomed last Friday's announcement that the Indonesian President, President Megawati Sukarnoputri, had issued two presidential decrees in relation to counter-terrorism. That effectively incorporated counter-terrorism legislation which was before the Indonesian parliament. This presents further opportunity for cooperation between Indonesia and Australia. </para></talk.start><para>One aspect which especially concerns my portfolio is the question of extradition. Dual criminality is the basis of any extradition, and now that those decrees have been brought into place we are exploring the question of extradition arrangements between Indonesia and Australia in relation to anyone who has been engaged in terrorist activities.</para><para>Another aspect relating to this issue is the question of the financing of terrorism. There have been numerous press reports in relation to the financing of terrorist groups in our region and indeed the relationship of that to the attack in Bali. When I met with my counterpart, the Minister for Justice, Mr Mahendra, I indicated to him that Australia would do everything it could to assist Indonesia on the question of tracking the terrorist financing. To that end, AUSTRACâwhich is our own agency that deals with thatâis an excellent agency and is well placed to offer that assistance. The indication that I had from the Indonesian government was that it wanted to work with Australia in relation to that.</para><para>Prior to the attack in Bali, an announcement had been made that Indonesia and Australia would cohost the conference in Jakarta on 11 and 12 December this year which will deal with the financing of terrorism. That is a very important conference, especially so in view of what has happened in Bali. The conference will be cohosted by Indonesia and Australia, and we anticipate that there will be a number of countries attending from the region. This will offer a great opportunity for enhancing cooperation between countries in our region in relation to tracking the financing of terrorist groups and terrorist activities. This is, of course, the lifeblood of any terrorist activity. We have seen with Operation Greenquest in the United States the extent to which funds can be involved in alleged terrorist activities, and large amounts of money have been frozen there as a result of that.</para><para>There are other aspects, apart from the investigation into counter-terrorism measures, which are involved, one of which is disaster victim identification. As I have indicated to the Senate, CrimTrac is involved in this. We will be introducing into parliament an amendment bill to deal with CrimTrac. CrimTrac was originally designed as a criminal investigative tool. The bill, which is an urgent bill, will allow CrimTrac to be used for the purposes of disaster victim identification and will also be extended to assist the families of those foreign nationals who were victims during that attack and whom we are trying to identify. This piece of legislation is a very important one in extending the applicability of CrimTrac to the Bali tragedy. In that legislation, we are also making provision for future terrorist incidents whereby it can be determined by the minister of the day that these mechanisms can be invoked. That, of course, is subject to disallowance and provides that accountability. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Dr Allan Hawke</title><page.no>5578</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>5578</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Hill, Minister for Defence.

Mr Smith was due to start mid-November. He is now staying on a little longer in Indonesia, given the current circumstances.

This credit rating is very important, because it affects not only the Commonwealth but all the other key players in the Australian economy, like the state governments and our companies, who can now be re-rated, because they cannot have higher ratings than the country itself. Now that that ceiling has been lifted, they can be re-rated. That will enable them to borrow at a lower risk premium, and their financial position will be strengthened as a result. This upgrading of our credit rating after some 16 years below AAA has been warmly welcomed.

I think that this credit rating upgrade is an appropriate, timely reward and recognition for the good economic management that this government has delivered since its election in 1996.</para><para>The Chief Economist of HSBC, John Edwards, this month issued a report which said that our great Australian economic growth is expected to remain strong, despite the international downturn and the very difficult conditions in other markets. His analysis not only points out that we are well placed looking into the immediate future but that the Australian economy has performed extremely well in recent years while global growth has been slowing and very unstable. We welcome praise from a former senior adviser to a Labor Prime Minister, but Dr Edwards is not alone in his view. You will recall that the IMF recently predicted that Australia's economic growth would continue to be among the highest of any developed country this year and certainly into next year. This comes on the back of the IMF's annual assessment of the Australian economy, in which the IMF highlighted the importance of our government's policy actions in improving significantly the domestic economic environment. So, despite what are obviously some of the most tumultuous events Australia has ever experienced in peacetime, we as a government will continue to work very hard to sustain what has been a strong economic performance in recent times. </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Information Technology: Security</title><page.no>5580</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>5580</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Alston, the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts.

The government is working to create a secure and trusted environment, through its own strategies to assist Commonwealth government agencies to improve their resilience to electronic security attacks and through the work of the business-government task force on critical infrastructure. The government has created a new working group focused on creating a culture of security across agencies. The working group will report directly to the E-Security Coordination Group and is developing a work program designed to assist agencies to become more secure by employing relevant security tools and strategies.</para></talk.start></continue><para>On 11 September, the working group ran a seminar which addressed e-security in the Commonwealth government context and was attended by representatives of 62 government agencies. The workshop was held to assist agencies in their compliance with the ANAO's best practice guidelines for online security. These guidelines and the associated checklist are based on the <inline font-style="italic">Protective Security Manual</inline> and the Australian communications electronic security instructions. The business-government task force on critical infrastructure protectionâconsisting of the CEOs of some of Australia's major infrastructure owners, senior officers from companies and representatives of state and federal governmentsâmet recently, and again the main object of the meeting was to obtain business input into the assessment of current arrangements. A number of very important issues have been addressed by the task force, and the full report and recommendations have been presented to the government for consideration. I think it is fair to say that we certainly cannot overestimate the importance of these issues. Clearly, all government agencies are expected to continually review and, if necessary, upgrade their protective arrangements. But, in terms of a whole-of-government approach, in that budget decision and the flow-on, we have ensured that there is the maximum degree of coordination and, obviously, ongoing attention to these important issues. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5581</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I have a supplementary question.

I am glad the minister mentioned the budget. How can this government claim that $24.2 million provided in the budget for the protection of our national information infrastructureâor a mere 32c per man, woman and child in Australiaâwill be sufficient to protect these sectors, when the United States government is spending around $A28 per head of population?

But, ultimately, government has to take its own decisions in relation to its own security arrangements, based on the best advice that we get from all the specialist agencies. We are in the process of coordinating that as well as taking advice from the task force. The amount you spend depends on the level of need. I am sure you know that, but obviously it suits your purposes to ask silly questions suggesting that somehow the Americans are spending more money than we are and that therefore we should be spending as much as they are, presumably pro rata, without any regard to the level of need. Anyone who has been to the US would know that they have massive needs and they probably regard themselves as a very high risk target. I have had discussions with them about these issues.

He will be discussing that matter with the premiers and chief ministers. I think it is important to remember, however, that we need to look at the situation of this particular tragedy. I have written to the minister for police in Victoria, Mr Haermeyer, to ascertain the details of what took place: how the guns were obtained and the circumstances of the tragedy. I think it is important that we look at that closely.</para></talk.start><para>As far as the measures that have been taken are concerned, the Commonwealth has introduced stringent regulations in relation to the importation and use of hand guns. Certainly, the Commonwealth led the Nationwide Agreement on Firearms Control in 1996. It increased penalties in the year 2000, making offences relating to the smuggling or importing of prohibited firearms a criminal offence, punishable on conviction by a penalty of up to a quarter of a million dollars or 10 years jail or both. We tightened import restrictions in April last year, requiring that the sale of imported hand guns needs permission from the state and territory police. We must remember the role that state and territory governments play in relation to the licensing and regulation of firearms in their respective jurisdictions. We introduced tougher controls on the importation of hand gun frames and receivers, which we found were being converted and activated for use by the criminal sectors of the community. We promoted the National Firearms Trafficking Policy Agreement and announced that we would introduce legislation for a Commonwealth offence for the illegal trafficking of firearms across state and territory borders. This, of course, relies on the constitutional powers that the Commonwealth has. You have to remember that we have a federation where the day-to-day control of firearms rests with the states and territories. Also, at the last Police Ministers Council we adopted a firearms trafficking agreement which was a move towards more uniform gun laws in Australia. At a meeting in two weeks time between the police ministers of Australia and me, firearms is definitely on the agenda, and that was put on the agenda prior to the tragedy which has just occurred at Monash University. </para><para>We have also tightened our import controls in relation to the surveillance of what comes in over the border. One hundred per cent of postal items are either X-rayed or inspectedâindeed, any parcel capable of carrying a gun or gun part through Australia Post is X-rayed or inspected. Seventy per cent of all air cargo consignments entering Australia are X-rayed, and we are introducing into the ports of Australia for the first time container X-ray provisions; in November this year we will see the first facility of its kind being opened at Melbourne. After my recent visit to the United States, I can tell you that this is state-of-the-art material in relation to X-raying containers at our ports. We will be introducing these measures at ports in Sydney, Brisbane and Fremantle over the ensuing 12 months.

No, I do not agree with that. What the OECD statistics show is that, taking account of all levels of government, Australia is the sixth lowest taxing nation out of 30 OECD countries in the year 2000. That is, in fact, what I said yesterday. The Commonwealth's budget papers clearly show that the Commonwealth's tax share has actually decreased under this government. Commonwealth general government sector cash taxation revenue, as a proportion of GDP, has declined from 23.9 per cent of GDP in 1999-2000 to 21.7 per cent in 2001 and it is estimated that it will fall to 21 per cent of GDP in 2002-03.</para></talk.start><para>Care of course needs to be taken in interpreting the 2000-01 estimate. Australia's tax burdenâand this seems to be where people got excitedâwas temporarily higher in 2001 as a result of the transition to the new tax system from 1 July 2000. In particular, the OECD statistics show that taxes on corporate income in Australia did increase from 4.9 per cent to 6.5 per cent in 2000-01. The increase largely reflected the one-off impact of the bringing forward of company tax assessments, which represented about one per cent of GDP. With the passing of this effect, the Commonwealth's tax to GDP ratio fell from 21.7 per cent in 2001 to 20.6 per cent in 2001-02.</para><para>The OECD statistics in future years will also reflect further reductions in state and territory taxes agreed under the new tax system, which will reduce Australia's total tax to GDP ratio. It is important to recognise the impact of tax relief provided through the rebates which are accounted for as outlays but which are essentially tax refunds. I can go on and give examplesâI am sure I am going to get a supplementaryâbut the short answer to Senator Webber's question is that the position I referred to yesterday was absolutely correct.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5583</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMr President, I ask a supplementary question.

This is lower than the total revenue of 24.1 per cent of GDP in 1995-96. It is wrong to say that levies are simply a way of disguising the fact that this is a big taxing government.

Grants range from $5,000 to $250,000, with the average grant being about $50,000, and they are awarded through a competitive, merit based process. Preference will be given to those applications which show distinct benefits for small business in regional Australia, those that have community support and those that will have a long-term impact on the local economy.

It also focuses on the business skills of women in small business, who form a significant element of the sector. The enterprise culture program is designed to help address some of the problems facing small businesses in regional Australia. One of the major hurdles facing small businesses in regional Australia is the difficulty in accessing the knowledge base that will improve their business. Through the program they can arrange workshops and mentoring services that will help them to run their businesses. A healthy business leads to a thriving economy and that generates the much needed jobs that are so vital in the regional areas of Australia, such as the Hunter region and, indeed, in my home state of Tasmania. As I have previously explained to the Senate, small business employs almost 50 per cent of Australia's work force and has witnessed substantial jobs growth.

We actually do think that it is a good thing for people to be able to borrow money at low interest rates to fund their own home. This is a good thing.

To get any sense of debt of either a nation or a family or an individual you must look at their total position. The fact is that Australians now have much more in the way of net assets than they have probably ever had. Under this government, the net worth of households has risen on average by more than nine per cent per annum. We saw recent figures that showed that over the last six to eight years the net worth of Australians has increased some 40 per cent. They have had real wage increases under our government that they never had under that lot when they were in government.

She has a longstanding interest in the delivery of welfare and other benefits to Australian citizens. It is true, Mr President, that the government is immensely proud of Centrelink, the government services delivery agency. Frankly, it took the good sense of two women to set it up in 1997; namely, I and Senator Newman. Prior to that, the boys had an arrangement whereby you would not put an office more than 15 minutes away from another one so that customers did not take too long to walk between the two, which was pretty stupid. Now it has been put together, because we recognise we have to serve Australian citizens.  </para></talk.start><para>Centrelink officers deserve congratulations because they are on the front line every day dealing with customers who contact either a customer service centre or a call centre because they are in need of help. They do an excellent job. They have a customer satisfaction level of 85 per centâfar higher than Labor got in Cunningham, I notice, and I am happy to say in a bipartisan way that their customer service satisfaction rating is higher than we get in any of our seats as well. But it is quite a bit higher than Labor got in Cunningham. In any event it is a great achievement, given the scale of the organisation, to get that level of customer satisfaction, and that is citizenship satisfaction. They have got over 24,000 staff in 430 customer service centres. They distribute over $51 billion in payments to nearly 6Â½ million customers. They administer 140 different products and services for 20 different agencies. </para><para>The model is so successful that I understand the United Kingdom are very close to following it. I recently saw Andrew Smith, the Secretary of State for Work and Pensions, and they are looking at merging the UK Benefits Agency and the Employment Service to create a national network of one-stop shops for unemployed and other claimants. They are also looking at a `revolutionary change'âas they describe itâto focus on services for different client groups, which of course Centrelink started doing some time ago. China is also looking at modelling a government services delivery agency along the lines of ours. </para><para>Last year, Centrelink received over 250 international delegations. That is an indication of the level of interest shown internationally in the reform of the welfare sector implemented by this government. Centrelink is truly a revolutionary achievement for Australia, not simply because of the design put on it by this government but also because of the work done in it by the people who really are Centrelink. They do not rest on their laurels; they are committed to continuous improvement in their performance. </para><para>I am pleased to advise the Senate that only recently one of the Centrelink call centres won the Teleservices Centre of the Year award in the 50 staff or more category at the 2002 national awards dinner on Friday night. The Liverpool call centre was named as the joint winner of this prestigious national award. It has an exceptional multilingual service, regular services in 22 languages and a callback service for many other languages. It is a unique commitment to multicultural Australia. Teleservicing is an increasingly competitive industry and we are very proud that Centrelink could compete with the private sector and win this award. We have the largest single-purpose call centre network in Australia, receiving over 23 million phone calls each year in 27 award winning call centres around the nation. Two-thirds of those are in regional Australia. The banks might be moving out of the bush but Centrelink is moving in, with 127 access points, 320 Centrelink agents and 140 visiting services to smaller communities.

It is a matter for the minister to decide to what extent and when he might release details of the submissions that have been received, unless that has already been spelt out in the original announcementâof which, presumably, Senator Carr would be aware. If he is not, then one can assume that it is a matter of discretion and the government will make that decision in due course. The government is committed to the safe management of Australia's radioactive waste for the benefit and wellbeing of the Australian community. We are pursuing the establishment of purpose-built national facilities for the management of radioactive waste arising from the use of radionuclides in medicine, research and industry. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The South Australian government's legislation to ban the establishment of the national repository is inconsistent with a previously agreed national approach to disposal of low-level radioactive waste and sits uneasily with the lack of any coherent plan by South Australia to deal with its waste. The South Australian government's policy fails to recognise that, given the small amount of radioactive waste that Australia generates, national facilities make sense. It also fails to recognise the benefit South Australians receive from the use of radioactive materials in medicine, research and industry, including the benefits provided by the Lucas Heights research reactor. So it really is a classic example of Labor in opposition running around trying to drum up any local community scare campaign, because people will always be afraid of the future if you tell them that the sky is about to fall in, and particularly if you do not tell them of the corollary benefits which, of course, you readily acknowledge when in government. You would be out there spruiking about how important it was to get the balance right, to minimise any dangers but at the same time to recognise the enormous research potential for lifesaving and life-enhancing research activities. </para><para>It is a bit hard to take people like Senator Carr seriously. I know the Left feels bruised and irrelevant. Perhaps it is about to make a comeback in the wake of the fiasco last Saturday. In fact, you will have to do a lot better than those sorts of scare campaigns. The people of Wollongong, for example, were subjected to nothing but a Telstra scare campaignâit was untimed local calls one day, it was price caps the next day and it was local call rates having gone up. Telstra was going to be the big issue in Cunningham, just as it was going to be the big issue in the last federal election. Imagine what they would have done without that scare campaignâit really is horrifying to think about, isn't it?

This has been going on now for 6Â½ years and nothing changes. We heard an answer today that was deliberately designed to mislead the Australian public. They set out to try and not answer the questionâa specific question about corporate excess in this country, relating to the sorts of payments in the millions being made to those who are fired and made redundant in corporate Australia, contrasted with the position of the Ansett workers and the Prime Minister's statement that an acceptable community standard for redundancy pay is only eight weeks pay. Did the Prime Minister, or anyone in this government, have anything to say about the millions of dollars paid to the corporate executives who failed and who have been got rid of? There was not a word in answer. Four minutes and another follow-up minute provided an opportunity for the minister to discuss some of the concerns that affect ordinary Australians today.</para><para>The Minister for Finance and Administration wanted to try again to obscure the facts about the level of household debt in this country. Many Australians are struggling under record levels of debt. Household debt is now at a record high of $597 billion; that is, an average of $81,000 per household. That is a staggering number. What is the government's response? It says, `Don't you worry about that; it will be okay.' The Governor of the Reserve Bank does not think it is going to be okay. The Governor of the Reserve Bank has issued a number of warnings about the level of household debt. What does the minister try to say? The minister tries to say, `Don't you worry because, if you look at the assets that are held out there in the community and you match them against the debt, it is really okay.' What the minister does not want to tell you, though, is that the assets are not held by the people who have the debt. Funnily enough, most of the assets that are held are at the top end of the market, in the higher income brackets, and most of the debt that is held is at the lower end of the market. But if you just pretend, obscure and pull that little confidence trick you might just get away with proving that there is no problem in this country. </para><para>My colleague Mr Alan Griffin in the other place and I have been calling on the government for some time to work with all the state governments to amend the uniform consumer credit code to require that a credit card provider cannot write to ordinary Australians and say, `Congratulations, you have won first prize; here is an increase in your credit card limit.' That is all we want this government to doâto get on board and try to stop the debt binge that is going on in this country. We are not saying that people cannot write and ask for an increase in their credit card limit if they want itâthere is no problem with that. But we have to put a stop to the banks writing to ordinary Australians and saying, `Your limit has gone from $3,000 to $7,000,' without receiving any expression of interest from them that they would like that. What happens is that everyone starts to build up to the limit again. That is bad practice, the Reserve Bank is concerned about it, and many people in the Australian community are concerned about it. All that this government has to do is to work with the state governments to ban the practice and say, `You can't do it any more. You can say to people, âWould you like an increase? Write to us and tell us.â Just stop this unsolicited cold-calling and increasing of credit card limits. It has to stop.'</para><para>Yet again, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer tries to mislead the chamber. She pulls out some dodgy OECD figures, which fundamentally are supplied by Treasury. Those figures have shown that this is the highest taxing, highest spending government in Australia's history. The only reason that the government gets away with comments about how that is not the case is that the GSTâa tax that funnily enough was voted on by those on the other side and us in this chamberâis a Commonwealth tax. Because it gives figures that show that it is the highest taxing, highest spending government in Australian history, what does it do? It says, `The GST isn't really a Commonwealth tax.'

He cannot cop the heat. Senator Conroy talked about AMP on the one hand and Ansett on the other. He talked about the limits placed on redundancy payments to Ansett staff compared with what he regarded as excessive redundancy payments made to a former employee of AMP. The facts that he ignores are that Ansett has gone brokeâAnsett is insolventâand that the redundancy payments being made to Ansett employees are as a consequence of that insolvency. AMP is not an insolvent company; it remains a profitable, successfully operating company, and the payments that it might make to redundant employees are therefore completely incomparable with the situation at Ansett. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Senator Conroy ignores that the government has announced its intention that, where what might be regarded as excessive or inappropriate redundancy payments are made to senior officers of a company that subsequently goes broke, the government will have power to reclaim those payments and put them back into the company for the benefit of all creditors, including all employees. Let us compare like with like. If a company like AMP goes broke and inappropriate payments are made to its senior executives, the government will have capacity to claw back those funds for the benefit of all creditors. Therefore, the government has acted to deal with the situationâquite contrary to the misrepresentation that we have heard from Senator Conroy. </para><para>We need to remind the Senate that the Labor Party did absolutely nothing with regard to employee entitlements. Only this government has taken the initiative to provide any benefit for employees when a company goes broke. It is no wonder that Senator Conroy wants to concentrate on this issue today, because he wants to try to divert attention from today's excellent news with regard to the restoration of the Commonwealth of Australia's AAA credit ratingâa credit rating that we have not enjoyed for 16 years. It took only three years of the life of the previous Labor government for our AAA credit rating to be lost, and it has been below that level ever since. As a result of six solid years of sound economic management by this government, we now have the good news that that AAA credit rating has been restoredâ the very top level credit rating that you can achieve through the well-known international credit rating agency, Moody's.</para><para>That brings us into line with the United States, the United Kingdom and Germany and it restores the credit rating that we lost in the early years of the Labor government. This is of benefit not only to the Commonwealth government in relation to its financing; it also benefits all the key players in Australia's economy. It benefits state governments and private sector companies because their credit rating in turn is dependent on the credit rating given to the Commonwealth government. All those other bodies can have their credit ratings re-rated to a more beneficial level to enable them to borrow money at a lower interest rate because of the lower risk premium that will apply from that better credit rating.</para><para>As I said, it is a direct result of 6Â½ years of hard work by this government to restore the economic credentials of Australia. This re-rating has not just occurred; it is the direct result of the hard work and sound policy initiatives of the Howard Liberal government. It is worth noting that even the Chief Economist at HSBC, Dr John Edwards, issued a report this month which commended the state of the economy under the Howard Liberal government. He said that growth was expected to remain strong despite the international downturn and difficult conditions. That was from Dr John Edwards, a friend of the Labor Party and, indeed, a former senior adviser to a Labor Prime Minister. Even Dr Edwards is acknowledging the sound economic management of this government.</para><para>I might contrast that with the situation I witnessed recently in Germany, which is now lamenting the re-election of a social democrat government because of its poorly performing economy. Currently it has a growth rate of about 0.6 per cent compared to our growth rate of nearly four per cent, and the necessary reforms will not now be implemented in that country to restore strong economic growth. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>5594</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWell, well! Don't those opposite get all hot and bothered and upset when the truth is finally revealed that this government is Australia's highest taxing administration? Isn't that a notable achievement, brought to us by the parties opposite that claim to represent small government? They come in here day after day with their ideological cant about the virtues of their administration. They are always ready to blame everybody else for Australia's illsâanybody else who crosses their path including, as a last resort, previous Labor administrations from six years ago. I have news for you: most Australians will no longer accept that.</para></talk.start><para>Those opposite want us to believe that they are better economic managers. At every opportunity they come in here and they are only too happy to hop into those of us on the Labor side about the past. Of course they want to focus on the past, because that lets them ignore the present and hide from the Australian people their complete lack of vision for the future. The simple fact is that this government collects more taxation revenue than any other Commonwealth government in history. If the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer does not like the OECD figures, perhaps she would like to focus on the ABS statistics. They show that Commonwealth government taxation revenue, including taxes received from other levels of government and Commonwealth corporations, rose 14.7 per cent from $152,576 million in 1999-2000 to $175,010 million in 2000-01. Before they get too carried away, let us compare this with the position of state and local government. State and local government taxation revenue fell for the same period by 11.1 per cent. You need not run around shirking your responsibilities and trying to blame everyone else. </para><para>The government want us all to worship at their altar of economic management. Let us have a look at what it has brought us: it has brought us the highest taxing government in Australia's history, a budget deficit and now more levies than we know what to do with. And they have the unmitigated gall to come in here and tell us that everyone else is no good. They are perpetuating the greatest con job Australia has had the misfortune to suffer. Their latest smoke and mirrors trick is they want to sell Telstra so they can deal with the budget deficit and have a war chest for the next election. I have news for you: I do not think the Australian public will buy it. Abraham Lincoln once said, `Too many piglets, not enough teats.' When he came up with that phrase, he could well have been talking about the coalition election strategy meeting. It is just incredible. However, you have to give them credit: they have come up with a strategy of hiding their latest taxation behind words like `levies'. And yesterday we heard from Senator Coonan that it is not a levy; it is an arrangement. Then they try to say that the GST is really a tax from the states.</para><para>You can have a gun levy, a dairy levy, an Ansett levy and now a sugar levy but, if you want to believe those opposite, those are not taxes; they are just levies. They even point to their Timor levy and its non-introduction as some kind of badge of fiscal responsibility. The bottom line is that the government have painted themselves into a corner. They want to continue the myth that they are a small government and that they are low taxingâ and a myth is just what that is; it is a fairytale that soon you will not even be able to tell your kids, because no-one will believe it anymore. No matter how the government try to dress it up, this myth reeks. There is an old truism about death and taxes; in Australia in the year 2002, it should read, `Death, taxes and levies.'</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>5595</page.no><name role="metadata">Johnston, Sen David</name><name role="display">Senator JOHNSTON</name><name.id>00AON</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI must say that, even after Saturday, I have now seen everything: the Labor Party comes into this chamber and wants to take point on economic management. It is absolutely mind-boggling in the extreme. Today we are being acknowledged with a re-rating up of our credit rating and the Labor Party is taking note on an issue of economic management.</para></talk.start><para>What does it actually mean to ordinary Australians when Australia gets re-rated? First and foremost, it means lower interest rates for ordinary men and women paying their mortgages and their debts. What does it mean for my state of Western Australia? It means that foreign capital can actually flow in, because the risk premium component of the foreign capital or borrowing is reduced. It means the oil and gas industry can expand, as Woodside has on our North West Shelf, with 2,000 new jobs. It means men and women can actually maintain a high standard of living and enjoy the fruits of the highest rate of average weekly earnings, which those in Western Australia now enjoy. Goldmining companies can borrow offshore capital which we cannot raise onshore, given our small population, and we can put people on the ground in the far-flung regions of Western Australia, Queensland, the Northern Territory and South Australia and develop our mineral resources for the benefit of men and women and their families, to provide them with the good schools and hospitals that flow from good jobsâand this is all because we have a very strong credit rating and are respected internationally as good managers of our economy. The fact is the OECD envies Australia's ability to manage its economy. Indeed the government have achieved something of a minor miracle in economic management and are renowned in the OECD and across the world for delivering growth to this economy, growth that we had not seen before we took over in 1996. </para><para>Having said what happens in Western Australia, let me turn to what happens in respect of the states. The states can now borrow at reduced rates of interest. Notwithstanding the fact that they are six Labor states, those states are the direct beneficiaries of our credit re-rating, and that is of course a re-rating up to AAA. The fact is that enables the states to provide more hospitals, schools, nurses, employees and teachers. These are things which affect average, ordinary Australians greatly, yet the Labor Party comes in here and says that we are not doing a good job.</para><para>Let us remind ourselves of what it was like back in the early nineties. We had 11 per cent unemployment. That was double the rate now. That was double the number of people who wanted a job but could not find one. Those were real peopleâthese were men and womenâwho wanted to work and raise their families with a reasonable standard of living but who could not find a job. Interest rates were up to 18 per cent. We had back in the early nineties `the recession we had to have' under this mob. These things are forgotten by the senators opposite, and it is quite remarkable that they would come in here and feign this rhetoric of Australia being the highest taxing country in the OECD. I am absolutely incredulous that, given the substantial victory for this government and for every Australian in this rerating today, they would seek to make a point on an economic issue.</para><para>Having said that the states are now able to raise more money and be more successful in their governance of their states, I turn to Senator Conroy. He just simply will not take note of what occurred during Labor's time at the helm. Senator Webber wants to talk about ideological cant. It is an absolute tragedy that the senators opposite have a complete policy vacuum when it comes to every single issue. We are winning with respect to Centrelink, defence reform, education and training, and employment. The figures and the runs are on the board. Sadly, there is no energy and indeed no hope among those opposite.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>5596</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âAustralian families are sinking under the combined weight of household and government family payment debts but today the governmentâthrough the Minister for Finance and Administration, Senator Minchinâhas failed to acknowledge their plight. We heard today that recent ABS statistics show that Australian families are now straining under a record $597 billion of debt, an average of $81,000 for every household. Household debt has jumped $23.4 billion in the three months to June and $79.3 billion in the 12 months to June this year. Household debt has gone up $319.5 billion since the coalition came to office, yet the government speaks of its `economic management'.</para></talk.start><para>These amounts are almost double the amounts of household debt under the last Labor government. Household debt per household has jumped from $41,450 when Labor left office to almost double thatâ $83,000âtoday. Average household debt has surged from 82 per cent of disposable income in 1995 to 122 per cent at the end of March this year. ABS statistics show that the average family now owes $122 for every $100 of their disposable income. With credit card debt also at a record high, families are now saving just 50c out of every $100 earned. This is one of the lowest saving rates ever.</para><para>These figures are a stark illustration of the growing debt burden faced by Australian families as they struggle to cope under the highest taxing and highest spending government in Australian history. Yet today the minister refused to acknowledge this in his answer to my question during question time. Under the Howard government, Australian families are under greater financial stress than ever before and are increasingly vulnerable to interest rate increases. Homebuyers who have borrowed heavily relative to their incomeâoften close to the full value of the propertyâwill be particularly vulnerable if prices fall or if interest rates rise further. The Reserve Bank and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority have given repeated warnings to borrowers and lenders to exercise caution. But, despite this, the government has failed to recognise that there is a household debt problem and has made no consistent response to the risk of the housing bubble. This is despite repeated warnings made by the Reserve Bank about the expansion of household debt and the increasing vulnerability of Australian households to interest rate increases. It is irresponsible of the government to sit on its hands and passively await a housing bust, with the pain that this will inflict upon Australian households. The government should join the opposition in warning potential borrowers to ensure that they are not overstretching themselves. In particular, borrowers should be warned to assess whether they have the financial capacity to respond to worsening financial circumstances, such as possible interest rate increases. </para><para>October Reserve Bank transaction card figures show that Australian credit card debt has hit record levels under the Howard government. Total debt has soared to $21.5 billion in August, an increase of over $100 million in just one month. These figures indicate Australian consumers are increasing their exposure levels to personal debt, month after month. In four years, credit card debt has exploded by 220 per cent from $9.8 billion to $21.5 billion and has increased as a proportion of household debt by 35 per cent. This is of particular concern when the August Reserve Bank statement on monetary policy showed average credit card interest rates at 16 per cent.</para><para>It is clear that consumers are extremely vulnerable when it comes to credit card debt. I asked the minister today whether the government would work with the states to ban credit card providers from issuing unsolicited promotional material with pre-approved credit limits or credit limit increases, but the minister provided no answer to this question. Labor calls on the government, in cooperation with the states, to reform the uniform consumer credit code. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>International Criminal Court</title><page.no>5597</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>5597</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Justice and Customs (Senator Ellison) to a question without notice asked by Senator Greig today relating to judicial nominations for the International Criminal Court.</para></motion><para>Specifically, I asked the representing minister if he could inform the Senate of what steps the government might be taking or had taken in terms of the nomination process for Australian judges who might potentially sit on the International Criminal Court. The minister's answer was very disappointing. He said that he had had a discussion with the Attorney on that but was not fully briefed and that he would undertake to get back to the Senate about it.</para><para>I acknowledge that the minister has been busy of late with other matters, but this is an issue which the Senate has been debating in a controversial way for quite some time. I felt that we should know at this fairly late stage whether, at the very least, the government has given consideration to some kind of short list. In this chamber we had a very extensive, robust debate on the question of ratification of the International Criminal Court. Finally, the parliament agreed on 27 June this year that, yes, Australia should sign on to that and become one of the 60 states setting in motion the establishment and formation of the International Criminal Court to deal with crimes against humanity, such as genocide and other atrocities.</para><para>It is worth noting that Australia's decision to ratify took place on 27 June. That was a Thursday, the last sitting day of that sitting period. This meant that, by ensuring that we beat the deadline of June 30 of this year by just three days and by signing on at that time, we could participate in what is called the Assembly of States Partiesâthat is, the inaugural group of countries which supported the notion of the International Criminal Court and signed up to that in a jurisdictional sense. The mechanism of the Assembly of States Parties provides for, amongst other things, the opportunity for any country which has signed on to the ICC to nominate for consideration judges to sit on that bench. </para><para>Given the very strong and, in many cases, leading role that the Australian government playedâparticularly through the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Downerâin advocating and supporting for many years the notion of the ICC, it is very disappointing that we should at this very late stage not be in a position to even identify whether or not we have considered appointing or at least nominating judges for the ICC. </para><para>As I said, Australia played a leading role in the negotiations leading up to the finalisation of the court. Indeed, our country chaired what was known as the like-minded group of countries, consisting of some 65 countries, all of which advocated a strong and effective court for the purposes that I have outlined. Given that Australians could be subject to the court's jurisdictionâeven if we had not ratified itâI think our interests are best served by having an effective voice in the Assembly of States Parties, yet we seem to be abrogating our role in that regard.</para><para>At the time of the negotiations, very strong concern was expressed by many Australians, including some in the government, who felt that we would in some way be losing sovereignty by signing on to the notion of an International Criminal Court. There was very strong concern about perceived bias from the court, particularly for countries which have signed on to and supported the court but which may have a history of atrocities or experience of human rights abuses. We Democrats would argue that surely one of the best ways to help remove that doubt and concern is, at the very least, to ensure that Australia nominates a judge or two from our country, to give them the opportunity to serve on the International Criminal Court. The many misconceptions that we heard prominently throughout the debate over Australian ratification could perhaps be addressed in that way.</para><para>It is very disappointing that the minister at this very late stage is not able to even identify whether or not the government has considered so much as a short list. I think we should note with disappointment the way in which the Australian government has approached thisâinitially very enthusiastically in terms of support for the court; initially very enthusiastically in terms of meeting the deadline, which it did; and initially indicating that there would be some kind of opportunity to indicate those judges who may be forwarded, which it has not done to date. With disappointment, I ask that the Senate take note of that and call on the minister to respond in the way in which he said he wouldâthat is, as soon as possible. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>5598</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>âA petition has been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Iraq</title><page.no>5598</page.no><no.signed>1067</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>3I6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Stott Despoja</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.

In lending support to the improved quality assurance bill, we said that the true test of the government's commitment to improving disability services would lie in how the new quality assurance standards worked on the ground. To put it another way, if the improved quality assurance bill is the body of the car then the standards are the engine that will make the whole thing move forward. </para><para>We now have before us in the parliament the first of these standards which will apply to organisations providing jobsâthat is, specially supported jobsâand rehabilitation services to people with a disability. What the standards set out to achieve is very good. The standards package incorporates the ideals of workplace transparency, selfdevelopment, skills development, privacy and good service. Labor believes that the standards should set the supported employment sector and its employees on the road to a uniform, high standard of working conditions and productive relations. Of course, whether those standards can be reached with the amount of money that the government is providing for disability employment is another matter. It is not the subject of the debate before us today.</para><para>Whilst we agree that the standards are generally very good, there is one exceptionâthat is standard 9, which deals with employment conditions and, specifically, the setting of wage rates. We are moving to disallow standard 9, which in its current form fails to provide certainty and equity in wage determination for people with disabilities employed by special business services. These standards hold a lot of positive potential, but we have to be very careful we are not setting employers up for failure. The information we have received from the disability employment sector is that up to one-quarter of businesses might fail to meet these new quality assurance standards by the deadline of 31 December 2004 and that up to one-third of the 15,000 people employed in the sector could thereby be left without work. Labor wants to bring those numbers down to an absolute minimumâindeed, to zero.</para><para>We must remember the history of these organisations. Business services for workers with disabilities are today focused on turning a profit, but they have their origins in humanitarian pursuits, and for very good reasons. Open employment is simply not an option for some people with disabilities. Not only do business services provide employment options, they provide many other benefits besides for individuals, their families and the entire community. Those benefits include social interaction, self-esteem and skills trainingâadvantages in addition to the payment of wages.</para><para>The disability employment standards are supposed to be the vanguard of the government's reform drive in the disability services sector. That should be the test upon which we judge those standards. But instead of smoothing the way for reform, standard 9 unfortunately creates confusion on how to determine a fair rate of pay for people with disabilities. In standard 9, the government is telling employers to use either the supported wage system, which was designed for use out on the open employment market, or any other system they can come up with, as long as it complies with criteria in the <inline font-style="italic">Guide to good practice wage determination</inline>. This guide was produced last year by the consultancy firm Health Outcomes International for the Department of Family and Community Services. I repeat that in standard 9 the government is telling employers that they have a choice: to use either the supported wage system or any other system that the employer can devise, as long as it complies with criteria in the <inline font-style="italic">Guide to good practice wage determination</inline>.</para><para>But the problem is that the good practice guide is of very little help to employers in this regard. It is not a simple checklist describing how to meet the new standards. In fact, the good practice guide itself concludes that no single wage assessment tool currently in use can be described as `best practice'. Furthermore, the good practice guide makes a recommendation that we agree with but which still will not make matters any clearer for employers. The guide says:</para><quote><para>Given that all Business Services in Australia are funded under the same system, it seems both logical and appropriate to develop guidelines that promote a nationally consistent wage determination system. </para></quote><para>That is from page 2 of the good practice guide. I emphasise those words: `a nationally consistent wage determination system'. But this is where the chaos really sets in. The government is in fact currently finalising just such a national wage assessment tool for people with disabilities. That project is currently underway, but the new tool is missing from these disability employment standards. The new wage assessment tool currently being developed by the government is being kept entirely separate from these standards. Why is that the case? We do not know. We have yet to hear any explanation from the government as to why these two projects are being kept separate.</para><para>There is no doubt that these standards set the bar higher for supported disability employment, and that is clearly appropriate. But imposing standard 9 in its current form is the equivalent of asking employers to clear the bar whilst blindfolded. At the moment, we do not know and the sector does not know where the bar is set, because the government is still to determine it. This uncertainty has been made very clear in the latest newsletter put out by Good Samaritan Industries in Western Australia. This is an organisation which excels at running businesses staffed by people with disabilities and at placing people with disabilities in open employment. In fact, two of the companies which employ people with disabilities through Good Samaritan Industries recently won major awards for their outstanding employment programs. In the newsletter for September-October, the Employment Services Manager at Good Samaritan Industries wrote:</para><quote><para>There are good reasons for meeting the standards.</para></quote><para>But they also wrote:</para><quote><para>The impact of meeting the Quality Assurance requirements for the organisation is uncertain.</para></quote><para>Good Samaritan Industries go on to say that the introduction of a new wage assessment tool will be a `particular challenge' and notes that the Commonwealth's new tool will only become available for use in January or February 2003. The organisation states that there is no way of accurately predicting the cost impactâthat is, of the new standardsâuntil it can introduce specific wage assessment guidelines.</para><para>There are some great wage assessment tools out there. We have taken the trouble to get out and see them in operation on the ground. My colleague in the other place Ms Ellis, the member for Canberra and the shadow minister, was very impressed recently by a visit to the Greenacres organisation in the Illawarra region. Organisations like Greenacres already understand the importance of giving people with disabilities a safe, nurturing and rewarding work environment. Greenacres operates very successfully as a manufacturing business, at the same time implementing a state-of-the-art human resources management system for its employees.</para><para>But we cannot be satisfied until all employers of people with a disability have a fair, transparent system in place to determine wages. The best way to do that is for the government to draw on the example of places like Greenacres and develop a methodology that all business services nationally can use. The point is that those disability business services which already have quality wage assessment tools should be the benchmark for others. We do not want the leading operators to be penalised or, alternatively, dragged down to some lowest common denominator. A good national wage assessment tool should be flexible enough to apply to all operators in the supported employment sector. It should draw on assessments of the employees' competency and productivity, it should be fair and it should be affordable.</para><para>The onus is now on the government to finalise its wage assessment tool and make sure the tool addresses the needs of employers and employees alike. What do we know about the government's plans for its new wage assessment tool? According to information on the web site of the Department of Family and Community Services, the new tool will be based on the existing supported wage system, or SWS, tool used in measuring employees in open employment, but it will be adapted to the supported employment environment. According to the department, the tool will: </para><para>Â·	comply with relevant legislation;</para><para>Â·	be appropriate for differing types of work and industry types in supported employment settings;</para><para>Â·	incorporate computer based applications; and</para><para>Â·	be used by assessors trained in the use of the tool.</para><para>That sounds like a solution that all employers and employees could live with very happily. We therefore believe that the only sensible outcome is for the government to deliver just such a tool to bring into being what the Department of Family and Community Services has said is their intention. Today we are seeking to disallow standard 9 on employment conditions, and we want the government to come back to the parliament next year with a set of clear guidelines for employers to use in setting fair wages for their employees with disabilities. We want to remove the uncertainty that will arise if standard 9 is implemented, and we want the government to complete its project to develop that new wage assessment tool and then bring that into the parliament. That would be the basis upon which a new standard would be implemented.</para><para>We are asking for some commonsense in the future. When we look back over the last six years, we see a very distinct pattern emerging in the Howard government's policies on disability services. Where there should be clarity and support, there is confusion and a continuing retreat by the Commonwealth from its commitments to people with disabilities, their families and their employers. It is time that the Howard government took the advice it has paid those consultants forâthat is, to develop a national tool for determining the wages of people with disabilities employed in business services and present it to the parliament for approval. The future of 500 businesses and 15,000 people with disabilities depends on the government getting these disability employment standards right. I ask that the Senate support the motion for the disallowance of standard 9.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>5606</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Democrats will not be supporting the disallowance motion. The primary goal of the Disability Services Act 1986 is its recognition that people with a disability are entitled to the same rights as other Australians, and that includes the right to participate economically. Earlier this year the <inline ref="S335">Disability Services Amendment (Improved Quality Assurance) Bill 2002</inline> passed with the support of the Australian Democrats. Quality assurance is an integral measurement tool of the degree to which the right of people with a disability to participate economically is being met, and the standards that we are dealing with here today are the means by which that measurement is made. At the time, the Democrats expressed concern that the key performance indicators did not accompany the original bill and we heralded our intention to closely consider these. The issue of key performance indicators as part of the standards has dominated industry debate in recent months. There has been dissatisfaction expressed within the sector over the past year with the way the KPIs were progressing. It has certainly been a long and arduous road that has led to their tabling.</para></talk.start><para>At the time the quality assurance bill was passed, we clearly said that whatever performance indicator is set by the standards, whether it is a one-size-fits-all model or a multilevel model, it must be specific, not one which by its lack of transparency fails to protect the rights of Australians with a disability. Standard 9, the subject of this disallowance motion, is integral and critical to the original intent of the quality assurance billâ that is, each individual within the business service has access to wages and conditions comparable to those of the Australian work force. It provides that a pro rata wage must be paid based on an award order or an industrial agreement and that the pro rata wage must be determined through a transparent assessment tool or processes which meet the relevant criteria.</para><para>In recent times the employment options for people with disabilities have been enhanced, with many people with disabilities seeking and retaining employment in the open market in addition to the traditional so-called sheltered workshop model of employment. Sheltered workshops themselves have changed significantly in the past decade or two, whereby now they are seen as a competitive industry and are appropriately known as business services.  </para><para>When the Disability Services Amendment (Improved Quality Assurance) Bill came before the Senate in May this year, it was alarming to note that, for many people with a disability, employment in business services was actually to their disadvantage. Many employers did not have a legal workplace agreement. Some employers paid wages well below the federal award safety net enjoyed by others in the Australian work force by using pro rata wage assessments which did not take into account the capacity of the individual compared to the productivity and conditions of employees without a disability. Some even sought to take advantage of the intellectual impairment of employees by negotiating workplace agreements that they could neither understand nor bargain for with any power. The bad news reports and lack of compliance served to undermine the principles and objectives of the Disability Services Act.</para><para>We have an obligation to prevent people who are least able to stand up for their own rights from being exploited by being employed under appalling employment terms and conditions. It follows that we have a real need to develop wage assessment processes for people in business services that are fair and appropriate to the worker, the industry and the employer; that use valid assessment techniques; and that comply with relevant legislation and standards. It is untrue, however, to state that all employers have been seeking to pay their employees unfairly. Currently there are four broad categories of wage determination processes operating within the business services sector, including historical wage payments, generally without formal assessment; productivity based assessments, including the supported wage assessment tool; competency based assessments; and hybrid models. Research conducted by Health Outcomes International last year reported that there were advantages and disadvantages to all four models. While it is easy to talk about people with a disability as a whole group, the reality is that true integration does not rely on the belief that all people with disabilities are the same. Levels of disability range from low to very high, and support needs and relative productivity in employment have the same variable range.</para><para>At the time we passed the quality assurance bill we paid special notice to the fact that, in developing the standards, consideration should be given to the viability of enterprises that employ people with a disability. To have people with a disability in non-viable businesses provides neither decent wages nor decent employment. As much as we are in the business of ensuring the rights of people with a disability, we cannot disregard the viability issues that organisations will face as a consequence of this disallowance. We certainly do not want to see people with a disability pushed out onto the street because too narrow a standard has been attached to an act that purports to assist them.</para><para>The Democrats recognise that employers who take on employees with a disability, or indeed whose business is comprised wholly or mainly of people with a disability, do so with the best of intentions. Employers should be given encouragement to provide practical, workable strategies to help them improve the quality of the services that they provide. Business services employing limited systemsâsuch as historical flat wages or, even worse, those based on an ability to payâ have for some time been encouraged to explore alternative options and to plan for the implementation of a valid assessment tool that complies with relevant standards and the concept of fairness. We supported the quality assurance bill earlier this year to compel business services to operate out of the single assessment model. For this reason we do not believe that it is appropriate for the standards to limit a wage determination system to one model only.</para><para>The quality assurance standards must provide the framework for fair wages for people with a disability. It is essential, therefore, that the wage assessment performance indicator set by the standards must not fail to protect the rights of Australians with a disability. The Democrats recognise that a genuine effort has been made to gain consensus from the sector. This has been demonstrated by including the key performance indicators in the disallowable instruments. We support the bill, as I said, in the belief that it will make a very significant contribution to improving the quality of employment services provided to people with disabilities and it will improve the consistency of those services across the country. </para><para>By nature, a period of testing of the standards must now follow. It is premature, and I think unfair, to throw out a critical standard that provides an element of safety for people with a disadvantage. To do so would set this process back by many months. There are numerous reasons in favour of the application of the supported wage assessment tool across the business services sector. Similarly, however, many limitations or disincentives were also identified during the consultation process.</para><para>The supported wage assessment tool is a valid, reliable and acceptable form of wage assessment that has already been implemented by some business services. The SWAT, as it is known, is considered a productivity based assessment tool, as it monitors the output of workers against an established benchmark. The SWAT is deemed to comply with relevant legislation and standards but it also has its failings. It does not formally link to structured training and professional development strategies, and it is recognised that the initial target of the SWAT was the open employment environment.</para><para>A number of alternative productivity assessment tools have also been identified with a similar objectiveâthat is, to determine the output of a worker in a particular job that they occupy. Research reports that a hybrid model represents the most appropriate method of wage determination in business standards. Standard 9 is the linchpin in these standards, stating:</para><quote><para>Each person with a disability enjoys comparable working conditions to those expected and enjoyed by the general workforce.</para></quote><para>It provides for a tool that includes, but is not limited to, the supported wage system and importantly it is one that will be measurable according to its validity, reliability, wage outcome, practical application and compliance with the legislation.</para><para>The Democrats have not taken lightly our decision not to support the disallowance motion. We are not convinced that the supported wage system model is the only way to go. The standards in their present form allow for some flexibility, and we believe that this flexibility will work to the advantage of people with disabilities. We do not want to see people with disabilities deprived of employment because a standard is unnecessarily prescriptive or, conversely, does not provide sufficient operational parameters. Disallowing standard 9 will see people with a disability denied their rights to participate in the economy with access to wages and conditions comparable to those of the general Australian work force.</para><para>Change in the sector of disability employment does not have to be at the expense of employment. In not supporting the disallowance of standard 9, we reiterate the call we made at the time the <inline ref="S335">Disability Services Amendment (Improved Quality Assurance) Bill 2002</inline> was passed earlier this year: we strongly encourage the government to dedicate sufficient assistance to those organisations who early in the process reflect symptoms of an inability to comply, and to maximise early and full compliance of other organisations well within the three-year period.</para><para>The Democrats support these standards and will continue to monitor them very closely. The government have advised that they are developing a pro rata wage model which provides for greater fairness in business services. We are keen to see that model and hope it is not too far away. We also think it should be available as soon as possible for public sector scrutiny. Again, we see no reason to disallow standard 9 before that happens. The Democrats look forward to the improvements in economic participation and wage fairness that these standards will bring to people with disabilities.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>5608</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThese disabilities standards are about delivering guaranteed minimum service levels for people with disabilities in all Commonwealth employment services. Disability employment services must meet these standards by 2005. The standard subject to disallowance today ensures: </para></talk.start><quote><para>Each person with a disability enjoys comparable working conditions to those expected and enjoyed by the general workforce.</para></quote><para>A key performance indicator of this standard will be the payment of fair wages to all employees. There are a number of methods available and already being used to assess wages in disability employment services. There is, however, no single tool suitable for both open and supported employment. This is not surprising, given the significant differences between the two types of services. Open employment provides jobs for people in workplaces that have a mix of employees, whereas supported employment is often provided in a business service previously known as a sheltered workshop.</para><para>In the business service workplace, tasks may have to be specifically designed for people with severe disabilities and there may not be any workers without disabilities doing these specific tasks. Therefore we do not wish to mandate a particular wage assessment method for all service types. However, we are working with the sector to develop a new national wage assessment tool that will meet, along with existing tools, the requirements of standard 9 for business services, a sector that in the past has not been required to pay award based wages.</para><para>If standard 9 is disallowed there will be no standard for wages and conditions for any employment services. This means that employment services may be certified for Commonwealth funding without being required to pay fair wages. Under our new quality assurance legislation, services need to be fully certified under these standards by December 2004. Services that are not certified by this time will not be funded from 2005. The industry sector has told us that they need a new wage assessment tool in order to make standard 9 work effectively.</para><para>We are in the final stages of developing a new wage assessment tool. It is currently being trialled. The new tool includes both competency and productivity components and provides links to training and career advancement. It will also use trained, accredited assessors. It will be available to the industry by early next year. They are expecting it and waiting for it. A new wage assessment tool is needed so that business services can prepare themselves in time to pay award wages in order to receive certification by December 2004. The government is developing a new tool because there is currently no suitable age assessment tool that can be used for all business services.</para><para>The existing supported wage system, SWS, does not work satisfactorily for most business services, because it is based on a productivity comparison between an able-bodied worker and a worker in open employment with a disability both doing exactly the same job. Such a ready comparison is not always possible in business services where jobs have been redesigned around the person with the disability and there is no similar job in open employment. Independent evaluation of the SWS in 2000 found that it was not necessarily suitable for all business services, especially where there are clients with high support needs or episodic conditions. </para><para>The disability service standards and key performance indicators have been developed through an extensive consultation process over many years. The industry and its stakeholders have travelled this journey with us from the outset and have been steadily working towards the new requirements. ACROD has made it clear that the requirement to pay award based wages will be a challenge for many in business services but still ACROD has signed up to the changes. Why? Because ACROD also believes that the new system and standard 9 will ultimately provide better outcomes for people with disabilities. That is the real bottom line here.</para><para>Standard 9 deliberately does not specify any particular tool; rather, it specifies criteria against which the tool should be assessed and includes the supported wage system as an example. The new tool will meet these criteria; however, this new tool will not be compulsory as a number of leading businesses are already paying award based wages using different wage assessment tools that would satisfy the standard. That is fine so long as they are transparent and they are paying against an award. Employment services and auditors have been given detailed guidelines that have been developed against all the proposed standards and key performance indicators. We have provided advice and help from a number of different kinds of services on what works and what does not work. Moreover, to ensure consistent and accurate interpretation of both of those aspects, the department has funded a training course for auditors. </para><para>If you get out there and talk to the sector, you do find excellent services implementing creative and innovative ways of meeting all the standards. The landscape of disability employment services is changing and it is changing for the better. People with disabilities, their carers and families will now have confidence in the quality of the employment service they choose. They deserve no less. The government support all workers having basic rights and conditions. We will not back down from that. We have come up with a legislative framework that gives disability employment services a new way of doing business and gives their clients a new confidence. I am sure history will record standard 9 as a defining moment in the ongoing call by people with disabilities for a fair go. To disallow it would be to disallow people with disabilities a fundamental rightâthe right to be treated the same as everyone else.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:17:00</time.stamp><page.no>5610</page.no><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display">Senator FORSHAW</name><name.id>656</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to respond to a couple of points made by the Democrats, through Senator Allison, and by the minister. Both speakers have misrepresented the position of the opposition and have suggested that disallowing standard 9 would deny workers with a disability certain rights, including rights to fair wages and so on. That is absolutely untrue. The reason it is untrue is this: standard 9 will not have legislative or legal force, in terms of all businesses having to meet the standard, until 1 June 2005. Businesses will be required to meet the new quality assurance standards by the deadline of 31 December 2004. So there is still some time to run before these standards have their full legal impact.</para></talk.start><para>As I said in my remarks at the start of the debate, standard 9 does not, on the admission of the minister and as acknowledged by Senator Allison, provide a full and appropriate set of regulations for determining what would be the appropriate pro rata wages to be paid. As standard 9 says:</para><quote><para>This prorata wage must be determined through a transparent assessment tool or process, such as Supported Wage System (SWS), orâ</para></quote><para>some other tool. Then it has been reiterated by the minister that the very process going on at the moment is the development of such a wage assessment tool. We are saying that in many ways standard 9 as it is contained within these standards is premature and confusing. We suggest it would be far better for the government to finalise the development of the wage assessment tool and bring that back to the parliament; then we will have the basis for the wording of an appropriate standard 9 covering employment conditions. That standard will be based upon workers with a disability receiving wages according to relevant awards, orders and industrial agreements, and receiving wages based upon what is contained in those agreements. We do not want to see confusion existing and then having to be corrected at some future date. There is time to deal with this. We understand that finalising this new wage assessment tool is no more than six months awayâI might be wrong in that. There is plenty of time to deal with this in a more effective and a more complete way, given that the standards ultimately do not have their full impact and that the compliance date is 31 December 2004. Obviously, given the indications from the Democrats and the government, we are not going to succeed; but I am sure that this is a matter that we will return to in due course.</para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>NOTICES</title><type>Notices</type><page.no>5610</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Postponement</title><page.no>5610</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator BUCKLAND (South Australia) (4.22 p.m.)âby leaveâAt the request of Senator Bartlett and Senator McLucas, I move:</para><motion><para>That business of the Senate notice of motion No. 3 standing in the names of Senators Bartlett and McLucas for today, relating to the disallowance of the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park Amendment Regulations 2002 (No. 5), be postponed till the next day of sitting.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to. </para></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>5611</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Economics References Committee</title><page.no>5611</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>5611</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>5611</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI present the report of the Economics References Committee entitled <inline font-style="italic">A review of public liability and professional indemnity insurance</inline>, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>âI seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have my tabling statement incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> and make some additional remarks.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows</inline>â</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">BACKGROUND TO INQUIRY</inline></para><para>There has been growing community concern about rising premiums for public liability and professional indemnity insurance for over two years. As 2001 progressed, and with the announcement of HIH's collapse, concerns about insurance premiums mounted. By the middle of that year, there were reports of huge increases in premiums that threatened the viability of small businesses, community and sporting groups and adventure tourism. Professional groups including lawyers, engineers and architects faced greatly increased premiums for professional indemnity coverage. </para><para>The terrorist attack in New York on 11 September sparked fears that the Australian domestic market would suffer from an increase in reinsurance rates. By year's end the situation appeared to worsen with media accounts of `staggering' increases in public liability insurance premiums. </para><para>As problems began to emerge in the public liability and professional indemnity area, the situation with medical indemnity deepened during 2001 with fears that some doctors, especially those practicing obstetrics, were contemplating resigning their positions because of the escalating costs of insurance. The upheaval in medical indemnity was felt even stronger when serious concerns were raised in February 2002 about the viability of Australia's major medical defence organisation, United Medical Protection.</para><para>It was against this background of mounting community and business concern about insurance coverage that the Senate resolved to have the matter referred to the Economics References Committee. </para><para>Submissionsâcross section of the Australian community</para><para>The Committee received 166 submissions from business people, community and volunteer workers, and representatives from a wide range of professions. </para><para>Many submissions described sudden, exorbitant increases in premiums regardless of claims history. The Committee was told of community events being cancelled, volunteer groups disbanding, and professionals finding themselves unable to practise their professions. Groups were concerned not only with the level of increase in premiums but also with the reduction in the level of coverage being offered and the difficulty of finding insurance in a shrinking market.</para><para>Health professionals have also been hard hit, particularly in obstetrics and midwifery. According to submissions the number of doctors in rural areas who are prepared to undertake surgical procedures is declining rapidly, as their earnings do not cover the cost of medical indemnity insurance. </para><para>Unfortunately there is no indication that these problems will soon abate.</para><para>One of the most worrying aspects of the current situation was the suddenness and severity of the turn in the market which caught the industry and governments flat-footed. </para><para>The insurance industry failed to recognise the danger signs in the public liability and professional indemnity insurance market until the problem was full blown. Insurance companies during the second half of the 1990s did not take account of changing conditions in the market, such as increasing claims costs, and consequently underpriced premiums for certain classes of insurance. According to the Treasury, it also appeared that in some cases insurance companies were more intent on increasing market share than on maintaining profitability. </para><para>APRA, the industry's prudential regulator, was also slow to respond to the emerging problem.</para><para>The early identification of a problem allows a more orderly and coordinated approach to address the difficulty. At the moment, the insurance industry and the State and Commonwealth governments, confronted with escalating premiums, are looking to the available statistics to help them analyse the problem and understand the causes. The available statistics, however, are not providing the information needed to obtain a clear and sound appreciation of what is happening in the insurance market. </para><para>Clearly, this lack of adequate data has implications for insurance companies assessing costs and setting premiums; for consumers seeking to understand and manage the price rises; and for governments looking to address the problem of rising premiums.</para><para>The Committee believes that a well-informed market is far better equipped to anticipate shifts, to adjust to trends in the industry and to plan future strategies. </para><para>The Committee maintains that the present system for the collection of data is far from satisfactory and requires prompt attention. It fully endorses the establishment of a readily accessible, comprehensive and reliable database. Such a database would lay the foundations for a more stable and predicable market better able to respond to cyclical movements and to manage the uncertainty generated by long term claims. It is also of the opinion that APRA is best placed to collect and analyse information on the insurance industry and to assume responsibility for establishing and maintaining that database. </para><para>Although APRA is introducing a new regime, the Committee is unsure whether it intends to collect the range of data that some regard as essential for a thorough understanding of the insurance industry. Further, the Committee is not convinced that APRA has the resources to meet such expectations. </para><para>In light of these findings, the Committee made a number of recommendations including that the Government: </para><para>Â·	make a commitment to the development of a comprehensive national database on the insurance industry in Australia;</para><para>Â·	put beyond doubt that APRA is to be given the responsibility for developing and maintaining this database; and</para><para>Â·	ensure that it is adequately funded so that it has the resources and level of expertise to effectively collect, collate and analyse data on the insurance industry.</para><para>The Committee believes that it is important for APRA to now prove itself as an effective and assiduous regulator in ensuring the prudential soundness of insurance companies. An efficient, strong and competent regulator will go some way to restore public confidence in the insurance industry.</para><para>The Committee recommends that the Government more actively monitor the activities of APRA and ensure that it has adequate powers and resources as well as a commitment to diligently supervise the industry.</para><para>The report also noted the problems created by the lack of good data management of court records throughout Australia and how they frustrate any detailed analysis of the underlying causes for premium increase. </para><para>In light of this ongoing problem of the lack of good quality, nationally comparable court data, the Committee recommends that the Attorneys-General treat this matter with urgency and, under the leadership of the Commonwealth Government, work together to ensure that good court data management systems are put in place throughout the country. The main objective is to have national standards apply so that the data across all jurisdictions is compatible, comprehensive and allows for consistency in interpretation.</para><para>One of the most persistent messages to emerge from this inquiry has been the confusion surrounding the assessment and pricing of premiums. Generally, witnesses were not only bewildered by the sudden and severe increase in premiums, despite relatively good claims history, but also by the growing use of clauses to exclude coverage of particular activities.</para><para>They assert that insurers do not seem to take into account claims history in setting premiums. One witness stated bluntly that underwriters `are picking and choosing clients without regard for previous good risks.'</para><para>Some suggested that coverage is being increasingly restricted with respect to policy wordings and endorsements as well as the introduction of new exclusions.</para><para>Moreover, the failure of the insurance companies to communicate effectively and openly with consumers about premiums has generated unnecessary disquiet at a time of difficulty in the industry. </para><para>While most acknowledged that insurance companies operate in a commercial environment and are accountable to their shareholders, they found difficulty in accepting the high increases and the lack of consideration shown by insurance companies to the consumer. A number harboured suspicions that the increases were not solely the result of rising claim costs but were related to attempts to recoup other business losses. </para><para>The general thrust of the need for improvement in the insurance industry focused on the principles of transparency, fairness and equity.  </para><para>The Committee believes that at present consumers, in many cases, are not receiving adequate explanation for the increase in premiums or the refusal by an insurer to cover particular services or activities. This has been acknowledged by some companies in the industry. </para><para>The Committee accepts that the insurance industry is having difficulty adjusting to current conditions. However it is concerned at the many reports it has received of what seems to be inappropriate or exploitative conduct by insurers, particularly in relation to last minute offers of renewal on exorbitant terms. The Committee considers that at the least insurers should be obliged to give 14 days notice of the proposed terms of renewal or proposed refusal to renew a policy.</para><para>Clearly, in the current market, the option for dissatisfied customers to take their business elsewhere is limited. Indeed, evidence presented to the Committee shows that the current situation has certainly brought to the fore the issue of consumer protection particularly in the area of setting premiums. For some it is a captive market and under such market conditions the need for consumer protection is heightened.</para><para>The Committee recommends that the Trade Practices Act be amended to allow the ACCC to take enforcement action to ensure that any savings or benefits that accrue directly or indirectly from legislative reforms being implemented throughout Australia to minimise insurance premiums are passed on by the insurance companies to consumers.</para><para>Under this proposed price exploitation legislation, the ACCC would also have the responsibility to educate and inform business and consumers about their rights and obligations. The Committee believes that given such responsibility, the ACCC would be an effective force in protecting consumers from exploitation.</para><para>The Committee understands that the transfer of consumer protection responsibility in relation to financial services to ASIC was to ensure that ASIC would be concerned with all aspects of financial products. Thus, consumers would know that they could approach ASIC on any matter related to financial products. Despite this transfer of power from the ACCC to ASIC, the line separating them in their respective roles in consumer protection is not widely understood. </para><para>The Committee believes strongly that the roles of the ACCC and ASIC in relation to these matters must be placed beyond doubt. </para><para>It recommends that, in close consultation, the ACCC and ASIC review and report publicly on their respective statutory obligations in regard to consumer protection and market integrity in the insurance industry.</para><para>The Committee further recommends that the ACCC and ASIC actively promote their roles in consumer protection for all financial products, including general insurance.</para><para>The Committee regrets that the statutory complaint-handling procedures now in place do not meet the needs of the groups most affected by the insurance crisis, particularly not-for-profit organisations. </para><para>The Committee recommends that:</para><para>Â·	the Government amend the Financial Services Reform Act to allow not-for-profit organisations to be included in the definition of `retail clients'.</para><para>Â·	the Government, by regulation, include public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance in the classes of insurance covered by the dispute resolution provisions of the FSR Act.</para><para>Â·	ASIC monitor the effectiveness of the dispute resolution provisions and report on this annually to the Parliament.</para><para>Â·	ASIC review, as a matter of urgency, the General Insurance Enquiries and Complaints Scheme and in consultation with the Insurance Council of Australia ensure that it covers adequately public liability and professional indemnity insurance and not-for-profit organisations. </para><para>The General Insurance Code of Practice appears to offer another avenue for improving consumer protection. </para><para>The code, however, is narrow in focus and has the same shortcomings as the General Insurance Enquiries and Complaints Scheme. It applies only to individuals, and relates to insurance for private or domestic use. The classes of insurance covered exclude public liability and professional indemnity. The Committee sees no logical reason for these exclusions.</para><para>The Committee recommends that: </para><para>Â·	the General Insurance Code of Practice be revised so that it provides remedies for community groups and small businesses that are affected by price exploitation in relation to public liability or professional indemnity policies.</para><para>Â·	Insurance Enquiries and Complaints Ltd submit the revised code for ASIC's approval under the FSR Act.</para><para>The recent increases in both public liability and professional indemnity insurance have had and will continue to have a dramatic impact on small business, community and sporting organisations, individuals and local councils. While the increases in public liability and professional indemnity insurance have affected the profitability of small business, they have also resulted in many community and sporting organisations being forced to reduce the level of services they provide or, in many cases, to cease operations altogether, due to their inability to obtain affordable, or sometimes any, insurance cover. </para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>âAs background to this inquiry, for over two years there has been a growing community concern about rising premiums for public liability and professional indemnity insurance, as Senator Coonan would be well aware.

The committee was told of community events being cancelled, volunteer groups disbanding and professionals finding themselves unable to practise their professions.

Unfortunately there is no indication that these problems will soon abate.</para><para>The tabling statement deals with a broad range of recommendations from the committee's report, and I will highlight just a few of those in the few moments I have. The report recommends that the Trade Practices Act should be amended so that the ACCC can take enforcement action to ensure that insurance companies pass on to consumers any savings from current law reforms which aim to reduce insurance claim costs. The Commonwealth government has asked the ACCC to continue monitoring insurance premiums, but at present the ACCC has no power to ensure that savings are passed on. It will not be good enough if savings for current tort law reform end up in the pockets of insurance companies in the current sellers' market. The Commonwealth has taken a role in response to the insurance crisis but there is a community expectation that the current initiatives will bring concrete results to insurance buyers. The Commonwealth will need to follow through to ensure that this is achieved. What is needed is strong national leadership. </para><para>The committee considers that the ACCC should have powers to control price exploitation in the public liability and professional indemnity insurance market. The amendments made to the Trade Practices Act in connection with the introduction of the GST could be used as a good precedent. The committee's report also shows serious gaps in consumer protection schemes set up under the Financial Services Reform Act and the insurance industry's general code of practice. The dispute resolution provisions of the Financial Services Reform Act 2001 apply only to individuals and small businesses and only to certain listed classes of insurance. The provisions do not apply to nonprofit groups and do not include public liability or professional indemnity insurance. It is unclear whether a complaint about price exploitation in a proposed policy renewal is within scope. The insurance industry's code of practice has similar limitations. The committee sees no good reason for these limitations. It has recommended that the relevant provisions should be amended to include nonprofit bodies, public liability and professional indemnity insurance. The committee regrets that at present these provisions are of no use to nonprofit groups, who have been the worst affected by this insurance crisis.</para><para>Other recommendations concern the notice that the insurers have to give at the time of a policy renewal. The report recommends that the legal requirements relating to notice of renewal should be strengthened. The committee is concerned by evidence of exploitative conduct by insurers, particularly in relation to last minute offers of policy renewal or exorbitant terms. The committee considers that at least insurers should be obliged to give 14 days notice of either proposed terms of renewal or proposed refusal to renew a policy.</para><para>I must conclude by placing a caveat on my previous references to the committee in regard to this inquiry. I regret to inform the Senate that on thisâas I would regard itârare occasion the government has gone missing. The committee report has been agreed to by Labor and Democrats senators. Unfortunately, the printed copy of the report leaves some confusion about whether the Democrats' contribution is a minority report or just some additional remarks; I can say quite clearly that this is a report by Labor and Democrats senators. With respect to the government, Senator Brandis abstained from voting on the report and has provided no separate comments. Senator Chapmanâwho I should acknowledge is currently Acting Deputy Presidentâcan be excused, as he was overseas for much of the relevant period. But Senator Brandis, despite having a month's extension on reporting, sought no amendments and no additions to this references committee report; rather, he had a concerning attitude that this was one of the opposition dominated committees and so no effort was warranted.</para><para>This is in stark contrast with government senators' behaviour in the many broad policy inquiries that I have chaired. Listing them briefly before, I highlighted about seven or eight in the last few years, some of which were references instigated by government senators. This is a most concerning attitude if Senate references inquiries are going to continue on their traditional path of looking at broad policy issues and advising government in a cross-party fashion. Senator Brandis's attitude on this occasion was worse than the growing trend of poor attendance highlighted by Senator Ray last Tuesday regarding the Joint Standing Committee on Electoral Matters; Senator Brandis, for instanceâand he was not the only oneâmanaged to attend only two out of 20 meetings. On this occasion the government has, as I said, undermined the traditional approach of Senate references committees to attempt to provide to government cross-party views or advice on broad policy references. In Senator Ray's words of last Tuesday:</para><quote><para>When the hard, solid work is there to be done, some of them go missing.</para></quote><para>I should acknowledge that in my past year's involvement in Senate references committees Senator Ferguson, Senator Tierney and Senator Chapman have had a very different approach and attitude. Senator Brandis has become known instead for his hysterical performances. From my experience in the `kids overboard' inquiry, his cross-examination of Navy officers, for instance, caused the suggestionâwhich was later retractedâby former Chief of Navy Admiral Sir Richard Peek that he should be shot. We had complaints about both his andâperhaps encouraged by Senator BrandisâSenator Mason's treatment of Amnesty witnesses. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>âOrder!

It seems that there is not a segment of the community that has been unaffected by spiralling increases in insurance premiums.</para></talk.start><para>In relation to the Senate inquiry, I endorse the recommendations of the Senate Economics References Committee report, but I also want to raise some issues and recommendations that I believe are developed more extensively in the Australian Democrats' supplementary report. Generally, I believe that the recommendations in the committee's report do accurately address the real problems and, unlike the reforms we have witnessed thus far from state and federal governments, address these problems with a sense of realism. This report presents a very careful analysis of the actual causes of the crisis, an approach that has so far failed to appeal to the proponents of tort law reform.</para><para>I want to comment on some of the report's recommendations in relation to the issues expanded upon in my supplementary report. In relation to recommendation 1, while I agree that a national accreditation program for providers of recreational services is an excellent idea in theory, the administration of such a program may well be impracticable. In my view it is therefore vital that the definition of `recreational services', or what are called inherently risky activities, not be so wide as to capture all manner of activities. The Democrats' report recommends that liability should not be limited as a result of fraud, recklessness and misrepresentation, so that users of recreational facilities are not unduly burdened with blame but the relevant safeguards can be put in place. It is very much about getting the balance rightânot loading up the users of recreational services to the exclusion of responsibilities that a recreational service provider must also have.</para><para>In relation to recommendation 5, the Democrats believe that the functions of a working group to look at the provision of long-term care of the catastrophically injured should be expanded to look into the viability of a no-fault compensation scheme for all long-term sick and injured, not just the catastrophically injured, particularly in a country like Australia with an ageing population. Additionally, whilst I do not endorse the way in which individual rights have been eroded through the latest tort law reform measures, there may be a rationale for removing the claims argument from the equation altogether if there is no guarantee that it will be in the best interests of accident victims. There may also be an argument to remove the insurance industry from the loop altogether and put responsibility back on the government, as it is likely that in the long run the government will bear the burden of costs for those who are seriously injured. A national compensation scheme such as the one operating in New Zealand should at the very least be examined more thoroughly than it has been to date. </para><para>In relation to recommendations 7 and 8, detailed data on the insurance industry is necessary to accurately assess the cost of claims and the pricing of risk in insurance policies. The Democrats do agree that data collection in this area should be a priority for the government. The ministerial communique on public liability of 30 May expressed concern:</para><quote><para>... that the lack of comprehensive data on claims costs was a significant constraint in the appropriate pricing of premiums by the insurance industry for not-for-profit, adventure tourism and sporting groups.</para></quote><para>The Ipp report on negligence also noted the absence of empirical evidence. Despite all of that lack of data, all governments across the country have been prepared to endorse tort law reform as the solution to the public liability crisis. It seems to me that the absence of hard data means that not only is it impossible to be sure that tort law is the cause of the current crisis but also it will be far more difficult to assess the effectiveness of the reform process itself.</para><para>In relation to recommendation 12, the Democrats agree that more active monitoring of the insurance industry by APRA is needed, but a commitment from the government and APRA that its existing powers will be used must also be provided. Without first getting this commitment from government, providing APRA with further powers would, in my view, be an exercise in futility. I think that it is also necessary that those monitoring powers be extended to include other types of insurers who have not been caught as a result of government proposals, such as the Medical Defence Organisation and other relevant mutual organisations, keeping in mind that bodies like United Medical Protection were not covered by APRA's monitoring powers.</para><para>We also believe that there should be greater independence between the accounting and auditing provisions of the insurance industry. This should include the ability to restrict the length of time that a single auditor can provide services to an insurer without rotation, and a requirement that no one firm can simultaneously provide auditing and accounting functions for a particular insurer.</para><para>In relation to recommendation 13, the Democrats support the recommendation for a more effective insurance industry complaints mechanism, recognising that there were almost half a dozen different complaints mechanisms. We would add that the government must ensure that industry harmonisation of those various complaints mechanisms is in place within the next 12 months and is reviewed regularly for effectiveness.</para><para>On recommendation 15, the Democrats agree that there is a need for an insurance code of practice and that its content should be revised. The current insurance industry code of practice does not provide adequate sanctions for non-compliance, and there is no guarantee of customer redress. We do believe that the code needs to be given greater promotion or even legal effect. Whilst I appreciate the limits of self-regulation generally, I think that consumers need to be assured that any insurance industry code should at the very least be equal in strength to the bank code of conduct and, therefore, contractually bind companies to the code itself.</para><para>So far, government responses to addressing rising insurance costs have laid blame predominantly on the legal system. The most far-reaching reforms have been in relation to tort law reform, limiting the ability to sue and limiting the amount of damages that can be awarded to the injured. This has been based on cases that have featured highly in the media, without understanding that 98 per cent of cases are resolved without recourse to the courts. I think the reforms have not sought to include the insurance industry in the proposals. I believe that they have gotten off scot-free. There has been little or no discussion on what measures should be adopted to ensure that accident victims will be provided for if they are injured as a result of the negligence or carelessness of someone else, nor has there been any discussion on what measures should be put in place to ensure that the community provides a safe environment, whether it be in the public, private or professional domain.</para><para>The Democrats' supplementary report tries to capture many of those issues as well as others that have not been developed as sufficiently in the committee report and the narrow debate that has been had to date. Perhaps these issues are going to come up over the course of the coming weeks in the range of bills that have been put forward to deal with these issues. Perhaps they are issues that can be taken up by the government and, more particularly, by the minister, because I think that the insurance industry, quite frankly, has gotten off lightly in relation to carrying any of the burden for the cause of increases in premium prices for consumers. I do not believe that the balance has been properly struck. </para><para>The final thing I want to say is that, whilst we put forward this supplementary report, I think the government does need to come up with some answer to the references committee, which has conducted a far-reaching inquiry and has tried to establish the causes of the spiralling increases in prices in the insurance sector. Most of all, I think there is an incumbent obligation upon the government to respond at the very least. Perhaps the minister might be able to do that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>5618</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI would also like to add some comments on the tabling of this report on public liability and professional indemnity insurance. In the first instance, I would like to say that this is actually the first Senate Economics References Committee inquiry that I, as a new member in this place, have been involved in, and I would like to place on record my thanks to the committee secretariat and all of those who provided both written submissions and oral evidence to members of the committee in an effort to make us better informed on this matter.</para></talk.start><para>In opening my remarks I would like to pick up where Senator Collins left off. It became apparent to me, in considering the evidence that was given by those who appeared before the committee, that the constant theme was the government's inability to respond to a problem that has been confronting Australia since the increases in public and professional insurance premiums began to bite in early 2001. The problems caused by these increases have seriously impacted on community groups, small businesses and many professions.</para><para>In attending the committee hearings, I heard evidence from many of these groups and individuals throughout the inquiry. The one factor that was clear to me was that the increases in insurance premiums were so excessive that, for many groups and individuals, the only option was to stop doing what they did. This process has had a profound impact, as I am sure everyone here is aware, on the activities of all of our fellow citizens. Whether this is related to community events or to the withdrawal of medical or allied health services, these events directly affected the quality of life of our people.</para><para>Through this crisis, what has been the response of government? The answerâit became clear in considering the evidenceâ was: not much. As Albert Einstein once said:</para><quote><para>Problems cannot be solved by the same level of thinking that created them.</para></quote><para>In the situation where there was an insurance crisis in this country, the government's main course of action was to talk: talk and then talk more; talk and then apportion blameâ blame the lawyers, blame the litigants, blame the insurance companies and blame the state and territory governments. At no time did the government say, `This is a national problem and we will work to find a national solution.' That would have required work rather than talk. That would have required thought. That would have actually required a new approach to insurance. </para><para>After all this time, what do we have? We have proposals to limit liability, limit the amounts of claims and limit the periods of time in which claims can be made. We have seen states, particularly New South Wales, move to tort law reform as a means of making insurance more affordable. But underpinning these moves is the expectation that insurance companies will move to reduce the cost of premiums. We can only trust that this will be the case, because the bottom line is that very little new thinkingâand from this government, almost noneâhas been applied to this issue.</para><para>This problem should have presented to all of us an opportunity for reviewing whether we needed a new system. In New Zealand there is a very different system of insurance. Their approach has been in operation for over 25 years and has been modified over time. The committee heard extensive evidence about the operation of that system. Whether that model is appropriate in an Australian context is not the issue here; the issue is government inaction. If the New Zealanders can have a different system of insurance that keeps premiums low yet delivers fair outcomes to those injured and allows the capacity to litigate for negligence, then why was the Australian government so keen to do nothing? How can it be that when community groups were cancelling shows and events, and even Anzac Day marches were at risk, the Commonwealth took no lead? The answer, it would seem to me, is ideological: insurance, after all, is just a marketâa market that should operate like any other market, apparently; therefore, the government will just let market forces operate. </para><para>It was only when that market demonstrated that people might not be able to go to the doctor that the government reluctantly stepped in. The government was forced to intervene, but did it come up with any lasting solutions? No. What it did was guarantee UMP for a defined period of time. When this bandaid solution started to run out, what did it do then? It stuck another bandaid on. Without the good work of state and territory governments in this matter, we would still be in crisis. This is a government that has shown that it is quite happy to fiddle while Rome burns. And the Rome that burns down is probably now uninsured because of the high premiumsâan issue that this government just hopes will go away.</para><para>The reality is that this government are the most reactive, poll driven administration in our history. If the polls do not register something as an issue, they will just sit back and do nothing. As Woodrow Wilson once observed:</para><quote><para>A conservative is a man who just sits and thinks, mostly sits.</para></quote><para>It is only when the polls begin to show a negative that the government actually get up and do something. That something is mostly to rush around and engage in the blame gameâall blame and no responsibility. For a few months they sit back and do nothing. The recommendations from this Senate committee will no doubt be ignored by this government, because now that the states have taken the lead the Commonwealth is quite happy to go back to sitting and talking. This all means that the insurance issue is not solved; it is merely no longer an issue that is showing up in the polls.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>5619</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator COONAN</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI must confess that I have not had an opportunity to read the report on public liability and professional indemnity insurance that is being debated but, if the contributions of Senators Collins, Webber and Ridgeway are any indication of its quality and depth, it will probably remain unread. The contributions that have been made by the honourable senators indicate that they must have slept fitfully through about the past eight months and been oblivious to three ministerial meetings between the federal government and all of the state and territory governments. All of those governments are Labor governments, apart from the federal government, which took the leadership role in this. Unanimous communiques came out of each of those meetings and endorsed a range of initiatives that have been systematically implemented throughout this year.</para></talk.start><para>We are starting to see insurers that had previously left the market actually coming back into the market. These insurers had withdrawn their capital because of skyrocketing claims and a lot of other problems in the international market. The steps that have been taken by the federal government and by state and territory governments have seen insurers come back into the market and show that they are willing to write insurance at an affordable price in those jurisdictions that are implementing tort law and other law reforms. Suncorp, for instance, have come back into the market in New South Wales. IAG have indicated that they are going to come back as soon as the second tranche of tort law reforms is introduced in New South Wales. And the Insurance Council of Australia has implemented a co-insurance pool for not-for-profits and for community groups so that, while the rest of the reforms can be implemented, some much-needed insurance at an affordable price will be available. </para><para>I will be very interested to see what the report recommends we do about international conditions. I will be delighted to see what those senators who prepared this report want to do about the downturn in the international market. When you look at the drivers of the increase in insurance premiums, you find that the pressure is there not only because of high cost claims but also because the international market has had a huge impact on reinsurance. For many years insurance companies could supplement their position with investments but, with the downturn in the investment market, they could not rely on that any more to supplement their returns and so they withdrew from the market.

That is not very responsible and I am sure that, if the Senate thinks about that for more than a moment, it will realise that, to be suggesting a national compensation scheme, it needs to have a hell of a lot more information than is available.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>âOrder!

Within that framework, it provides for an additional $24 million, which is nothing more than the funds made available for normal price adjustments. Other measures associated with this bill are incorporated within the base funding. Notwithstanding that, the Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer, in his second reading speech on this bill, said:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>This record level of funding provided to the States and Territories for their vocational education and training systems in 2003 is a demonstration of the Commonwealth's commitment to a strong national vocational education and training system.</para></quote><para>I would like to deal with that issue at some length in this second reading debate. Frankly, the proposition that the minister puts forward is disingenuous at best. It is a miserable commitment by the government with regard to the total quantum. It is a measure of the government's failure to address the fundamental problems within vocational education and training in this countryâin particular, the unsatisfactory efficiencies policy that was pursued by the former minister and continued as a consequence of the growth funding agreement entered into with the states last year. It was a proposition which saw that growth funding was includedâwhich was a backdown by the government with regard to their original position that no growth funding would be providedâbut on terms and conditions which were unsatisfactory to meet the needs of the system.</para><para>We have before us a bill that, in effect, allows for indexation arrangements of 1.6 per cent. I remind the Senate that the 1.6 per cent indexation figure that applies to vocational education compares with the 2.2 per cent figure that applies to the university system and the 5.7 per cent that applies to the schools system. You can see in those terms that the vocational education system in this country is at a disadvantage by comparison with other sectors within education itself.</para><para>The statement that the minister makes that the Commonwealth is committed to `a strong national vocational education and training system' is one that I would like to pay particular attention to. The government has had before it legal advice for many years that indicates that the present administrative arrangements do not have a legal foundation which would stand up to serious challenge in a court of law. Details of the requirement were of course contained in the report <inline font-style="italic">Aspiring to excellence,</inline> which was brought down in the Senate in November 2000. That followed fairly detailed examination of the evidence presented to the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee, in particular the evidence of the legal opinions, of which there are a number, from the legal firm Minter Ellison. They were commissioned by the government in response to persistent complaints from all the major players within the vocational education system that the present arrangements were unsatisfactory. In fact, as far back as 1998, the state ministers and the CEOs of the various training authorities across Australia acknowledged that there were serious legal questions underpinning the quality assurance regime within vocational education in this country. So the government has known for four years that the legal foundations of the vocational education system in this country have been open to serious challenge. </para><para>The government's response to this serious legal advice was that a committee name change should occur and that there be a series of processes entered into with the states to highlight the need for change. So there was a recognition that the legal advice was sound, and understandings were reached about the need for urgent action in achieving what was said to be a fully integrated, high quality national vocational education system. You have to bear in mind that that legal advice was undertaken at Minister Kemp's direction, and it specifically excluded consideration of any legislative framework being undertaken through this parliament. It proposed in essence that, given the need to have national consistency and given the increasingly national nature of our economy, a series of model clause agreements should be entered into across Australia by the various states and territories. We soon discoveredâ and we said it at the timeâthat that approach was not likely to produce results quickly.</para><para>Let me come back to the original proposition. We have a national economy. We treat ourselves as one nation and talk of ourselves as being a nation. Yet we do not have an education system that underpins our economy and allows for basic vocational education to be undertaken on a nationally consistent basis. I put the view that, if you are a tradesman or tradeswoman or a highly skilled worker, you are entitled to have qualifications that mean something no matter where you go within this country. For instance, if you are a fitter or an automotive mechanic and you have a certificate IV, that certificate should have the same standing no matter where you are within the country. It should have the same level of skills, the same level of competencies, and be a qualification that is accepted wherever you go. Frankly, if you think about this in terms of our international relations these days, it is important for workers to have qualifications that can be recognised outside this country as well.</para><para>So, increasingly, a large number of companies and organisations are suggesting that they need to have qualifications that can be understood from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. That is clearly not the case at the moment. Take for instance the last ministerial council meeting, held I think in May this year. On page 5 of a paper entitled <inline font-style="italic">Achieving fully integrated, high quality national vocational education and training systems</inline> it is stated:</para><quote><para>Notwithstanding the worthwhile gains in quality and national consistency, feedback from enterprises is that the complexity of arrangements across jurisdictions, particularly in the area of New Apprenticeships, is still acting as a major inhibitor to further engagement. This is particularly evident where companies need to understand systems and transact business across jurisdictions but also applies within single jurisdictions given the range of players, complexity of systems and constant rate of change. This is reported to have led many companies previously operating as enterprise RTOs to move towards the use of intermediaries (which include public and private RTOs, training brokers, national ITABs, and Group Training Companies) and partnership arrangements with other RTOs. At the same time, these intermediariesâdespite being system expertsâalso have considerable difficulty working across borders.</para></quote><para>The government acknowledged that these problems had emerged and that, despite the transition of a period now of four years, no one state in this great Commonwealth had actually picked up the model clause arrangementsâno one state. In fact, at the last MINCO it was proposed that at the next MINCO meeting there be a discussion on what progress might be made towards a legislative response. Not all the states and territories signed up to that either. Some significant jurisdictions reserved their opinion. </para><para>Having acknowledged that there were serious problems, the government set in place a special report through ANTAâit is called the troubleshooter reportâon national consistency. It is quite contemporary, dating from May this year for a report due in November. It said that there were:</para><quote><para>varying training plan requirements</para><para>variations in nominal duration of apprenticeships and traineeships</para><para> varying certification arrangement on completion of the apprenticeship/traineeship</para><para>differing approaches in access to apprenticeships/traineeships for existing employees</para><para>varied recognition of enterprise Training Packages for New Apprenticeships</para><para>the need to understand and address non-completion rates, the treatment of casual employees and continuing apprentices/trainees</para><para>differing approaches to the movement of apprentices and trainees across borders</para><para>difficulties where a national client seeks to use one RTO across jurisdictions under User Choice, and</para><para>the need to develop an agreed approach to the identification and presentation of information given the recent proliferation of websites.</para></quote><para>We have not even got national agreement yet on the training package arrangements. I am talking about effective operation, not the mealy-mouthed approach that has been taken. I am talking about the effective operation of our vocational education system in this country at this time. And what is the government's response? `We'll have another working party.' Another working party! After spending four years on a fundamental legal problem which every major employer and every major interest group in this country knows about, the government's response was to get legal advice which says, `You must exclude the possibility of a national legislative response to this problem, because we are going to rely upon providing a model clauses approach with the agreement of the states and territories.' And what evidence or outcomes have we seen? We have seen very little indeed.</para><para>We do not even have agreement on mutual recognition yet. The only change that has effectively occurred is that the current framework has had its name changed. It is now called the Australian Quality Training Framework, the AQTF, which replaces the former ARF. What a tremendous achievement! What startling progress! This is what we call a truly national vocational education scheme! Isn't that what the minister said? He said we have a strong national vocational training system. It strikes me that either the minister's second reading address is based on a profound ignorance of what is actually occurringâclearly not supported by the ministerial council documents which the minister presumably was given this year and which the department has presumably advised him on in terms of the progress towards the next MINCO, to be held in Novemberâor, alternatively, the minister is being disingenuous.</para><para>It strikes me that there are serious misgivings about the capacity for this minister to get on top of these issues. It strikes me that what we have seen is testimony to a broader problem within vocational education, which is that the reform agenda has effectively stalled. There has been no significant movement in vocational education and training in regard to the reform agenda for the better part of 18 months. It stopped in the six-month run-up to the last election just after the agreement on the future funding formula was struck and it has not moved forward since that time. There has been some discussion on the questions in this bill, including the question of disabilities. There is a Senate inquiry that is currently under way that Senator Tierney and I are serving on.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1M6</name.id><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name></talker><para>âI am on that committee too.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator CARR</name></talker><para>âSenator Allison, my apologiesâI did not see you there. We have an inquiry looking into the question of disabilities. Disabilities are referred to in the minister's second reading speech as well. It indicates that the government is providing additional resources within the base funding. There is no additional allocation. There is no specific purpose payment within this appropriation. It is just indicated that within the base funding there will be money made available for disabilities. In regard to ANTA's performance on disabilities, 3.3 per cent of working age people with a disability participate in VET, which is a very small rate of participation. It strikes me that this is another issue that requires quite urgent attention. VET provides assistance for people who are disadvantaged in many ways and gives them a second chance of education, as well as providing the foundation for the development of a skilled work force in this country. In light of this, 3.3 per cent is a figure that one should not be proud of. I see nothing in this provision that will seriously improve that number. It strikes me that there is a clear problem there as well. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The issue of employer incentives is another matter that was referred to in the minister's second reading speech. This is a problem that has been with us for many years. It is a bit like the tax avoidance industry. One has to pay constant attention to the abuses of employer incentives. The government proposes additional money to go towards employer incentives, to encourage more employers to take people on. A pamphlet distributed by a company called Business and Corporate Training Services says:</para><quote><para>How many of your staff attract the $4400 Government Grant?</para><para>Train your staff and make money at the same time! The Government is currently giving grants of up to $4,400-$5,400 per employee to employers, and providing National Accredited QualificationsâON THE JOB.</para><para>This is available for all staff, regardless of how long they have worked for your company.</para></quote><para>It goes on to say that the areas include:</para><quote><para>Business ...</para><para>Front Line Management (for all supervisors) ...</para><para>Information Technology (for anyone who uses a computer)</para><para>Finance (for all accounts and administration staff)</para><para>Retail Operations ...</para><para>Business Administration ...</para></quote><para>And so on and so forth. It seems to me that the issue of employer incentives does require constant supervision. It strikes me that this is another example of where there is a misuse of the employer incentive program. It is not supposed to be a wage subsidy. It is not supposed to be a means by which you substitute the payment of workers for arrangements in which:</para><quote><para>The training is delivered on your premises once a month, and the rebates are paid directly into your business bank account.</para></quote><para>It is supposed to be a mechanism whereby you are subsidised for the training costs. It is not supposed to be a wage subsidy, as this document would suggest. I have moved a second reading amendment to this bill because I am concerned that a range of matters require considerable attention and have not been picked up within this bill. We are particularly concerned about the way in which young people are being treated by this government. The government has not provided in the budget an appropriate comprehensive response to the Youth Pathways report, particularly with regard to the VET in schools program. Despite its growing usage, the program has a number of issues that require further attentionâin particular, the role of schools in RTOs, the way in which they are being used at the moment and the capacity to provide high-quality training for what is approaching, I understand on the projection, some 70 per cent of students in years 11 and 12 by 2004. We are concerned about the way in which the VET in schools program is being implemented, and we would like to see further action there.</para><para>There is also concern about Indigenous people's participation rates within the VET program, and we are very concerned about the decline in the number of people under this government who are participating both in higher education and in vocational education. This is a government that has a shameful record in vocational education and training. It has failed our young people; it has failed older workers; it has failed the national economy in the development of nationally consistent arrangements to protect the quality of vocational education qualifications in this country; it has presided over falling completion rates; it has seen a significant number of people encouraged to take on dead-end training packages, particularly at the certificates 1 and 2 levels; and it has done little in the way of developing policies to ensure that there is a training reform agenda in this country which is broadly based and attracts support right across the community. I am afraid that this minister does not seem to have his heart in this particular aspect of his portfolio. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>5625</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1569">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> provides funding to be distributed by the Australian National Training Authority to the states and territories for capital and recurrent purposes and for national projects. The bill increases funding for 2002 by $24.3 million, appropriates $992 million for 2003 and provides up to $101 million for growth funding in 2003. The Democrats will be supporting the bill. I notice that the opposition is moving a second reading amendment, which we will also supportâalthough I am not altogether sure, Senator Carr, why we should. The ALP wants to condemn the government for failing to address youth unemployment. Some of us in this place have longer memories than perhaps you assume.</para></talk.start><para>The real interest in the opposition's amendment, we say, is not the failings for which they condemn the government but, rather, the failings for which they do not. The opposition ignore the real problems, including the Howard government's lack of commitment to TAFEs; its overreliance on simple-minded competition, including user pays; its refusal to engage with the states and territories to address the very real problems of excessive casualisation of TAFE teaching; its overemphasis on short-term training at the expense of breadth in post-compulsory vocational education; and its marginalisation of the TAFEs in ongoing innovation debates. We are saying that these are real issues of concern because it is these, in combination with inadequate resourcing, that are driving the problem.</para><para>I am not sure that the TAFE sector will be able to take anything away from this second reading amendment. It certainly will not be thinking that there is a government in waiting bursting with ideas, energy and commitment. There are serious problems in the TAFE sector, as I have already alluded to. The current triennial ANTA agreement covers 2001-03, and we certainly hope that the negotiation period leading up to the next agreement results in a far more sophisticated approach to vocational education.</para><para>It is important to note that the bill does not restore funding to levels commensurate with 1997. This is particularly important when we consider the increasing participation in vocational education and training and the high level of unmet demand. The government has effectively reduced vocational education in TAFEs and VET to a second-rate instrument of employment policy through concentration on training courses, many of which are short term and do not prepare students well for ongoing work, education and training; and which, moreover, have poor completion rates.</para><para>At the heart of the government's approach to vocational education are rewards for throughput and cutting cornersâin other words, churningâand this is a dangerous false economy. Nominal hours create incentives to separate techniques from the generic skills and context that make sense of their use. Skills acquired in environments geared to fast tracking desensitise institutions to the diversity of needs of students. Superficial and narrow training also means that such skills run the risk of rapidly failing to be of value in a changing employment environment. Despite myriad press releases over the past few years from this and previous ministers, New Apprenticeships disguises real shortages in fair dinkum areas of technical and engineering apprenticeships. Indeed, in these crucial areas, numbers are falling. I am aware that the question of incentives for private providers is currently being reviewed. The key issue in the review of incentives will be successful completions. Current arrangements effectively only reward recruitment of traineesâchurning people through the front door, in other words.</para><para>With a more sophisticated funding mix, including incentives for completions, we might see the very high attrition rates in New Apprenticeshipsâcurrently, about 50 per cent, I understandâbegin to fall as providers becomes more interested in offering proper student support, mentoring and pastoral care. However, success in post-compulsory education, as indeed for other levels of education, is predicated upon good teaching. It is hard to see any real scope for shifting the current approach forward until we develop proper strategies to end the long-term trends of casualisation and deprofessionalisation of teaching. That is of course a fundamental role for the states and territories. On this issue alone, I do not think the states deserve Senator Carr's second reading amendment. </para><para>We need to provide additional resources to ensure a professional layer of full-time and qualified teachers delivering the main core of TAFE programs. That and shifting the focus away from the excessive concentration on narrow training programs towards stronger education values are the two great challenges that this government needs to overcome.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>5626</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI also rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1569">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline>. It was interesting to listen to Senator Carr and his criticisms of the government. One of the things we do not remind people of sufficiently in this chamber, in all areas of government, is what used to happen under the Labor government. Those who are dallying with the idea of returning Labor as the government of this country should think very long and hard about their appalling record across a whole range of policy areas, but particularly in education. Senator Carr seems to have forgotten the record of the last Labor government on VET.</para></talk.start><para>Let us go back through the records of Senate estimates. Senator Carr is very fond of going through Senate estimates records. Perhaps he should go back to the period from 1990 to 1996 and look at the questions and answers, and then he would really appreciate the appalling state of vocational education and training in this country over the period of the last Labor government from 1983 through to 1996. The main minister at that timeâthere were a number, but the main ministerâwas John Dawkins. He had as a major focus the reorganisation and disorganisation of Australia's universities, and he created enormous trauma through the whole university system by what he did. The way universities responded to this appalling approach to public policy was amazing and a great tribute to the universities. Reorganising Australia's universities in one afternoonâ from 19 to 37, for exampleâcreated enormous difficulties in the system, and they have come through it very well. But one of the outcomes of that was that the minister at the time totally ignored VET. There was very little done with vocational education and training. The one shining lightâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âWhere did the ANTA agreement come from?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>âYou are anticipating my next sentence, Senator Carr. Let me finish the sentence. The one shining light of what was done in that period was the creation of ANTA, the Australian National Training Authority. The Labor government realised the way it had neglected vocational education and training, and the states had let it run down. Something had to be done about vocational education and training in this country, and indeed something was done with the creation of ANTA. That has been, over the last 10 years, an excellent instrument for targeting growth funding into basically a state controlled vocational education and training system. Senator Carr's earlier remarks today indicate that he prefers a centralist approach to all of this. We know his political beliefs, and it is not surprising that he would advocate everything be run by a central government.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What Dr Kemp showed in his administration, particularly of vocational education and training, was that an enormous amount can be achieved in government policy, in an area that is basically controlled by the states, if you take a cooperative federal approach. Through bodies such as MCEETYA, there was an enormous amount done in the reform of vocational education and training, and we now see that in the outcomes in this area of education, as compared with what was happening under the previous Labor government. I would like to invite Senator Carr to trawl back through those earlier records and to look particularly at my questions in the Senate estimates process on apprenticeships each year under the Labor government. </para><para>There was a very consistent trend in apprenticeship training in this country under the last Labor government, and it was all downhill. Each year the outcomes were worse than the year before. They did not come up with any real policies to reverse this. It was left to the then Minister for Education, Training and Youth Affairs, Dr Kemp, to bring in a number of quite significant changes to the whole sector and bring a change in outcomes about. The whole approach to apprenticeships and traineeships was changed. New Apprenticeships was created, there was a new emphasis on traineeships, we had a real emphasis on the creation of VET in schoolsâsomething that the previous Labor government virtually ignoredâ and we brought in registered training organisations. We tried to changeâI think quite successfullyâa system that was very dominated by state TAFE colleges into one that was delivering far more flexible training. Through New Apprenticeships, we managed to expand from the traditional trade areas into a whole range of service areas and jobs that much better reflected the directions and changes in the nature of the Australian economy.</para><para>We are now seeing the fruit of that. At this time, one-third of teenagers in this country are in some type of apprenticeship or traineeship in employment. I invite Senator Carr to look back to the position exactly 10 years ago, compare the figures and have a look at how Labor were going then. They had been in government for over nine years, so they certainly had a lot of timeâmore time than we have hadâto reform the system, but the reforms were not made and the outcomes were absolutely appalling. We now have a record 333,000 young people in apprenticeships and traineeships in this country.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âThey are not apprenticeships.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>O15</name.id><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name></talker><para>âOf course they are.</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>âThey are `new apprenticeships'.

What you did was stay with a 19th century system of apprenticeships. What we have done with New Apprenticeships is create a modern system that is far more flexible, responds far better to the economy and provides more appropriate training to the circumstances of young people. Let me repeat the outcome: 333,000 peopleâone-third of a millionâare in apprenticeships or traineeships at this time. That actually represents 2Â½ per cent of the total work force who are in some form of traineeship or apprenticeship.</para></talk.start></continue><para>What we have done is a remarkable improvement over what happened under the previous Labor government, and by international comparison it is also an outstanding record.

They will certainly follow some of the innovations of the Howard government over the last six years.</para><para>When Senator Carr made his concluding remarks he said that the government had a shameful record in vocational education and training. What nonsense! The only governments with a shameful record in vocational education and training in this country were the Hawke-Keating governments between 1983 and 1996.

Let me provide a bit of background to the funding of VET. As we know, in 1996-97, when this government came to office it reneged on the Commonwealth commitments in the original agreement with the Australian National Training Authority, ANTA, signed by Labor prior to 1996, to have growth funding going into the training sector. We know that the landscape in funding this sector of education has dramatically changed since that time. In fact, since 1996 there has been a cumulative reduction of over $200 million in the Commonwealth funding of VET and a massive cut in the labour market programs. </para></talk.start><para>The impact of these funding cuts on the TAFE system has shown a dramatic decrease in the ability of this system to function effectively since that time. Two years ago, the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations, Small Business and Education References Committee conducted an inquiry into what was happening in the vocational education and training sector. The outcomes were very similar, really, to what is happening in higher educationâthat is, these days TAFE colleges and institutions and the staff in those institutions are expected to do much more and operate much more efficiently and provide a much broader range of courses and outcomes for their students, with significantly fewer funds.</para><para>In 1998, when renegotiating the new agreement with ANTA, we saw the end of this government's commitment to growth funding. Those in the sector will well remember the new concept of `growth through efficiencies' that emanated from this governmentâthat is, in return for growth through efficiencies, the Commonwealth promised and was to maintain funding in real terms to the VET system. Those who have been working in the vocational education and training system since the Howard government came to office are still scratching their heads and wondering what `growth through efficiencies' actually means. We now know that it means that you put in significantly more effort and longer hours, with larger classes and an expectation that your courses are more diverse, more responsive and more flexible to the needs of industry. But of course the funding from the government has been reduced, funding that in real terms did not address the unmet demand or the growth in student numbers.</para><para>This is an aspect of the training sector that the Labor Party has revealed year after year through the estimates process. In fact, we were able to demonstrate a significant unmet demand in this country, a significant increase in the number of students who want to access vocational education and trainingâand they haveâbut institutions, providers and staff have had to accommodate that unmet need without any real increase in funding from this government. The 1997-2000 revenue from this Commonwealth government fell by $112 million, which neutralised the $150 million that had been put into the system by the state and territory governments during that time. So, all up, there has been a cumulative reduction in Commonwealth revenue during this time, to the tune of $386 million.</para><para>We have a recent report from the Productivity Commission entitled <inline font-style="italic">Skills and Australia's productivity surge.</inline> As a result of that report, we know that the growth in skills that people need to possess in order to meet the demands of industry, be responsive to industry and meet the expectation that industry has on its future operational needs and output has dropped under the Howard government. Those skills had accounted for over 28 per cent of productivity growth in the late 1980s and early 1990s but accounted for only 2.9 per cent of productivity growth in recent years. When there is such a dramatic drop in the contribution that skills are making to the economic growth and the productivity output of this country, from 28 per cent down to 2.9 per cent, there has to be a dramatic change in the way in which this country operates and the way in which this country responds to what industry wants and what the international markets demand. Certainly we are seeing a deskilling of this country. The Productivity Commission report, through its figures, has shown that that in fact is the case.</para><para>This afternoon I want to specifically look at the impact on this system from the neglect of the Commonwealth government because of its lack of commitment to funding in this sectorâthe impact that that has had not only on the youth of our country but also on the way in which rural and regional Australia can respond to the demands of students and industry. The TAFE system has 1Â¾ million students enrolled in the vocational education and training system. We know that at least one in every 10 Australians acquire some sort of educative or broader skills or work related skills or lifelong learning experience through the TAFE sector. It has become a sector that has been integral to the education environment in this country. Earlier in the year, the minister made some fairly disparaging remarks about the TAFE sector, referring to it as being a sector that people use as a backdoor means of getting into higher educationâimplying that, if you were not good enough to have an academic career and go to the universities for your education, the second and probably the least preferred option you had was to go through the VET sector or the TAFE sector. That view shows a complete lack of understanding of what the TAFE sector in this country does and what it provides. In fact, there are some peopleâ obviously 1Â¾ million students, which is many more than those in the higher education sectorâwho choose to take the vocational education and training sector as the sole means for providing their education, their skills and their background in this country. They would have been quite upsetâ certainly staff in this sector were quite upsetâto learn of this minister's views earlier in the year. </para><para>I want to turn now to a report that has recently been released by the Dusseldorp Skills Forum. The report is titled <inline font-style="italic">How young people are faringâkey indicators 2002</inline>. It is an update about the learning and work situation for young Australians. It is a very significant report, and I think it should serve as a wake-up call to the government that one of the ways in which they can address the situation regarding young people in this country is to inject more funds into the VET sector to accommodate the needs of these people. The accompanying letter to the report says:</para><quote><para>The findings are sobering. There has been a small increase in the number of teenagers not in full-time education or full-time employment (15.4 per cent or 211,000 young people) in May 2002 compared to the same time last year. And still some 25 per cent of young adult women and 19 per cent of young adult men were at considerable labour-market risk in that same month.</para></quote><para>The chair of the forum continues in the letter:</para><quote><para>... our research continues to display significant variations across States and Territories.</para></quote><para>I want to particularly highlight in this report the dramatic figures in relation to the Northern Territory. We know that 15.4 per cent of teenagers were not in full-time education or employment in May 2002. However, in the Northern Territory the figure is more than double that number. In the Northern Territory, 32 per cent of teenagers were not in full-time education or full-time employment in May 2002. That is a startling figure, compared to the rest of the nation. This report also shows that the proportion of teenagers at risk has been rising gradually since 1999 and in May 2002 it stands at 15.4 per cent, which is higher than the prerecession years of the late 1980s. The report states:</para><quote><para>It is likely that without significant and lasting reforms to develop more effective learning and work transition strategiesâ</para></quote><para>and one of those key reforms, I believe, is to ensure that the TAFE sector gets the funds it needs and deserves to be able to operate properly and effectivelyâ</para><quote><para>during these relatively good economic times young people will be especially vulnerable during the next period of recession.</para></quote><para>The report says:</para><quote><para>The situation in the Northern Territory, with close to a third of its teenage population in `at risk' activities, should be a cause of national concern.</para></quote><para>And so it should be, because those figures are startling; they are nothing to be particularly proud of. That goes to my point of the failure of this government to respond to a report that was commissioned in 1999 to set up a Youth Pathways Action Plan Taskforce to examine young people's transitions from school to work, further education and active participation in community life. When you have a situation in the Northern Territory where at least 32 per cent of teenagers are not in full-time employment or in full-time education, that sort of report from the task force should have been the basis for crucial action on the part of the government to look at addressing and reducing those statistics. That report was due to be released in March 2000; however, it was not released until May 2001âsome 14 months later. It was a comprehensive and far-reaching report and set the scene for radical new approaches to addressing the needs of young people, particularly those who are disconnected or who are at risk of becoming disconnected from society. </para><para>The Howard government promised that there would be budget measures in response to that report, but we know from this year's estimates process that nothing substantial was made available in the budget, and we know that this government has not announced any new initiatives at all as a result of the Youth Pathways action plan. The department in fact informed us during the estimates process that they had not been instructed to investigate the introduction of any new programs as a result of this report.</para><para>Is it any wonder then that we have TAFE Directors Australiaâa body that I met with quite recently when they had a meeting in Darwinâemphasising how critical the role of the TAFE sector is in this country? In a kit that was released prior to the federal election last year, `Skilling Australians for the future', TAFE Directors Australia took the opportunity to emphasise the critical role that the TAFE sector must play if Australia is to have a world-class vocational education and training system. In fact, in a letter to me they went on to say:</para><quote><para>It underlines the need for adequate funding and a curriculum approach that would enable TAFE Institutes to perform that role. It also emphasises the importance of recognising the TAFE sector as a full and equal partner with other stakeholdersâ</para></quote><para>something that the federal minister, Brendan Nelson, has failed to realise as yetâ</para><quote><para>in working towards an improved national vocational education and training system.</para></quote><para>Of course, during that time TAFE Directors wanted a range of changes that they believed were necessary to improve the TAFE sector. The first of thoseâand the key recommendation coming from TAFE Directorsâwas significantly increasing the national investment in TAFE to fund unmet demand, which this government does not do; then providing places in emerging industry areasâwhich this government does not recognise there is a need to doâand teacher professional development, improved student services, and computers and high-tech facilities in institutions. This government believes that institutions should be able to find all of that through its old `growth through efficiencies' policy, but there is no new or additional `growth' money for people to be able to do that.</para><para>On the brighter side, though, there has been one slight change that I want to report on to the Senate, and that is that at least you can have some small gains in this sector. The Australian National Training Authority had a VET Infrastructure for Indigenous People Program. Back in 1999, through the Senate estimates process, I highlighted that in the Northern Territory, where a number of training facilities had been built under this program, there was no provision for these facilities to actually set aside room for a trainer to stayâthere was no accommodation attached to these facilities. So a trainer would go out from Darwin for three or four nights at a time to a new facility that had been built with ANTA funds, under their VET infrastructure program, and all that the guidelines approved in those days was just the classroom. So you would have a situation where a trainer was having to sleep on the floor in a classroom for the four nights or two weeks of the block training that they delivered in those communities.</para><para>I am pleased to say that ANTA listened to and looked at what was needed in those remote communities, and those guidelines have now been changed. Those guidelines now do accommodate the extra three or four square metres that were needed to make a trainer's life comfortable when they went to remote communities. I had the pleasure of being at Titjikala community, which is a couple of hundred kilometres south-east of Alice Springs, when the new training centre, the Paulus Wilyuka training centre, was opened. This centre has been named after an Indigenous pastor from that community who committed his life to improving training outcomes for his people. That centre was built by a local Indigenous building team and it not only has a classroom for VET and training facilities but also accommodates the trainer. </para><para>It was probably a very small change to ANTA's program guidelines, but it means an awful lot to those trainers who do not have to sleep on the floor anymore in those remote communities but are provided with a bed, a bathroom and some kitchen facilities so that life is a little more comfortable. So there can be light at the end of the tunnel when bureaucracies actually listen to and take notice of what is needed out in those communities. I was very pleased to attend the opening of that training centre, and I congratulate ANTA and the ANTA board on recognising that their guidelines for the infrastructure program were too narrow and inflexible and needed to change.</para><para>In closing, let me say that there has been another significant change in the training program and the way in which this federal government has approached training in this country this year. That of course has been the decision to cut funding to industry training bodies at the state levelâto cut the funds that state and territory governments can access to provide training advice at that level. I notice that my time is diminishing, so perhaps I should leave this for another time. But this is another example of the government's neglect of the VET sector and the TAFE sector since it came to office in 1996.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>5631</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1569">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> is an imperative piece of legislation for the training needs of young people in this country. This is particularly important for those at greater risk of being marginalised by education and training and employment. The Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 makes available the maximum amount of vocational education and training funding for distribution by ANTA to the states and territories for capital and recurrent purposes and for national projects. The purpose of this particular bill is to amend the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 to supplement the funding which was appropriated in 2001 for vocational education and training, and was provided to the Australian National Training Authority for distribution to the states and territories in the year 2002. This is in line with real price movements and the Commonwealth's commitment under the 2001-03 ANTA agreement to maintain its level of base funding in real terms.</para></talk.start><para>The main provisions are as follows. The effect of item 1 of schedule 1 is to amend the amounts payable to ANTA under section 9 of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 in the following manner: increasing the amount of base funding payable for 2002 from $956.158 million to $978.781 million and providing a base funding appropriation of $992.295 million for the year 2003. The effect of item 2 of schedule 1 is to amend the amounts payable under subsection 9AB(2) of the Vocational Education and Training Funding Act 1992 to ANTA for allocation to states and territories, by increasing the amount of funding payable for 2002 from $75 million to $76.725 million and providing funding of $101.725 million for 2003.</para><para>This all sounds well and good. However, the government has failed to develop adequate policies and programs that ensure successful transitions to adulthood. It has become apparent in the latest report of the Dusseldorf Skills Forum, entitled <inline font-style="italic">How young people are faring</inline>, that there is a great constant increase in the number of young people in the age range of 15 to 19 years who are neither here nor there on any form of education or training and are not in full-time work. This, of course, translates into over 200,000, or approximately 15 per cent of all young people in that particular age category, who are not in any form of education or employment that will result in a worthwhile job in the long-term future.</para><para>This is a troubling issue and one that has not been adequately addressed by the Howard government. The disastrous reason for this situation is that more than 40 per cent of young people who left school before year 12 were involved in at-risk activities within six months of leaving school. These at-risk activities include drug taking and other illegal activities. From my experience, this is more prevalent in country areas and areas where there are fewer opportunities for young people to find work of any nature. It is pure commonsense, then, that the best way to distract young people in the most constructive way from at-risk behaviour is to provide them with education and training and give them opportunities for employment. How often have we heard young people say, `You can train me but can you give me a job?' The answer to that, in the majority of cases, unfortunately, is no, because there is no focus by this government on the long-term future of our young. </para><para>We are also well aware that Australian businesses frantically need more skilled workers. They are constantly telling us that. The government's reaction to this was the New Apprenticeships Access Program, which focused on the low-paid and low-skilled instead of on the high-growth, high-paid, high-demand skilled workers that were required by so many industries. The consensus from industry groups has been that the government program has in fact produced a severe skills shortage in high-skilled technical areas. Some of the examples include those in medical services, engineering, and mechanical and electrical tradesâand that is just to name a few.</para><para>What we now have is these apprentices being forced down to the other end of the scaleâ`You can train me; you cannot provide me with the work.' The skills and training that are offered in the TAFE and VET institutions will provide those much-needed opportunities at the high-skill, high-wage end and prevent what has been happening. But the question is: what is the Howard government doing about the dilemma that we face?</para><para>What we have is a scheme that is a source of cheap labour rather than a constructive measure to assist the unemployed. The government have reiterated what they believe is the success of this program, with the doubling of numbers of apprenticeships and traineeships. What is not being reiterated is the expense this has cost the vocational education sector with quality training outcomes. And that is what countsâquality training with true outcomes and jobs at the end. There are many employers out there who are simply exploiting the scheme as a de facto wage subsidy program. They see it as nothing more than a cheap way of getting labour for a period of time. It has gotten to the point that in many cases trainees have had their chances of getting a job hindered if they have already undertaken a traineeship.</para><para>The other disturbing fact is that there is a consistently high noncompletion rate among trainees. Almost 50 per cent of trainees participating in the scheme do not complete their course of training. That is a cause for real concern. The latest ABS figures illustrate that between 20 and 30 per cent of those who do continue their traineeship receive inadequate training. Between 1997 and 2001, the average training hours per employee fell by 15 per cent.</para><para>The key to developing a successful transition for young people into jobs is to provide a strong, vital TAFE sector. Consequently, TAFEs need to be well funded in order to provide the incentives and support for these young people leaving school that will eventually lead them to work and prevent at-risk activities. It is all interwoven. If you provide no real outcomes you have young people at risk, and that is when we pay the price.</para><para>This bill does not address the massive funding cuts the vocational education and training sector was hit with in the Howard-Costello budgets of 1996 and 1997. The Commonwealth contribution to vocational education and training operating revenue fell by $112 million between 1997 and 2000. During the last election, the Howard government promised young people a future action plan for young Australians. The government said that it would provide a comprehensive response to the report in the 2002 budget, but while this government is big on inquiries and reports it does very little to implement the findings of those inquiries.</para><para>Instead, we have government policies that have given very little assistance to the young people of Australia and have consequently caused a great deal of negative self-esteem. Low self-esteem caused by the inability of young people to fulfil their potential can be observed every time you walk down the main streets of any city and down the streets and malls of any small or medium sized town in this country. To add to this negative self-esteem that young people are experiencing, the government is more interested in massive funding increases to wealthy private schools. The attitude of this government is to look after one and forget about the other: `Don't worry too much about the needy. They can't look after themselvesâthey won't cause us problems.' </para><para>Young people have also had enormous rises in HECS fees and consequently have no time to study and enjoy university because they are working record hours to pay the rent and buy food. If you are in vocational education or at university you spend what time you have workingâif you can get workâ simply to pay the rent and pay for your food. The GST has increased the cost of living, and there are record levels of youth homelessness. These issues are not addressed by the government.</para><para>To add insult to injury, the government's new apprenticeships scheme has created a warped subsidy for crooked employers. All of these issues need urgent attention. The answer to creating opportunities for the young people of Australia is to encourage more students into TAFE, into vocational education. This can be achieved only through investment in the future. This government needs to develop a plan that gives it a reason and a vision for investing in our young people's futures.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>5633</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe <inline ref="R1569">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> holds a special attraction for me. Having worked in the retail industry and spent a long time participating in the industry at the organisational level as an organiser or industrial officer or as the Assistant Secretary or Secretary of the SDA in Queensland, I have experienced problems associated with school-to-work transitional programs and also, through serving on various boards, with programs involving TAFE.</para></talk.start><para>I particularly want to say that my difficulties with many of these programs go back to 1978. At that stage, there was a program known as the `sweet pea' schemeâthe Special Youth Employment Training Programâ which was meant to assist young people in gaining employment. Unfortunately, that program was invariably exploited by employers as a source of cheap labour. They would engage young people and give them bright prospects of employment. These young people would become very enthusiastic, only to find out that as the government subsidy ran out so did their employment, and a new batch would replace them. On that basis, I have a degree of cynicism in this area.</para><para>I am not completely a cynic, because I do admit that there are good outcomes in this area. But, having worked for a long period of timeâand I think 25 years in the retail industry is a long timeâI know some of the pitfalls that exist there. These pitfalls were alluded to by my colleague Senator Buckland, who was undoubtedly referring to the industries that he is familiar with. Nonetheless, they are there in the retail industry as well, and I think it is worth while putting on the record today some of those concerns.</para><para>If one looks at the labour market statistics, one finds that the retail industry is a particularly large employerâof all the sectors, it is in the top five; in fact, it is No. 1. Most importantly, if one looks at the age break-up in employment based on the November 2001 statistics, one finds that in the order of 50.3 per cent of employment in the retail industry is focused in the age group between 15 and 19 years of age. These people are the most vulnerable and most susceptible to being exploited, because this is where not all but the majority of money under vocational education and training would be focused and, for people who are seeking transition from school to work, VET undoubtedly plays a significant part in giving them an opportunity to have some long and lasting employment.</para><para>The importance of the Vocational Education and Training in Schools scheme falls into two broad areas: firstly, it acquaints the student with the world of work and, secondly, it equips them with the capacity to seek and obtain employment post school in a way which gives recognition to the value of their Vocational Education and Training in Schools achievements and qualifications. That is terribly important to these young people. It does two things: it gives them social skills and it equips them with achievements and qualifications for bona fide employment opportunities into the future. According to a past submission of my organisation, the SDA: </para><quote><para>There is widespread concern in industry (both employers and unions) that VETISâ</para></quote><para>Vocational Education and Training in Schoolsâ</para><quote><para>students, whilst having a comparable qualification, do not have comparable skills and abilities to others with the same qualification who have obtained their qualification post school, whilst part of the paid work force.</para></quote><para>So there is a diminution of the value of the training. That, of course, is a concern. One of the reasons why some employers seek to exploit the labour of these young people is that the training does not necessarily gain the recognition that it should. There is no doubt, though, that the training that is provided must conform to the Australian Quality Training Framework and the relevant national training package. It is unrealistic to expect that the industry will embrace students whose training is not in line with training packages. Again, that comes out of the submissionâa very good submission, I might addâthat my organisation has made in times past. The submission says:</para><quote><para>There is widespread concern at industry level that many of those delivering VETIS do not meet the trainer and/or assessor requirements set out in the Training Package.</para><para>There is also widespread concern that teachers often lack understanding of the workplace and the industry concerned.</para></quote><para>That is where I have a particular concern in respect of the retail industry. In the retail industry, as one of my colleagues described in this debate before, a churning process takes place because of a lack of understanding of the retailers and the retail industry itselfânot all retailers; one must be quite fair. There are some very good retailers out there who seek to do the right thing by those students, who do seek to give them a realistic opportunity, but there are also the exploiters. Unfortunately, when it comes to a debate such as this, one tends to focus upon those who exploit the system rather than on those who use the system wisely and in a responsible manner. There is clearly considerable concern as to whether the current system is producing consistent quality outcomes. This is in part due to the lack of funds; this government has failed to provide them in this area. The states, we are aware, are pulling their weight; they are doing their share. But this government, as always, has been behind the eight ball.</para><para>Focusing now on my concern about employment prospects and the way in which these people can from time to time be churned, I want to return to the SDA submission and look at a couple of specific quotes that I think sum up in a nutshell the way young people in this 15 to 19 age bracket, which we all concerned about, can be treated from time to time. The submission says:</para><quote><para>In many instances students are compelled to complete their on the job training/work at peak operation times.</para></quote><para>So what is meant to be a program through which they are getting vocational education and training turns out to be in many ways nothing more than subsidised employment. The submission cites the situation in Victoria at the time:</para><quote><para>... school students can complete their on-the-job experience working late nights, public holidays and weekends.</para></quote><para>If one knows anything about the retail industry, one knows that late night trading, public holidays and weekends are the times of highest density of trade. One can understand a responsible union such as the SDA becoming very concerned to see that these young people, who are seeking to gain qualifications which will give them a long and lasting career, are being used at times when others might be gainfully employed in the industry and that these young people are really nothing more than substitute labour for bona fide employees who could be earning a living and making an income out of the retail industry. The submission goes on:</para><quote><para>Although this may be advantageous in limited circumstances, it gives little opportunity for structured on the job learning. </para></quote><para>That is particularly critical in the retail industry. The submission continues:</para><quote><para>On occasions VETIS becomes little more than a source of cheap labour for employers.</para></quote><para>The concern is there. It is a long and a lasting concern. It is not something that has just cropped up in the last five or 10 years. The submission goes on:</para><quote><para>If the student is not being paid for their work or being paid only a nominal amount such as in Victoria where work placement is paid at $5 per day, the attraction of cheap labour is even greater. In particular it is an encouragement to unscrupulous employers to be able to only provide work placements at times when they are required to pay normal employees penalty rates.</para></quote><para>This is a real concern. It is not a manufactured concern. It is a concern that I have had a personal association with. We, as an organisationâand I say we because I am still the president of the Queensland branch of the SDAâhave made representations to employers to desist from these practices. It is proper in this debate to draw attention to this issue. Whilst one is not trying to label every employer as fitting into this particular category, one must necessarily draw attention to those who seek to exploit the funds that are rightly supplied to deliver proper training to 15- to 19-year-olds. The submission goes on:</para><quote><para>It should be a clearly spelt out responsibility of the school to organise proper work placement for students. Schools, teachers and students and employers need to clearly understand and implement the purpose of work placement. </para><para>The principle of normal work being counted for VETIS purposes should be supported but where this does occur then the student should be paid the award rate for the job.</para></quote><para>In other words, there should be no avenue of exploitation. One is not opposed to the systemâthere are great merits in the system, as I have saidâbut one seeks to stamp out the exploiters. The submission goes on:</para><quote><para>It is essential that school to work participants receive genuine training with an appropriate range of tasks and not spend most of their work time performing routine work such as working on a register during peak trading times.</para></quote><para>In other words, it is about providing these people with real skills. There is a need for real skills and a skilled work force. Having a productive work force works for both the employer and the employee. It enables the employer to make a reasonable profit, pay a fair and just wage, and give reasonable conditions to the employees. As I said, this matter is a particular concern and attention needs to be drawn to it. The only other statement along the same lines in the submission which I would refer to is this:</para><quote><para>Schools often struggle to convince employers to provide structured work place training opportunities for students. Often, where such opportunities are provided, adequate supervision, mentoring and appropriate structured on-job training, especially across all the competencies in the Training Package qualification, is not provided. </para></quote><para>That is a real concern as well. There is a need to ensure that there is adequate supervision, proper mentoring and appropriately structured on-the-job training across all competencies; if there is not, then the scheme is a fraud. Again, I am not suggesting that that is the case in all instances. I am suggesting that, unless those things are there, visible and transparent, the system fails the very people it is designed to help. If they are not there, then the VETIS scheme is nothing more than a source of cheap labour. The recurrent theme is there. This is not something that is said lightly. It is something that is said because of vast experience with this type of program over a long period of time. The submission goes on:</para><quote><para>In some cases this is due to inadequate commitment by employers but in others it is due to employers not understanding their obligations, employers not being adequately briefed by schools and not being given appropriate support mechanisms by schools.</para></quote><para>This is not simply an opportunity to kick employers to death. That is not the aim of my participation in this debate today. The aim of my participation is to clearly stake out an area that has been of grave concern in the retail industry over a long period of time. Problems have been encountered not just in the state of Queensland, where I come from, but in states and territories throughout Australia.</para><para>In the second reading amendment that my colleague Senator Carr has put before the chamber today he asks the Senate to condemn the government for: </para><para>(a)	failing to develop comprehensive transition strategies to assist young people, thereby abandoning at least 205,300 15 to 19 years olds, placing them at risk of not making a successful transition from school and work ...</para><para>That is so important, because not everyone is an academic. Not everyone is going to end up at the University of Queensland or the James Cook University in my state. I have a young family: I have a 17-year-old, a 19-year-old and a 21-year-old. The 17-year-old is about to leave school. I believe the 17-year-old will, at the end of the day, end up at university, but not every child in her class is destined to do that. Many of the children do not want to go to university, do not have the academic skills or, in some instances, cannot afford it. The importance of the VET program to those people cannot be underestimated in any way. I have spoken with my daughter, Louise, about this from time to time, and she has told me of the experiences that many of the young people that she mixes with have in these programs. Many of them have good experiences but those good experiences are because of good employers. One should not underestimate that there are bad experiences because employers misuse a right that is given to them to assist them in helping young people and to assist them in running their business. I commend Senator Carr's second reading amendment to the Senate.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>5636</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too rise to support the second reading amendment to the <inline ref="R1569">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> and relate my comments to the impacts of the lack of funding for vocational education and training and the lack of support for young people in rural and regional areas. We know that it is in the regions where persistent unemployment is high and it is incumbent on us to do everything we can do to assist the regions, particularly in view of the effect on young people.</para></talk.start><para>I want to address my concerns tonight in relation to two particular issues: vocational education and training in schools, and the role of TAFE in regional and remote areas. These are the two important providers of vocational education and training in the regions, where private providers tend not to be so visible, simply because of lack of numbers and lack of profitability. It is up to the public sector to provide those critical services for our young people.</para><para>In terms of vocational education and training in schools, we need to be aware of the importance of ensuring that the curriculum attracts more young people. This relates quite specifically to young boys in regional areasâgetting them to participate further in their education, which is a relevant and contemporary issue. Importantly, through VET courses, they can develop important education, training and employment skills. They are able to find some kind of a balance between the academic programs that are a part of the new Higher School Certificate curriculum, particularly in New South Wales, and a non-academic strand where vocational education and training fits.</para><para>There have been some significant submissions to the Standing Committee on Education and Training inquiry into vocational education in schools, which is currently under way. Several of those have been commented on this afternoon. I would like to draw attention to particular submissions from New South Wales that have special relevance to the issue we are debating here. The submissions are quite extraordinary in terms of the simple message that has been included in all of themâthat is, the critical issue is about the lack of funding to resource the rapid growth of vocational education and training and, significantly, the financial penalties in the TAFE funding formula for additional delivery hours within the budget. These are significant issues that need to be addressed.</para><para>I draw the Senate's attention to one important submission that came from the Vincentia High School on the South Coast of New South Wales, which is not too far from me. Mark Dodd, the vocational education coordinator at the Vincentia High School, outlined the importance of the VET program for a community such as Vincentia, which reflects very much an area of high unemployment; there are very few employment opportunities for young people in the region. I will quote from his conclusions in the submission. He acknowledges the importance of vocational education in schools and states: </para><quote><para>VET in schools provides training opportunities for students in rural and remote communities that are vital to accessing career opportunities and transition to work in areas of high unemployment.</para></quote><para>Vincentia is located in one of the highest youth unemployment areas of the state. He also concludes:</para><quote><para>VET in schools complements existing training opportunities, and the seamless transition for students should be seen as a greater positive for the national training agenda.</para></quote><para>We know that the national training agenda, which now incorporates a new apprenticeship and traineeship scheme, is struggling to find both structured training places and flow-on employment placements that are needed in the regions. A whole range of economic issues are part of the program that needs to be delivered there.</para><para>His third conclusion, about VET in schools increasing student retention by providing an appropriate curriculum, is a very important message when we think of the whole-of-community and whole-of-education approach that ANTA and all parties, both Labor and the Liberal government, are trying to promote in terms of lifelong learning and the importance of that for Australia's knowledge economy in the future. Student retention is an important priority and one that we need to be promoting. The way that we can promote that through vocational education and training is by supporting young people and by supporting and resourcing vocational education and training programs effectively. He concludes also that VET in schools has a funding imperative, from both state and federal governments, that must be recognised. I can say that, certainly, the New South Wales government has contributed significant funding improvements to vocational education and training programs. It has been disappointing to see in this legislation that that has not been reflected satisfactorily in the federal government's allocation, simply because of the rapid growth of vocational education and training programs and the take-up rates, which have been quite extraordinary and so successful.</para><para>The other issue is the integration of other government initiatives and the impacts that they are having on vocational education and training programs in schools. I am particularly thinking of students with special needs and of Indigenous students who are able to use vocational education and training opportunities and programs to complete appropriate HSC qualifications. That is an important issue, and we have to be supportive of those specific and targeted programs that provide a response to our access and equity responsibilities for those students.</para><para>If I can move on now to the issue of TAFE and the role of TAFE in the regions, which is such a significant issue for us, both in terms of the regional economy and where, particularly, regions are experiencing decline or economic stress due to the drought. We have some specific issues that need to be placed on the record. TAFE institutes in the regions play a critical role in the educational and economic infrastructure of regional Australia, and that is acknowledged everywhere. I do not think I have been anywhere in a country community in New South Wales where someone has not participated in a TAFE program of some kind. We need to acknowledge that there are difficulties and extra costs involved in delivering regional and remote courses, and that the institutes face significant burdens that are not sufficiently recognised in the current funding provisions. That message is very clear. It has significant impacts on the kinds of courses and programs that can be offered, particularly in vocational education and training or the preparatory courses that lead into vocational qualifications. It is essential that we have better funding provision and significant resourcing. We know now that institutes are being forced to reduce the hours of off-the-job training and to withdraw from delivering some of their programs simply because of thin markets and the distances involved in trying to actually get their students to participate in programs.</para><para>This is such an important issue because people living in rural and remote areas of Australia generally have lower levels of skilling and recognised qualifications. One of the outcomes of the New South Wales government's initiative relating to drought relates to the retention of rural skills bases in rural communities. One of the important initiatives is to fund the training and upgrading of qualifications as part of retaining skills in those regional communities at a time of drought when these people are not able to be employed. It is important to be able to maintain that kind of presence, and it is the role of TAFE to run most of those kinds of programs. That is a critical issue for maintaining the economic infrastructure of communities, and it seems not to be recognised in any of this legislation. </para><para>Another important issue that we need to consider is that the TAFE system has over 1,100 campuses and covers geographically diverse cities and towns throughout Australia. The university system, by contrast, has a much smaller network of about 100 campuses, and these are mostly in the larger population centres. So there is a real imperative that we support public vocational education through the TAFE system: they are so often the only provider of post compulsory and vocational education and training in the regions, and their presence means young people can stay in the local community for their pre-employment education and training. We know, again, that it is an important issue contributing to the social capital and the social infrastructure of our regional communities to keep our young people there, to keep them educated and employed, and hopefully to have them take up some capacity-building roles within their communities as they grow older.</para><para>We need to recognise that the TAFE institutes make a very significant contribution to regional economies. They are often one of the major businesses and employers in their towns and cities, and they generate significant income for the area. They also work closely with the industries in their region to identify upskilling needs, and they develop the skilled work force that is essential for attracting industry to the regions and enabling regional enterprises to operate successfully. Earlier today we were hearing about an initiative that Senator Abetz addressed, about small business development and its application in the regions. If we do not have TAFE as a presence in regional communities like that, we do not have the capacity to deliver programs under a whole other raft of legislation and government departments. So there is the need for a whole-of-government, whole-of-community, lifelong learning approach, and for an integration of the kinds of programs that we offer in regional communities, to sustain those communities and make them resilient in times of economic stress.</para><para>A critical issue for us is that TAFE institutes are being expected to meet wider community expectations. Regional TAFE institutes provide a significant source of leadership in their communities. That is a very important community development role, particularly in rural, remote and Aboriginal communities. TAFE is the centre of learning; very often it is the first second-chance opportunity that people have for educational access and it is where people are drawn back into a learning environment and have a supportive learning environment to continue their education. This is a significant issue for us. We also have an expectation in regional communities that TAFE institutes will provide for disadvantaged groups. This is not the case for private providers who are providing contracted training, and it highlights the role of TAFE as the public provider and the importance of maintaining their role and presence in communities. They offer services such as library services, counselling services, community services, distance learning opportunities and a range of programs of study in areas, including those of relatively low demand which for private training providers tend not to be profitable.</para><para>There are significant challenges and difficulties in servicing regional and isolated vocational education markets that need to be recognised in the legislation. We know what these are. We have heard them in many, many submissions to different parliamentary committees and inquiries about education and training. They are things like the fact that small numbers of students mean that delivery costs and overheads are proportionately higher in regional areas than in urban areas; it can be significantly difficult to attract appropriately qualified teaching staff; the distance from major centres can add considerably to the costs of materials, equipment, staff and other essential services required for the delivery of programs; there are high costs involved in serving geographically distant campuses and in travelling long distances to undertake workplace assessment; nearly 10 per cent of TAFE students nationwide live more than 100 kilometres from their TAFE college; many students need better access to information and communication technology infrastructure, and TAFE at the moment is very often the only provider of some of those broadband communication technologies in rural communities; in many cases there is no explicit funding for community service obligations or for offering low-demand programs which nevertheless provide important skills for local industry, and it is often the responsibility of TAFE as part of community development and planning to look for regional skills needs to initiate employment and vocational training to meet planned growth of regions. </para><para>There are two very important examples of TAFE meeting regional skills needs. The first is the Illawarra Institute of TAFE, which encompasses the South Coast of New South Wales, which has been involved in a range of information and communications technology training to meet the growing need of the region in terms of employment opportunities and investment. It is quite innovative. On the South Coast things like virtual campuses have been established and programs have been developed to link vocational education in schools and TAFE and industry in quite innovative ways.</para><para>A second example which is also a very useful example for us in terms of looking at recognised skill shortages is the work that the Central Queensland Institute of TAFE have been involved in. They have been looking at the shortages in light metals and processing industries in the central Queensland region. They have also been looking at how they can initiate a range of training programs to provide the pre-employment skills training that will ensure that the major infrastructure development that is going on in the central Queensland region of the country will not have significant skill shortages. In the central Queensland region the programs that the TAFE institute have been specifically involved in have been projects of national significance, including the aluminium and magnesium smelters proposed for the area. They have identified through a regional planning approach that there are going to be significant skill shortages in the construction and light metals processing industries. TAFE are taking the lead in that region to ensure that industry is able to be accommodated and is able to respond in terms of employment and skills needs in the future for the region. The Central Queensland Institute of TAFE recently won ANTA's training provider of the year award for the second time running. They are obviously responsive and critically tuned in to the industrial and economic needs of that region.</para><para>I wish to place on record the impressive number of submissions to the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Education and Training inquiry into vocational education in schools. I spent quite a bit of time reading those submissions. I congratulate those people who are involved in vocational education and training in schools and TAFE on their incredible enthusiasm. I recognise that the importance of supporting this amendment bill relates to the fact that vocational education and training is highly significant in regional Australia. We need to do much more than provide rhetoric. We need to provide real resources to support vocational education and training in our schools. I congratulate all of those involved in programs in schools and in TAFE on their efforts.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>5639</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank honourable senators for their contributions. The <inline ref="R1569">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline> appropriates $1,094,020 million for vocational education and training in 2003. The total figure includes an amount of $12.381 million, provided under the Australians Working Together initiative of the government, and a first instalment of $4.545 million to deliver new training opportunities for people with a disability under the Recognising and Improving the Capacity of People with a Disability initiative. </para></talk.start><para>The bill will also increase the amount previously appropriated for 2002 by $24.348 million in line with normal price adjustments. The $230 million in Commonwealth growth funding takes to the highest level ever the Commonwealth funding to the states for vocational education and training. The National Centre for Vocational Education Research indicates that there are 362,140 new apprentices in training as at 30 June 2002, a 15 per cent increase since the corresponding period last year and a 250 per cent increase since 1995. In 2001, a report by the national centre noted that the Australian system of New Apprenticeships is among the best in the worldâfourth in OECD figuresâ in terms of proportional coverage of the work force and that 45 per cent of all teenagers in full-time employment are in a new apprenticeship. New apprenticeships are now available in more than 500 occupations across a diverse range of industries. Growth in new apprenticeships has not been at the expense of traditional trades. An estimated 107,360 new apprentices completed their training in the year to 30 June 2002, an increase of 27 per cent over the corresponding period. I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Original question, as amended, agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a second time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Chapman, Grant (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Chapman)</inline>âI remind honourable senators that, under a sessional order agreed to on 20 June 2002, I shall call the minister to move the third reading, unless any senator requires that the bill be considered in the committee of the whole.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Third Reading</title><page.no>5640</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>5640</page.no><name role="metadata">Alston, Sen Richard</name><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name><name.id>LD4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a third time.</para></motion><para>In so moving the third reading to the <inline ref="R1569">Vocational Education and Training Funding Amendment Bill 2002</inline>, I take the opportunity to comment on the second reading amendment, which I think was only very recently circulated and had not been properly brought to my attention.

The chamber will also note that Australian farmers take great effort in preserving water quality and in finding ways to be more efficient with this precious and scarce resource. That is particularly so in the case of Queensland sugar farmers who recognise the impact past practices have had on the Great Barrier Reef and who, through the industry Compass program, continue to work to minimise the impact of sugar farming on the surrounding environment. </para><para>Nearly six weeks ago, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Forestry, Mr Truss, crept out under cover of twilight and gave a 5.15 p.m. doorstop interview to announce the government's long awaited sugar package and associated tax. Since that announcement on 10 SeptemberâI emphasise 10 Septemberâwe have seen only slivers of the detail dribble out from the government via a series of media announcements and hollow promises made in the other place. On 25 September, Mr Truss stood up in the other place and promised that sugar farming families would receive emergency income support from 1 October. His media release of the same day talked about interest rate subsidies, which would be available for `new loans obtained from financial institutions for replanting purposes'. Unfortunately for struggling sugar farming families in need of urgent income support, Mr Truss forgot to advise his colleague the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone, that Centrelink was required to play a role in delivering payments.</para><para>On 9 October, Labor revealed that no money had reached needy cane farming families because no application form existed and because Centrelink staff had not been briefed. On 10 October, after being shamed into action by Labor, Mr Truss issued a media release advising that registration forms would be available on that day and that payments would commence on 21 October. Despite the bold promises of Mr Truss, his ability to bungle knows no bounds. I understand that the funds that were promised to be delivered on 21 October are still not flowing to farmers in need and are not expected until next week. It is now 22 October.</para><para>The Howard government calls its current package the `sugar industry reform assistance package', and indeed there has been much strong rhetoric from the Prime Minister and Senator Minchin blaming the sugar industry for not reforming sufficiently when the Howard government's last package was delivered in 2000. But it is very tough for any industry to reform in the face of drought, low world prices, corrupted markets and crop disease. When one considers what the sugar industry has endured for the past four years, it is amazing there is any industry at all, let alone that it has been able to reform in this period to the extent that it has.</para><para>Generally, a key tenet of any reform package is the objective to help farmers increase profitability. The window of opportunity to maximise returns from this year's crop is rapidly closing. To do so, many farmers require access to capital made affordable by those very interest rate subsidies that Mr Truss promised. But yesterday Senator Ian Macdonald advised the Senate:</para><quote><para>The final details of the Commonwealth's package on interest rate subsidies have not yet been determined ...</para></quote><para>How much longer must growers wait for the assistance promised by Mr Truss? Clearly, Senator Ian Macdonald cannot answer this, not through any fault of his but because the responsible minister, Mr Truss, has not done the work needed to deliver the package as promised. That minister has left families without an income for their needs today and has undermined their ability to earn a living for the next year. Mr Truss must urgently explain to struggling sugar families why they have so little money for food and no money to maintain their crop, and when the full details of this package will be available for all of us to see. On this important matter, I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission</title><page.no>5641</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>5641</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>The report by the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission on visits to immigration detention facilities by the Human Rights Commissioner is a worthwhile document. It is an issue that has had a lot of focus, and it has been one of the issues that many people and groups in Australia have expressed concerns about. I think it is particularly appropriate that a comprehensive investigation into immigration detention facilities by an independent person such as the Human Rights Commissioner is noted and the content treated seriously. It is outside the realm of political parties. It is an independent commissioner who is tasked by this parliament and by this government to ensure that basic human rights standards are upheld by our government agencies for all people in Australia. </para><para>It is a fairly comprehensive report. It details aspects of a range of facilities from Woomera to Maribyrnong, Curtin, Port Hedland, Perth, Villawood, Christmas Island and Cocos (Keeling) Islands. It is wide ranging and covers a comprehensive range of visits over the course of 2001. Some of the things I would particularly like to draw attention to are the conclusions and recommendations. Specifically, the Human Rights Commissioner of Australia recommends:</para><quote><para>The Migration Act 1958 should be amended to impose specific time limits on detention, with provision for review of continuing detention, in accordance with international law standards.</para></quote><para>There are two key aspects to that. Firstly, it acknowledges that our current system is not in accordance with human rights standardsâ something that the Democrats and others have been stating for a long timeâand, secondly, it indicates quite specifically that there should be time limits on detention, which, I should remind the parliament, is in accord with the findings and recommendations of the parliament's own all party Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade, which reported on this matter prior to the last election. So, in that sense, we have parliamentarians from across the political spectrumâLiberal Party, Labor Party, the Democrats and Senator Harradineâwho recommended time limits in that committee report, that recommendation being backed up by the Human Rights Commissioner. Surely that should be sufficient for this government to recognise that it needs to act in relation to that.</para><para>The conclusions also note concerns about adequate access to information so that detainees can be informed properly and effectively about their legal status and rights. There is no doubt that some of the disturbances in our detention centres, not least some of the major ones at Woomera, have been in part because people who are detained there do not have adequate information about their situation. They are in total limbo in the middle of nowhere and do not know what their future holds. Those things need to be improved.</para><para>Minimum standards of conditions and treatment are noted specifically, as is the adequacy of the monitoring of minimum standards. There is a specific recommendation about children in detention, and among the range of concerns from the public this has to be one of the biggest. As the report says, `Children should only be detained for the shortest period of time for initial security, health and identity purposes.' The department has provided responses to that and, as usual, they are extremely disappointing. This report should be noted and should be emphasised. It should add to a recognition by the government that the current system is not adequate and is not working; it is incredibly expensive and damages human beings for no great purpose.

My first contact with the National Library was in the 1970s, when I was doing my PhD. I once spent a day down there chasing 100 items that I wanted to have a look at. I had the list of items and I went in and looked up the card index, as you had to do in those days. On the cards were 30 of the items that I had listed. I went into the stacks to find these items, and of the 11 that I found only three were of any use. That was a full day's work to get there, to go through that time-consuming manual process and to locate the information, only to find that little bit. What I can do now on the laptop is access all that very quickly, read through the abstracts and probably get done in an hour what would have been a day's work. That is how this technology is delivering a revolution to our information economy and why we need to develop strategies to move this out to the people. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline> I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted; debate adjourned.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration</title><page.no>5643</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were considered:</para><para>Film Finance Corporation Australia LimitedâReport for 2001-02.

October, of course, is Breast Cancer Awareness Month. Breast cancer is still the most common cancer which affects Australian women and still the most frequent cause of death from cancer for women. Last year, in 2001, 2,511 Australian women died of breast cancer. This was a slight decline from the 1998 figure of 2,542 deaths and is the first indication that mortality rates are decreasing. However, more women are being diagnosed with breast cancer. The lifetime risk of developing cancer before the age of 75 has increased since the year 2000. In 2000, it was one in 12; in 2002, it is one in 11.</para></talk.start><para>We do not yet know how to prevent breast cancer. Its cause is still unknown. This is why support for the increasing numbers of those affected and the coordination of research are so important. This is also why our focus to date has been on screening to enable early detection and early intervention. The most effective means of detecting cancer at an early stage is still by mammography screening every two years. There is evidence that, for women in the 50 to 69 years age group, this screening substantially reduces the lifetime risk of dying from breast cancer. If the breast cancer is detected early, while still localised in the breast, the chance of five-year-plus survival is about 90 per cent. The survival rate drops if the tumour has spread to other parts of the body. </para><para>Labor is proud that, when we were in government, we initiated in 1990 the national early intervention program of breast cancer screening. This program can claim to have been in part responsible for the decrease in breast cancer deaths. I am pleased to be able to report some recent progress in the area of breast cancer services. A new emphasis on a multidisciplinary team approach to the management of breast cancer has begun with demonstration programs aimed at ensuring that women with breast cancer have access to the full range of treatment options, no matter where they live. The project aims to reduce the fragmented nature of health care delivery to women with breast cancer by linking a range of expertsâmedical oncologist, surgeon, radiation oncologist, pathologist, radiologist, genetic counsellor and general practitioner in multidisciplinary care. After many months of campaigning by the Breast Cancer Network Australia, Herceptin is now available for women with advanced breast cancer. Herceptin actively targets the breast cancer cells rather than all cells in the body. But very much more research is needed.</para><para>In February this year, a national summit for women with breast cancer identified two major issues facing women with breast cancer: first, access to breast prostheses and, second, travel and accommodation assistance. Members of the Parliamentary Breast Cancer Support Group have spoken of the distress caused to women who have had a breast removed, yet cannot claim the cost of a prosthesis on Medicare. I refer senators, for example, to the motion tabled on 27 June by my colleague Senator Crossin, calling for the government to provide mammary prostheses through the Medicare rebate schedule. This motion directs the attention of the Senate to a recommendation of the House of Representatives Standing Committee on Community Affairs in 1995 that the Medicare rebate schedule should be amended to include the provision of mammary prostheses. I also refer senators to a speech on 26 August this year by the member for Calwell, Ms Vamvakinou, also calling on the government to provide mammary prostheses through the Medicare rebate schedule and pointing out that the cost to the government may be as low as about $1.7 million annually.</para><para>Lymphoedema is one major concern of women with breast cancer, and it is only in recent years that the condition has attracted recognitionâan acknowledgment of the need for research. Overseas studies suggest that 20 to 30 per cent of women who have surgery and radiotherapy in the armpit as part of their treatment for breast cancer develop lymphoedema. This is a painful and debilitating condition. We badly need data on its extent and causes and on effective treatment. Research has begun, following the Adelaide Lymphoedema Summit, and a clinical trial on lymphoedema by the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons has also begun. In the ACT a local breast cancer support group, Bosom Buddies, has donated a scanning laser machine to the lymphoedema clinic at Calvary Hospital. This clinic is to be opened officially in November. Continuation of funding for lymphoedema research should be a priority.</para><para>We still have a long way to go to achieve a coordinated and patient-focused approach to treatment. We need coordination of research into the causes and prevention of breast cancer. We need to be able to take full advantage of the rapid expansion of cancer knowledge generally and use this to benefit cancer patients. Many organisations in Australia do valuable work in the area of breast cancer research, treatment and services to patients. The Breast Cancer Network Australia seeks to provide a consumer perspective on the direction of breast cancer research, the policies developed and the services provided for those affected, by promoting the priorities and needs of women and their families. It works to improve the treatment and care of those diagnosed with breast cancer. Currently it links 94 member groups, as well as more than 7,000 individuals, in all states and territories. Its `Seat at the Table' project recruits, trains and supports women to be consumer representatives, enabling the needs of women with breast cancer to be promoted. Its free national newsletter, the <inline font-style="italic">Beacon</inline>, offers information on research, available resources and services, as well as individual stories. From May 2001 the government allowed tax deductibility for gifts of $2 or more to the network. </para><para>The National Breast Cancer Centre web site lists over 20 research bodies and institutions involved in breast cancer research, including the Breast Cancer Institute of Australia and the Australia-New Zealand Breast Cancer Trials Group. Clearly coordination and monitoring of ongoing research and collaboration between bodies and institutions is vital.</para><para>Many wonderful and hardworking women have contributed much to the growing awareness of breast cancer and the need for research and improved services. In Canberra, Anna Wellings-Booth has coordinated the Dragons Abreast dragon regatta and the mini Fields of Women. I also congratulate Professor Linda Reaby, Associate Professor in the School of Nursing at the University of Canberra, who has been nominated for the Australian of the Year award. Professor Reaby is a breast cancer survivor, having been diagnosed in 1990. She has worked to raise community awareness and support by lobbying on behalf of Australian Breast Cancer Day. She has served as patron of Caring for You, a national organisation which supports women with breast cancer and those who have survived breast cancer. Professor Reaby also serves on the advisory committee of the Australia-New Zealand Breast Cancer Intervention Study.</para><para>I wish to pay tribute also to Helen Leonard, whose work for breast cancer awareness and research, among her many other roles, will long be remembered. Helen died a year ago, on 12 October. My colleague Senator Crossin spoke earlier this year of Helen's many roles and formidable achievements, and it is fitting that we remember her also in Breast Cancer Awareness Month.</para><para>On Sunday, in Canberra, the first dragon boat regatta of the season was hosted by Dragons Abreast, in support of the Breast Cancer Network. The Field of Women will be held in Sydney this year, on Sunday 27 October. This is presented every year at this time and is a moving and powerful display of pink and white silhouettes of women to highlight the impact of breast cancer in our community. A mini Field of Women outside the ACT Legislative Assembly last Tuesday, 15 October, also supported breast cancer awareness.</para><para>We need to support and maintain all of these efforts to ensure advances in community awareness, in research and in the treatment of breast cancer. I urge all of my Senate colleagues to take an interest and encourage women with breast cancer in the various support groups in their advocacy of increasing the amount of research into this problem that afflicts so many women.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Grocery Industry: Australian Competition and Consumer Commission Report</title><page.no>5647</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>5647</page.no><name role="metadata">Murray, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator MURRAY</name><name.id>3M6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak on the September report of the ACCC to the Senate on prices paid to suppliers by retailers in the Australian grocery industry. The report was a response to an order of the Senate dated 8 February 2001, initiated by me. At the heart of this report is the question of fair competition. It is not a question of whether the supermarket sector will continue to be dominated by Coles and Woolworths, because plainly that is likely to continue to be the case for the foreseeable future; it is a question of whether there will be sufficient competition allowed to those two, whether there will be sufficient diversity of choice allowed to counter the dangerous oligopolisation of the sector and whether there will be sufficient critical mass to nurture the independent sector so essential to our social and economic fabric. The Baird committee report two years ago sounded strong alarms. This ACCC report adds to the concerns.</para></talk.start><para>In the past decade consolidation within the grocery retailing and wholesaling sector has been rapid. In 1991 there were 11 major players. There are now four, including Woolworths and Coles, which jointly hold almost 80 per cent of the national market for branded packaged grocery products. Australia now has the most highly concentrated grocery industry in the developed world. In passing, I might say that I fear it will get worse if Graeme Samuels, the putative replacement for Allan Fels, turns out to be Australia's own version of Harvey Pitt. </para><para>Compare the almost 80 per cent of national market share held by Woolworths and Coles with the 34 per cent held by the top five supermarket companies in the United States, the 52 per cent held by the top three in the United Kingdom, the 53 per cent held by the top three chains in Germany or the only seven per cent held by the top five supermarket companies in Japan. While the number of major players in the Australian grocery industry fell from 11 to four in the decade to December last year, the number of independent grocery retailers fell by about 50 per cent, according to the Australian Bureau of Statisticsâfrom 8,270 stores in 1992 to 4,197 in 1999. Do Australian governments really want the destruction of the grocery small business sector to continue?</para><para>Regrettably, the ACCC report is based on limited data, and that is not their fault. Fifty significant suppliers were approached; of the 35 responses, only 19 provided a sufficiently detailed and cooperative response. I cannot help but harbour deep suspicions as to improper motives for non-cooperation. Alternatively, were any suppliers put under duress not to cooperate? My advice to the ACCC would be: quite a number of suppliers evidently have something to hide or were forced to go to ground; go back and dig some more.</para><para>In essenceâand it is no surpriseâthe ACCC confirms that Woolworths and Coles get the best supplier price more often than their competitors do. Some people might presume that this is because of the economies of scale which accrue from the mere size of those supermarket chains, but that is not always so. Grocery suppliers prices are determined by efficiencies within their own operations, as well as by the size of the purchase order. Typically, a major supermarket chain buying product from a manufacturer for delivery to one or more of its distribution centres will order quantities similar to those ordered by the major wholesalers supplying the independent sector. They are very similar customers in size terms. Yet the chains are often given or extract a price advantage over their competitors, giving them an obvious competitive advantage over similar sized buyers.</para><para>Why do Woolworths and Coles get the best available price more frequently than the wholesalers? The report does not resolve this critical issue, and that is a failing that must be addressed. The report does point to the need to consider whether suppliers are ever victims of intimidatory behaviour by the chains, as is alleged. Chart 5.3.2 of the ACCC report indicates that in 1999-2000 the major supermarket chains enjoyed a price advantage expressed as a ratio of 10 to four; in 2000-01 it was a ratio of 12 to eight. The question must be asked: are the grocery suppliers at times vulnerable to an undue exercise of market power? Most significantly, the Australian Food and Grocery Council, which represents the major suppliers to the grocery industry, observed in its submission to the ACCC that:</para><quote><para>... there exists a disproportionate distribution of power in favour of the retailer/wholesaler over the supplier in the Australian grocery sector ...</para></quote><para>The independent sector begins each day at a competitive disadvantage versus Woolworths and Coles. Their disadvantage begins with the prices they can get from their suppliersâ the ACCC has demonstrated that fact. The ACCC report clearly indicates that suppliers have little power in their dealings with Woolworths and Coles. They could be open to commercial duress or pressure as a result of that market power. The suppliers' peak body, the Australian Food and Grocery Council, admits to their limited countervailing power against their major customers. There are dangers to competition in allowing unfair price discrimination, because the consequent destruction of competitors can lead to the destruction of competition. The ACCC must be aware that chains could use price favouritism to subsidise lower prices in those markets in which the chain faces competition from independents. </para><para>The National Association of Retail Grocers of Australia has argued in its submission to the Dawson review of the Trade Practices Act that the TPA should be amended to introduce a new prohibition against such anti-competitive price discrimination. That would go a long way to guaranteeing a competitive result. It would also give suppliers some comfort in their dealings with powerful chains. NARGA also argues as a corollary that another new prohibition be inserted into the Trade Practices Act to prevent entities with a substantial degree of market power from engaging in coercive or intimidating conduct or conduct inducing a supplier to unfairly discriminate against competitors of the powerful entity.</para><para>The Dawson committee needs to have regard to the Baird report and this ACCC report. The specific dangers of price discrimination in a highly concentrated market as outlined in the ACCC report include: the possibility of lower supplier prices to the major supermarket chains being subsidised by high supplier prices to the other buyers; the raising of barriers to new entrants to the industry; the prompting of independent grocery retailers to exit the industry, thereby pushing the independent sector below the critical mass required to sustain a viable competitive force; and reduced vigour in the competitive process and a greater likelihood of parallel conduct or tacit collusion involving those remaining in the industry.</para><para>Without the independent grocery retailers, Australian supermarket customers would face the very real danger of a duopoly or oligopoly engaged in market-sharing and profit-taking rather than competition. The ACCC has identified this as a real danger and I quote from its report:</para><quote><para>From the earlier discussion of market participants it is apparent that, generally, the grocery market is highly concentrated. It could become more so if price discrimination in supplying grocery products caused non-chain retailers to incur higher costs e.g. the lower price given to the major chains is `subsidised' by higher prices charged to other buyers ... If price discrimination resulted in a further increase in market share for one or both of the chains, this would confer even greater economies of scale and scope. It would make viable entry by independents even more difficult and unattractive. Should one (or both) chains raise prices, smaller retailers would then have every incentive to follow suit. Although all independent retailers will not exit, those remaining are therefore unlikely to be a real constraint on the chains ... A reduction in the number of retailers and in diversity might more easily enable parallel conduct or tacit collusion.</para></quote><para>That quote indicates the ACCC recognises that there is a problem. I suggest that it needs to do much more about the issue.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Telstra: Communications Infrastructure</title><page.no>5649</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>5649</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to talk about the degradation of the Telstra cable network. This, of course, takes place in the context of the proposed sale of the remainder of Telstra. The government would have us all believe that the Telstra network is in perfectly good working order. The people of Australia and potential investors are told that there are no real problems with the network, and Telstra is therefore touted as a good buy. Specifically, we are told that the main cable network is now up to scratch, especially in the Eastern States. The main cable network comprises the trunk cables between the major cities, cables between the exchanges and cables from the exchanges to the pillarsâthe cylindrical things that are in our streets. This is all in good working order, we are told.</para></talk.start><para>The cables are specially designed to keep out moisture. Under the outer skin, or sheath, there is a space that is maintained under high pressure. This high-pressure area is designed so that, if the outer protective coating is breached, the pressure will keep out the moisture until the cable is repaired. The recommended level for this pressure is 40 kPa. This, I am told, is the standard that Telstra acknowledges. To maintain this pressure, gas is continually pumped into the cables. This work is done by Telstra's CPASâcable pressure alarm systemâsection. In administering this system there are three alarm levels: if pressure falls below 40 kPa, if it falls below 20 kPa and if it falls below 10 kPa.</para><para>You would expect Telstra to ensure that CPAS is well funded. You would expect that if the pressure fell below these levels Telstra would do just about anything to get those parts of the main cable network fixed, and fixed immediately. Unfortunately, you would be wrong. Three years ago Telstra spent some $39 million on CPAS annually. CPAS work has now been moved to the Telstra subsidiary for construction and maintenance, Network Design and Construction, or NDC Ltd. What value do you think Telstra would put on that business? Once it was outsourced to its wholly owned subsidiary, Telstra reduced its spend on CPAS to $20 million annually. I am led by those within NDC Ltd to believe that this is now going to be reduced to $12 million annually. This will mean that NDC Ltd will have to further reduce costs. Honourable senators will not be surprised to hear that this will therefore mean further job losses. </para><para>Telstra and the government are telling all and sundry that the main cable network is up to scratch. Looking at the decrease in funding to CPAS over the last three years, you would think we could assume that the main cable network is in good shape. How could you explain a reduction from $39 million to $12 million in three years unless this was the case? Telstra and the government must be right, apparently, and not simply fattening up the bottom line to make it a good buy for the investors. Surely that is the case. Upon further investigation, it would seem that it is not. The pressure rates in the main cable network do not support that assumption. In fact, if you look at the figures for just one day, you will see some very scary numbers. In the New South Wales region, where there are 4,138 cables, 77 per cent of cables were operating at less than 40 kPa; 1,884 were operating at less than 20 kPa. The numbers from other regions are part of the same grim picture. In South Australia, 83 per cent of the cables were operating with a gas pressure of less than 40 kPa. In my home state of Western Australia, 76 per cent of the cables had a pressure of less than 40 kPa. The only shining light was Victoria, where only 42 per cent of the cables operated at less than 40 kPa.</para><para>What sort of shape is the main cable network really in if on a single day so much of the network was operating well below the standard that Telstra itself acknowledges? It seems the height of folly for anyone to be promoting the view that the network is in such good shape when clearly it is not. This same gilding of the lily in a normal share float would, I believe, be the subject of an investigation if it were included in a company's prospectus. But when the government and Telstra are running a line, what hope is there for the ordinary investor? What hope is there that this information will be made public?</para><para>The other issue that needs to be of concern to all of us is that the sale of Telstra is also about job shedding. The three-year reduction in funding for CPAS means that jobs are disappearing. Technical and maintenance positions are being shed so that the bottom line looks good. I am advised that NDC Ltd currently proposes to shed eight jobs in Perth and Adelaide, five in country New South Wales, 12 in Sydney, three in country Victoria, six in Melbourne, six in country Queensland and six in Brisbane. I am told that this is part of a plan that has already seen the loss of some 400 jobs, with rumours of even more to follow. That is what this all comes down to: cut the costs to improve the bottom line, get a big return for the government from the sale of Telstra and use that to fund the next round of election cycle giveaways; put jobs at risk, put the main cable network at risk so that the government can pork barrel its way back into office, and put at risk the ability of people from regional and remote Australia to be able to communicate with one another. NCD Ltd workers, Telstra shareholders and consumers and the Australian taxpayer deserve far better.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Insurance: Public and Professional Liability</title><page.no>5650</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>5650</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âFirstly, I would like to highlight a few recent events that have brought us to where we are today in relation to the national insurance crisis. Even putting aside the impact of September 11 on the global insurance industry, a number of local events highlighted by the media added panic, disruption and dismay to the general public's understanding of the current insurance crisis. On 15 March last year, HIH filed for voluntary liquidation. As it was the largest underwriter of public liability policies, this had a significant effect on the closure of community events. On 5 November last year, there was much media attention on the damages payout of $13 million to Calandra Simpson, who suffered tetraplegia as a result of a botched forceps birth. </para></talk.start><para>On 3 May this year, and leading up to this date, the provisional liquidation of United Medical Protection caused panic throughout the health industry and certainly disrupted the delivery of essential medical services. On 13 May this year, there was also widespread reportage of, and public outcry at, the outcome of a negligence claim against the Waverley Council that resulted in a damages payout of $4 million dollars. The attention devoted to this topic has since spiralled and has maintained prominence in the media and in people's minds as the insurance crisis has developed, not only because this issue now affects all of us in some way but also because the fundamental issues underlying this crisis generally remain unaddressed.</para><para>The New South Wales government's response to the issue was based on criticisms of the legal system and the blow-out in the cost of claims. However, sweeping statements of reform were delivered without any real statistical evidence in this area to back them up. Premier Carr on that occasion led the charge on a wave of reforms that were essentially designed to cure the insurance crisis and ensure the availability and affordability of public liability and professional indemnity insurance. It was always seen as a noble task, but what was the premise for making such sweeping tort law reforms? It seems to me that there should have been a commonsense approach which would begin with the question: what was the cause of the current crisis? Unfortunately for the people of my home state of New South Wales and for the rest of the country, it seems that commonsense was not the motivating factor behind these insurance solutions.</para><para>What do we really know about the blow-out in the costs of claims themselves? We know that there are a handful of cases that appear to be outrageous in terms of what we understand to be justice in particular circumstances. However, we also know that there are competing statistics regarding claims size and number. According to Insurance Statistics Australia, there has been no overall increaseâand perhaps some reductionâin claim numbers in more recent years. For instance, in 1996 there were approximately 10 claims per $100,000 premium. In 2000, there were approximately eight claims per $100,000 premium.</para><para>At the Ministerial Meeting on Public Liability Insurance held on 30 May, ministers agreed that the lack of comprehensive data on the costs of claims was a significant constraint in the appropriate pricing of premiums by the insurance industry for the not-for-profit sector, adventure tourism and sporting groups. The Ipp report on negligence that came out of that process also noted that there was a lack of empirical evidence in relation to claims costs. Despite the lack of data, all of the governments and states have been prepared to endorse tort law reformâin essence, limiting people's right to sue and the size of payoutsâas the solution to the public liability crisis, on the assumption that it is the primary cause of the problem.</para><para>I guess the thing that needs to be raised is that the absence of solid claims data means that not only is it impossible to be sure that tort law is the cause of the current crisis but also it will be difficult to assess the effectiveness of the reform process itself. Whilst there has been no time wasted in moving to limit individuals' rights, regardless of the lack of claims data, the community has not been guaranteed anything in return. There has not been any discussion on what measures should be put in place to encourage a safer community or how the future medical and financial needs of victims of serious injury would be addressed and how the party responsible for the injury will be deterred from future negligent acts or omissions.</para><para>Today's tabling of both the Senate Economics References Committee recommendations and the Australian Democrats' supplementary report on the national insurance crisis again highlights these issues as well as the pressing need for a greater role for the insurance industry in any solution to the current situation. The state and federal governments have not only failed to come up with a solution that addresses the crisis but also left out the role that the insurance industry needs to play. I think that the insurance industry have come out of this as privileged in being overlooked as having some responsibility for those things that have caused the current crisis. </para><para>From the creation of UMPâthe largest medical insurer in Australia, with coverage of about 60 per cent of medical practitioners nationally and 90 per cent in New South Wales aloneâuntil its collapse, it pursued an aggressive, irresponsible and unsustainable market growth strategy that undoubtedly contributed to the state it is in today. Whilst the provision of medical services is vital to the health of all members of the community, pressure from the AMA and the government's attempts to bolster UMPâan unregulated, unscrupulous insurerâhighlight the quick-fix solutions that have typified the current government. At the same time, other non-specialist medical professionals, such as practitioners in Aboriginal medical services, are experiencing increases in professional indemnity costs of around 150 per cent.</para><para>Another shameful example is the fact that there is no insurance policy on the table for independent midwives. Midwives in this country attend 98 per cent of all births, yet childbirth medical specialists, who attend 10 per cent of births, look to be in line for special status in the government's quick-fix solution. I believe that it is imperative that the focus here be on long-term, broad-ranging solutions rather than on supporting non-viable insurers for some groups and ignoring the plight of other equally viable and important professions. At the end of the day, this affects all of us.</para><para>If the government cannot provide guarantees for the whole of the community to overcome the current insurance woes, then the government must ensure that the insurance industry is also part of that solution. The government has to restore some balance to their solution so that the winners are not just the big end of town, such as UMP, the AMA and the insurance industry. The great danger that I believe we now face is that the tort law reforms that have been implemented will have a major impact on the ability of the injured to realise their long-term financial and medical needs.</para><para>The problem is that the move to solve the insurance crisis in this way shifts all responsibility away from the negligent and towards the public purse and the community. Without necessary protection and safety standards for the community, it seems that insurance pricing may very well be the least of our problems. We have to ensure that we have mechanisms in place that encourage people to minimise the risk of accidents and that those who are injured are properly cared for. Shifting the blame to the individual so that the insurance industry is better off in the short term does not address the real causes and problems that are currently facing the community.</para><para>Going down the narrow, short-sighted path of tort law reform without looking at necessary safeguards and industry involvement has the potential to create more problems than it fixes. It may make our current complaints about insurance premiums seem trivial at the least. Solid, wide-reaching reforms, such as those outlined in the Democrats' supplementary report and, of course, the report following on from the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry, need to be put in place to ensure a future safe environment, whether it be in the public, private or professional domain.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Science: Nuclear Waste Storage Facility</title><page.no>5652</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>5652</page.no><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name><name.id>00AOU</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise tonight to speak on the issue of this government's continued attempts to impose a nuclear dump in South Australia against the wishes of the South Australian people and against the express wishes of the South Australian parliament. We saw today in question time Minister Alston failing again to come clean from the government's perspective on the issue of the intermediate waste and the government's plans for an intermediate-level waste dump in South Australia. The government has failed to indicate clearly what its preferred sites are for an intermediate-level waste dump. It has attempted to keep that secret, meanwhile moving on the issue of what it calls a low-level and short-term intermediate waste repository. For those of you who do not know, the short-term intermediate waste that is proposed to be dumped in South Australia has a half-life of up to 30 years. It is not what most people would consider to be a short-term issue.  </para></talk.start><para>As bad as the issue of the repository is, and as bad as it is that this government is seeking to impose on South Australia a low-level and short-term intermediate-level waste repository, even worse is its clear but secret agenda to impose an intermediate waste dump on South Australia. Today we saw in the South Australian parliament Premier Rann making public leaked documents which show that this government plans to spend $300,000 of taxpayers' money to soften up the South Australian public on the issue of the nuclear dump. If it is as easy as Minister Alston appears to say it isâthat is, it is good public policy and logical to put it in South Australiaâwhy are you spending so much public money on softening up the community to try and convince them that this is not a bad idea? The reason is that 87 per cent of South Australians understand this issue and do not want the nation's nuclear waste in their backyard. </para><para>The intermediate-level waste dump is a matter that Senator Minchin, when he was the minister, was pretty quiet on for a fair bit of time. He was prevaricating on the issue of co-locationâthat is, whether he would seek to locate the store of intermediate-level waste with the low-level waste repository which is targeted for South Australiaâbecause he obviously thought politically it was too much of a pill for South Australians to swallow to have both the low-level waste, which everyone keeps talking about, and the intermediate waste, which is substantially reactor waste.</para><para>What this government did in relation to the Lucas Heights reactor was to ensure that the requirement that was in the Senate committee recommendations and the environmental assessment report produced by Environment Australiaâthe requirement that there be an adequate waste management plan prior to the construction of the facilityâwas ignored. The government have simply pushed that issueâof how they will manage the waste from the new reactor at Lucas Heightsâoff into the future. The reason is that they want to go as far down the track as they can, firstly on the construction of the new reactor and then on the introduction and the establishment of a nuclear waste repository for low-level and short-term intermediate-level waste in South Australia, so they can then be in this policy bind where they say: `We have to get rid of the reactor waste. It is silly having it in Sydney. Let's truck it across the country and put an intermediate-level waste storage in South Australia.'

Burial is the cheap and nasty option and there have been a number of reportsâ including a report of this chamber, entitled <inline font-style="italic">No time to wasteâ</inline>which have recommended above-ground storage of low-level waste. Burial costs less but it is pretty hard to undo. The government is nevertheless going down that path. </para><para>It really is the issue of the intermediate-level dump which is the most difficult for South Australians to swallow. As I say, this government is proposing to spend taxpayers' money on trying to soften up the community to accept a situation where we are going to accept nuclear waste from around Australia in South Australia. As Premier Rann has put it, there is no state that has actually been seeking that South Australia store its waste. The only government that is seeking to impose this upon South Australia is the Commonwealth government, and it is doing so against the express interests of the community and against the legislative intent of the South Australian parliament. It simply demonstrates the Commonwealth government's arrant disregard both for good policy in this situation and for the interests of the people of South Australia. It is time the government came clean and was up-front with the South Australian people about where it proposes to locate the storeâthat is, the nuclear waste facility for intermediate-level waste, substantially reactor wasteâbut of course it will not. Minister Alston refused to indicate that today, and that has consistently been your position, because you do not want to tell them what the truth is.  </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WP6</name.id><name role="metadata">Lightfoot, Sen Ross</name><name role="display">Senator Lightfoot</name></talker><para>âHow about you telling the truth?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOU</name.id><name role="metadata">Wong, Sen Penny</name><name role="display">Senator WONG</name></talker><para>âYou accuse us of running a scare campaign.

Before I do that, though, I would like to recognise the importance of the various programs of commemoration supported in a bipartisan way, whereby the parliament and the Australian people are encouraged to remember and learn about the deeds and exploits of previous generations who served on behalf of the Australian people. It is very important that as time passes we pause to think backâof the pain, the suffering and the deprivation of war, as well as of the courage and the commitment of the persons involved. Not only does this reflection help to bind the generations and continue that sense of national identity which comes from the sharing of wonder and gratitude for what was endured, but at this particular time it also reminds us of the real cost of war in human terms.</para></talk.start><para>War is truly an awful thing. Not only does it impoverish nations for generations, it destroys life and parts of civilisations for a very long time. As we reflect, therefore, we need to appreciate that cost and the justification that is necessary before we proceed to inflict that cost further. As we are collectively engaged in that debate right now with respect to Iraq, it is salutary to remember events of the past as a benchmark at least, against which we can measure that justification, and with full knowledge of the real cost.</para><para>If we look back to the years of 1941 and 1942 in particular, justification of our role in war was not an issue. There was no choice. The mad men of Germany, Italy and Japan were on the rampage and world domination was their single aim. We were at war all over the world. 1941 was a very dark year. Apart from early successes by the Australian 6th Division against the Italians in North Africa and some other gains in the Middle East by the 7th Division, the progress of the Germans into North Africa, Russia, Greece and Yugoslavia was seemingly inexorable. The 9th Division became besieged at Tobruk and Crete fell at the end of May, with many Australians taken prisoner. In November both HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Sydney </inline>and HMAS <inline font-style="italic">Parramatta </inline>were sunk, followed shortly thereafter by the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbour.</para><para>By the start of 1942 the war was suddenly very much closer, with Australia torn between its commitments in the Middle East and North Africa on the one hand and in our near north, where retreat before the Japanese was well under way, on the other. Singapore fell on 15 February and Darwin was bombed four days later. Surrender to the Japanese at Ambon, New Britain and Java added to our pain and loss. Yet, faced with this impending peril on our doorstep, we were still fighting the Germans and Italians in North Africa, with a now well documented debate on the effort of Prime Minister Curtin to bring those forces home. So the darkness continued to spread, with Papua New Guinea invaded by Japan, retreat along Kokoda and major naval losses at Guadalcanal. Yet there were soon to be some rays of light. We have just commemorated the about-turn on the Kokoda Trail, which saw the Japanese tide reversed for the first time, and we are about to do the same with the Battle of Milne Bay, on which I spoke in this chamber some weeks ago. And here I must express my gratitude for the opportunity to be able to accompany a party of veterans back to Milne Bay and Popondetta at the end of this month. </para><para>At the same time, our troops under British command in North Africa were about to have some success as, on 23 October, the Battle of El Alamein commenced under Montgomery. It is fair to say that without the 9th Division it might never have achieved its objective without extraordinary extra cost. Strategically, North Africa was vital. The German objective pressing east was clearly to seize Egypt and the Suez Canalâa major allied lifeline. Possession of the northern coast was either a defence of southern Europe for the Axis or a springboard for invasion by the Allies. Just as the success of the Australians along Kokoda was a critical turning point, so was El Alamein for it turned the German juggernaut into retreat for the first time. Again, it was the Australians in the form of the 9th Division who were so critical. The British 8th Army, of which the Australian 9th Division was but a small part, was faced with an enormous task. The front was very longâover 14 kilometresâbut the allied forces were clearly superior in strength, with 220,000 men, 1,100 tanks and 900 field guns. Against that, Rommel had 180,000 men, 600 tanks and 500 guns.</para><para>Much has been written on the conduct of this battle, with interesting comparisons between the strategies of Montgomery and Rommel, but the critical thing for Australia was that it was the 9th Division, which had the northern coastal sector, which gained the early initiative along the coast and bore the brunt of Rommel's assaults. In short, by doing so, it is said that Rommel's losses and diversion of forces from other sectors quickly allowed Montgomery and the rest of the allied force to break through to the south with relative ease in Operation Supercharge. The battle raged 60 years ago, from 23 October until 5 November when Rommel, in disobedience to Hitler, turned and fled.</para><para>Montgomery became a hero, but beneath him, as we know, there was a gallant band of Australians without whom his task would have been immeasurably more difficultâa fact which he, to his credit, was quick to acknowledge. But there was an awful cost and, returning to my opening thought on the need for justification of war, we need to remember that 660 Australians died at El Alamein, almost 2,000 were wounded and 130 were taken prisoner. While Australians comprised only 10 per cent of the total force, the casualty ratio was 22 per cent. That in itself is awesome testament to their effort. I relate that to the Senate this evening not only as a reminder of the nature of military commitment and the responsibility we bear but also in commemoration of those who served.</para><para>It would be remiss of me, too, to overlook in my tribute to these veterans the outstanding leadership provided by the then Lieutenant General Leslie Morshead. Clearly, from what has been written, he was an outstanding commander, possessing all the skills of leadership and determination which are more often judged to have been lacking in so many others. Much has been written on the relative competence of military leaders. As Australians, of course, we are quick to deride what has often been described as the ineptitude of the British officer class, particularly in World War I in France and at Gallipoli. To be fair, though, the same criticism has been levelled at some Australian officers. Sir Leslie Morshead, however, is written of in very high terms, and his politeness and deference to his British commanders is said to have covered an inner frustration which, fortunately, was something shared by Churchill, resulting in the appointment of Montgomery.</para><para>There is more to it than that, though, for it seems that his frustration also included the failure to gain sufficient support when he so needed it. The failure of the British armourâso necessary in the early days of El Alameinâto arrive as scheduled, exposing the 9th Division to the full front of Rommel's panzers, was a case in point. It is gratifying, though, that not only was Montgomery quick to give credit but so were Churchill and the British Crown, who recognised his effort immediately with the award of Knight Commander of the Bath. </para><para>As 23 October approaches, the 60th anniversary of the Battle of El Alamein, we should all stop to remember the significance of that time in our history and to remember those who were lost to their families and to the nation. We should also remember that, for those who were fortunate to return home immediately after the battle, the task became even tougher as they took on the Japanese in the jungles of Papua New Guinea, where they again fought for their country, this time in its direct defence. We should also send our best wishes to those veterans who have recently made the pilgrimage back to the battlefield of El Alamein. We wish them well.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 8.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>5656</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>5656</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><quote><para>Australia CouncilâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Electoral CommissionâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Film CommissionâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Film, Television and Radio SchoolâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Fisheries Management AuthorityâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Greenhouse OfficeâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Industrial Relations Commission and Australian Industrial Registryâ Reports for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Postal Corporation (Australia Post)âStatement of corporate intent 2002/2003-2004/2005.</para><para>Australian Radiation Protection and Nuclear Safety AgencyâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Safeguards and Non-Proliferation OfficeâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Sports CommissionâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Strategic Policy Institute LimitedâReport for the period 22 August 2001 to 30 June 2002.</para><para>Australian Trade Commission (AUSTRADE)âReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre (AUSTRAC)âReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Australian Wine and Brandy CorporationâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Bundanon TrustâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>CentrelinkâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>CrimTrac AgencyâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Dairy Adjustment AuthorityâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Dairy Research and Development Corporation and Dairy Research and Development Corporation Selection Committeeâ Reports for 2001-02.</para><para>Defence Housing AuthorityâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Department of the Prime Minister and CabinetâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Export Finance and Insurance Corporation (EFIC)âReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Film Australia LimitedâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Film Finance Corporation Australia LimitedâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Fisheries Research and Development CorporationâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Grains Research and Development CorporationâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation and Grape and Wine Research and Development Corporation Selection CommitteeâReports for 2001-02.</para><para>Human Rights and Equal Opportunity CommissionâReportâVisits to immigration detention facilities by the Human Rights Commissioner 2001, August 2002.</para><para>Indigenous Land Corporationâ</para><para>National Indigenous Land Strategyâ Changes to strategy, 18 September 2002.</para><para>Report for 2001-02.</para><para>International Air Services Commissionâ Report for 2001-02.</para><para>Land and Water Resources Research and Development Corporation and Land and Water Australia Selection Committeeâ Reports for 2001-02.</para><para>National Archives of Australia and National Archives of Australia Advisory CouncilâReports for 2001-02. </para><para>National Gallery of AustraliaâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>National Library of AustraliaâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>National Registration Authority for Agricultural and Veterinary ChemicalsâReport for 2001-02.</para><para>Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation and Rural Industries Research &amp; Development Corporation Selection CommitteeâReports for 2001-02.</para><para>Sugar Research and Development Corporation and Sugar Research and Development Corporation Selection Committeeâ Reports for 2001-02.</para></quote><para>The following documents were tabled by the Clerk:</para><quote><para>Australian Research Council ActâDetermination No. 14âDeterminations under section 51, dated 24 September 2002 and 2 October 2002 [5].</para><para>Commonwealth Authorities and Companies ActâNotice under paragraph 45(1)(c)âMembership of Aboriginal Hostels Limited.</para><para>Criminal Code ActâRegulationsâStatutory Rules 2002 Nos 248 and 249.</para></quote></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript></hansard>
