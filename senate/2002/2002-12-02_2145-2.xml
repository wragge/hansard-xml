The specific changes are, firstly, to insert before the word `embryo' the word `human' so that we are dealing with a human embryo and, secondly, to replace the word `purpose' with the phrase `sole purpose of harvesting the human embryonic stem cells consistent with the matters contained in paragraph 21(4)(b)'. Paragraph (b) of clause 21(4) goes to the issue of licensing. In relation to the licensing system, division 4, 21(4)(b) states:</para><quote><para>... the NHMRC Licensing Committee must have regard to the following:</para><para>(b)	the likelihood of significant advance in knowledge, or improvement in technologies for treatment, as a result of the use of excess ART embryos proposed in the application, which could not reasonably be achieved by other means ...</para></quote><para>The reason for my putting this amendment up in the first instance is that I believe the bill should reflect in its entirety the COAG agreement. I believe that the COAG agreement was specifically based on the issue of embryonic stem cells. If one changes clause 9 to read as I propose, it then relates to a specific use of embryonic stem cells as opposed to any other purpose that ART embryos may be considered for. That was never the purpose in the first instance of the COAG agreement. The COAG agreement was made in this area principally on the issue of surplus IVF embryos being made available for embryonic stem cell research and not for any other purpose. There was nothing in the debate that led to the COAG agreement or the debate that led to the bills that are now before this chamber, save for the Andrews report and the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee report, which mentioned the issue of excess ART embryos and their purposeâand their purpose being not other than for implantation but for research purposes. Those research purposes were for embryonic stem cells and not for a raft of other purposes which became obvious in the inquiry before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee.</para><para>I will refer specifically to evidence cited in Senator Harradine's report to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. In Senator Harradine's additional comments, he made reference to evidence given by Dr Morris of the NHMRC. Senator Harradine referred to the additional matters that now seem to be taken into account when one is considering the use of the excess ART embryos. These excess ART embryos, as I said in my speech in the second reading debate, were created in the first instance for the purpose of IVF. They were created for the purpose of the creation of life in a set of circumstances where a couple was unable to produce offspring. Whether one agrees with that or not, that was the stated purpose for which the IVF program was put in place. The IVF program was not put into place for other purposes, such as producing a by-product which can then be used in medical research. Whilst I am opposed to the bill, it looks as though, based on the numbers in this place, it is going to get up. In that case, one must look at using the excess ART embryos for the stated purpose, as I believe it was originally intendedâand that was as a source of embryonic stem cells. On page 192 of the report of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, Senator Harradine outlined, from the evidence given by Dr Morris, a range of other issues which were to be considered for the use of these embryos: </para><quote><para>The range of embryo research permitted by the Bill includes using human embryos to examine the effectiveness of new culture media used in assisted reproductive technology (ART) practice, to assist in understanding embryonic development and fertilisation, training clinicians in microsurgical ART techniques, transport, observation and storage of embryos, micromanipulation, lasering, cutting and dissecting, studies in genetic makeup and expression, quality assurance testing to ensure that pre-implantation diagnostic tests give accurate results, drug testing including toxicology studies on human embryos as well as the destructive extraction of embryonic stem cells.</para></quote><para>That far exceeds the original proposal, as one understood from the debate surrounding the COAG agreement. Whilst this debate gets to the use of those excess ART embryos, one does not want to see that it is just going to be open slather, allowing these embryos to be used in a whole range of research areas that were not necessarily even advocated, or actively advocated, when this debate was taking place. One only needs to turn to the COAG communique itself and one will find that reference is made strongly to the issue of stem cell researchâthe focus not being on anything else other than human embryonic stem cell research. If one looks at paragraphs 6 to 8 of the communique, in the appendix to the report, one finds this:</para><quote><para>6. The following principles should underpin nationally-consistent legislation:</para><para>6.1 legislation should ensure appropriate ethical oversight of research involving embryos based on nationally-consistent standards ...</para></quote><para>So we are looking to nationally consistent standards for the research on these embryos. The communique goes on to say:</para><quote><para>6.2 the nationally-consistent standards should be clear, detailed and describe the ethical issues to be taken into account, research which may be permitted and the conditions upon which it may be permitted ...</para></quote><para>Given the way the current clause 9(2)(a) is framed, there could be a wide range of purposes for which the excess ART embryos could be used. That is the last thing that one would want to countenance, as far as I am concerned. I believe that clearly the issue was included for there to be a consistent approach, an approach for research. Whilst I do not necessarily subscribe to the research myself, the research would take place on the excess ART embryos. We will come to the issue of the limited number of excess ART embryos later on in this debate. The communique says, at paragraph 8:</para><quote><para>Research with existing stem cell lines will be permitted ...</para></quote><para>It goes on to say, at paragraph 10:</para><quote><para>The ban on the development of embryos for purposes other than for assisted reproduction will be maintained and reviewed within three years taking into account the implications for therapeutic use of embryonic stem cells (as detailed in the Health Ministers' report, Chapter 4).</para></quote><para>I am seeking with my amendment simply to ensure that there is the proper focus of the COAG agreement. The minister may well tell me that all of these other things are going to be excluded. But, from what I have read and heard, I do not believe that that is the case. I believe that there is a real necessity to ensure that the sole purpose, as I state in my amendment, is for the harvesting of human embryonic stem cells consistent with matters contained in paragraph 21(4)(b), where there is a real chance and a significant likelihood that there will be an advance made as a result of the research. In other words, I am not about stopping the research; I want to see a proper definition put in place which will ensure the respect and the dignity that is appropriate to the excess ART embryos. I commend the amendment to the Senate. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>6813</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have a question for Senator Hogg. I am sorry if you answered the question in your explanation of the amendment. On the second part of your amendment, where you say `and other than a purpose relating to ART treatment of the woman concerned', I wanted to ask whether you thought that your amendment, as is, facilitated the possibility of using embryonic stem cells for improving ART technology in itself other than for a purpose specifically related to the woman concerned, as is written in your amendment?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>6813</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI did not give that a great deal of thought when I put the amendment together. As you can see, in framing the amendment all I did was insert the word `human' in front of `embryo'; and then, in the existing proposal in the bill, instead of the word `purpose', the words that I included were the words from `sole' down to `21(4)(b) and'. So I tried not to disturb the intent that was there previously, but I tried to focus more on the issue that the excess ART embryos were for the purpose of embryonic stem cell research as opposed to necessarily a wider, more far-ranging group of other research activities that might take placeâbecause I think that was the basic focus of this bill and the intent of that particular part of the bill.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>6813</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise on behalf of all the Democrats to say that we will be opposing the amendment before us, which seeks to limit the use of excess ART embryos to deriving embryonic stem cells. For the information of the chamberâand because I suspect we are hoping to facilitate debate today, with so many amendmentsâout of courtesy I thought I would inform the chamber of what we are doing in most cases. I would similarly inform Senator Barnett, who has an amendmentâI think it is amendment No. 5âwhich attempts something similar, that we will also be opposing that amendment.</para></talk.start><para>Based on Senator Hogg's comments to the chamber, but also perhaps on broader debate on this issue, I suspect that this amendment is intended to reflect a claim that has been made in a number of submissionsâand certainly in a number of submissions to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee inquiry into this legislationâthat the legislation went further than the intention of COAG. One of the reasons that has been put forward to support this view is the belief that COAG was only dealing with regulating access to embryos for the derivation of embryonic stem cellsâbut, the argument goes, the legislation is much broader than that, because it allows training, quality assurance, testing of culture media and so forth. The legislation does say that it is illegal for anyone to use any excess ART embryos unless they have a licence or unless it is an exempt activity. The real strength of this approach is that it seeks to avoid any loopholes and it treats all possible uses in an even-handed manner. This is one of the strengths of the legislation and something that we have certainly recognised before. The strength of this legislation is that it treats the uses of excess ART embryos even-handedly.</para><para>In a supplementary report prepared by Senator Webber, Senator McLucas and me, we have outlined in some detail that we believe that the bill is quite consistent with COAG, because there is nothing in the COAG communique that says it is only about embryonic stem cells. Just on that point, I note that, in Senator Hogg's commentsâand I am happy to be correctedâhe talked about the idea that the COAG communique pretty much deals only with embryonic stem cells. If you refer to the communiqueâand certainly, in the committee report, we have done thatâand particularly points 5 and 6, you will recognise that, indeed, it is broader than just dealing with the issue of embryos for the derivation of stem cells. That is covered in relation to point 8. The derivation of embryonic stem cells is clearly discussed as one element in a general approach. </para><para>The amendment before us would effectively ban all research other than for the derivation of stem cells, including research that is non-destructive. It would also have a particularly negative impact on the IVF practice, because it potentially bans legitimate and longstanding research, quality assurance and training that involves the use of excess ART embryos donated by couples. For these reasons, the amendment is not supported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>6814</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank Senator Stott Despoja for her brevity. The amendment seeks to confine permission to use excess ART embryos to the derivation of stem cells. COAG made no distinction between different types of research on excess ART embryos and it did not place restrictions on the types of research for which a licence may be sought. While the legislation does not limit the types of research for which a licence may be sought, it does include safeguards to ensure that trivial or inappropriate research involving embryos does not occurâthat is, each application is to be considered and approved or rejected on its own merits.</para></talk.start><para>This amendment would prevent couples from donating their excess ART embryos to IVF related research. Many couples want to donate their excess ART embryos for this type of research, in order to help other infertile couples to become pregnant. While the legislation does not limit the types of research for which a licence may be sought, it does include safeguards to ensure that trivial or inappropriate research involving embryos does not occur and that any application to undertake research involving excess ART embryos must be considered and approved by the Human Research Ethics Committee, according to a range of criteria set out in the NHMRC guidelines.</para><para>A similar amendment was moved in the lower house and was defeated. The bill that is now before this chamber and has been passed by the House of Representatives is nationally consistent with the approach determined by COAG. It ensures appropriate ethical oversight, sets out clear standards underpinned by NHMRC guidelines, will be applied consistently throughout Australia, provides for public reporting and appropriately monitors compliance. All of those are outlined in the COAG communique at paragraph 6â6.1 to 6.5âas partially read out by Senator Hogg. I indicate that those who are supporting the bill will not be supporting this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>6814</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the formal Labor position, I indicate that we will be opposing the amendment for the same reasons as outlined by Senator Patterson and Senator Stott Despoja.

I obviously believe the point that I have put is correctâthat is, quite contrary to what Senator Stott Despoja said, I do not think this is seeking to limit the use of excess ART embryos to responsible research. To me, it seems quite reasonable that this be done on the basis of where the argument came from. The argument originally arose out of the issue of using adult stem cell research to help to cure people's diseases versus the issue of embryonic stem cells. If anyone is under any illusion, the debate certainly did not reach any great depths or go to any great heights on the issue of excess ART embryos for other purposes. If there was a debate on that at all, it was a very silent debate; a debate in which few, if any, took part. The focus of the debate in this nation since the debate emerged has clearly been on the issue of whether embryonic stem cell research is better than adult stem cell or other forms of what I would think are responsible research. Having gone down that path, the whole COAG process involved people standing up and singing the virtues of embryonic stem cell research versus the advantages of using adult stem cell and other kindred forms of research. </para></talk.start><para>Whilst there have been undertakings stated by the minister in her response to me todayâand I believe the minister is sincere in giving those undertakingsâone must be a little sceptical about how this debate will evolve in years down the track. When people look back at this debate and say that it was a wide-ranging debate, that will seem to be true, but people will have lost sight of the original stimulus for this debate taking place in the first instance in this nationâthat is, it was clearly a debate on embryonic stem cells versus adult stem cells, in particular.</para><para>Whilst I concede that the minister quite rightly said that I did read only two of the sections of paragraph 6 of the COAG communique, I did not mean to mislead. There is no doubt that the issue is raised there of research involving human embryos. It talks, as I said, of nationally consistent legislation being desired and that there should be an appropriate ethical oversight and that the standards should be clear. The communique also said:</para><para>6.3 these national standards should be applied consistently throughout Australia, recognising that jurisdictions may use different mechanisms to establish that proposals comply with the national standards;</para><para>6.4 the system should provide for public reporting of research involving embryos so as to improve transparency and accountability to the public; and</para><para>6.5 the system should enable appropriate monitoring of compliance with national standards and provide legislated penalties for non-compliance.</para><para>I understand that we are going to do the bulk of that in the rest of this legislation, but it seems to me that, if we do not have the focus of the legislation correct in the first instance, certainly the purpose of the legislation will become broader and broader as time goes on. People often talk of the slippery slope, and it is my view that on this particular piece of legislation we are there already. As I said, the evidence contained in Senator Harradine's additional comments to the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee's report clearly outlines a vast range of uses, as seen by Dr Morris of the NHMRC, that one would not have ever even speculated on out there in the public when this broader debate took place. Chair, without using up more time in this valuable debate, I commend the amendment to the Senate. Whilst I do not think the numbers are there, I believe this is a just and proper amendment that should be moved at this time.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cherry)</inline>âThe question is that amendment (1) on sheet 2720 moved by Senator Hogg be agreed to.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>6815</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI seek leave to move together amendments (1) and (2) standing in my name on sheet 2693.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>âIs leave granted?</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>6815</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âBefore we grant leave, could I see where we are at?

Those of us who have been intimately involved with the progress of this bill will recall the advice that the NHMRC, under the signature of Assistant Professor Tobin, the Deputy Chair of the Health Ethics Committee, provided to the community affairs committee.</para><para>I should at this stage thank Senator Nettle, who has also picked up the issue in her amendments. Both of us have sought to adopt the advice of the Australian Health Ethics Committee on how to ensure that this exemption does not generate an unintended loophole that could cause future problems for what COAG has determined should be a strict regime.</para><para>I will take a moment to take the chamber back to the advice from the Australian Health Ethics Committee, again commending Dr Breen for his courage in bringing forward this statement. The position put was that members of the Australian Health Ethics Committee are not satisfied that this potential loophole has been removed and that two matters are still of concern. Senators need to be mindful that this was as a consequence of a discussion in the Senate committee where, if I recall correctly, Dr Breen said that, in the discussion of these sorts of things and in the consultation process, you give some ground in some places and you gain some ground in other places. I felt a bit uneasy at the time, when I was thinking, `Is this the way we conduct ethical debates on issues of principle?' But Dr Breen took on board concerns raised and came back with the very strong position from the Health Ethics Committee that the consultation process that led to this bill had left them not satisfied that this potential loophole had been removed. </para><para>The two matters still of concern in the bill were that, firstly, the phrase `unsuitable for implantation' is so broad as to allow a clinic, if it so wished, to deem any embryoâregardless of its biological conditionânot fit for implantation and, secondly, the phrase `forms part of diagnostic investigations' is similarly so broad as to allow a clinic to investigate embryos in ways which would constitute research as well as diagnosis. The letter then reads:</para><quote><para>Several views were then expressed as to how this part of the bill might be redrafted so that it would deliver the strict regulatory regime for experimentation on embryos that it promises.</para></quote><para>The first suggestion that came forward was that the wording of the bill could be improved: the phrase `unsuitable for implantation' could be clarified so that the unsuitability of the embryo is determined only on the basis of its biologyâfor example, the poor physical appearance of the embryo. While in the AHEC advice this part is not in inverted commas as suggested wording, these are the words that Senator Nettle sought to adopt in her proposed amendment. Secondly, the phrase `forms part of diagnostic investigations' could be clarified so that the investigation of the embryo is for the sole purpose of diagnostic investigations for the direct benefit of the woman for whom it was createdâwith the words starting from `is for the sole purpose' clearly implying that this is the suggested wording of the Australian Health Ethics Committee.</para><para>In my amendments, especially since the words were in inverted commas, I adopted that into a definition of diagnostic investigation, which is clear in my amendment (2). I struggled a bit more with amendment (1) to try and give effect or meaning to the suggestions that had been raised by the Australian Health Ethics Committee. In regard to the suggestion in point 1, which is that the unsuitability of the embryo is determined only on the basis of its biologyâfor example, the poor physical appearance of the embryoâ and in contemplating biology and what interpretation might be put into this act in the future, certainly in my mind it was not clear that poor physical appearance gave a significant meaning to close a loophole. You then obviously ask what poor physical appearance really means.</para><para>That brings me back to my significant concern here. When we are talking about the biological issues involved in this exemption what we are really saying in my view is that the biological aspects of this embryo mean that it is not suitable for implantation because it would not lead to a viable or successful pregnancyâand that is all. We are not saying that, according to the biology, this embryo is carrying the cancer gene, so we will set it aside for research. We are not saying that, according to its biology, this embryo is female, so we will set it aside for research. We are not saying that, because of its biology, this embryo might have some form of disability, so we will set it aside for research. I think that most of us are pretty clear here that these are not the sorts of things we are saying. We are not providing a loophole which says that, for diagnostic purposes, anything other than the eugenically pure embryo is available for research.</para><para>With respect, while I am aware of some of the NHMRC advice on this issue and we are aware that it is only diagnostic investigation in relation to the particular woman involved, some of those arguments are quite circular, because AHEC have already told us that they do not think those factors are strong enough. They have already told us that we have to be more clear about why we are saying it is unsuitable for implantation.</para><para>Let me go back to why they say that. They say that the phrase `unsuitable for implantation' is so broad as to allow a clinic, if they so wished, to deem any embryoâregardless of its biological conditionânot fit for implantation. They are the words that AHEC suggested, and on this particular occasion I would not class it as stronger than a suggestion because, unlike in the second point where they give us precise words, on this occasion they just say to clarify it so that the unsuitability of the embryo is determined only on the basis of its biologyâfor example, the poor physical appearance of the embryo. But we need to go one step back from thatâthey talk about its physical appearance or its biology, but for what purpose? The purpose really concerns whether it is biologically fit for implantation to survive a successful pregnancy. </para><para>The suggestion in my amendment (1) is stronger than Senator Nettle's on this point, because I go on to say `where the suitability of the embryo is determined only'âand I stress the word `only', which I am not sure is that clear in the further amendment but does come from the AHEC adviceâ`on the basis of its biological fitness for attachment'. I am also aware that some issues have been raised about the suitability of or how clear is the term `attachment'. I am quite happy to change that word `attachment' to `implantation' in the amendment. I think the meaning or effect of that is quite clear.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Cherry, Sen John (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Cherry)</inline>âSenator Collins, you can seek leave to amend that.</para></talk.start></interjection></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>6818</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move an amendment to opposition amendment (1):</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit âattachmentâ, substitute âimplantationâ.</para></quote><para>So it becomes very clear that we are talking about where the suitability of the embryo is determined only on the basis of its biological fitness for implantation. We are now not going down the path of its biological fitness for any other purpose. We are not talking about its biological fitness because it could be, if it were assessed or examined, identified that there was a gene or some other issue related to its fitness besides its ability or its fitness for implantation. In this way we avoid in this loophole going down the path of some of those very complex and difficult arguments about whether we should be determining the status of one embryo as regards another, aside from the issue of whether it is, in a sense, a viable life. We explore those issues in many other ethical debates, but in this particular case I really think that that is the crux of what this exemption was designed to achieve. We were told, `We are having an exemption and that's okay because we are really only going to use those embryos, those lives, that would not have been viable into the future.'</para><para>In thinking this through further, I was thinking that perhaps the example is that, if you were looking at whether to store or freeze these embryos, they might be the ones that do not end up being frozen because the determination is made that they were not ever going to be able to result in a viable pregnancy. These then, under these amendments, would be the only ones that would be available for diagnostic investigation. So these two amendments make the exemption much tighter. I think that is quite consistent with the advice from the Australian Health Ethics Committee. In fact, before some people get too caught up in exactly the words that the Australian Health Ethics Committee used, I have already noted that their first suggestion was simply thatâa suggestion. It was not in inverted commas as the exact words that they would suggest, unlike their second suggestion. </para><para>But, if you read the next paragraph, they say, `In addition, diagnostic investigations could become an activity requiring a licence.' This is not being proposed here. We are still accepting that an exemption could existâalbeit a very tight and strict exemptionâbut, unlike this additional issue raised by the Australian Health Ethics Committee, we accept that other problems could develop, if you go back and put them into the strict licensing regime. These two amendments accept that an exemption can occur but propose that it be as tight as possible and draw on the advice of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. I have sought to add some additional meaning to their first point that the unsuitability of the embryo is determined only on the basis of its biologyâfor example, the poor physical appearance of the embryoâbut I have sought to express that in a way which gives clearer effect to the meaning, which is that we are talking about those embryos which, were they placed in the body of a woman, would be unlikely to lead to a successful pregnancy and it is only in those circumstances that they should be available for research. I will be interested to hear the discussion on these amendments. While I understand that there is some support for Senator Nettle's amendment, I commend these amendments to the chamber. I think this is the more appropriate way to go, and I will be interested to hear senators' responses to these amendments. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>6819</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am happy to cover the amendments moved by Senators Collins and Nettle, and also Senator Hogg, for the purposes of facilitating the debate. My intention was always to listen to the arguments on the floor while acknowledging the benefits in both the amendments. Certainly, I think both Senator Nettle and Senator Collins have provided us with amendments that go to some of the concerns that have been raised by AHEC. I think the added commitment by Senator Collins in the chamber to amend her proposed amendment is most satisfactory and, therefore, we will be supporting Senator Collins's amendment. </para></talk.start><para>In the course of the Senate inquiry, there was some discussion as to whether or not diagnostic testing should be an exempt activity and whether or not the wording contained in the legislation was in fact adequate. Part 2, clause 10 outlines the exempt uses of excess ART embryos including storage, removal from storage, transport of those embryos and diagnostic testing. The Democrats are satisfied that these are routine practices in ART clinics and that there are good reasons to make them exempt from requiring a licence. We also note that there is the capacity for the regulations to describe any other exempt practices, should they be identified. We think that is prudent. It is a reasonable provision, as it is not the objective of this bill to unreasonably impose on IVF routine, IVF practices. If I may have the indulgence of the committee to refer to Senator Hogg's proposed amendment to eliminate this capacity, while we may discuss that again, I flag to Senator Hoggâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>7L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âOkay, we will support that. Clause 10(2)(d) makes it quite clear that diagnostic testing can only be carried out by an accredited ART centre and the excess ART embryo is not suitable to be placed in the body of the woman for whom it was created and the diagnostic investigations are specifically carried out for the benefit of that woman's treatment. We think the intent is quite clear that diagnostic testing should not be for general research and we are completely satisfied that such tests are a legitimate and routine part of the ART practice. Accordingly, we have indicated our concerns with Senator Hogg's amendment. </para></talk.start></continue><para>So that leaves us with Senator Collins's and Senator Nettle's amendments. Following discussion in the Senate inquiry between Senator Collins and Dr Breen from AHECâ to which Senator Collins referred in her remarksâthe committee received advice on 18 October from AHEC that two matters are still of concern for AHEC. The phrase `unsuitable for implantation' is so broad as to allow a clinic, if it so wished, to deem an embryoâregardless of its biological conditionânot fit for implantation. And the phrase `forms part of diagnostic investigations' is similarly so broad as to allow a clinic to investigate embryos in ways which could constitute research as well as diagnosis. AHEC suggested the wording of the bill could be improved thus:</para><para>The phrase `unsuitable for implantation' could be clarified so that the unsuitability of the embryo is determined only on the basis of its biology, for example, the poor physical appearance of the embryoâ</para><para>which is essentially the text that Senator Nettle has relied upon in her amendment. AHEC further suggested:</para><quote><para>Secondly, the phrase `forms part of diagnostic investigations' could be clarified so that the investigation of the embryos is for the sole purpose of diagnostic investigations for the direct benefit of the woman for whom it was created.</para></quote><para>Again, that is Senator Nettle's preferred wording. There may be a concern that Senator Collins's amendment is a little ambiguous in relation to the wording, in that `biological fitness for attachment' raises the question: fitness for attachment to what? Certainly Senator Collins anticipated some of these queries and concerns, but I think both senators have recognised some of the outstanding problems and have taken into account AHEC's concerns. I acknowledge the comments provided by Senator Collins and her amendments, which are satisfactory. </para><para>Finally, I observe that AHEC's contribution on this particular issue demonstrates that they take their responsibilities very seriously indeed, and I think that demonstrates that they warrant our confidence. This possibly stands in marked contrast to some adverse reflections on the NHMRC, and there have been attacks throughout this debate which should be corrected for the record. I think organisations such as AHEC are doing a good job under difficult circumstances. That is not to say that the Democrats would reject any attempts to further improve issues of transparency and accountability, but we certainly appreciate their feedback not only in the debate in the committee stageâparticularly the interaction between Dr Breen and Senator Collinsâbut also more generally. We will be supporting the amendments moved by Senator Collins in preference to the one moved by Senator Nettle which is, indeed, still a good amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>6820</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn view of the comment by Senator Stott Despoja on my proposed amendment (2), whilst that is not before the chair I think it is appropriate that I make some comments on that now so that other speakers in this debate know what my position is.

My concern was, as it always has been in these pieces of legislation, that it was open to abuse. I welcome the amendments that have been put forward by Senator Collins and Senator Nettle.

I do not consider Senator Collins's amendment to be necessary because I believe that the exemption is already very strongly worded and there is no potential for loopholes. The legislation provides a range of safeguards ensuring that general research activities cannot avoid licensing by relying on the exemption for diagnostic investigations. While I believe the criteria for exemption are sufficiently strong and provide for very limited exemption to allow valuable diagnostic work to be undertaken in the treatment of a particular woman, I am also aware that this exemption has been of concern to a number of people. In particular, I am aware of the advice of the Deputy Chair of the Australian Health Ethics Committee that the wording of the exemption could be strengthened by the inclusion of a few words.</para></talk.start><para>As I indicated, I am prepared to support an amendment that gives effect to the advice provided by AHEC. However, I believe that the amendment proposed by Senator Nettle is preferable to that proposed by Senator Collins. Senator Nettle provides that the `embryo is not suitable to be placed in the body of the woman for whom it was created, because of its biological condition, including poor physical condition'. This aligns with that suggested by the Deputy Chair of AHEC and, given the strong and central role AHEC have had over the last five or more years, I believe that this would be a more appropriate amendment. As I said, I will be opposing Senator Collins's first amendment but propose to support the amendment proposed by Senator Nettle. Senator Collins's second amendment seeks to include a new definition of `diagnostic investigation'. Again, given my support for the Nettle amendment, I will not be supporting this amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>6821</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am somewhat surprised by the response of the Minister for Health and Ageing on this point, particularly the statement that there was not a loophole. What started me down this path was the second reading debate in the House of Representatives, in which Minister Andrews said that he still had concerns with the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> as drafted and that this loophole would occur. I can only presume that the draft as presented is the consequence of the consultation process that the NHMRC went through. That is why, in the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, I said to the Australian Health Ethics Committee: `Are you happy with the result of this consultation process? Are you happy that concerns you raised were taken seriously and are you happy with the outcome?' On this particular issue the Australian Health Ethics Committeeâquite courageously, in my view, given some of the practices I have become aware of over timeâ said, `No, we are not.' Their letter said, `Members of AHEC are not satisfied that this potential loophole has been removed.' I reinforce the point back to the minister and to the Senate:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Two matters are still of concern. The phrase `unsuitable for implantation' is so broad as to allow a clinic, if it so wished, to deem any embryo, regardless of its biological condition, not fit for implantation.</para></quote><para>Aside from the phraseology of this bill, what does that tell us about the confidence of the Australian Health Ethics Committee and how they think a clinic might seek to apply this exemption? I think there is a very strong warning in those words. Let me read them again:</para><quote><para>The phrase `unsuitable for implantation' is so broad as to allow a clinic, if it so wished, to deem any embryo, regardless of its biological condition, not fit for implantation.</para></quote><para>I have already commended Senator Nettle for picking up the suggestion in this AHEC letter. When I first read it and took note of the fact that it did not have these words in inverted commas, as indeed it did have for the second element of their suggestion, I read it as their suggestion that we look at this and give some serious consideration as to how best to tie it up as much as we can, which is what I did. The letter continues:</para><quote><para>The unsuitability of the embryo is determined only on the basis of its biology, for example the poor physical appearance of the embryo.</para></quote><para>With respect to Senator Patterson, beyond simply a preference for wording something one way or the other I have not heard any significant reason why tightening this exemption to the biology of the embryo in terms of its viability for implantation is not satisfactory as a way of tightening this loophole in the view of the Australian Health Ethics Committee. On the basis of their response on the last occasion I raised this issue with them, I would be quite surprised to hear them come back and say, `No, actually we think that is too strong; you have tightened it too strongly.' Their advice to us was, `Tighten it; it needs to be tightened. We do not have confidence in clinics not using this phrase âunsuitable for implementationâ to deem any embryo up for research.'</para><para>We already know from our hearings that some of these clinics are open to many things. A number of the senators on the committee were quite surprised to hear that Sydney IVF is doing gender selection, not for health related reasons or to do with genetic issues but simply for anyone who wants to use IVF as a means of determining that their next child be male or female. We do not want to see the consequences of this in terms of the handling of embryos under this exemption. The only embryos that should be available under this exemption are those that would not result in a viable pregnancy. No other biological reason should be a factor. I believe that Senator Nettle's wording still allows that possibility. We do not have the further benefit of the Australian Health Ethics Committee's advice on this, but I think the intent of their response to my questions was quite clear: tighten it as much as you possibly can. In fact, they went one step further and said to put them into the licensing requirementâeven though they then discounted that suggestion on the basis that other problems would eventuate. I can only suggest most strongly to the committee that we look at tightening this loophole as much as we can. I do not accept Senator Patterson's view that there really is not a problem here. In fact, I am surprised that that position has been represented to her. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>6822</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI want to clarify my position on these amendments.

As we have argued previously, we have tried as much as possible to remain consistent with the COAG agreement. We have tried not to move too far away from that because of the unique process they went through, when they got the agreement of all the states and territories. We want to respect that as much as possible while still allowing the Senate to do its proper job of reviewing the legislation with some rigour. We are persuaded on balance that Senator Nettle's amendment most accurately reflects the advice from AHEC and provides sufficient protection against the concerns raised.

I will be referring to this along the way, because I do not think that this is a strict regulatory regime at all. The arguments have been put forward by both Senator Collins and Senator Nettle about the problems identified by the Australian Health Ethics Committee. Those arguments are indisputable. It is a question of whether we can have the strictest regulatory regime. It has been acknowledged by all around this chamber that the proposal put forward by Senator Collins is the strict regulatory regime that is being requested. That strict regulatory regime is being requested by COAG. The advice from Senator Nettle, who also thought of this as an amendment, as I heard her, was that the proposal by Senator Collins is stricter than hers and that she was supporting it.

If you have a look at the whole regime of this legislation, you can see that it requiresâand much is made of this in the COAG agreementâa licensing committee. Even if you do not, as I do, oppose the legislation you at least ought to stick to what the COAG agreement was. The COAG agreement envisages the use of excess ART embryos after a licence has been obtained from a specific licensing committee which is to be established under the act. This particular clause exempts certain experiments and research from those provisions. We just have to look at what the exemptions are. Clause 10(2)(d) states:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>A use of an excess ART embryo by a person is an<inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic"> exempt use</inline> for the purposes of subsection (1) if:</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>(d)	the use is carried out by an accredited ART centre, and ...</para></quote><para>That is point No. 1.

I want to ask the minister: what supervision is made of the body that gives this accreditation? You have this in the legislation; how do we know whether we should put all of our confidence into the hands of that accreditation committee when there is no legislation or other independent authority involved? Bear in mind that the accredited ART centre can simply give permission for the use of excess ART embryos for a whole range of purposes so that the researchers and others involved do not have to obtain a licence. In due course, I would like to hear from the minister as to how that accreditation committee will be run and who will manage it.

It is a shame that the Labor Party politicians on the other side do not have the same interest. When Labor were in government, the private health system, as I have said before, was dangerously and perilously close to being non-existent. The membership of private health insurance was running at about 33 per cent and even the then Minister for Health, Graham Richardson, said that it was totally unsustainable as it was. With our Lifetime Health Cover and with our rebate, we have brought it up to 44 per cent and we have seen a significant increase in membership and a significant increase in the use of private hospitals.</para></talk.start><para>When Labor were in their last years of government, premiums were increasing by an average of eight per cent per year and Australians were dropping out of private health insurance at the rate of two per cent per year. We have restored the balance between the public and the private system in terms of hospitals. We have pursued policy options, and at every step along the way Labor have resisted themâbasically motivated by their blind ideological opposition to private health care. They have been unable to acknowledge the success of our programs. Almost nine million Australians now have private health cover, and they all get and enjoy the benefits of the coalition's 30 per cent rebate. The rebate has been the cornerstone of our policies, and it has taken the pressure off Medicare and our public hospitals.</para><para>The latest figures from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare, which are based on the figures provided by the statesâ I repeat: those figures are provided by the statesâshow that in 2000-01 public hospital admissions decreased by minus 0.1 per cent and private hospital admissions increased by 12 per cent. That is a massive 12 per cent increase compared with the decrease in public hospital admissions. This is before we even begin to see the real impact of lifetime cover, which will come in over a period of time. The figures are even more interesting when you look at the states one by one. In New South Wales, public admissions fell by 7,370 or minus 0.6 per cent and private admissions grew by 35,486 or 5.9 per cent. In Queensland, public admissions fell by 19,267 or minus 2.7 per cent and private admissions grew by a massive 73,903 or 16.3 per cent. In South Australia, public admissions were down by 2,961 or minus 0.8 per cent and private admissions grew by 24,511 or 15.3 per cent.</para><para>On the face of this obvious and overwhelming success, the Labor Party maintain their opposition to private health care. We awoke to screaming headlines this morning on Labor's clear intent to dismantle the rebate. I said the other day here in the chamber that one thing we can guarantee is that private health insurance will be 30 per cent cheaper under the coalition. The fact that the Labor Party are going to take the rebate awayâand they have now basically let the cat out of the bagârepresents an attack on Australian families and pensioners. Last year, Labor went to the election promising to retain the rebate in full, and in February this yearâthis is their flip-flop on policyâthe Leader of the Opposition said:</para><quote><para>We've said that this is now a big part of people's budgets and we went to the last election retaining the private health rebate.

I gather that what Senator Sherry is really asking is whether the government is planning any increase in the age at which superannuation benefits can be accessed. As honourable senators would know, the government provides substantial tax concessions for superannuation in order to promote self-provision in retirement. Appropriate restrictions on the release of superannuation moneys are required. The government recently increased the preservation age from 55 to 60 on a phased basis between the years 2015 and 2025. This means that for somebody born before 1 July 1960 the preservation age will remain at 55 years, while for someone born after 30 June 1964 the preservation age will rise to 60. This change aims to reduce the opportunities for people to double-dipâ that is, to use their concessionally taxed superannuation benefits for non-retirement income purposes and then access the age pension. I am aware that a report was apparently prepared by a temporary employee of the Department of Finance and Administration which raised the prospect of increasing the age pension age.

We have discounted growth by 0.75 per cent because of one of the worst droughts this nation has ever experienced, and we do have a relatively uncertain international economic environment. But the Treasury is still forecasting growth of three per cent in this financial year and four per cent in the following financial year, so we do continue to be one of the fastest-growing economies in the developed world.</para></talk.start><para>The underlying cash surplus at the mid-year point is forecast to remain at $2.1 billion for this financial year and to increase in the following year. Of course this is at a time when many of our competitor nations and comparative nations have very significant deficits. The unemployment rate is forecast to remain steady at six per cent, and inflation will remain in the band of two to three per cent. We have also announced additional counter-terrorism measures in the wake of the Bali tragedy and we have made provision for extra spending in relation to exceptional circumstances in the drought, in order to ensure that Australian farmers can cope with this very severe situation. I think the fact that we have been able to cope with the drought, September 11 and the Bali situation does demonstrate just how strong the current budget situation is and how good our economic management has been.</para><para>I was asked particularly about MYEFO and I take this opportunity to make some comments about accusations by those opposite that budget transparency has somehow been diminished, which is of course a very strange claim coming from a party that, when going to its last election in government, hid from the Australian people a $10,000 million deficitâone of the worst examples of hiding the true situation we have ever seen. We have revolutionised the transparency of the budget since Labor was in office. For example, the MYEFO document that we released last week was 168 pages of detailed information. When Labor was in office, the midyear update rarely exceeded four pages.</para><para>The public and the opposition have much more detailed information available to them now about the Commonwealth government's financial position than has ever been the case. We do now report the budget not only in cash terms but also in accrual terms. I think the problem is that the Labor Party has never understood accrual accounting and simply gets confused by all of the information we now make available to it. We release a detailed MYEFO, a final budget outcome document, monthly financial statements and a set of fully audited consolidated financial statements. When we had just cash budgeting under Labor, all we had given to the parliament from the government were the cash flows of the budget. They did not provide any information on the overall financial position of the government.</para><para>Labor has also raised the issue of special accounts. Of course, they are not new. We have had special accounts in one form or another since 1908, and their purpose has not changed. All of these accounts were endorsed by the parliament when they were established via legislation or determination, and Labor has not voted against any single special account created under our government. They are all audited by the ANAO. There were in fact more of these special accounts when Labor was last in office and there was more money in those special accounts when Labor was last in office. Under our government, the budget is as strong and as transparent as any budget in the Western world.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title><page.no>6828</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>6828</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is directed to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer.

The property at Clareville that seems to have excited so much interest from those opposite was owned by my husband before we were married, and we have been married for about 20 years. That means it cannot be subject to capital gains tax. The property was purchased many years before capital gains tax was introduced in 1985. As those opposite should be aware, capital gains tax does not apply to assets owned before 1985. The Labor Party should know this, because they introduced capital gains tax.

In relation to the question of making the results public, I answered a similar question from Senator Faulkner some time ago in which I said that I expect that there will be a public statement arising out of the report. How much of the report itself would be able to be made public will depend on that part that has to remain secret, for obvious reasons.

Secondly, will she commit to looking at other methods of `restoring the balance'âand I quote from her answer to Senator Knowlesâbetween the public and private health systems, such as a bed day subsidy for when private beds are actually used, so putting back the subsidy that the Labor Party scrapped some years ago?</para></talk.start></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>6833</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âHere is what the Labor Party and Mr Crean said about the rebate:</para></talk.start><quote><para>We've said that this is now a big part of people's budgets and we went to the last election retaining the private health rebate.

Let me say that thousands upon thousands of people who are waiting in queues to get into public hospitals for surgery and other procedures have been able to get into private hospitalsâ a 12 per cent increase in patients going into private hospitals. The minus 0.6 per cent decrease in last year's figuresâthe AIHW figures that Senator Lees is referring toâis from a survey of, I think, 30 hospitals undertaken by the public hospitals association. The figures we are going on are last year's figures based on what the states give us, not on a survey of 30 hospitals undertaken by the public hospitals association. The rebate on private health insurance has actually made private health insurance sustainable in the future, enabling private hospitals to build more beds and deliver services to people who need them. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title><page.no>6833</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6833</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â My question is directed to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer.

I am aware that Senator Ferris has recently been out west of Bourke and would have experienced first-hand the terrible impacts that the drought is having on agricultural industries and on families in that area. As Senator Ferris will know, virtually all of New South Wales is in drought, and some areas are experiencing their lowest rainfall in recorded history. I understand that where you were, Senator Ferris, they have not seen rain for some 2Â½ years.</para></talk.start><para>The cost of the drought to Australian farmers and their families and the communities they support will be enormous at both an economic and a financial level. The Howard government well appreciate the difficulty being experienced in country Australia at the moment. We expect to provide an additional $370 million over the next two years in exceptional circumstances drought payments for relief to farmers in the areas that we expect may qualify based on current rainfall data. As of today, more than 1,300 farmers in four states are in receipt of Commonwealth EC drought relief payments. A further 1,000 are receiving welfare assistance under the Farm Help program.</para><para>In the last two weeks, more than 5,000 farmers have become eligible for interim exceptional circumstances assistance. On 13 November the Commonwealth declared Bourke and Brewarrina as an exceptional circumstances area, and five other regions have been, prima facie, designated for exceptional circumstances assistance. Interim income support is available to farmers in these areas. These regions include Peak Downs, Walgett, Coonamble, Grafton, Kempsey, the majority of the Western Division of New South Wales and also northern New England. For every $1 that the states contribute towards exceptional circumstances, the Commonwealth contributes something like $25. The effort from the Commonwealth is large. Regrettably, the states are still dragging the chain.</para><para>In addition, the Howard government has given $5 million to the Farmhand appeal to help those in very needy circumstances. The Farm Management Deposit Scheme, which we are very proud of on this side of the chamber, has accumulated some $2 billion, and that means the Commonwealth government will forgo something like $470 million in revenue. Mr Howard announced the other day that there would be earlier access to those farm management deposits, and we are going to provide an exemption to the 12-month waiting period for access to the Farm Management Deposit Scheme for farmers in an EC drought declared area. We are also going to provide additional money through the Family and Community Services portfolio for personal counselling in drought affected areas. That will be up to $2 million. We have committed $10 million for drought funding under the Australian government Envirofund, a new program element to assist in recovery and to help with land, water, vegetation and the biodiversity resource base that affects drought. We have also provided additional money for pest animal management grants and we have given $1 million to the Country Women's Association for emergency aid funding. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title><page.no>6835</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>6835</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMy question is to Senator Coonan, the Assistant Treasurer and Minister for Revenue.

The Labor Party are labouring mightily to try to establish a conflict of interest with my portfolio responsibilities or my ministerial responsibilities. There is not one single concrete fact that could ground a complaint of conflict of interest against me. The Labor Party have simply failed to establish that I had any interest at all in Endisputeâthat was last weekâthat required divestiture of my share, but I did it anyway. The Labor Party have failed to establish that I have ministerial responsibility for ASIC and for governance matters; I clearly do not. They will fail to establish that my husband is a consultant to ASIC. He was eight years ago and has not been since. Next there was an attempt to implicate my portfolio in relation to capital gains tax, but a simple search shows that this property can under no circumstances be liable to capital gains tax; so that horse will not run. There is not a shred of evidence that any area of my ministerial portfolio responsibilities is involved in any of these allegations, nor that my own conduct can be questioned.

That is as it should be. It is proper for the minister to identify that as soon as possible. Of course, it could also be noted that Senator Coonan signed both those returns, which gives me little confidence in the level of diligence she applies to these tasks. However, having done that, I think there are a range of other issues on which Senator Coonan needs to respond appropriately and quickly to the Senate. Senator Coonan needs to understand that she is the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer in this country. That is the second most senior position in the administration of the Treasury portfolio and the tax officeâ one rung down from Mr Costello. Despite this crucial job, the Assistant Treasurer, through her family company arrangements and her property portfolio, is unable to satisfy the Senate about the taxation arrangements she is involved in.</para><para>In the last sitting week the Senate has already exposed the minister's tardy resignation from family company Endispute, which no doubt led to ASIC charging a late lodgment penalty against the company secretary, her husband, Mr Rogers. I asked Senator Coonan about those arrangements on 13 and 14 November. Mr Rogers's company report, lodged with ASIC on 15 November, reveals she resigned as company director on 24 December 2001âa month after becoming Assistant Treasurerâbut the public lodgment of this resignation with ASIC had to wait 11 months. At best, this is extreme sloppiness on the part of the Assistant Treasurer, who is supposed to be in charge of answering questions about ASIC here. </para><para>The Senate has exposed a property supposedly owned by a deregistered company, Karnick Trustees, and the Assistant Treasurer ought to be well aware that the property of a deregistered company is vested in ASIC through section 576 of the Corporations Act. This Rogers family company seems to have been lax in its corporate reporting responsibility for some years now, with legal ownership seeming to reside with ASIC, which is of course a Commonwealth agency within the Treasury portfolioâmore sloppiness from the Assistant Treasurer. Does this sloppiness attract a tax advantage? That is the question that is being asked. Karnick, owning this million dollar property, retained CGT-free status. But if the property had been transferred to Mr Rogers's own name when the company was deregistered in 1993, capital gains tax liability would have begun accruing from that date. These questions were asked of Senator Coonan today, and the Senate is entitled to expect an answer. What we are worried about is whether the failure to transfer the ownership has led to nine years of potential capital gains tax liability. This is something the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer should be able to answer.</para><para>There are further serious questions over Senator Coonan's husband's Pittwater weekender that have been raised in the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> and the chamber today. As soon as the unimproved land value rose sharply in March 2001, Senator Coonan's family arrangements changed, with Mr Rogers declaring it his principal place of residence, thus possibly avoiding what the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> calculates as $11,800 worth of land tax and leaving a lucrative question mark against any capital gains tax accrued if the property is sold. The <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> relates Mr Rogers saying he lived there to avoid the inconvenience of renovations at the couple's Woollahra houseâfair enoughâand Senator Coonan through her spokesman said that the renovations began in September or October 1999 and finished in April 2000. But the renovations finished 11 months before Mr Rogers varied his enrolmentâagain, a proper question. We are asking the questions: what on earth is going on here; what is this all about? We do not know whether this is a case of wrongful enrolment for tax avoidance purposes. Senator Coonan needs to say to the chamber what the situation is. Senator Coonan needs to come clean.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>6839</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe unfortunate thing about Senator Faulkner's attack, if you could call it that, is that Senator Coonan has come clean. He has basically fired a few shots out of a locker that is bereft of any ammunition. In the last five minutes he has basically tried to associate Senator Coonan with some sort of impropriety. He has failed on each attempt. He has basically said that Senator Coonan's resignation from the family company was done in an improper way. That is the first charge that he seeks to make against Senator Coonan. She had in fact done exactly the right thing in accordance with all ministerial guidelines. In fact, on every single charge that Senator Faulkner has sought to make against Senator Coonan she has abided by the ministerial guidelines to the very letter of those guidelines.</para></talk.start><para>What has he actually come in here to do today? He wants to attack a person who is outside this place, who cannot come in here and defend himself, who happens for his sins to be married to a minister of the crown and a senator in Senator Coonan, and of course Mr Justice Rogers will not be able to defend himself. People like Senator Faulkner and Senator Conroy should walk the 15 to 20 yards outside that door and make the allegations they are prepared to make in here. But of course they will not, because the people opposite are spineless and gutless. They have no policies of their own. They have no policies to try and improve Australia or to improve the standing of the Australian Labor Party federally. What they do is come in here and try to attack a minister of the government, not because they can find anything that she has done wrong in the portfolioâin fact, she has done an extraordinarily sound job as the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. What they do is try to attack her through her husband in a spineless and gutless way. They attempt to hurt her through her husband who, as I said, cannot defend himself in here. </para><para>Senator Coonan did resign from the family company, and she did so in good time. Having established that in the Senate, they start to have a look at the ownership structure of her husband's property in Clareville. And of course Senator Faulkner was hit for six over the boundary in Adam Gilchrist style when they found out that the property had in fact been owned for many years, that it was owned by Mr Rogers from a previous marriage and that Senator Coonan had no interest in that property. Having been absolutely hit for six over the boundary on that one they tried to then raise other issues about Mr Rogers's enrolment on the electoral roll.</para><para>What is the real motivation for this attack? They cannot attack Senator Coonan on tax policy or the administration of tax policy, because she has done an extraordinary job, and they cannot come up with a policy of their own. They cannot attack Senator Coonan in relation to the administration of superannuation or superannuation policy, because they have total confusion on their own side. They cannot come up with any sort of rational concept, discussion paper or even the commencement of an idea in relation to superannuation. So what do they do? Can they attack her on policy? No. Can they attack her on ministerial propriety? No. So what do they do? They attack her husband. It really is a pathetic and disgraceful attack.</para><para>I seriously suggest to Senator Conroy that, if he believes what he says in here, he uphold his own integrity, quite frankly, by walking outside and calling a press conference. You have representatives of the press who are now leaving the gallery in droves. You should call a doorstop, Senator Conroy, and repeat the allegations out there, if you believe them. If you believe them to be true, just say them outside. You are not even attacking a minister here; you are attacking a citizen, Justice Rogers. He cannot come in here and defend himself.

Because those opposite could make no headway at all in questioning the performance of the Assistant Treasurer in her ministerial capacity over the past months, what do they do?

The Assistant Treasurer has satisfied the Senate in relation to her taxation liabilities and has explained at every opportunity.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Senators opposite cannot even get their questions right. On at least four occasions today their first attempts at questioning were ruled out of order. That is how thin the ice was that they were skating on when it came to determining what their questioning of this minister was going to be or on any matters related to the minister. They did not relate to the minister's portfolio; in every instance the questions related to matters other than the minister's portfolio. So we had the situation where on at least four occasions their questions were ruled out of order by the President, and they were then given some leniency in order to rephrase the questions. I think they were given more than the required amount of leniency today. If you get it wrong once, maybe you should get a chance to rephrase the question; but if you continually get your questions wrong, you cannot expect the President to say, `Listen, that is out of order; have another go.' On four occasions they were allowed to rephrase their questions, which I think is totally inappropriate and they ought to do their homework better.</para><para>Today Senator Coonan, in her role as a senator not as a minister, adequately answered those questions put to her in relation to her register of interests. She then came back as soon as possible at the end of question time and clarified any misconceptions there may have been. We all know that, in relation to her taxation liabilities, everything that had to be done has been done. Her husband's property in Clareville, which Senator Coonan has no interest in, cannot be subject to capital gains tax. That is the only tax that was referred to today that would have any bearing on the federal government. Every other taxation liability that was brought up today in relation to any properties that they might have, that Senator Coonan might have or that her husband might have were all New South Wales state government taxes, over which Senator Coonan has no responsibility whatsoever.</para><para>So if you are talking about Senator Coonan's portfolio responsibility, there is no way other than the capital gains tax issue that any of it has any bearing on her portfolio. As she said, the property has been owned for over 20 years and therefore is not subject to capital gains tax, which was introduced by the Labor Party in 1985. Land tax is a state tax; it has nothing to do with federal revenue or Senator Coonan's portfolio responsibilities. As a senator and as a minister she of course would not condone the non-payment of any properly assessed tax at either a state or a federal level. So Senator Coonan came into this chamber and answered the questions put to her by both Senator Conroy and Senator Faulkner. </para><para>We also know, of course, that Justice Rogers had been in contact with the Commissioner of Land Tax in mid-November, notifying him of a change of circumstances and seeking a land assessment in relation to his property at Clareville, before questioning of this issue ever arose from the opposition senatorsâwho have nothing better to do on behalf of the Australian people than to personally attack Senator Coonan and her husbandâand before any questioning was ever raised by the <inline font-style="italic">Sydney Morning Herald</inline> in today's newspaper. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>6843</page.no><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator SHERRY</name><name.id>ZW4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âToday when I posed a question to Senator Coonan, who is the minister responsible for superannuation policy in the Liberal government, I asked her quite directly not on one but on two occasions whether she would rule out on behalf of the Liberal government a further increase in the preservation access age for superannuation.

Australians need to know well in advance at what age they can access their superannuation if either they are forced into retirement or they voluntarily wish to go into retirement. The minister declined to rule it out not once but twice. I would have been surprised, in light of the leaked document from the finance department, if the minister had ruled it out. But if we look at statements made by ministers in this government in very recent times, we get a good idea about where the Liberal government are headed on retirement incomes policy. Because they do not have a decent retirement incomes policy, the Liberal Party answer in large part to resolving the problems of the ageing population is to make people work longer.</para><para>The Liberal government effectively want to force many Australians to stay in the work force at least to the age of 65 in respect of superannuation and probably to the age of 70. Their solution to the challenge of the ageing population and of providing decent retirement incomes for Australians is to make everyone work longer: force people to work to the age of 70. The Liberal Party want to force many Australians to work until they literally drop. Many Australians will not live far beyond the age of 70, and the Liberal government want them to work to that age. The Liberal government want Australians to work until they have got one foot in the grave. That is their retirement incomes policy: force everyone to work longer, to work to the age of 70. Never mind the dreams of Australians who want to spend 10 or 15 years in retirement, buying a caravan or participating in community activities. The government just want to force them to work longer. In fact, the Treasurer, Mr Costello, as recently as 7 August 2002âand I asked the minister about thisâsaid: </para><quote><para>More flexible working arrangements, training and re-training, and raising the preservation age for superannuation would all be positive moves ...</para></quote><para>The Treasurer has quite directly flagged a further increase in the preservation age or access age for Australian superannuation. No wonder Senator Coonan, in respect of superannuation policy, not once but twice refused to rule out a further increase in the preservation age. The Liberal government want Australians to work until they drop, until they have got one foot in the grave. That is their retirement incomes policy: to force them to work until age 70.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>National Security</title><page.no>6844</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>6844</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence (Senator Hill) to a question without notice asked by Senator Bartlett today relating to pre-emptive military action.</para></motion><para>Despite the fairly flippant response from the minister and the typical gratuitous gutter-trawling interjections from some of the government senators, this is actually a very important issue. I do not know why the minister did not think it was important, but the Democrats certainly think it is important that five very important countries in our neighbourhood have all taken great offence at the Prime Minister's statement. The minister, as usual, read out a part of the Prime Minister's statement that suited his argument. He did not read out the context of it, the question that it was responding to, nor the further comments from the Prime Minister.</para><para>The Prime Minister's comments were specifically linkedâparticularly his follow-up answerâto a question from Laurie Oakes. He was talking about the SAS being perfectly tailored to make a pre-emptive strike in another country. He was specifically talking about Australian troops being involved in a pre-emptive strike in another country in the context of potential terrorist attacks. Of course, every government has a responsibility to do everything it can to prevent its citizens from being attacked. But when the Prime Minister suggests that part of Australia's repertoire should be the possibility of SAS troops being involved in some pre-emptive military action in another country in our region, it is not surprising that countries in our region would get very perturbed by his statement.</para><para>It is astonishing that the government and the minister did not take the opportunity to say, `We did not say that at all.' I would have thought that there is no problem at all and that it would be completely appropriate and responsible for the government and the minister to take the opportunity to clarify that statement by saying to our neighbours, `This was not the intention; this was not what we meant; this has been unclearly interpreted.' I would have thought that was a natural part of appropriate communications. Instead, we just get a continuation of the bluster. We have seen Minister Downer saying, `If people misinterpret the Prime Minister's comments, that's their problem,' and specifically that those countries `have to live with the consequences of their misinterpretation'. The people who will have to live with the consequences are the Australian people who will once again be perceived in a negative light across vast parts of our region. Basically, in his response to the question from the Democrats, the minister is saying, `You are stupid for misunderstanding what the Prime Minister said; he didn't really say it.' That, by extension, is saying to the governments of Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and the Philippines: `You're stupid as well; go get a life.'</para><para>That is the sort of approach they take to dealing with our neighbours. If we have learned one thing from the tragedy in Bali, surely it is that we need to be more sensitive than ever to how we are perceived in our region and more sensitive than ever to the possibility that we are perceived as an aggressive B-grade cowboy trying to be the US deputy sheriff in the region. We have seen these sorts of diplomatic gaffes before from the Prime Minister and from Minister Downer. Yet, not only do they not learn but, at a time when it is all the more crucial for the security of Australians that this sort of impression is corrected, they increase that perception, refuse to clarify it afterwards and then tell everybody, `If you misunderstand, that's your problem; you can live with it.' We have had the Thai government saying that no country should do anything like that which Mr Howard suggested. The Philippines national security adviser said that Mr Howard's comments were completely unacceptable, that this is the 21st century, not the 19th century. Malaysia's defence minister said that he will not allow foreign intervention in the fight against terrorism, and there was also criticism from Indonesia. </para><para>Despite some of the shallow jibes from the government, the Democrats are certainly not suggesting that we should allow our foreign policy to be run by other countries, although the government is quite happy for our foreign policy to be run by the US. But the Democrats do believe that, if you are not going to be sensitive to the perception of other countries in our region, if you are simply going to say to them, `If you misunderstand us, that is your problem,' if you make statements such as the Prime Minister did, which clearly inferred possible involvement of SAS troops in a first strike in circumstances down the track, then you have got to expect this sort of response, and when you get this sort of response you have to at least clarify your comments. The Prime Minister should withdraw the statement and apologise, but at a minimum he should clarify the statement so that Australian people do not have to keep wearing being massively misinterpreted and misunderstood in our region. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>CONDOLENCES</title><type>Condolences</type><page.no>6845</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Davidson, Mr Gordon Sinclair CBE</title><page.no>6845</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>6845</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is with deep regret that I inform the Senate of the death, on 25 November 2002, of Gordon Sinclair Davidson CBE, a senator for the state of South Australia from 1961 to 1981.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>6845</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Robert (Leader of the Government in the Senate)</name><name role="display">Senator HILL</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Leader of the Government in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate records its deep regret at the death, on 25 November 2002, of Gordon Sinclair Davidson, CBE, a former Liberal Party senator for South Australia, and places on record its appreciation of his meritorious public service and tenders its profound sympathy to his family in their bereavement.</para></motion><para>Gordon Sinclair Davidson was born on 17 January 1915 at Adelaide in South Australia. He was from a farming family in the Strathalbyn area and his early working life was on the family farm, as a farmer and grazier. At a reasonably early age, he became interested in politics and he was elected to and served on the Strathalbyn district council from 1942 to 1950. That fostered further interest in politics and he first came to the Senate in September 1961, filling a vacancy for a three-month period. He came to the Senate again in February 1962 for a period of five months. He was elected as a senator in his own right in 1964, and served from 1965 until 30 June 1981.</para><para>In his first speech, former Senator Davidson spoke of water as being the lifeblood of any country, and of the need for water storage facilities and water management practices, particularly in relation to the River Murray in South Australia. Presumably, his interest in these issues would have resulted from his experience on the land not far from the River Murray. He served on several parliamentary delegations and committees in this place, and one of them particularly related to water matters: he was chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution, whose inquiry was largely responsible for the introduction of a range of water management programs. I am not sure whether it was that committee or another committee which he also chaired that recommended a water commission for Australia, which, as I understand it, would have given the Commonwealth greater powers over management of waters such as the River Murray. Some of us think that there may still be a worthwhile case for that position, many years after it was suggested by the late Gordon Davidson.</para><para>He was vitally interested in education matters and he also served as chairman of the Education, Science and the Arts Committee of this place. In particular, he examined the need for a multicultural and multilingual broadcasting service. His role on many committees earned him the reputation of being one of the pioneers and one of the champions of the Senate committee system. He served as a Temporary Chairman of Committees and was an active member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. In addition to his parliamentary work, he served as president of the South Australian Royal Flying Doctor Service from 1965 to 1967. He was an active member and in fact a leader of the Freemasons in our state. </para><para>In his valedictory speech he referred to the motto of the Davidson clan, which when translated is `wisely if sincerely'. I think that very much reflects the way in which he carried out his functions as a senator for South Australia. In January 1981 he was appointed Commander of the Order of the British Empire, for service to the parliament. Other matters that affected him greatly during his life included his Scottish heritage, to which he was totally committedâone could see it in his costume as he stood at the airport for his planes to Canberra. Another matter that affected him greatly was his Christian faith. He was a committed Presbyterianâin fact a leader of the lay church in South Australia. For many yearsâas I learned from his funeral last Fridayâhe had a radio program, known as <inline font-style="italic">Presbyterian Corner</inline>, which he used to educate and inform the South Australian community on Presbyterian matters. I mentioned his very deep commitment to his lodge and, as has been demonstrated by his public career, his commitment to the parliament through 20 years in this place. He was a member of the council of the National Library of Australia, which I think further demonstrates his commitment to education and to public information. He was also a member of the committee for South Australian libraries.</para><para>I took his place in the Senate, so I guess that in that way we had a special relationship and I have a special responsibility. He was a gentle, well spoken, elegant man. He gave a lifetime to public service and the community. He is survived by his widow, Patricia, to whom he was married for some 50 years. On behalf of the government I therefore wish to extend to Patricia and his other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>6846</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of opposition senators, I wish to support the condolence motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate. The opposition expresses its deep regret at the death of Gordon Sinclair Davidson, CBE, a Liberal senator from South Australia who served parliament from 1961 until 1981. Originally a farmer and grazier, Gordon Davidson also spent his life in public service in one form or another. He was, by all accounts, a devout man, and was a senior member of the Presbyterian Church in South Australia for many years. For 61 years, he was a member of the Grand Lodge of Freemasons, and he served in the late 1980s as a Deputy Grand Master. His political career, like those of so many here, began with local government. From 1942 until 1950 he was a councillor on the Strathalbyn district council and was an office holder of the then Liberal and Country League. In the 1960s, he was president of the South Australian Council for the Royal Flying Doctor Service, and he was for 20 years a senator.</para></talk.start><para>He was a busy committee man and he chaired the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution from 1968 to 1970. His first speech was mainly about water and population pressures along the Murray River system. It is an interesting snapshot of the dilemmas of the times, which continue to be pressing on governments of all persuasions today. In the 1970s he campaigned against changing the National Anthem and what he felt was the corrosive effect of television on children. He was made a CBE in the 1981 New Year's honours list. After leaving parliament he served on several distinguished committees, including the South Australian Libraries Board, the National Library of Australia, the Adelaide University Council and the national board of the Australian Inland Mission. Gordon Davidson gave service to his community all his life. South Australians in particular should remember his work. On behalf of the opposition in the Senate, we offer our most sincere condolences to his family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>6847</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to speak briefly on behalf of the Australian Democrats to associate ourselves with the condolence motion. As has been noted, former senator Gordon Davidson had 20 years in this chamberâor, to be more precise, the chamber in the old Parliament House, down the hillâwhich is a fairly long stretch of time, as those few who have been here for 20 years or a bit longer would certainly concur with. That in itself, I think, is a sign of the contribution and the distinction that he brought to the chamber. The 1981 election, when he departed, was the first time a Democrat from South Australia was elected, with Janine Haines coming into the new Senate in the second half of 1981. So, in that sense, while he was directly replaced by Senator Hill, his departure from the Senate linked in with the Democrats first getting an elected seat from South Australia in the Senateâalthough Janine Haines did serve here briefly at the end of 1977, filling a casual vacancy for six months. </para></talk.start><para>It is worth noting in passing a couple of the comments from the valedictory speech that he gave on 12 June 1981. Some things stand out from that brief contribution at that time. He noted that his first speech back in September 1961 was all about Murray River water. From the context of his remarks, it sounds as though it was a topic that he returned to quite frequently. It would be interesting to hear what his views were these days on Murray River water, but it is obviously a topic that was important to him over 40 years ago and it is one that is occupying a lot of people's minds these days as well. It shows how some issues continue to need addressing.</para><para>In his final speech he also gave counsel to the Senate, in words that seem quite prescient, about the Senate committee system. At that stage it was somewhat in its infancy in terms of the way it was structured and the way it operated. He gave counsel to the Senate to look after the Senate committee system because, as he said:</para><quote><para>I believe that system is going to be one of the greatest strengths of this important house of parliament.</para></quote><para>I think his comments there have clearly been shown to be correct: 20 years down the track, it is clear that the Senate committee system has been and continues to be one of the great strengths of this house of parliament. In that sense, consciously or otherwise, it appears that the Senate has followed the counsel of former Senator Davidson.</para><para>According to his own words, his Davidson family motto is `Wisely if sincerely'. It is in Latin, but I do not even attempt to pronounce Latin these days. But the interpretation is `Wisely if sincerely'. Without knowing the man personally, I think that if any of us can leave this chamber feeling that we have acted wisely and sincerely then we have done very well. The Democrats also support this condolence motion. We pay tribute to the life of former Senator Davidson and in particular to his 20 years work in the Senate. We pass on and associate ourselves with the condolences to his family.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>6847</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âGordon Davidson left in 1981 and I came here in 1983, and so I never had the good fortune to meet the former Senator Davidson. But today gives me the opportunity to join with Senator Hill, the Leader of the Government in the Senate, who is moving this condolence motion. He is moving it for someone he replaced, which is a unique situation. I am one of the few that have done 20 years in the SenateâI think Senator Hill and a few others around here have done 20 years; my 20 years comes up in Marchâand it is a long time. It was a long time for Gordon Davidson to have given to South Australia. He spent more time than that in local government, which is the breeding ground for federal government. He would have spent much of his time serving the people there too. He was awarded a CBE for his work for both federal and local government. I say to his family that we join with them in their sorrow. I support the motion of condolence that Senator Hill has moved.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>6847</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI should like to associate myself with the condolence motion which has been moved by the government and supported by the opposition, the Democrats and the National Party. I was here for about six or seven years with Gordon Davidson. I always found him to have quite strong views, but they were always moderately expressed. They were certainly purposeful views. He got his point across very well on many occasions in a quiet way. </para></talk.start><para>I would not say that he used committees; he was a servant of this chamber and realised the importance of the select committees, general purpose committees and legislative committees of this chamber and the important use that they had in gleaning views from the public on particular issues. He was a learned person. He was very keen on serving the particular cause of literacy. He was a member, as was said, of the Parliamentary Libraryâand, from recollection, I was also a member for a couple of those years. Besides being a devoted member of the Parliamentary Library, he became a member and later deputy chairman of the Council of the National Library.</para><para>He had a commitment to literacy. He served on a Senate select committee on literacy. He was interested in the effect of TV in relation to the learning difficulties of children. From recollection, another committee of which he was the chair dealt with that matter and came forward with a report. One of those committees tried to make sure that TV companies did not have children's programs, including cartoons et cetera, on early in the morning: he felt, as did the committee, that this distracted the attention of the young ones from being focused on other things, such as literacy and learning, which they could not get from the TV. That committee was also concerned about the time that children spent watching TV, including murder mystery programs, soapies and all the rest of it. These were concerns even at that particular time, and they still are.</para><para>He was a member of the Commonwealth Parliamentary Association. He was very clear about what happened along the way and the British traditions. He did not go overboard, but he was against the need to foist a new national anthem on the public of Australia. As has been said, he had a great interest in the issue of water resources. I think it is very worth while to end with a quote and to see whether it was any different then from now. This is a quote from his maiden speech on 19 October 1961. We are talking about 41 years ago, I thinkâmy numeracy is not too good! He said:</para><quote><para>If there is one dominant characteristic that underlines the development of the history of any country and particularly our own, it is this element of a struggle to develop, a struggle to create, a struggle to give leadership. This element of struggle in our own history has found expression and exerted its influence in many ways throughout the years. We find it at the beginning in our communications and transport systems. We find it in our industrial development from time to time and, because of our situation, we find it in our relations with other nations. But the basic struggle of all of these and of our life generally is associated with the life blood of any country, and particularly of ours. I am referring, of course, to water.</para></quote><para>Gordon was a member of the PCF, the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship. At one stage, he was also the administrator of the South Australian Presbyterian Church. I wish to convey my sympathies to his family and particularly to his wife, Patricia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>6848</page.no><name role="metadata">Reid, Sen Margaret</name><name role="display">Senator REID</name><name.id>VI4</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to join in supporting the motion put to the Senate by Senator Hill to mark the passing of Gordon Sinclair Davidson. I knew him well. I knew him first when I was a Young Liberal in South Australia and he was an active member of the Liberal Country League, as was his wife, Pat, who has been referred to. Other than at Liberal activities, I saw her because she had attended the same school as I hadâthe Methodist Ladies College in Adelaideâand throughout her life she remained an active supporter of the school and an active member of the Old Scholars Association. My association at the school, while I was a student and subsequently with Pat, was quite close as well.</para></talk.start><para>It is interesting to reflect upon the lives of Gordon and Patâlives of total service to their community at all times and certainly not just in the 20 years that Gordon was a member of the Senate. It started long before that and it continued after he served in the Senate. Gordon was 87 last January and the whole of his life was devoted to his community. He and Pat did not themselves have children, and they took a great interest in young people. Gordon was, as has been mentioned, very committed to the issue of education, to libraries, to learning. He himself was a learned man and very well read. </para><para>There were very many organisations that Gordon Davidson belonged to. Reference has been made to the fact that he was a farmer at Strathalbyn in South Australia until 1952 and had in that area served on the district council from 1942 to 1950 and was deputy chairman of the Strathalbyn council from 1948 to 1950. Gordon Davidson was educated at Scotch College and throughout his life was an active member of the Presbyterian Church. It was very important to him. He was the organising secretary and administrator of the Presbyterian Church of South Australia from 1952 until 1964 and was editor of the<inline font-style="italic"> SA Presbyterian</inline>.</para><para>Gordon Davidson was a member of the board of the Australian Inland Mission for some years from 1957 and put a great deal of his effort and expertise into the work of that mission. He was on the United Church board from 1959 until 1970. He served on the council of his old school, Scotch College, in Adelaideâas Senator Ferguson, an old scholar of the same school, would knowâ from 1955. Gordon Davidson was on the board of St Andrew's Presbyterian Hospital from 1953 until 1971. I think mention has been made that he was on the South Australian council of the Royal Flying Doctor Service from 1958 to 1970 and was president from 1965 to 1967. He was the foundation chairman of the Dunbar Presbyterian Homes for the Aged. All of these tasks he really committed himself to and was active on. These were not things he did just to have them on his CV so that it looked good. After Gordon Davidson left the Senate, he was very pleased to be able to attend the Second Assembly of the World Council of Churches that took place in Evanston in the United States of America in 1954. Gordon Davidson had a very full life throughout the whole of his 87 years.</para><para>Mention has been made of Gordon Davidson's committee service in the Senate. Talking about his Senate career, let us go back a bit. He first stood on a Senate ticket in 1958, but he was No. 3 on the ticket at that time and it did not quite get him there. He must have had doubts at times as to whether he would ever have a parliamentary career, having not been successful in 1958. In 1961, he was appointed to replace and serve the balance of the term of Senator Pearson, who had died. He then was selected to serve the balance of the term of Senator Buttfield when she retired from the Senate. He finally was elected in his own right in 1964 and took his place here, from that election, on 1 July 1965 and then was re-elected in 1970, 1974 and 1975, retiring on 30 June 1981.</para><para>As I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, I knew Gordon Davidson when I was a Young Liberal. He was extremely supportive of all of the young people in the party who were participating during that time. Nothing was ever too much trouble: he would attend Young Liberal meetings, talk to people and advise. Certainly I knew him well during those years. In 1961, I was the Liberal candidate for Bonython in South Australia. He was extremely helpful to, and supportive of, me in that campaign, and I learnt a great deal. Gordon Davidson was very much a grassroots politician. He knew where the votes came from, and he knew that one managed to get votes by relating to people and by being concerned about the interests of those who were voting. I certainly enjoyed campaigning with him during that election.</para><para>I want to refer to Gordon Davidson's committee service. He was very committed to the role of the Senateâhe spoke of that, on occasionsâand had a very strong feeling for the concept of a second chamber and the role that it could play. His commitment to committee service was with a view to actually achieving something. As he had put it to me, it was a question of committees working together to find those things on which there was a common interest between those on the committee and to at least achieve that much. He did not have much time for the concept of extremes finishing up with dissenting reports that really achieved nothing at all out of the process. His view was that the basis should be committees working together to achieve something for the electorate. That is what I came to the Senate believing, from the way that he had spoken to me about committee service, in which he believed. He did chair committees. He was involved with the education committee for a long time, and Senator Hill referred to his being chairman of the Senator Select Committee on Water Pollution from 1968 to 1970. </para><para>Others have referred to Gordon Davidson's maiden speech, and it is interesting to read it, especially at a time like this, when the country is covered with drought to the extent that it is, when the River Murray's mouth has been blocked recently and has had to be artificially opened for water to flow through. His speech referred to the Chowilla dam project in South Australia and the role of the Murrumbidgee. It bears re-reading at this time in these circumstances. Going on a fraction from the part that Senator Harradine read outâand others have referred to other parts of the speech that he gaveâthe speech read:</para><quote><para>Water is always topical, water is always urgent, and its provision, its storage, and its distribution are very much matters of moment and very much matters of struggle.</para></quote><para>It continues:</para><quote><para>... if there is any one factor that has limited our development or limited us in any way, it is this position regarding water.</para></quote><para>Others have referred to other parts of the speech that he gave. When I was elected to the Senate by a joint sitting of the Senate on 5 May 1981 there were no other South Australian senators to escort me to my place. That was done by Gordon Davidson, who was to retire from the Senate some seven weeks later, and by former Senator Peter Sim from Western Australia, whom I had also known for a long time through the Young Liberal movement. They were the two who escorted me to my seat at the back on the government side of the chamber in the old building, where I then sat for some time with John Martyr from Western Australia on one side of me and David MacGibbon on the other side. Every time I came into the chamber I would push the seat forward so that I could reach my desk and when they came in they would put their feet on the board underneath and push it back so that they were comfortable. But I learnt a bit from them as well.</para><para>Certainly for me it was a great privilege and a pleasure to be, if only for a short time, serving in the same chamber as a man of the integrity of Gordon Davidson. He was very committed, as has been mentioned, to the Parliamentary Library. He served on the Library Committee for, I think, the whole of his term in the Senate, and after that time he continued his involvement in that area through roles with the National Library and the South Australian Libraries Board.</para><para>After John Knight died in early 1981 there was of course a gap before a replacement could be appointed. I know that Gordon Davidson liaised with and contacted staff who were still maintaining former Senator Knight's office and was unobtrusively helpful to them with the things that still needed to be done. He was always available to talk about any issues that might be helpful. He was that sort of person. If something needed to be done, he would do it. He certainly was a gentleman. Someone used the word `elegant', and I think that is right. There were times when he wore his flamboyant Scottish bow ties and looked extremely elegant doing that. He was friendly to those around him. He did have firm views, as Senator Harradine has mentioned, but never pushed them at people. He worked towards achieving the things that he believed in. He was an outstanding senator, and as a senator on the back bench he fulfilled the role of the Senate relating to the community in representing his community. I join with other senators in expressing my condolencesâand those of my husband, Tomâto Pat and other members of the family and their friends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:09:00</time.stamp><page.no>6850</page.no><name role="metadata">Chapman, Sen Grant</name><name role="display">Senator CHAPMAN</name><name.id>FF4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is also my privilege to join in this motion of condolence for the late former senator Gordon Davidson CBE, who died last Monday aged nearly 88. I had the privilege of undertaking some part-time research projects for former Senator Davidson during 1975, in the months prior to my own election to the House of Representatives as the member for Kingston as a result of the December 1975 election. After that, of course, we became parliamentary colleagues until former Senator Davidson's retirement in June 1981. While I came to know him much better during that particular period, I had already known him for some years prior to that through our mutual involvement in the Liberal Party and in his role as a senator. Indeed, he and his wife, Pat, were well known to my parents through their mutual interest in farming and church related activities, as well as through the Liberal Party and through being residents of Glenelg. </para></talk.start><para>It would be accurate to characterise former Senator Davidson's life as one of continuous community service. That has already been alluded to by Senator Reid, Senator Hill and other speakers today. I think that encapsulates former Senator Davidson's life: continuous community service. From 1942 to 1950 he was a councillor on the Strathalbyn District CouncilâStrathalbyn being the area in which he farmedâand from 1948 to 1950 he was deputy chairman of that council. From 1952 to 1964 he was Organising Secretary of the Presbyterian Church in South Australia, a full-time position with the Presbyterian Church. This involved extensive work right around the state on behalf of the church and was a keen expression of Gordon's Christian faith. Of course, it was from there that he was elected for a 16-year period as a senator in 1964, taking his seat in July 1965. It is significant, as I mentioned, having already been Organising Secretary of the Presbyterian Church, that he was one of the founders of the Parliamentary Christian Fellowship, which was established in the parliament in, I think, 1966. </para><para>Before becoming a long-term senator in 1965, he had already served 2Â½ months in the Senate, having been appointed to replace the late Senator Rex Pearson in September 1961 but defeated at the December 1961 general election under the earlier different rules for Senate replacements at that time. He served in the Senate againâthis time for five months, from February to June 1962â replacing former Senator Nancy Buttfield. Senator Reid mentioned that perhaps Gordon wondered whether he might ever have a long-term parliamentary career. I recall when I was a member of the Liberal Senate team for the 1974 double dissolution electionâ and I was No. 6 in a team of six at the time when the Liberal Party was expecting to win four or five of the seatsâGordon relating this earlier experience he had as a senator for a few months at a time and saying that it did not hurt to be first reserve in the early days; it could always lead to better things. And it certainly didâthose few months of service for Gordon eventually led to, as I have said, 16 years of service, from 1965 to 1981.</para><para>During that long period he gave extended service as Chairman of the Senate Committee on Education, Science and the Arts. Over that time, the committee tabled a number of significant reports on education issues. They have been referred to by other speakers today. Certainly, education was a major priority for Gordon Davidson in his service in the Senate. He was also especially notable in his role as Chairman of the Senate Select Committee on Water Pollution, in the late 1960s.</para><para>As I said, Gordon's life can be characterised as one of community service. His retirement from the Senate in 1981 did not mean that he retired from community service. He served on the South Australian Libraries Board standing committee from 1984 to 1989 and on the Council of the National Library as well, again reinforcing the interest that he had in education and the spread of knowledge through the facilities that libraries can offer. He also served until 1988 on the Council of Scotch College, as well as being involved with other community organisations through the late 1980s and into the 1990s.</para><para>It has been my pleasure to have been able to maintain my friendship with the late Gordon Davidson and his wife, Pat, in the years following his retirement from the Senate. I have seen them both regularly at community functionsânotably the annual Carl Linger Memorial Australia Day service, with which he maintained a close association over the yearsâand also at Liberal Party events, and here in Canberra when he regularly attended the retired members association functions. It has been said that Gordon was a gentle man, but he was also a powerful orator who commanded the attention of his audience. As a resident of the Kingston electorate, he was of great assistance to me in my campaigns as a candidate and subsequently member for Kingston in the late 1970s and early 1980s. I certainly appreciated his support in those days. He was a kindly and courteous man with whom it has been a privilege to share a friendship. I therefore offer my condolences to his wife, Pat, with whom he shared 50 years and who was a wonderful supporter for him in his parliamentary and other community activities. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>6852</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to associate myself with the condolence motion that was moved by Senator Hill in relation to the late former senator Gordon Davidson. Gordon Davidson had three great loves in life: his church, his party and his community in South Australia. My father had a close association with the late Gordon Davidson, particularly through the church and the party. My father was a member of the state parliament during much of the period that Gordon Davidson was a senator. My earliest recollection of Gordon Davidson is listening to the radio on a Sunday afternoon. When Gordon Davidson was Organising Secretary of the Presbyterian Church he had a five-minute spot on the radio. Unknown to him, he had a voice that very closely resembled a well-known race caller of the day, and I can tell you that Gordon got more into his five minutes on the radio than any race caller ever got into a race because, being of Scottish heritage, I think he wanted to make sure he got his money's worth, even though he was getting it for free. That was my earliest recollectionâevery Sunday afternoon listening to this beautiful voice of Gordon Davidson, who was a very good orator, speaking on the radio.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Davidson, as he later became, was very proud of his Scottish heritage. Those that have known him over the years will remember that, because Senator Reid has referred to his tartan bow ties and tartan waistcoats. And he had this longstanding interest in Scotch College, particularly because of its relationship with the Presbyterian Church. Senator Hill and I attended Scotch Collegeâ not at the same time as Senator Davidson, of courseâand my father was there prior to his time. So he had all of his loves joined together in one main cause that he could serve on and work in for most of his working life.</para><para>You need only to read the biographical registers to know that his interests were widespread. As Senator Chapman and others have said, his whole life was devoted to community service in South Australia, whether it be as a member of parliament, as part of his church organisation or as representing the interests of various groups in South Australia, like the Royal Flying Doctor Service, the St. Andrews Presbyterian Hospital and all of these other things to which he willingly and voluntarily gave his time to serve the interests of his fellow man. It is with regret that we note the passing of former Senator Davidson, but those of us who knew him and those that were affected by his life will always remember the enormous contribution that he made to South Australians, to our Liberal Party in South Australia and to the Senate.</para><para>There are many who claim to have been Young Liberals when they first met Gordon Davidson. I was not a Young Liberal when I first met Gordon Davidson, because I joined the senior party when I was 20. I guess I have always been an old Liberal, and a lot of my colleagues would probably say that it shows. With the impact that Senator Davidson had in his 16 years as a backbencher in this parliamentâthe influence he had over the people that worked around him and that he worked withâhe will always be highly regarded by those who understand the processes of the Senate. He was not even content to let it all be in the past when he retired, because he was also a very strong member of the former federal members association. Invariably, when they had their functions here in Canberra, we would see Gordon Davidson and his wife on the plane coming to attend the former federal members functions. He thought it was important to maintain those contacts. He loved the political life. He loved knowing what was happening currently and he also wanted to maintain contact with the many people that he knew. I join with others in offering my sympathy to his wife and family. I am very pleased to have been able to associate myself with the remarks on the passing of former Senator Gordon Davidson.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>6853</page.no><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name><name.id>10000</name.id><electorate>PO</electorate><party>N/A</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI too am privileged to have met the late Gordon Davidson CBE on several occasions.

The order arises from a motion moved by Senator Ludwig, at the request of Senator Conroy, as agreed by the Senate on 19 November 2002. It relates to files held by Treasury and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission. Senator Coonan wishes to inform the Senate that, given the size of the request and the age of the files in question, she is unable to respond by the nominated date of 2 December 2002. I point out to the Senate on behalf of Senator Coonan that the files requested are now over 20 years old and were created by a body that no longer exists. The combination of these factors means that a number of files have had to be retrieved from the Australian Archives. The files relating to the request contain a large number of documents which are still being examined, and Senator Coonan will respond to the order as soon as possible.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>6853</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âby leaveâI respond briefly to the comments by the Minister for the Arts and Sport. I was hoping that we would have something slightly more definitive. I appreciate that the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer is distracted right now, but I was hoping that we would have something slightly more definitive as soon as possible. Senator Kemp, I hope you will pass that on to Senator Coonan. As I said, while I appreciate that she is a little busy, most of the documents that we are talking about have already been prepared and handed to a royal commissioner, so I would have thought that the vast bulk of them could just have been collected back, copied and given to us. But I do acknowledge that she has indicated that she will comply, and I welcome that.</para></talk.start><para>Last sitting week, Senator Hill refused the order of the Senate to produce the final report by TFG International, and my colleague Senator Ludwig spoke passionately at the time reminding the Senate about this government's abysmal record on complying with returns to order. This morning's <inline font-style="italic">Notice Paper</inline> showed 14 orders for the production of documents which remain outstanding and a further 15 orders still current from previous parliaments. You may well shake your head, Senator Kemp, because we are doing much the same thingâshaking our heads. I do not wish to repeat what Senator Ludwig said; I only reiterate the importance of returns to order in enabling the legislature to carry out its function of scrutinising legislation and the performance of the executive. Unfortunately, this government rates accountability very low. It is part of ensuring a strong democracy and effective government, but something which the Howard government obviously does not really care about.</para><para>The Senate order made at my motion goes to the very heart of effective government. It concerns the proper supervision of the insurance industry by the Treasurer, both now and in the past, and seeks the production of certain documents in relation to FAI. The collapse of HIH has been attributed by some to the purchase of FAI by that company. My colleague Mark Latham has referred in the other chamber to the involvement of the Liberal Party's treasurer, Mr Malcolm Turnbull, in that transaction. However, the involvement of significant and powerful Liberal Party members in the fortunes and misfortunes of FAI predates that. The collapse of HIH has caused severe hardship to many people. It is also a factor in the escalation of premiums for public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance which, as all in the chamber know, has affected many other people. The collapse of HIH has had significant consequences, and we must ensure that we understand all of the reasons for the collapse so that this parliament can properly respond to them. The return to order in my name seeks to allow parliament to do this. </para><para>Information available to me indicates that, when the Insurance Act was passed, FAI had significant difficulties in getting approval to hold a licence. In fact, four FAI companies had to appeal the decision of the then Insurance Commissioner in the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. In the end, the AAT approved two of the licences and the Treasurer at the time approved the other two licences. That was not until 1979, some six years after the commencement of the Insurance Act, and the Treasurer then was Mr John Howard. The documents the Senate now seeks will go towards explaining on what basis Mr Howard approved FAI's licences.</para><para>Turning specifically to the order, paragraph (a) refers to:</para><quote><para>... the Treasury files, as described in paragraph 10.1.4 of the report to Messrs Corrs, Chambers Westgarth from John Palmer ... entitled `Review of the role played by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority and the Insurance and Superannuation Commission in the collapse of the HIH group of companies' ...</para></quote><para>Senator Kemp, these files have already been found, sorted and provided to Mr Palmer. It should be easy to provide them to the Senate. I would have hoped, in fact, that that first part could have been provided today. Mr Palmer advised in his recommendations to the royal commission that a full review of these files be made and documented to ensure that there is an accurate record of the circumstances under which the FAI companies were authorised and their condition at the time of authorisation. I think that parliament, and the Senate in particular, is an appropriate place for this to occur.</para><para>Paragraphs (b) and (c) are necessary because the AAT heard the matter of FAI's licensing applications in privateâwhat a surprise!âand a transcript of the decisions was not made available by the AAT. It is possible, but not certain, that a transcript may be available from the National Archives. I take the point Senator Kemp made that some archival material had to be dug out. I appreciate that answer. However, I understand that it will require the approval of the governmentâin this case, the Attorney-General or his departmentâto search those archives. I think Senator Kemp was indicating that that has been givenâI will take it that he was and, if I am wrong, I am happy for Senator Kemp to clarify thatâbut even then it may not be possible to locate the transcript, if there is one. However, if these Senate orders can be complied with and sufficient information provided that step may not be necessary.</para><para>This return to order, like all returns to order, is about ensuring that the processes of government are not being manipulated or used to the advantage of few and the disadvantage of many. It is about accountability to the Australian people and transparency of government dealings. The procedure by which the Senate can order the production of documents is an important one and should be respected by the government. At this point, the government has not shown proper respect for the Senate's orders in relation to a whole range of matters I have already mentioned. I look forward to the minister being able to furnish all of the requested documents by the end of the parliamentary year.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>6854</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>âPetitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Iraq</title><page.no>6854</page.no><no.signed>50</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>5F4</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Calvert</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled.</para><para>We the undersigned in this Petition call on Members of the Senate to support the following.</para><para>1.

The Prime Minister has responded and I think it is appropriate that the Senate take note of that response. It was a pretty straightforward resolution concerning military action against Iraq and was supported, if my memory serves me correctly, by the Labor Party, the Greens and of course the Democrats. It basically outlined in a very straightforward way a request for the Prime Minister to rule out Australia's involvement in a first strike against Iraq or any other country without clear-cut evidence that that country's support for international terrorism, its weapons of mass destruction capability and its threats represent a real and present danger to our collective security. In other words, it was a request for the government to rule out Australia breaching international law. That is pretty straightforward, one would have thought, and yet the Prime Minister refuses to respond to the thrust of the resolution. </para><para>Every time the question is raised, the Prime Minister makes lots of general statements and says: `That's all hypothetical. We haven't been asked yet by the United States or anybody else. Therefore, I'll make a decision when that time comes.' The resolution of the Senate said, `Fine, make a decision when the time comes, but make a statement now that Australia won't support any action that breaches international law.' That is a pretty simple thing but the Prime Minister refuses to do it. Despite what Mr Howard says about considering it at the time et cetera, we know what his response will be at the time any response comes from President Bush. If a call comes from President Bush, Mr Howard will say, `Yes, we support you.' No-one in this country would think otherwise. So a decision about what Australia's response would be, in terms of support, has basically already been made. A decision might not have been made about the type of support, but there is no doubt that this government would support the United States of America if it chose to launch an attack on Iraq, even if it was pre-emptive military action against Iraq without clear-cut evidence that that country's capability represented a real and present danger to our collective security.</para><para>It is a simple thing but the Prime Minister refuses to make a clear statement that we will maintain and stay within international law. He also leaves us in the situation where how we act as a nation, in terms of supporting such an attack against Iraq, is dependent on a decision made by the leader of another country.

I am being distracted terribly by the three-way interjections surrounding me. The point at hand is that the Senate made a simple resolution calling on the Prime Minister to rule out Australia's involvement in any pre-emptive military action. That is the view of the Senate. The Prime Minister, by way of response, did not even say that he disagreed; he just ignored the resolution altogether and continues to avoid the question. I think it is the issue of avoiding the question that is really the problem. If the Prime Minister wants to make a case as to why Australia should support or leave open the option of supporting pre-emptive military action then he should do so. He should not just keep dodging it and saying, `Well, we haven't been asked yet. We'll decide that at the time,' and all those sorts of things. Everybody in the country knows that. You have only to look at the thousands upon thousands of people in the streets of capital cities around Australia over the weekend to see the level of public concern about this issue and the level of apprehension about where we are going to be ledâor where the Prime Minister is going to allow us to be led, which is even worse. Let him make the case. Let him show some leadership, but not just sit back, dodge the question and leave the future direction of our country to be determined by the leader of another nation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>The Democrats are not an anti-US party; we are a pro-Australian party. We believe we should be making our own decisions in our own national interest rather than subjecting ourselves to a situation where the direction of crucial foreign policy decisions will be determined by leaders of other countries. So it is a disappointing response from the Prime Minister. It does not go to the thrust of the resolution of the Senate. I think it is worth noting that there is a very real prospect that, by the time the Senate finishes sitting at the end of next week, our nation may well be at war. Our Prime Minister may well support our nation's involvement in war before we return.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>EP5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator Ferguson</name></talker><para>âYou're a scaremonger.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>DT6</name.id><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name></talker><para>âAgain, all you get are shallow interjections from the government saying, `You're a scaremonger.' There is a pretty real prospect of war out there. If Senator Ferguson is not aware that there is a prospect that we might be going to war, I think there are plenty of other people who are. That is why they are marching in the streets. That is why they want to make their voices heard in the same way that the Senate made its voice heard with this resolution. I think it is very disappointing that the Prime Minister has chosen not to respond to the heart of the resolution but to continue to dodge the question. Let us at least get a position clearly out in the open so the Australian public can be informed and so we can have a more informed debate rather than the toing-and-froing, the dodging and weaving and the backwarding-and-forwarding that we have from the Prime Minister and his foreign affairs minister.</para></talk.start></continue><para>We have had the Prime Minister not only ignoring this resolution of the Senate but over the weekend suggesting we actually need to expand the definition of self-defence under the UN charter. I do not think there is any clearer indication that the Prime Minister knows that the existing definition of self-defence under the UN charter would not justify an attack against Iraq. That is why he wants to argue the case that the definition needs to be changed. This is a classic case of trying to change the rules after you have already made your decisionâthat is the Prime Minister's approach to this. It is very disappointing that he has chosen not to respond to the substance of the Senate's resolution on what is quite clearly one of the most fundamental questions facing the Australian people and the Australian parliament at this point in time.</para><para>We do welcome the Prime Minister's commitment over the weekend to have a parliamentary debate on this issue. But, again, we say that that debate should happen before a decision is made; we should not be asked to ratify a decision after it has been made. We also repeat our call that any vote on Australian involvement in a war on Iraq must be a conscience vote. Today we have already had the quite positive experience of witnessing a conscience debate and vote on stem cell research and the like. I do not have a problem with that; it is obviously an important moral issue for many people. But I do not think you get many moral issues bigger than going to war or having one's nation support a war. Certainly, there should also be a conscience vote in relation to any issue concerning military engagement in Iraq.</para><para>The Democrats will continue to try and get further examination of this issue in the parliament. We will try and pressure the government to take a stronger stand and show some leadership rather than just try to keep its head down and sneak Australia into war by default. We will continue to apply pressure in that regard, and I welcome others in the Senate who are also continuing to work to get this issue properly addressed by the government.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>6862</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI endorse what Senator Bartlett has said on this matter and congratulate the Democrats for giving the Senate the opportunity to resolve that the Prime Minister should be contacted. I find the Prime Minister's response lacking in a couple of particulars and I want to talk about those points. The first issue is the Prime Minister's failure to commit himself to the democratic process. Without any real precedent in this country, the executive has developed a tendency to believe that the parliament is a subsidiary when in fact it is the other way aroundâthe people elect the parliament and not the executive. </para></talk.start><para>As Senator Bartlett has pointed out, we have had the Prime Minister reiterate over the weekend that he will determine when and if Australians are sent to Iraq at the behest of the Bush administration in the coming weeks or months. This is totally against the democratic principle that this parliament, and every member of it, is elected to deal with the important matters that confront this country. In the United States, the Congress has already debated this matter. What is more, it was done on the basis of informed debate. There were committee hearings, and then an informed parliamentary debate before Congress gave the President the authority. We have had no such process in this parliament. In fact, the first effort by the Greens to get a committee hearing into the potential destruction of Australia's interestsâlet alone those of Iraqi civilians, should there be an invasion of Iraqâwent without support from any other component of the Senate.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Kemp, Sen Rod</name><name role="display">Senator Kemp</name></talker><para>âYou never come to committee hearings.

Power is invested in this parliament and it is quite arrogant and antidemocratic for the Prime Minister to assume for himself the power to involve Australians in a war before a debate has occurred and a vote has been taken in this parliament. Certainly, the Prime Minister is going to respond to President Bush much more clearly, quickly and directly than he will respond to public feeling in this country, should the eventualities of war become reality. The problem is that we are moving inexorably towards an invasion of Baghdad. Behind that invasion is a wish by United States corporations and the United States administration to get control of the Iraqi oil resources in an age when oil is an ultimate currency for the economic wellbeing of the United States in particular but the West in general.</para></talk.start></continue><para>This is a very dangerous road for Australia to be following the United States along. I point out that both ASIO and the CIA have warned that an attack on Iraq could well lead to increased terrorist activities against those who are involved in it. It is not some fanciful concern coming from people who are worried about standing up for the nation's interests; this is real information which has been presented to us as representatives and to governments in both Canberra and Washington and which ought to be taken note of. While I reiterate, because it is necessary to do so every time, what a brute Saddam Hussein is, I note that the Prime Minister has disagreed with those who say that Saddam Hussein is not directly connected with S11 or the Bali bombings through the al-Qaeda chain or whatever.</para><para>Nevertheless, this inexorable road to an invasion of Baghdad, with huge consequencesâdeath and destructionâwithin and outside Iraq, is being undertaken by the Bush administration. They put maximum pressure on the United Nations, after Colin Powell explained to the President of the United States that the ramifications would be far more serious were the trajectory taken in the lead-up to an attack on Baghdad not to follow the United Nations path. Now that process has been undertaken, and the United States, with Britain andâalthough the pressure is much lessâthe Australian administration have put pressure to get the United Nations to sanction a resolution which effectively allows the United States to engage in an attack on Baghdad, whether or not the rest of the world wants it. We have this extraordinary persistence from President Bush and his advisers that, even if the United Nations countermands an attack on Baghdad, if it is in the United States' interest then they will do it. I tell you what: our Prime Minister will follow suit, because his interest, as he sees it, is with the Bush administration. But I follow Senator Bartlett in saying that is not necessarily at all in the interests of the Australian people, Australia's future, Australia's wellbeing or even the economy of this country.</para><para>I point out again that Nepal is currently undergoing an extreme period of terrorism with the Maoist uprising there, and the United States has done nothing except tell American citizens to leave, further damaging the Nepalese economy. This is because the Nepalese have made this great error: they do not have oil. So they are off the agenda. Nepal is a country terrorised. I was in Katmandu some months ago, and people there are talking about Katmandu becoming the next Phnom Penh under Pol Pot. But the world is turning its back on thatâand it must not, because that would mean duplicity and hypocrisy in the way in which the word `terrorism' is used and the genuineness with which President Bush and, indeed, Prime Minister Howard say that we must tackle terrorism wherever it arises. Nepal is a friendly country to Australia. It has huge problems; it is one of the poorest countries on earth. Many Australians love the placeâ there are Australians there nowâbut we are doing next to nothing. I challenge any government member to get up and say what we are doing to assuage this terror stalking the lives of some 20 million Nepalese. </para><para>Finally, I want to talk about the pre-emptive strike business. On the weekend, Prime Minister Howard endorsed an earlier statement from Defence Minister Hill that Australia reserves the right to a pre-emptive strike on another country in the event that it sees there may be an attack by terrorists from that country. This was an unguarded, injudicious and damaging statement from the Prime Minister. The Prime Minister normally goes right out of his way to dismiss hypothetical questions put to him by senior journalists. On this occasion he engaged. He took the question up, and he did not give the necessary precautions as he thought aloud about an area of potential Australian engagement which should never be discussed by the head of state of this country. The Prime Minister made a mistake; the Prime Minister made a gaffe. The Prime Minister's statement seriously damages this country insofar as its relationships with the neighbourhood are concerned, and he should withdraw it.</para><para>Prime Minister Howard is experienced enough in state affairs to know what the damage of leaving that statement hanging in the air, not properly qualified, will be as we go down the line in coming months and years in seriously fraught situations of international tension. He has to be big enough, on behalf of this nation, to withdraw that statement. The explanations given by the foreign minister today compounded the problem. The foreign minister cannot explain away the statement the Prime Minister made yesterday. It is up to Prime Minister Howard to withdraw that statement in the interests of this country, to show that he has the statesmanlike capability to put his country first, not his own political interests. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed

an oral presentation, by way of a report, entitled <inline font-style="italic">Review of Australia's preparedness to manage the consequences of a terrorist attack</inline>. I am pleased to announce that the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade will be conducting a series of public hearings on Australia's preparedness to manage the consequences of a terrorist attack in Australia. The hearings will allow the committee to report to parliament on the state of Australia's preparedness to manage the consequences of a terrorist attack. The hearings are part of the committee's ongoing watching brief on Australia's involvement in the war on terrorism and on related actions in response to terrorism. </para></talk.start><para>The watching brief, which commenced in May 2002, has involved regular private briefings from diplomatic representatives, government officials, defence force personnel and other experts in the field of counter-terrorism. We have, for example, met with the United States Ambassador, His Excellency Mr Thomas Schieffer; Denis Richardson, the Director-General of ASIO; Hugh White, from the Australian Strategic Policy Institute; Clive Williams, the Director of Terrorism Studies at the Australian National University; senior officials in the Australian Defence Force; aviation security experts; and officials from the Protective Security Coordination Centre, the Commonwealth agency responsible for coordinating the national counter-terrorism arrangements and programs. Some members of the committee have also travelled to Kuwait, the Persian Gulf, Kyrgyzstan and Afghanistan to visit the defence forces deployed to the international coalition against terrorism. The report of this visit was tabled in parliament on 21 October. </para><para>To date the focus of our watching brief has been to develop an understanding of the nature and extent of Australia's current commitment to the international coalition against terrorism; the nature of the terrorist threat at home and abroad; and the measures in place, domestically and internationally, to counter the threat of terrorism. When we began these briefings we viewed them from the perspective of a world changed by the terrorist attacks in America on 11 September 2001. The bombings in Bali on 12 October 2002 have tragically demonstrated that the threat of terrorism is always present.</para><para>Most of our briefings have focused on identifying terrorist threats and discussing some of the preventative measures that have been put in place. Of necessity these briefings have been conducted in private session. While we have learned much about the work of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies and our defence forces, we have taken the view that public disclosure of some of this information would affect the government's capacity to protect Australian citizens and their interests. The briefings have nevertheless been valuable, allowing the senators and members on the committee to develop a better understanding of these issues, to make informed contributions to parliamentary and community debate, and to oversee more effectively the government's counter-terrorism policy responses. Our briefings have highlighted the importance of maintaining a multifaceted counter-terrorism strategy involving close domestic and international cooperation to detect, apprehend and prosecute terrorists, and to degrade and destroy terrorist organisations and structures. </para><para>Identification and prevention of the threat is clearly important and is likely to remain a focus of government attention. But it is equally important to acknowledge that, no matter how sophisticated and well connected our intelligence and law enforcement operations, prudent planning must assume that further terrorist attacks will occur. While we must continue to do all we can to prevent an attack, we must also do all we can to prepare for the consequences of such an attack. It is this end of the spectrumâthe capacity of our governments to successfully respond to a terrorist incidentâwhich will be the focus of our new program of public hearings.</para><para>The hearings are scheduled to begin in Canberra on Monday, 9 December with a focus on the role of the Commonwealth government and its agencies in coordinating the immediate response to, and managing the consequences of, a terrorist attack. We will seek evidence from the Protective Security Coordination Centre, Emergency Management Australia, the Australian Federal Police, the Australian Defence Force and a number of non-government experts. We will then travel to a number of states and territories to hear from local coordinators of the national counter-terrorism strategy, police and emergency service agencies, health service providers and state based representatives of key Commonwealth agencies.</para><para>Key issues for us will be: the response and management capabilities in each jurisdiction; the capabilities that can be provided at short notice to supplement local resources; and the nature and likely effectiveness of the mechanisms in place to ensure a swift and well-coordinated response. Our aim is to critically examine the state of our preparedness to respond to a terrorist attack, hopefully providing a measure of confidence to the community that appropriate arrangements are in place or, if they are not, making recommendations aimed at correcting any identified shortcomings.</para><para>It is likely that we will report to the parliament in the 2003 budget sittings. We will consider at this time whether to conduct any further public hearings on other aspects of Australia's involvement in the war on terrorism. This is an important series of events, and I look forward to the active support and cooperation of all relevant authorities.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>ASIO, ASIS and DSD Committee: Joint</title><page.no>6866</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>6866</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>6866</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Sandy</name><name role="display">Senator SANDY MACDONALD</name><name.id>CX5</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD, I present the annual report of the committee for 2001-02.

The report, which has been authorised for publication by all three portfolio ministers, includes a review of the expenditure and aspects of administration of the three agencies for the period 2001-02, and a summary of the committee's activities in its first four months of operation. </para><para>Tabling of this report is an important step forward for the committee and the process of legislative oversight of the intelligence services of Australia. It marks the first time that the administration and expenditure of the three agencies have been subjected to comprehensive review by the Australian parliament. It is also the first time that a committee dealing with intelligence matters has been required to report to the legislature on its own activities. Both are reasonably modest steps but they are important milestones. </para><para>In preparing the report, the committee considered detailed submissions from each of the agencies on their administration and expenditure. It also held a full day's hearing, in camera, at which agencies were cross-examined on evidence provided to the committee, and it conducted a number of informal briefings with the agencies, with the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and with the Australian National Audit Office. </para><para>The annual report reflects the committee's satisfaction that information on each agency's expenditure is transparent and that the budgetary positions of the three agencies for the current financial year appear sound. Additional appropriations for each of the agencies under the 2002-03 federal budget have been earmarked by the government for new programs and should enhance operational capability within the Australian intelligence community. </para><para>The report includes two recommendations, which are aimed at improving external oversight of the agencies: firstly, the establishment of an efficiency adviser position within the office of the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security to enhance his capacity to assess use of resources by the agencies; and, secondly, arrangements to enable DSD to provide separate, audited financial statements for review by the committee. Presently, they are embedded within those of the Department of Defence. </para><para>The report also contains a useful summary of the committee's activities to June 2002. These include the committee's intensive inquiry into and report on the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>, and participation by members in the International Intelligence Review Agencies Conference in London in May this year. </para><para>As the report makes clear, these are still early days for the committee and the process of agency review. Future reports will see refinements to the committee's methods and scope of investigation. The committee has already identified a number of areas for further work, such as: recruitment, training and retention of agency staff; the adequacy of contracting arrangements; and the implementation of internal audit and risk management strategies. Of course, the committee also has powers to request separate terms of review, which it may choose to pursue in the coming 12 months.</para><para>In conclusion, I would like to thank the other members of the committee, including: the presiding officer, the Hon. David Jull; my colleague Senator Alan Ferguson; Senator Robert Ray; the Hon. Leo McLeay; the Hon. Kim Beazley; and Mr Stewart McArthur. All of them show considerable interest in and commitment to the work of the committee. I would also like to thank the staff of the committee, who are particularly active and interested in the work that we do.</para><para>As I mentioned in my opening remarks, this is a new committee. It is developing its role at a time of heightened international and national interest in security and counter-terrorism. I think I share the view of every member of the committee when I say that we feel extremely privilegedâif that is the right wordâto be playing a part in protecting Australia and our citizens from the challenges of the present international environment. In time, the committee will play an increasing role in that task, but I think the Senate will see from the report as tabled that a very good start has been made. I commend the report to the Senate.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Fund Committee</title><page.no>6867</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Membership</title><page.no>6867</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>âThe President has received a letter from a party leader seeking a variation to the membership of a committee.</para></talk.start><para>Senator PATTERSON (VictoriaâMinister for Health and Ageing) (5.15 p.m.)âby leaveâI move:</para><motion><para>That Senator Johnston be appointed to the Parliamentary Joint Committee on Native Title and the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander Land Fund.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para></interjection></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FINANCIAL SECTOR LEGISLATION AMENDMENT BILL (NO. 2) 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>6868</page.no><id.no>R1589</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>First Reading</title><page.no>6868</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Bill received from the House of Representatives.</para><para>Senator PATTERSON (VictoriaâMinister for Health and Ageing) (5.15 p.m.)âI move:</para><motion><para>That this bill may proceed without formalities and be now read a first time.</para></motion><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Bill read a first time.</para></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Second Reading</title><page.no>6868</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>6868</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI table a revised explanatory memorandum relating to the bill and move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be now read a second time.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to have the second reading speech incorporated in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>â</para><para>I rise today to introduce a bill which has been agreed to in the House of Representatives. The bill consists of a package of amendments to seven Acts dealing with the financial sector. These Acts are the:</para><para>Â·	Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act 2001</para><para>Â·	Banking Act 1959</para><para>Â·	Corporations (Repeals, Consequentials and Transitionals) Act 2001</para><para>Â·	Corporations Act 2001</para><para>Â·	Insurance Act 1973</para><para>Â·	Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act 1993; and</para><para>Â·	Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993.</para><para>Most of the amendments are in the nature of minor technical matters that have no policy implications. Other amendments, such as those to the Banking Act have the effect of improving prudential regulation by the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority (APRA) of authorised deposit-taking institutions and ensuring that Australian regulation is in compliance with world's best practice.</para><para>Passage of the bill will enable the financial sector to operate more effectively and efficiently by improving the application and implementation of the various Acts. The amendments will help to avoid confusion that currently exists in penalties, in definitions and in discrepancies with other legislation. The bill does not contain any controversial amendments and there has been wide consultation with industry and Government agencies where appropriate.</para><para>The amendments to the Banking Act largely reflect that it has not been updated for some time. They include provision for the application of a `fit and proper' test to directors and senior managers of authorised deposit-taking institutions (ADIs) and authorised non-operating holding companies. Currently, there is no formal test of expertise and integrity of directors and senior management. This amendment will make Australia compliant with the requirement for a `fit and proper' test as specified by the Basel Committee, which prescribes the international benchmark for banking regulation. These amendments will reduce the risk exposure faced by depositors arising from mismanagement. A three month transitional period will be applied to part of the `fit and proper' test, which will especially benefit smaller institutions in implementing the test.</para><para>Amendments will also make the provisions in the Banking Act that deal with auditors consistent with the auditor provisions in the Insurance Act. The amendments will provide APRA with the means to remove auditors who fail to perform adequately and properly. This is essential for APRA to receive accurate information in carrying out its prudential regulation.</para><para>The Banking Act will also be amended to include the requirement for an ADI, authorised non-operating holding company of an ADI, and their subsidiaries to notify APRA immediately of any breaches of prudential requirements and any material adverse developments. This will enable APRA to more effectively monitor the position of potentially troubled organisations in order to seek earlier remedial action and will assist in protecting depositor interests. Penalties have been specified for breaches of this requirement. It will also improve compliance with the Basel Core Principles dealing with regular banking supervision.</para><para>Another amendment to the Banking Act will allow APRA to continue to apply prudential standards on a consolidated group basis. This is consistent with APRA's own conglomerate policy and also with the Basel Core Principles, which require that supervision of a banking group be on a consolidated basis.</para><para>The Banking Act will also be amended to provide additional grounds for APRA to revoke the authority granted to an ADI or non-operating holding company where the application for the authority contained false or misleading information. Currently APRA must rely on uncertain national interest provisions. This amendment will remove the uncertainty. This is also a requirement of the Basel Core Principles. </para><para>Other proposed amendments to the Banking Act correct a discrepancy between the indemnity provisions of the Banking Act and the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority Act 1998. The discrepancy relates to the extent of protection available to APRA officers under these Acts. This will ensure that Australia is in compliance with the Basel Core Principles, which require that legal protection should be afforded to the supervisory agency and its staff against lawsuits when they have acted in good faith.</para><para>The information and data-gathering powers of APRA will be enhanced with amendments made to capture the provisions of the Financial Sector (Collection of Data) Act 2001 and to clarify the definition of `information'. This will improve APRA's investigative capacity. These amendments are being made to both the Banking Act and the Insurance Act.</para><para>There are further proposed amendments to the Banking and Insurance Acts that will enable APRA to more quickly and easily direct the removal of directors of regulated institutions.</para><para>Amendments to the Insurance Act are required to allow APRA to discuss submissions from a director or senior manager who is being removed with third parties. This would mean that APRA could test the veracity of any material notwithstanding privacy or confidentiality concerns. This is a vital part of APRA's ability to apply the `fit and proper' test to management.</para><para>A further amendment under the Insurance Act is the requirement that an insurance company must notify APRA of any breach of prudential standards, including any material developments that are detrimental to its financial position. This will allow APRA to deal earlier with potentially troubled institutions.</para><para>Another amendment deals with the incorrect specification of penalties. The penalty provisions in the Insurance Act need to be increased so that the penalty units applying to a body corporate are appropriate and consistent with penalty provisions specified in the Crimes Act 1914 that apply to bodies corporate.</para><para>Amendments to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act will introduce flexibility in the time limits relating to complaints about disability benefits. This acknowledges the difficulty in assessing medical conditions over time and gives the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal discretion in dealing with time limits, which are currently fixed.</para><para>Another amendment to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act will act to strengthen, modernise and improve the conciliation powers of the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal. This will enable the Tribunal to require parties to attend conciliation, instead of the current voluntary system. There will be penalties for non-compliance. These amendments will make the use of conciliation in the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal consistent with other administrative tribunals.</para><para>A further amendment to the Superannuation (Resolution of Complaints) Act is required to remove redundant powers that deal with arbitration. There will also be further minor technical amendments which will have the effect of streamlining the application of the Act.</para><para>Amendments to the Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act will allow the recognition of awards that were given under arbitration agreements and are still in force, even though the arbitration power has been removed.</para><para>Amendments to the Australian Securities and Investments Commission Act, the Corporations Act and the Corporations (Repeals, Consequentials and Transitionals) Act correct minor errors, grammatical mistakes and erroneous cross references and remove obsolete provisions. The Ministerial Council for Corporations has been consulted about the amendments and has approved them.</para><para>This bill builds on financial sector reforms already undertaken. They emphasise the commitment of the Government to ongoing reforms that ensure Australia is at the forefront of international best practice in financial regulation.</para><para>The financial sector is a key driver in the economy. These amendments will increase the efficiency of the financial industry and, through improving the operation of the Acts, assist the regulators in ensuring a stronger regulatory environment.</para><para>I commend the bill to the Senate.</para><para>Ordered that further consideration of this bill be adjourned to the first day of the next period of sittings, in accordance with standing order 111.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>FAMILY AND COMMUNITY SERVICES LEGISLATION AMENDMENT (SPECIAL BENEFIT ACTIVITY TEST) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>6870</page.no><id.no>R1645</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee</title><page.no>6870</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>6870</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn behalf of the Chair of the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee, Senator Knowles, I present the report of the committee on the provisions of the <inline ref="R1645">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Special Benefit Activity Test) Bill 2002</inline>, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and submissions received by the committee.</para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>6870</page.no><id.no>R1625</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>6870</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">McLucas, Jan (The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN)</name><name role="display">The TEMPORARY CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator McLucas)</inline>âThe committee is considering amendment (3) on sheet 2720 moved by Senator Hogg.

Just before question time, Senator Harradine expressed concern that certain activities are exempt. This is because the offence provisions were drafted very broadly to apply to all uses of excess ART embryos, not just research involving the destructive uses of ART embryos. This was intentionally done to ensure no loopholes were created. The exemptions were included to exempt routine ART clinical practice.

Is not the Fertility Society of Australia, in effect, an IVF industry body? I would be obliged if the minister could show me where it is not an industry body. In fact, isn't it true that the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee is a committee of the Fertility Society of Australia? If you have a look at that disinterested bodyâthis gatekeeper appointed by the government; it is to be imported into the bill by the government and it is going to end up in an act of parliament, so that is why I am raising thisâit is to be appointed as the appropriate independent body to grant accreditation to IVF centres. This is a very important area because it means that this organisation, which is an industry body, can virtually give carte blanche approval to research activity on human embryos and that matter does not have to then go to the licensing committee.</para></talk.start><para>I raise the question as to whether the minister understands that there are 16 members on the board of the Fertility Society and that three of the members are from Monash University and are associated with IVF. Monash is certainly not a disinterested organisation in the debate over the bill because, as you know, Madam Chair, two of these members gave evidence to the Community Affairs Legislation Committee, lobbying in favour of the draft legislation. Eleven of the members are representatives from for-profit IVF centres. Again, I emphasise that that is an industry body. This parliament has absolutely no control over this body, and yet you are giving to this body power over exempt uses of human embryos and therefore the matter does not have to go back to the licensing committee. </para><para>In my description of the Fertility Society, I include the consumer representative. There is a consumer representative on the body of the Fertility Society, but guess what? That organisation, called Access, is 70 per cent funded by the industry. That came out of the information that was brought to the committee. I think that Senator Bishop asked various questions at that time and it was revealed that the consumer representatives are from an organisation which is 70 per cent funded by the IVF industry.</para><para>I ask you, as a member of parliament: is it appropriate to allow this organisation to undermine, if you like, the structure that was proposed by COAG? The structure was for the establishment of a licensing committee. Madam Chair, regarding what you quoted from the COAG decision, it does not say in that decisionâas far as I know, and I have not seen itâthat all of these exempt activities could take place.

The reason this was included was to ensure that parliament did not unintentionally prohibit practices regularly undertaken by ART clinics which should not be subjected to the licensing scheme. The offence provision in clause 10 was drafted very broadly in order to ensure that there were no gaps or loopholes. The effect of the offence provisions is that all uses of all excess ART embryos must be licensed. It was therefore necessary to exempt from the licensing scheme certain routine uses of excess ART embryos such as transport, storage, removal from storage et cetera. It is for reasons of prudence and good administration that clause 10(2)(f), the regulation making power, has been included.</para></talk.start><para>If any additional exempt uses are proposed to be included in the regulations it will require the agreement of the states and territories to ensure national consistency and it will be open to the scrutiny of parliament.

It ensures that there will be no additional exemptions unless all states and territories and the Commonwealth parliament actively decide that there should be. For this reason I will be opposing Senator Hogg's proposed amendment to remove the regulation making power in clause 10.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>6872</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, I take it from the words `parliamentary scrutiny' that you are saying that those regulations will be a disallowable instrument?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>6872</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â Yes.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>6872</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âWhat power, if any, has the minister or whoever will be in control of this area to ensure that there is not open slather on the use ofâand I use the technical termâ`excess ART embryos'? Take, for example, the testing of different culture mediums for growth and survival rates. That is an open field. I notice that COAG was very strict in its view that there should be an overall restriction on the number of human embryos that are used as a result of this decision. How is that to apply, for example, to the provisions of clause 2(d) of the legislation? Unless I am mistaken, clause 2(d) permits the training of people in IVF techniquesâwhich include dissecting, lasering, cutting, transportation and observation, as the minister mentionedâand studies in genetic make-up and expression et cetera. How will the principle that has been proposed by COAGâthat is to say, the need to ensure that the number of embryos used is restrictedâbe applied? Is that a fair question? I think that even the supporters of the legislation, and obviously COAG, wanted to see some sort of restriction. You are proposing that that restrictive limit goes in at a later stage in respect of the human embryos that are going to be used as a result of a licence, but these are not licensed areas. Would that be in the new NHMRC-AHEC guidelines, perhaps? I think the current guidelines mention that there is such a restriction. Perhaps that is going to be done in the new guidelines. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6873</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â There must be a licence for the use of excess ART embryos, unless there is an exempt use.

I may be wrong, and I will look over my shoulder to the lawyers who are advising me, but I have been advised that the amendments would cover matters that fall under the jurisdiction of the states and territories. The amendments seek to regulate the use of gender selection techniques. The states and territories have always been responsible for the regulation of ART clinical practice. That was confirmed by COAG in April this year. The purpose of Senator Hogg's amendments would be to prohibit gender selection and therefore dictate the conditions that must be satisfied for an embryo to be designated as excess to the needs of a couple undergoing IVF treatment. Gender selection is an appropriate clinical intervention in ART clinical practice where families have a history of a sex linked genetic disease. In IVF, when somebody has a sex linked disease, they choose the embryo which does not have it. Gender selection is most often used in ART clinical practice, as I said, as a means of screening for such diseases. I am advised that the inclusion of clauses that seek to inhibit such practices would severely limit treatment options for infertile couples within Australia. I presume from what Senator Hogg has said that that is not his intention, but that is what I am advised will be the outcome of these amendments. For that reason, I will be opposing the amendments.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>6874</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate that I will be opposing these amendments.

But, as has been acknowledged by peopleâincluding the mover of these amendments and the ministerâthere are very good reasons why a couple would want to gender selectâfor example, to avoid passing on a gender specific inheritable disease. In these circumstances, I believe that gender selection is justifiable and legitimate. </para></talk.start><para>As I understand it, these amendments do not ban gender selection per se, but they seek to make it an offence to allow gender selection as a criterion to designate ART embryos as excess. If the real issue here, and the real desire of Senator Hogg, is to ban gender selection per se or entirely, then I suspect that this is the wrong legislation in which to do that. As the minister has pointed out, it would need to be addressed in state regulation and the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee guidelines. As I have stated, there are good reasons why this practice is and should be allowed. There are perfectly legitimate reasons why genuinely excess ART embryos may arise because of gender selection.

This legislation is going to go to the state parliaments for their consideration and endorsement, and they can either endorse it or otherwise.

I would ask the other Democrat senators to have a close look at the intention of it. The intention is clear.

If the high risk of inherited disease was in the male, then the male embryos would then be in excess of the needs of the woman, but you would know for the purposes of research that the excess embryos were all male. Senator Hogg's amendments would then be a problem in the sense that you cannot discriminate on the grounds of sex, but in this case you would just happen to have all these excess embryos from that person, and they would all be male. That is the issue. It does actually cover both areas. I may not have explained that properly but that is the gist of it. The amendments say that you cannot select an embryo to be excess based on gender. If the couple have two embryos, one male and one female, they may decide not to use one because it is male and may carry disease, and that embryo will then become excess. I have been advised that this would be an offence under the Hogg amendments. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>6876</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âMinister, I need to express my frustration at the statement, `I am advised that this would be the effect,' because, like Senator Brown, I do not really understand how that would be the effect. This amendment deals specifically with embryos that would be regarded as excess, not embryos that are selected for the treatment of a genetic disorder. The other aspect of the argument raised earlier eludes me also; namely, that this area covers areas of state regulation. With respect, the whole bill does. I have seen this used as an argument against some other quite legitimate concerns in some of the advice that has been put forward. It is a furphy. To the extent that there may be a concern that an unintended consequence of this amendment might relate to gender selection in relation to a genetic disorder, I would like to see how we could deal with that. I do not think that we need to throw the baby out with bathwater, so to speak.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>6876</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âOn the same issue, Minister, Senator Collins has suggested that there may be a proviso that is included to state, `Provided that this does not apply in the case where a genetic disorder is being looked at.' That would make it quite clear. As I have said, I am prepared to leave this and come back to it if the government are prepared to go away and look at that reasonably. I think that is a reasonable suggestion to put to the government in this debate. It covers off from the concern that has been raised. It specifically excludes the issue of gender selection, except in cases where it is clearly demonstrable that it applies to a concern where there is a genetic disorder. I think that is reasonable. If you look at the number of amendments that I have put up, you will see that I am not putting up a whole host of amendments just plucked out of the air willy-nilly. I am trying to put forward some amendments that I believe will make for better legislation when the bill finally passes through this chamber.

Certainly, in terms of the Acts Interpretation Act, the courts can take some level of interpretation from statements made by him as the mover of this amendment. He could perhaps strengthen that further by amending this provision so that it does not apply where an embryo has been selected or deselectedâI suppose that is really what we are talking aboutâin the case of a couple where there is concern of a genetic abnormality where gender is a factor. </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>6877</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is no need for any amendment to the amendment.

This amendment proposes a new section 12A, which creates an offence if a person disadvantages or discriminates against persons conscientiously objecting to conducting research on human embryos.</para><para>The amendment will ensure that those who do not wish to participate in destructive experiments on human embryos will have their rights to a conscientious objection protected. It is a fundamental right not to be personally complicit in what one considers to be morally objectionable practices. People are entitled to basic freedoms of association, freedoms of conscience and to connect as one desires as long as no harm is done to others. The right not to be involved in practices that one considers to be morally objectionable is simply an exercise in the expression of those basic freedoms. </para><para>It is important, therefore, that individuals are not forced to be directly or indirectly complicit in acts or practices that they deeply believe to be ethically or morally objectionable. A person's act of professional engagement in destructive embryonic research in the workplace or in the educational setting can count, from that person's point of view, as moral complicity to the extent that it actively supports the conduct of the practice. It is not important that the practice in question is bad or immoral; it is rather that the person concerned genuinely and deeply believes it to be so. Therefore, it does not require that a person oppose the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> in order to support this amendment. </para><para>It is generally agreed that in some cases a person's genuine and conscientious objection to engage in a particular activity is sufficient grounds for them to be exempted without penaltyâfor example, conscientious objection to military service on deeply held pacifist grounds. Where someone who is required to perform some duty or obligation is granted a conscientious exemption, it is usually because compliance by that person would involve a deep and grave violation of their moral integrity. In other words, they are exempted because complying would cause them significant moral and psychological distress, if not harm. </para><para>Conscientious objection is an important protection in the employment sectorâand I address my remarks to the Labor Party through you, Temporary Chairman Brandis. It is very important for workers. Employment is a very basic social need and employment opportunities are limited. They are a limited resource even if the employer-employee relationship is, in many cases, a voluntary and a so-called private one. This calls into question just how voluntary an employee's relationship with an employer is. Most employees do not have the luxury of being able to move to a new job if a regime is imposed upon them to which they have a conscientious objection. Where complying with the employer's directives would cause significant moral and psychological distress, an employee should have the right to conscientious refusal. An employee has a right to a work environment that does not cause them harm or significant distress. The exercise of that right cannot justifiably be penalised. That is the case in this particular instance where there is a deliberate attempt to integrate adult stem cell research with human embryonic stem cell research.</para><para>Education is another area which I have sought to cover by this amendment, particularly with respect to those students studying biology and other university subjects. Education is a basic social good to which all are entitled. Moreover, people are entitled, arguably by moral right, to education in an environment that does not cause them moral harm or significant psychological distress. In fact, it is often thought that one of the fundamental goals of an education is to enhance or at least facilitate moral and psychological development. Therefore, if students were required to engage in educational activities involving the destruction of embryos, even though they found this deeply morally objectionable, their rights of protection against harm and distress would be breached and the educational activity itself would probably run counter to the purposes of education. Conscientious refusal should be allowed to students without penalty or discipline with alternative educational and assessment tasks set.</para><para>This is a very vital amendment. The Prime Minister of this country has said that we all ought to have a conscience vote. It is very fine for us to give ourselves a conscience vote on a measure. What does this measure do? It opens the way for destructive experiments on human embryos. The fact of the matter is that there are researchers involved in adult stem cell research in other research areas within a particular institution and, in that case, they may be required to undertake certain research activities involving human embryos, even if it is not explicit or overt but part of a structure or a regime. If we are going down this path, I believe we have a responsibility to protect people's consciences. I know that it will be said that the NHMRC has in its guidelinesâand again I emphasise that they are guidelinesâthe provision of conscientious objection. The guidelines say:</para><quote><para>Those staff who conscientiously object to research projects or therapeutic programs conducted by institutions that employ them should not be obliged to participate in those projects or programs to which they object and they should not be put at a disadvantage because of their objection.</para></quote><para>They are guidelines; they are not insisted upon by law. In fact, they do not cover the area of education, so we do need to have this up-front in this legislation so that everybody knows about it. It is a principle of justice and equity.

To include it as a criminal offence carrying a significant penalty requires more detailed consideration of a range of issues, including the Commonwealth's constitutional power to regulate in respect of individuals in this way, the nature of employee and employer relationships and the elements of the offence itself.

Here we are dealing with legislation which is very specific to an outcome, which is experimentation on excess embryos. Senator Harradine is saying that this very clearly leads to the potential for people who have a conscientious objection to being involved in such experimentation being penalised because they do not undertake such work. I totally agree with Senator Harradine. When dealing with a specific issue like this, I do not think it is good enough for the government to say, `Go and get another piece of legislation and amend that.' For one, Mr Temporary Chairman, as you very clearly know, that would mean Senator Harradine having to bring a piece of legislation in here, with all the difficulties of getting that brought forward for debate, and then it being sent to the House of Representatives, where in all likelihood it would be put aside and taken off the agenda. The place to deal with this is right here and now. I agree with Senator Harradine: it is a very important matter. We all know how difficult it is for us to make decisions on this matter. We must not leave people in the workplace to be denied the same ability to make a decision as we have here. I think Senator Harradine's argument on that is totally compelling.</para></talk.start><para>I point out to fellow senators that we are having a free vote on this because it is a matter of conscience. The matter that Senator Harradine raises is not whether or not we are going to favour this bill or its content; it is whether or not we should remove from people in the workplaceâin a laboratory somewhere, coming down the lineâthe right to have a conscience. I believe that if we discount this amendment and say to Senator Harradine, `Go and find some other way of implementing your wish here,' we are doing just that. This is, as Senator Harradine has pointed out, not a matter of whether we believe that we should support this legislation or components of it; it is a matter of whether we believe that other Australians should be able to follow their conscience on the matter. Who of us does not believe that is the case?

I belong to a party that believes strongly in conscience votes and conscientious objection, and we have registered that in a range of Commonwealth debates. One example concerns the issue of universal membership of student organisations and whether or not there should be conscientious objections. But we have also acknowledged that, whether or not you do that through disallowable instruments, through guidelines or through the actual legislation, it is a debate that needs exploration.</para></talk.start><para>I do not know if the Minister for Health and Ageing can provide us with some of the precedents in relation to such an issue, bearing in mind that the broader issue of conscientious objection, including the issue of victimisation, is complex.

I think it is about determining whether or not this is the right place and whether or not the guidelines are the appropriate way to deal with this very important and complex issue. I suspect that they are. Having said that, is this amendment in its current form the appropriate one to deal with the complexity of the issue? I suspect it is not. But that is not to say that other senators in this chamber have a problem with the principle, and I would hate to think that it is a reflection on them if they do not support the wording of this amendment. </para><para>I acknowledge Senator Harradine's pointâand it is a good pointâthat whether people support or oppose the legislation does not prevent us from viewing each amendment on its merits and voting for amendments that actually value-add or improve this bill. I think anyone who has been a part of this debate would recognise that there is absolutely no predictability about anything in it. Without meaning to reflect on a vote of the chamber, the vote before lunchtime proved this. That will certainly go down as the most memorable vote for me in the last seven years. It goes to show that people are thinking about these issues, that we do have differences of opinion and that they do not necessarily relate to whether or not we simply support the legislation in its entirety.</para><para>I do support this principle but I am unconvinced that this amendment will address all those issues. If we do perhaps decide as a chamber that changes should be made to the law or that the guidelines are not sufficient, then we should actually take some time to ensure that the amendment is the right one. Then I suspect we should possibly have an inquiry to deal with a whole bunch of other laws that relate to conscientious objection and broader issues of discrimination, because I certainly have a list of issues that I would like to see included in federal legislation.</para><para>If the minister has any information which she can provide to the chamber in relation to the constitutional impact of the bill or to perceived problems in addition to those that she has outlined, I would like to hear it.

In supporting it, I would also like to raise the issue that, in relation to a person possibly being victimised for being a conscientious objector, the government has said that this could be covered by bringing a different bill into this chamber and moving amendments to it. This raises an interesting situation, because we have seen consistently in this chamber that, when the government brings a substantive piece of legislation in, it brings in at the same time what are referred to as consequential amendments. Yet here we have a bill that not only has the potential to impact socially and morally on the fabric of our society but also has the ability, if passed in its present form, to victimise a conscientious objector to the use or provision of embryos for research. In the past, in the majority of instances, as well as bringing the primary bills into this chamber the government has brought in the consequential amendments. My question to the minister is this: why, in the face of such a substantive piece of legislation, has the government not indicated to this chamber the consequential amendments that it is willing to move and brought those into the chamber at the same time?</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>6881</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â Before I was so rudely interrupted by the dinner breakâand it was the fault of nobody that I was rudely interrupted; I was quite glad to have a dinner break, but I could not believe it was half past sixâI was in the middle of a speech.

I think this debate has got a bit off track. I think there is an agreement around the chamber that we ought to protect any scientist, health worker or anyone else involved in the field who might have a conscientious view about the work or research they are involved in. That has been long recognised in the NHMRC guidelines. They have a <inline font-style="italic">National statement on ethical conduct in research involving humans</inline>, which I think originated in 1999, which requires that staff who conscientiously object to research projects or therapeutic programs should not be obliged to participate in those projects or programs to which they object and that they should not be disadvantaged because of their objections.</para></talk.start><para>Science has been dealing with these issues for many years. The fact that this parliament has got around to doing something about research involving embryos et cetera, many years after that research has been conducted, does not mean that we have to reinvent the wheel or the whole vehicle. There is a range of issues that science and research have been dealing with for many years. This is one example where that research raises ethical and moral questions. Quite rightly Senator Harradine pointed to those areas, but there are other areas of research and scientific activity which raise those same issues. </para><para>Our view is that that range of issues has been adequately dealt with by the statement from the NHMRC on ethical conduct in research involving humans, and the guidelines issued with it. We argue that those address the concerns raised. I am not convinced of the need for us to include in this bill a specific provision that deals with those concerns. I accept the logic of the position taken but believe that the guidelines provide that protection to those people who are knowingly involved in this scientific research and to those employed by organisations involved in that research. Their ability to have a conscientious objection is protected. I think everyone around the chamber has respected that. </para><para>The question is whether you want to go the next step and enshrine in this legislation an amendment such as that proposed by Senator Harradine. Our advice is that there is a range of questions arising from thatâeven if we thought it appropriateâabout unintended consequences and the Commonwealth's constitutional power et cetera. I am sure Senator Boswell has much more faith in the government's IR legislation than I have, so I was surprised at his concern that workers rights were not being protected. I hope that means he will be a convert to a more progressive IR position than he has previously held. I guess it suits him on this occasion to worry about workers rights, but it has not suited him on any other occasion. I will try not to be too inflammatory, but it was a bit galling. I take it that Senator Harradine's amendment is moved in good faith. He put the argument for it. I am indicating on behalf of the Labor Party that our view is that the issue is sufficiently dealt with by the NHMRC's guidelines and we do not need at this stage to legislate those provisions in this bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>6882</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThat is totally incorrect.

This is an opportunity for the chamberâI insist, for the chamberâto do the right thing by workers and students. Senator Evans spoke about the guidelines and said that federal science has been dealing with this for many years. We have a situation here which is occurring for the first time. Doesn't Senator Evans understand that we are, for the first time in the federal parliament, proposing a licence to kill? For the first time we are proposing a licence to take the life of a human embryo. That is what we are doing. That is very different from what you are saying. There has not been such a regime before in this country. Yet Senator Evans says, `This has been happening for many years; why are we introducing it now?' We are introducing it now precisely because it has not been faced for many years. Around the chamber people are saying, `This is very good.' I congratulate those who have stood up on the matter and have not succumbed to what the minister has been saying, on advice.</para></talk.start></continue><para>Let me deal with these questions. Everybody, including the minister, has had this amendment for two or three weeks. If these matters are of concern, let us have a look at them. But they are not of concern. The statement by the minister uses the word `victimisation'. According to the minister, that has doubtful connotations. If it has doubtful connotations, what about the Commonwealth legislation where the word `victimisation' appears and where there are proscriptions of victimisation?</para><para>For example, the Parliamentary Services Act has a provision in respect of victimisation. The Complaints (Australian Federal Police) Act has an offence of victimisation. The Disability Discrimination Act also has an offence of victimisation. The minister should know this one: the National Health Act has a provision in relation to an act of victimisation. The Superannuation Industry (Supervision) Act 1993 has a provision whereby `a person must not intentionally or recklessly commit an act of victimisation'. It goes on. I am not going to waste the time of the committee by reading more of them, but it is all there. There is precedent. So scratch `victimisation' off your list, Ministerâ through you, Mr Temporary Chairman. </para><para>I was aware of the concerns of the minister, so I put belt and braces on.

The minister said it was not certain how this would operate in relation to other laws. What other laws? As I said, the minister and her advisers had this amendment for some considerable time. The minister started up by saying that she did not disagree with the basic premise. Even if she does not disagree, this very serious matter is not going to be dealt with over some time. The guidelines of the National Health and Medical Research Council do not helpâunless, of course, the institution is receiving specific grants from the NHMRC, which would then be in the contract. So it is not covered. There is a real problem here, which is the possibility of persons with a conscientious objection being victimised.</para><para>The minister says that she has a problem with the word `if'. If she has a problem with the word `if', just change `if' to `because'. There is no problem in doing that.

I have some concerns in relation to this particular section of the legislation and to Senator Harradine's amendment. I ask the minister: what is a person's redress under the regulation? How do they effect it? If they are an employee in a biotech lab and they object to being asked to carry out a certain function and their employer then decides that he is going to force the issue, how does that person then exercise their right under those regulations or guidelines? I do not believe there is a way. Senator Harradine's amendment clearly gives that person a redress at law, and that is exactly where it should be.</para></talk.start><para>Too often we are asked in this chamber to pass legislation that will require the drafting of regulations that we will not have seen, and this particular issue is so substantive that I believe it is the responsibility of this chamber to know what the actual outcomes and results are going to be. Too often when we pass legislation in this place, we are so bound up with the volume of it that we never even look back to see whether those pieces of legislation, those regulations or those guidelines are even having the effect that was intended by this chamber. I do not want to go into examples but there are a series of them that have had catastrophic effects on this nation and on our social life. I believe all of those will pale into insignificance compared to the impact that this legislation may have in the future. Senator Harradine is clearly setting out in this amendment a definition of a person's legal redress. Through you, Chair, I think it is almost a requirement on the minister, given that she was saying that she was going to vote against this amendment, to at least give this chamber a clear and concise process under which a person will be able to access and implement at law those guidelines that she refers to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:56:00</time.stamp><page.no>6884</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThere is an important unanswered question here that I have heard from Senator Harradine and Senator Harris, and that is: what will the impact of the guidelines be in the workplace? I will reverse that and ask: are there workplaces where stem cells from embryos which are not under the aegis of the guidelines that the minister has spoken about may be used? In that respect, Senator Harradine alluded to students in certain situations. The second very clear argument here is to turn it around the other way and say: if this is not inconsistent but is in fact redundant because it traverses the same ground as the guidelines then what is the objection? There is one simple difference that I see: the guidelines are guidelines without any penalty for those who breach them, except that maybe they will be marked down by the NHMRC for some research grant. If there is some other penalty or comeback, I want to hear of it. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Harradine's amendment says that this is so serious that, if there is a breach of those guidelines, there is a penalty; this is going to make people think before they breach those guidelines. We are talking about a fundamental principle of liberty, freedom, difference and diversity in our community. We are not talking about whether or not we agree with experimentation on stem cells from embryos; we are talking about the right of other people to have their conscience recognised and not penalised on the matter. I have heard nothing tonight to say that the guidelines do what this amendment does. I have heard it said that the guidelines cover the area, but this amendment gives force to the implementation of those guidelines. It says that they should not be breached and that they are not simply guidelines of which no notice should be takenâthey actually have the force of law. When we are talking about defending the right of people in the workplace to exercise their conscience on a matter as fundamental as this, I think that is important.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>6885</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â The statement at the beginning of the 1999 National Statement on Ethical Conduct in Research Involving Humans says it is endorsed by the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the Australian Research Council, the Australian Academy of the Humanities, the Australian Academy of Science and the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and that it is supported by the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering. I say that because I was asked what organisations and institutions the guidelines apply to. All I can say is that I presume it is a pretty broad range of research institutions when you have the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee, the Australian Research Council, the Australian Academy of the Humanities, the Australian Academy of Science, the Academy of the Social Sciences in Australia and the Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering supporting the guidelines which I referred to before.

But there is a raft of legislation covering unfair dismissal and discrimination that people can resort to if they believe that they have been discriminated against on the basis of their conscientious objection to research projects or therapeutic programs conducted by the institutions that employ them. The guidelines are there and they are supported by a large number of institutions that are covered or do research within either universities or other institutions. I believe that that is sufficient. I find this whole debate quite difficult because I am often put in a situationâand I presume some other people in the chamber feel the same wayâwhere my scruples, morals and intentions are being questioned. That is not the case. I believe that people should be able to conscientiously object about doing research, and I find it offensive to be put in a situation which makes me feel otherwise. I believe that these measures cover those people. There are people who conscientiously object but, to those people who are putting up the amendment, I say: do not come to this chamber and pretend that somehow you have the truth, because those of us on the other side feel very strongly that people should be able to conscientiously object. However, we believe that they are covered, so I am not going to sit here and tolerate people implying and impugning that I do not care about people conscientiously objecting. You might wonder why I feel angry about it. I have been sitting here and I have been very calm.

An interesting article has come into my possession from a publication titled <inline font-style="italic">Clinical guidelines and the law: negligence, discretion and judgement</inline> by Brian Hurwitz, a general practitioner in London and a senior lecturer in general practice at the Imperial College of Science, Technology and Medicine. I think the extract I am going to read sums up the type of debate we are having here this evening. It goes to this issue of the operation of guidelines and how they interact with legislation. I will not take the senators laboriously through the whole page but it is interesting to go through the discussion that takes place on this issue. It refers specifically to a dialogue which took place during the Scott inquiry into the arms for Iraq affair and illustrates the appeal that guidelines hold to those attempting to enforce accountability upon professionals who have traditionally regarded their work as self-directed and generally free from outside interference. The debate that is quoted is between Ms Baxendale QC and Lady Thatcher and it goes along these lines:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Ms Baxendale QC: Some of the witnesses we have had have described these guidelines as a framework, within which to work ... Does that fit in with how you saw the guidelines?</para><para>Lady Thatcher: They are exactly what they say, guidelines, they are not the law. They are guidelines.</para><para>Ms Baxendale QC: Did they have to be followed?</para><para>Lady Thatcher: Of course they have to be followed, but they are not strict law. That is why they are guidelines and not law and, of course, they have to be applied according to the relevant circumstances.</para><para>Ms Baxendale QC: They are expected to be followed?</para><para>Lady Thatcher: Of course they have to be followed. They need to be followed for what they are, guidelines.</para></quote><para>The issues raised in this exchange are also at the heart of the concerns addressed by this book: whether guidelines carry appropriate authority and in which circumstances they should be properly viewed as imposing mandatory obligations upon doctors. I do not see that as too remote from what we are discussing here. What effect in law do the guidelines have? Are they merely guidelines or are they an instrument of the law? If they are merely guidelines, it does not seem unreasonable in this circumstance, given the issue that I believe Senator Harradine is reasonably pursuing, that one should see the amendment that is being put forward by Senator Harradine being reasonably adopted. It does nothing that alters the effect of the guidelines and it gives effect to the protection and the wellbeing of those who may want to conscientiously object to something. </para><para>I do not think this is a reflection on those who might be carrying the other point in this debate. Clearly, one of the major things that characterises many people in this place is that they look very rigorously to protect those who do have genuine conscientious beliefs on issues. I cannot see that this particular case is any different. There is a bit of lesson for us in the case I have just quoted from <inline font-style="italic">Clinical guidelines and the law</inline>. I ask the minister: do the guidelines have any force in law or are we in a similar set of circumstances to those that I have just quoted from the extract in that the guidelines are there as a matter of convenience but, where they do not suit, they are not mandatory and therefore do not have to be followed?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>6887</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have a great deal of sympathy for the views put forward by the minister in response to Senator Brown's comments about people getting angry.

I accept that important and general principle. The arguments for and against this amendment have been put in detail. The general principle of conscientious objection has been supported in principle by a majority of senators in this chamber. The debate still remains, certainly in my mind, as to whether the conscientious objection principle is enshrined in legislation and whether it is made a criminal offence in relation to this particular bill. I thank Senator Harradine for providing precedence because that was my question earlier in the debate. I had broader questions in relation to the complexity of this issue: whether this amendment covered the complexity, including the definition of `victimisation', and whether senatorsâboth the proponents and opponents of this amendmentâhad thought through the constitutional implications of regulating the behaviour of an individual. I have heard precedence in response to that.</para></talk.start></continue><para>By the same token, this amendment has become the `James Bond' amendment in terms of some of the lingo I have heard in the debate about the powers that have been made possible under this legislation. I wonder whether there are any examples from anyone in the chamber pointing out the current deficienciesânot in a theoretical sense but in a practical senseâin guidelines when it comes to scientists, students or anyone else for that matter in relation to scientific research and discovery. Obviously, preferred examples would relate to the issue of embryonic stem cell and adult stem cell research but what about other examples of research? I can get a lot more passionate at the moment about the issue of whether students, scientists or researchers, for example, are able to conscientiously object to research on animals. I wonder whether this amendment is the precursor to more amendments in relation to scientific research, animal welfare or other parts of legislation. I suspect it is not, for the very reason that we have guidelines and until those guidelines are deficient or our current industrial laws or any other legal avenues are proved to be deficient, I wonder whether this is the place to make these changes. Would anyone like to provide examples of scientists? I am not suggesting that there are not any; I am just not aware of examples where the NHMRC guidelines, for example, or any other guidelines, have fallen down. </para><para>I endorse the comments made by the minister in relation to the general and wide ranging support for the guidelines from groups such as the Academy of Science and, in particular, the Australian Vice-Chancellors Committee. If those deficiencies are evident, please let us put them on the table now. If people decide that this is an amendment worth having but, like me, believe that this is not necessarily the time or the place because we do not have enough detailâwe have not looked at the definition in relation to `victimisation'âthen let us look at this either under the review that will come up or in a broader context where we look at other elements of science and research, whether it is to do with animal testing or anything else. I still have grave concerns about making this a new offenceâa criminal offence. I have made two contributions in this debate; I agree with Senator Evans and Senator Patterson that we have had a long discussion, that the amendment at some point in the near future should be put and that these may be issues for the review that will naturally take place as a consequence of the package of this and the other legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>6888</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI really could not understand that last intervention. I do not think it would be relevant here to propose a conscientious objection provision with regard to experiments on animals. We are dealing with the human embryo experimentation bill, not the animal embryo experimentation billâif there were one. Let that be decided there and then on that occasion. If Senator Stott Despoja is suggesting that we do not have the constitutional power to do what is being proposed here then why does she suggest that perhaps we ought to be dealing with animal experimentation as well? It is a non sequitur.</para></talk.start><para>The plain fact of the matter is that the guidelines are not enforceable unless the institution is receiving money from the NHMRC and that then becomes part of the contract. Senator Stott Despoja says, `Give us an example of a researcher being victimised.' I am trying to anticipate that situation in order to ensure that it cannot occur. Let me make it perfectly clear: this legislation does not come into effect for the period that is mentioned at the beginning of the legislation. The whole point about it is that this is the first time that the Australian parliament has proposed a licence to kill or a licence to destroy a human embryo for the purpose of, for example, extracting stem cells. Why, then, on this occasion do we not foresee what may indeed occur, not only amongst those scientists who are conducting adult stem cell research quite effectively at the moment but also amongst students? There is nothing, even in the guidelines that are laid down there, about the protection of the consciences of science students who may wish to do research on stem cellsâbecause general research on stem cells is very importantâderived from an ethical source, in their own view.</para><para>I took the opportunity of sending some explanation as to why this is so important to a number of my colleagues in the parliament. I also wish to take this opportunity to say that this is a basic matter of human rights. Just because I say this is a basic matter of human rights I do not want anybody to get up and say, `You're saying that we're not in favour of human rights.' But, in fact, unless we do something like this we are potentially denying a fundamental human right relating not only to the integrity of an individual's actions but also to the integrity of the individual person. The <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> will show that, far from suggesting that the minister has no concern about the conscientious objection provision, I in fact restated that she had told the committee that she does not disagree with the intentionâand I am not sure what word she usedâbehind this particular measure. I was concerned about the raising of the question of victimisation, which has been answered, including the examples in Commonwealth legislation and the other amendments relating to the guidelines. Let us look at the word `if'. That has been deliberately provided in the amendment. The amendment says: </para><quote><para>A person commits an offence if the person:</para></quote><para>(a)	disadvantages, victimises, threatens or discriminates against another person in the course of his or her employment, research or study because that other person conscientiously objects to being involved with research on human embryos and human embryonic stem cells.</para><para>Paragraph (b) uses the word `if' rather than `because', and quite deliberately, because the first paragraph talks about the person committing an offence if the person disadvantages another person et cetera. Then paragraph (b) says:</para><para>(b)	compels another person in the course of his or her employment or study to be involved with research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells if that other person conscientiously objects to conducting research on human embryos or human embryonic stem cells.</para><para>That is relevant to the action of compelling another person. The offence is to disadvantage or victimise the person who is conscientiously objecting.</para><para>So I maintain that this conscientious objection provision has been well researched. I have had the advice of very competent draftspeople in respect of this. As I have said, this has been available for some time now and, had there been those objections, they should have been brought to my attention. But they are irrelevant objections because I have answered them all. I am just very disappointed that the minister is not adopting it when she knows as well as I do that the guidelines are unenforceable unless there is money involved in respect of the National Health and Medical Research Council. I submit this to the parliament and hope that persons who are affected in their own consciences, by reason of the decisions that we are making now, have the same rights as we are given to exercise our conscience in respect of these measures. There is a high degree of discrimination if we, as parliamentarians, give ourselves a conscience vote on this matter and deny those who are affected by the legislation their right to conscientiously object.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>6889</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to express perhaps another angle on this debate, which brings into play the whole status of the guidelines and where they sit in this legislation. Without getting into the detail, I want to go through a number of points. First of all, the concerns that Senator Harradine has with other senators in this chamber relate to the fact that this is in the guidelines; it is not enforced in law. But you would assume, and we can take it that it is the government's position, that the guidelines are a condition of the licence. The licence must be abided by and, as a result of that, the guidelines must also be abided by. If there is a breach of the guidelines then there will be a breach of the licence conditions. An offence will necessarily flow from that if there is a breach under this bill, and breaches have penalties such as imprisonment for up to five years or a financial penalty.</para></talk.start><para>The point that this leads us to is: what status do these guidelines actually have? As Senator Hogg says, in law they clearly have little to no status unless they become, as foreshadowed in an amendment by Senator Collins, a disallowable instrument or they come underneath the regulation as a disallowable instrument. I would like the government to seriously consider making the guidelines a disallowable instrument to give them some legal effect, otherwise you are basically saying, `You can be subject to a criminal penalty of up to five years imprisonment simply for the breach of guidelines which may change from time to time and for which there is no force of law.' It is like signing a blank cheque. It is a very dangerous position to be in.</para><para>It is essentially very bad law, and very bad law making, to accept the fact that these are guidelines and that it is going to be covered, in any event, under those guidelines when they do not have the force of law and they are not referred to this parliament in terms of being a disallowable instrument or having the status of a regulation. So I ask the government to carefully consider that and, in particular, consider also this bigger issue of giving these guidelines the force of law and making them a disallowable instrument, because that is another question. It needs very serious consideration, because there are a number of clauses, such as clauses 8, 11 and, I think, 21, where the bill refers to the guidelines in a very open-ended way. For example, clause 11(2) says: </para><quote><para>(b) such other code or document as is prescribed by the regulations in addition to, or instead of, the code mentioned in paragraph (a), as in force from time to time.</para></quote><para>For goodness sake, this is so open-ended, so open to abuse and so open to the infringement of the rights of the general public, that it is very concerning. These issues that I have foreshadowed need to be carefully considered and addressed as soon as possible by a response from the government which takes them into account. I have mentioned clauses 8, 11 and 21 and if the government could have a look at those, that would be good. I do support the amendment moved by Senator Harradine. It does make sense. It enshrines in legislation that which is fair, proper and reasonable. For the sake of brevity, I will leave it at that. </para><para>Question put:</para><motion><para>That the amendment (<inline font-weight="bold">Senator Harradine's</inline>) be agreed to.</para></motion></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>20:30:00</time.stamp><para>The committee divided.</para></division.header><para>(The ChairmanâSenator J.J.

I move this amendment because, in effect, I want to bring the legislation on stem cells into line with what we are doing in Australia. In Australia it is illegal to clone and it is illegal to trade in human tissue. You cannot trade in stem cells and you cannot trade in human tissue but there is no provision in this bill that would prevent exports of human stem cells into countries that do not have our high ideals and, in some cases, do not have any laws whatsoever to protect the stem cells or the derivatives of embryos. </para><para>If we were to export guns, uranium or any other dangerous product we would have an end user certificate that says, `You can do this with this uranium but you cannot build an atom bomb; you can use these guns for defence but you cannot on-trade them.' We do not have any such thing in this legislation. Some companies that have associations with the National Stem Cell Centre have already set up a company in Singapore called ES Cell International. It is a company made up of Singaporean, Australian and Israeli money and it has some official tie-up with the stem cell centre. </para><para>I welcomed the minister's decision the other day to prevent embryos from being traded or exported overseas and, on some occasions, imported. It was a good step. I am not sure that people are aware of the fact that you can use stem cells to clone. You can use embryos to clone and you can use stem cells to clone. That is not widely known. I have evidence from a lot of scientists but let me just quote from the libraryâ</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>TH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Knowles, Sen Susan</name><name role="display">Senator Knowles</name></talker><para>âYou're not meant to quote the library in anything.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name></talker><para>âLet me just quote from some advice that I have from the library. The library defines the use of embryonic stem cells as therapeutic cloning. It states:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>This technique involves cloning human embryos not for the purpose of allowing them to develop until birth, but to extract certain cellsâso-called embryonic stem cellsâfrom them, grow them into tissues for development of therapies ...</para></quote><para>You can, in effect, clone from stem cells. You can clone from embryos and you can clone from stem cells. Surely the status of an embryo is that it cannot be exported or imported, and that status is acknowledged by the government, the Prime Minister and the minister. Stem cells, I believe, can be cloned and used for other things. </para><para>We are opening this up. We have put forward a cloning bill, which both houses of parliament voted against. We all congratulated ourselves on our high ethics and the fact that we would not allow cloning in Australia. Yet we are prepared to allow stem cells to go overseas to countries that have no standards and no legislation that would prevent them from doing things. In fact, anything can go when stem cells are exported.</para><para>I am suggesting that this amendment would only bring this bill into line with the legislation that was passed to prevent cloning and the use of human tissue in Australia and that it would set the same standards for anything that was exported to overseas countries. On numerous occasions I have asked the NHMRC whether anything in the legislation would prevent exports. I was told on a number of occasions that there was no measure in place to prevent the export of Australian embryo products, such as stem cells and other derivatives, to places where cloning is allowed. Embryo stem cell lines may be exported and then manipulated for various uses.</para><para>When we originally debated this, we were told about cures. Many people believed that the thought of cures was the motivation to vote for this legislation. But the general public were never told about trading in embryos, stem cells and embryo derivatives. I am sure that there would be no great enthusiasm in the general population for the commercialisation of stem cells. If people had been asked, `Would you vote for this for a cure?' they would have answered yes. But when it comes to commercialisationâtrading in stem cells and human tissueâI think the general population would give it the thumbs down. </para><para>This has been a difficult debate and it has been very difficult to get information out there. But there is no doubt in my mind that people would not support the commercialisation of stem cells to be traded as human tissue, particularly when we do not allow that to occur in Australia. How can we not allow it to occur in Australia and then just wipe our hands of it and say, `When it goes outside the country you can do what you like.' I do not think that is acceptable to people and it should not be acceptable to parliament. </para><para>The same standards are required in Australia for our embryos, our derivatives from embryos and our stem cells. We want those same standards for those derivatives from embryos to apply in Australia and outside of Australia. We do not want a separate law for what happens in Australia and another law for what happens outside Australia. I ask people to support this amendment. I believe it is an amendment that would have the general support of the public.

I do not believe that there is evidence to dateâand I have sought advice and had this advice supported by asking people from NHMRCâof any possibility that you can clone a human embryo from a stem cell, and any cells that are derived in Australia would be derived under the regulations that have been agreed to by COAG. </para></talk.start><para>I am sure senators will remember the discussion that we had regarding a similar amendment to the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>.

We addressed the issue and at that time I said that the Prime Minister had given an undertaking to amend the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 to provide for a 12-month prohibition on exporting human embryos, during which time the government will determine the most appropriate way of regulating such exports. In addition, during discussions on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002, the government also undertook to amend the Customs regulations to implement a ban on the import of viable materials derived from human embryo clones. I will not be supporting this amendment and advocate that people who are supporting the bill not support this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>6892</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Health and Ageing asked where I got my information from. I got it from a number of scientists, but I am not relying on that. One source that I thought could be relied on is the Parliamentary Library, which is absolutely straight down the middle and has no bias either way. I have asked a number of scientists and I have affirmation that you can clone from stem cells, but tonight I will read the advice that I got from the libraryâand this backs up what I had been told by eminent scientists. The advice states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>So-called therapeutic cloning: the technique involves cloning human embryos not for the purpose of allowing them to develop under birth but to extract certain cells. The so-called embryonic stem cells from them grow them into tissues for developing therapies for adults suffering. For certain diseases, the embryos are created by nucleus substitution using nuclear from the adult patient, thus the stem cells are clones for the patient and have potential to grow into any types of tissue and disease. The removal of stem cells results in the destruction of the embryo.</para></quote><para>Let us not just rely on that information. It is an important issue but there are more important issues. We should apply the same standards on the use of embryos and stem cells outside Australia as we apply in Australia. In Australia we do not allow trade in human tissue; we do not allow the commercialisation of many thingsâfor instance, blood. We ban trading in human tissues and we ban cloning. Once those stem cells or embryos are exported overseas, Australia has no control over the use of those products with respect to mixed cloning or whatever.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:52:00</time.stamp><page.no>6892</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â Just for clarification, the implication in Senator Boswell's initial contribution was to `clone'âI think he used that wordâfrom stem cells.

That is the issue. Senator Boswell may have additional information of which I am not awareâthat is possible, although, as I said, I do read widely in the area because it interests meâbut I would think that it is appropriate for anybody listening to the debate and for senators making a decision to know that. That is not what the Parliamentary Library's information indicates. I want to be doubly sure that Senator Boswell does not have information to which I am not privy, because I would be concerned about that. I showed good faith last time, when I was concerned about the export of embryos, in that I went to the Prime Minister.

The material that was read out by Senator Boswell is 100 per cent correct, as we all acknowledge. I think the confusion has been about some people describing SCNT as developing and culturing the embryonic stem cell in tissue and then using that tissue for transfer for therapeutic purposes. That is sometimes incorrectly called `therapeutic cloning', and that is a misnomer that has been recognised in the report of the community affairs committee. Senator Patterson is correct, and Senator Boswell is correct in stating what his advisers have told him. The technique of cloning is the same whether the resulting embryo is for transfer to the body of a woman or for the harvesting of stem cellsâit involves the destruction of that human embryo. As everyone around here knows now, although it was not evident in the House of Representatives debate at all, the cloning technique, the somatic cell nuclear transfer process, is the same whether the resulting embryo is transferred to a woman or whether it is harvested for its stem cells to be cultured for so-called therapy. It is not very therapeutic for the embryo, I suppose.</para></talk.start><para>I support the amendment. I think it is very important for a number of reasons. The commercial area is an important reason. We are coming to that particular issue in the debate. It is in one of the following amendments, and there will be a number of other amendments. As Senator Boswell has said, once the embryonic stem cell leaves the country, there is no way that we have any control over what happens to that human embryo. I ask the minister: could the licensing committee, for example, impose a requirement on the applicant that stem cells derived from the excess ART embryos are not sent overseas? Is it possible for the licensing committee to exercise that function? Would the licensing committee be able to make that a condition?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>6893</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThis amendment, which seeks to ban the export of human embryonic stem cells or stem cell products, is not supported by the Democrats.

I believe that is a perfectly legitimate activity for scientists. I have no problem with the export of stem cell products. I thank the minister for raising her query in relation to Senator Boswell's contribution. I was similarly curious to hear his comments in relation to cloning from stem cells. I also have to thank Senator Harradine because I think he clarified the matter for the benefit of the chamber. This is obviously going to be an ongoing area of debate, but I believe my understanding and that of the minister are the same.</para><para>I do not think we have explicit evidence that demonstrates that cloning from stem cells can be or has been done. I think the only evidence that has been provided to us in the committee stage of the bill concerned an exampleâI am not sure how many years ago; the advisers of the minister may be able to assistâin relation to stem cells bedded on top of a bed of embryos, resulting in the production of an embryo. But I am not quite sure whether scientists know whether that was produced as a consequence of the stem cells or whether it was a consequence of the embryo. I look forward to the continuation of the debate about whether stem cells are totipotent as opposed to pluripotentâbut perhaps not tonight. </para><para>I thank Senator Harradine for his contribution. If Senator Boswell did have anything further on that issue, I am sure we would all be keen to hear it, but I think we have resolved that we are not dealing with the issue of cloning embryos from stem cell lines. Having said that, I indicate again that the Democrats will not be supporting this amendment. We believe that the trade on prohibited embryos has been satisfactorily dealt with under the previous legislation that we have debated.

I believe we have the Minister for Health and Ageing indicating that the government has the intention of altering the Customs legislation.

I believe it adds to it. It brings absolute clarity that, under any circumstances whatsoever, it is an offence to export a human embryo, embryonic stem cell or product. What doesn't the amendment do? It does not in any way prohibit the production of adult stem cells. I believe it does not prohibit in any way the ability of researchers to develop adult stem cell lines. Therefore it is only impacting on embryonic stem cells. I have received, as all senators in this chamber would have received, enormous amounts of correspondence in relation to this legislation. It has overwhelmingly called on this chamber to reject, except for IVF purposes, experimentation on or trade in human embryos. In conclusion, I indicate that One Nation will be supporting Senator Boswell's amendment. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>6895</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI rise to support the amendment. We do not have an international agreement in this area, and this legislation is not reflecting an international code of ethics or conduct for experimentation with embryos or human embryonic cells. Without that, there is no safeguard that can be applied to the export of these entities to another country. They can export them on, which could have them put to a different use. We are hearing from the government assurances that within this country there will be quite clear policing and overseeing of the use of embryos and embryonic material for experimental purposes. We are not havingâand we cannot haveâ any such safeguards applying to exported material. We know that exported materials from Australia are simply not going to have those safeguards in place. That, to me, is the case. If we had another country which had mirror legislation to this then a dual arrangement could be arrived at, but we do not. Until we do, I will support this amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>6895</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI wish to indicate my support for the amendment. This happens to go to a very important matter that will come forward in the next amendment, relating to trading in embryonic stem cells. The real problem here is the issue that was raised in support of this amendmentâthat is, there is no way you can keep track of where embryonic stem cells are going to end up or for what purpose they will be used in another country. Singapore has been used as an example. </para></talk.start><para>The other matter is that in the Senate Community Affairs Committee meetings and hearings it was acknowledged that this legislation does not prevent the selling of embryonic stem cells derived from human embryos to their destruction, to the highest bidder overseas. That is the real problem, if you are going to talk about the availability of possible cures in Australia, because it is going to cost you. It is only going to be the people who have the money who will be able to pay for it. That is it in a nutshell. I do not believe they are going to miss out on much because, as we know and as was presented to the committee, there is no proven principle about the efficacy of the so-called utilisation of embryonic stem cells for therapy. I support this amendment and I also support the points that have been made.</para><para>On the matter that Senator Boswell raised, I think that we are clear all round. I have heard, however, of the possibilityâand it is only a possibilityâthat, instead of having somatic cell nuclear transfer, in fact it would be embryonic cell nuclear transfer. But for what purpose, unless it was for the testing of drugs and so on? The push for cloning will come from those sources which realise that the use of embryonic stem cells in therapy is nonsense for a number of reasons, not least of which is that they are histo-incompatible with the DNA of the patient. They think, `How will we get around this? We'll get around this by taking a somatic cell from the patient and placing that into an enucleated egg, having an electrical charge and Bob's your uncle'âor Bob's your embryo! It is gross. I was very interested to hear what the minister said about the approval aspect, and I hope that the NHMRC might make it a condition to explain to the donor all the options that the donor has for requiring that their embryos or the products therefrom will not be exported.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>6895</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI indicate on behalf of the Labor Party that we will be opposing Senator Boswell's amendment for many of the reasons that Senator Stott Despoja outlined and because we had this debate during the debate on the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>âwhich was the place to have it.

Trade in human tissues is prohibited in every state of the Commonwealth.

The prohibition of trade in human tissue is important and has facilitated the existence of relatively inexpensive, efficient and universally available blood bank and organ transplant services. The creation of the lawful possibility of trade in human cells and tissues, and thus a market for them, would prevent a similar development occurring in relation to human tissues and human cells derived by culturing human cells. Such commercialisation would restrict access to human tissues and cells arising from cell cultures to those who could afford them. I would be interested to hear what the Labor Party has to say about that.</para><para>The prohibition on trade in human tissue has been an admirable feature of Australian society. The blood bank and organ transplantation services are part of Australia's social capital and the envy of the world for their low cost, high standard, efficiency and universal availability. Trade in human tissue and blood parts is thought by many to involve disrespect for the social and moral significance of humans.

Look at where the `scientific knowledge' took us when it created the nuclear bomb, chemicalbiological weapons etc. How do we know that human cloning isn't going to be used in a similar light.

Senator Harradine's amendments also go to the definition of the human embryo: `human tissue includes a cell, cells or cultured cells that have a human genome or an altered human genome'. It has been indicated that Italy is moving towards legislation that will ban human cloning. Ultimately, scientists are going to be looking for the availability of human sperm, human eggs or already-created human embryos.

By getting the states to be uniform in their approach, it is much easier to monitor what the states are doing. If a state wants to then change something, to be part of a team and to get other states involved in it, that state will need to come in at that three-year review. I believe it makes this much more open and transparent, rather than having a state doing something without the rest of the country understanding what they are doing. The states have agreed, through COAG, that this is of such importance that we have to have cooperative federalism. Very rarely have we seen this happen, that the states have come to a point where they are prepared to agree to bring state legislation into line. This will make it very obvious if a state steps out of line over trading in human tissue, for example. Before this, it was not as clear. Because of this agreement, I believe we will have a much more transparent system. It will be much easier for the public to be more informed about what is happening, rather than having a state being able to go off on a frolic of its own. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>6898</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI thank the minister for her comments.

There was no attempt to hide that. It is perfectly clear that this is about human tissue, human sperm, human eggs or human embryos and includes, because of the definition, human embryonic stem cells. It is required in this legislation, I believe, because this will be template legislation, and this is a chance for the states to make sure that this is observed in the various state legislation. Let me remind honourable senators that we are talking about procedures which a lot of people are placing false hope in and which, because of commercialisation, will only be available to those who can afford them. So embryonic stem cell cultures, if they are going to be of any use at all, will be only available to those who can afford them.</para></talk.start><para>As I pointed out, we are talking about state laws here. It is important because, according to a number of state laws, the human tissue is defined as being obtained by removal from a human body.

That is why there is a need to ensure that the medical procedures that would be facilitated and made lawful by this proposed act of parliament avoid the problems of existing laws.</para><para>In regard to trading, the payment of reasonable expenses is taken as being approved. Reasonable expenses obviously need to be paid. This proposed amendment would not prohibit that aspect at all. We are not talking about valuable consideration here.

It seems to me that when this issue is properly clarified we should be able to proceed with Senator Harradine's amendment.</para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>6900</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIn view of that, I am prepared to seek leave to postpone consideration of this amendment until a later hour of the day.

Senator Harradine's reference to the supply of blood in Australia is an extremely good one. We should comprehensively apply that to the supply of human tissue, whatever its derivation. While it is interesting to find out what the current situation is regarding adult stem cells, this amendment has the power of a good argument and I would not like to see it set aside even if it does turn out that there is trade in adult stem cells. In fact, if that were the case, it would be a very good thing if a stop was put to it.</para></talk.start><para>One of the concerns I have overarching this legislation is that a driving power for the legislation is commercial interest. That is totally inappropriate to the outcomes that are being predicted by those who most strongly support this legislationâthat is, it is being pushed for the purpose of getting curative outcomes for humans who have illnesses or problems of one sort or another. I am concerned that that is really in some cases subsidiary to the commercial advantage that corporations and others can see coming out of stem cell experimentation. Whether it be adult or embryonic stem cells, I do not think we should have provision for that.

In other words, the Commonwealth minister and also all states and territories will be examining the credentials of potential nominees to the NHMRC Licensing Committee and ensuring that they do not have a conflict of interest that would preclude them from working on the NHMRC Licensing Committee. Also, all potential members who are to be appointed to NHMRC committees must fill out a form and make a declaration accepting membership nomination and declaring any conflicts of interest. This occurs before recommendations relating to appointments are finalised and ensures that the minister and, in the case of the chair of the NHMRC Licensing Committee, the states and territories have all the relevant information available to them regarding the interests of the people who have been nominated.

This legislation is not going to be a burden. Undoubtedly regulations will be made and, in the fullness of time, like all regulations, they will be a disallowable instrument.

The amendment to clause 16 of the bill requires that regulations must be made prescribing matters that may constitute a conflict of interest for a member of the NHMRC Licensing Committee. Senator Hogg may be aware the bill before us provides that the NHMRC Licensing Committee is to be taken to be a principal committee of the NHMRC for the purposes of National Health and Medical Research Council Act 1992. The reason this was done in this way is that many of the administrative provisions that apply to other principal committees of the NHMRC, such as the Australian Health Ethics Committee, can also apply to the NHMRC Licensing Committee. </para><para>In accordance with the requirements of the NHMRC Act, the NHMRC has issued procedures relating to the disclosure of interest in the event that an issue arises as part of a committee's consideration of a matter. These procedures that currently apply to all of the existing principal committees of the NHMRC will also apply to the NHMRC Licensing Committee. Once the NHMRC Licensing Committee has been established and has had the opportunity to review the procedures, it may wish to detail additional procedures. Provision has therefore been made in the legislation for this to be addressed through the making of regulationsâand I refer senators to clause 13(4) of the bill. </para><para>There is, however, a big difference between including a clause in legislation stating that regulations may be made if necessary and Senator Hogg's amendment that states that regulations must be made. I am advised by the Office of Parliamentary Counsel that it is entirely inappropriate to compel the Governor-General to make regulations. In effect, this amounts to binding the sovereign to a particular course of action. This is contrary to the Acts Interpretation Act that refers in section 48 to an act conferring a power to make regulations rather than a requirement that such regulations be made. Furthermore, to our knowledge, this approach is unprecedented in Commonwealth legislation or in regulation making powers of which the Office of Parliamentary Counsel is aware are permissive.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>6903</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator HOGG</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI have heard what the minister had to say.

I think there is some validity in that. The NHMRC must take a very good look at itself and have a look at what it has been doing to see whether or not it has ensured that weight is given to the ethical questions that are involved in a number of research proposals which are funded by the NHMRC. This is certainly not to question the intentions of the NHMRC but members of parliament have received a certain missive from the University of Tasmania about the treatment that Tasmanians have been getting from the NHMRC because of the round robin effect of a number of these grants. The same people are getting the same grants and are being assessed by people in similar institutions and so on. The question really does need to be looked at.</para><para>Let us go to the amendments.

On the conflict of interest clause, amendment (2) on sheet 2696 seeks to add after subclause (4) the words: </para><quote><para>The Minister must not appoint as a member a person who has a continuing personal, professional or pecuniary conflict of interest with the functions of the NHMRC Licensing Committee.</para></quote><para>The amendment that I am moving has the effect that a person may not be appointed to the NHMRC Licensing Committee if there is a continuing personal, professional or pecuniary conflict. There are many examples of similar protective provisions in Commonwealth legislation. I mention just four of them: the National Environment Protection Measures (Implementation) Act 1998, the Trade Practices Act 1974, the Australian Tourist Commission Act 1987 and the Australian Film Commission Act 1975.</para><para>The third amendment on sheet 2696 is the addition of clause 16A. The background of this proposal is that, if a conflict of interest arises for a member of the NHMRC Licensing Committee, it must be disclosed and the member cannot take part in deliberations in relation to that particular matter. There are numerous examples in Commonwealth laws of disclosure of interests that are required. Again, the proposed amendments are consistent with precedentâfor example, the International Air Services Commission Act 1992 requires that a member must disclose any interest, whether monetary or otherwise, that would conflict with proper performance of functions and must not further take part in proceedings except with the consent of other members and parties, if any. </para><para>The Australian Film Commission Act provides that a person is not eligible for appointment if there is a conflict of interest, which is in similar language to the proposed amendment and is also referred to above. As I said, it is a very important area. I am sure that the minister appreciates, as I do, that COAG did make a point of agreeing to the need for strict regulatory provisions. Of course, this whole question of conflict of interest is one which I am sure those honourable senators in the chamber and those senators who are not here, who are involved in transparency and accountability for the actions of parliament, would agree. I put that forward in the hope that the minister might be able to enlighten me as to what the current situation is.

Firstly, I acknowledge the arguments put forward by the Minister for Health and Ageing, particularly the fact that we know that the legislation can provide for regulations as required in relation to this issue. But I ask the minister, or indeed perhaps Senator Harradine, about the wording of amendment (2) and particularly subclause (3) of amendment (3), which defines a conflict of interest as `any interest, personal, pecuniary, professional or otherwise, that could conflict with the proper performance' et cetera. Presumably this broad ranging definition could encapsulate any sort of relationship or interest, such as an acquaintance or someoneâthemselves or perhaps their spouseâwho had an IVF treatment. </para></talk.start><para>I am wondering if my interpretation is too broad, or is my impression correct that the broad ranging nature of this definition could leave itself open to that interpretation, in which case I would be curious to know who could possibly meet such a criterion. Is it not a possibility that it may be very difficult to find someone who would meet that criterion, especially someone who has the expertise in IVF and stem cell science? We could be looking at a licensing committee with no expertise in stem cell science or ART, while recognising that the purpose of the licensing committee is precisely to make informed judgments about licensing applications which necessarily means that they should have that expertise. I know that Senator Harradine provided the precedent but, given the unique nature of this legislation, I am wondering whether or not it is the case, in my interpretation of the broad ranging definition, that we might find it very difficult to find the appropriate people to serve on the licensing committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>6906</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âI am not sure that I understand what Senator Stott Despoja means, but if she is asking me the question I would answer by saying that these clauses were drafted in accordance with the accountability and transparency provisions of a number of pieces of legislation. They were all brought together by the draftsperson from a range of legislation. That is about all that I can say about it. In respect of the purpose of this section, if you look at clause 3, the key words there are `that could conflict with the proper performance of the member's functions' in relation to that matter. If you look at the proper performance of the member's functions in respect of whether `interest' has a definition of its own in the legislative sense, it is not just a case of, `Yes, I've got an interest in this subject.' But you have a point there. I must follow up on the meaning of `personal'. You do have a point there and, for my own satisfaction, I will find out the reason for that word.

As we have just discussed, there are safeguards against a person who has a direct pecuniary interest being appointed, but my opinion is that it is clearly outlined that these are the sorts of people who ought to be on the committee.

I do not think that is good enough. The Minister for Health and Ageing says that some person is going to be on a board or a committee that is funded by drug companies. If that board is dealing with issues relating to drug companies, it is quite improper for that person to be a member of such an organisation, committee, licensing board or whatever it is. With this legislation you are proposing to allow access to excess ART embryos. I am not sure that you went as far as to say that that is quite appropriate and proper, but it may well be that it should preclude a person whose organisation is funded substantially by the very industry to which you are going to give access to excess ART embryos. I do not think that is an appropriate circumstance. For a person who has expertise in ART, at least that is up-front and we know what that person's views are. I also raise the question: if this licensing committee is to determine the applications for the use of excess ART embryosâthat is to say, where their use is not exemptâhow does the person with expertise in ART get a guernsey and why? That is the question to the minister: how does the person described in clause 16(1)(d) as `a person with expertise in assisted reproductive technology' get a guernsey for that?

I also want to put my views on the record. I did not have time to anticipate what Senator Murphy was referring to. Senator Murphy says that the Patents Act does not deal with this or that there may be deficiencies in relation to this area of research. Of course the Patents Act is, by necessity, general. It is a broad-ranging piece of legislation. The characteristics which define your success in an application for a patent are `novel' and `inventive'. I think, off the top of my head, that is the actual wording in the law. I am not sure that it necessarily has to specify any particular type of research or scientific discovery. I imagine it works in parallel with the Patents Act. I am not quite sure about the issue of it being overridden, but perhaps that is something we can get advisers to look into. </para></talk.start><para>But I would still imagine that anyone would have to satisfy the criteria of inventiveness and novelty under patent law. Hence the argument of some of us that genes and gene sequences are, by their very nature, unique and novel and therefore they should not be patented. That is not to say, as I have said previously, that the processes by which you derive information about a cure or the purposes for which you use those genes cannot be patented, because that is novel and inventive or unique. But our actual genes and our gene sequences should not be patented at all. I would be curious to get some information on this, but my understanding is that it should not necessarily hold up this debate per se, because I am not quite sure if the implications for the Patents Act are such that they need necessarily hold up the debate in relation to clause 24 on licensing or indeed clause 18 now. With all due respect, if Senator Murphy wants to draw up the amendment and have a debate, bring it on. I think it would be a very interesting one.

The Australian Greens are proposing a national stem cell bank. It should be established before any licences are issued under the proposed licensing system set out in the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline>. The aim of our two amendments on sheet 2713 is to ensure that the stem cell bank is established. We are seeking support for this amendment because it is stronger than that proposed by Senator McLucas and Senator Stott Despoja for the review of the legislation to consider whether a national stem cell bank should be established. The review in their alternative amendment will commence two years after the act receives royal assent. It may take 12 monthsâthe bill does not include a reporting dateâand the report of the review is to be presented to the Council of Australian Governments with no requirements for COAG to act and no mechanism to bring the matter before the Commonwealth parliament again. Providing for the review to examine this matter in two years time means that it could take three or four years before a stem cell bank is operational for the nation. There are really compelling reasons to establish that bank now, and through this amendment parliament should provide the mechanism for doing so. </para></talk.start></continue><para>Madam Temporary Chairman McLucas, as you know the House of Lords report earlier this year supporting the establishment of a human stem cell bank in the United Kingdom stated that it would lead to fewer embryos being used for stem cell research than would be the case without such a bank. That is a desirable outcome of itself. The UK bank would be a repository for existing and new, adult, foetal and embryonic stem cell lines. An Australian stem cell bank would address the concerns of researchers about not having access to stem cell lines because the institutions and/or companies that discover stem cells and develop stem cell lines obtain intellectual property rights over them. </para><para>The bank would also address the patenting of human stem cells, which concerns the Australian Greens and clearly other members of the Senate, judging from the debate that we heard just a moment ago. Human stem cells should not become the property of private corporations or institutions. Let me reiterate that, because that is a very strong point as far as the Greens are concerned: human stem cells should not become the property of private corporations or institutions. If they should be found to enable the development of therapies that improve the quality of life for people with serious, debilitating diseases or conditions then access to them to develop therapies should not be constrained because of private rights. The bank would provide access for accredited researchers to the stem cell lines.</para><para>It is not necessary to wait until the British stem cell bankâwhich was, as I earlier indicated, announced in Septemberâis operational to begin work on establishing an Australian human stem cell bank. We do not need to take the British model and apply it wholly to our country, but of course we can draw on it to formulate our own model. Waiting two years, as the alternative amendment would do, to begin examining whether we should have a stem cell bank may enable the patenting of human stem cell lines in the meantime in a bid to beat the establishment of the bank. This could undermine the purpose of the bank, which is to ensure that human stem cell lines are held in a public repository and are available to all accredited researchers.</para><para>We think that the Australian Health Ethics Committee is the most appropriate body to undertake an investigation into the establishment of the bank. It has the expertise in the area, it is operational and it would obviate establishing a new body to undertake the investigation. We want that investigation to be public, and that is provided for in our amendment. We are proposing that the report of the investigation be made public by being tabled in parliament, and we have set a date for itâ1 July 2003âto ensure that it happens. We have given some guidance on what the bank should doâfor example, provide a repository for human stem cell lines and make human stem cell lines available to accredited bodies for approved research. Of course, it may have additional, related functions depending on the investigation's outcome.</para><para>As far as we know, only the UK is moving to establish such a bank, and that is not operational as yet. We acknowledge that this is a new field, but the bank is a vital component of our perception of any regulatory regime dealing with human stem cell research. It will be critical to our evaluation of this legislation once we get to the third reading stage. We are confident that Australian experts, in consultation with the public, can develop the arrangements for the bank so that Australia can ensure that market forces and profit motives do not constrain this area of research and the promise it may hold. I strongly commend to the Senate this first amendment of Senator Nettle's. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>6913</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âIt is particularly appropriate, Senator McLucas, that you are in the chair, given your advocacy of this issue through amendments to this and the other legislation, the fact that you were involved in a Senate committee and that you put this in our report, and that this is also a line of questioning that we both pursued during that committee process. As a consequence of that process, Iâand I will not presume to speak on your behalf, Chairâwas certainly convinced of the merits of investigating the applicability of a stem cell bank for Australia. I think that the idea of establishing a national stem cell bank in this country has merit. It deserves closer investigation, hence the recommendation by Senators McLucas, Webber and me in the Senate committee report. In the debate on the prohibition of human cloning, this chamber overwhelmingly supported an amendment, moved on behalf of Senator McLucas and me, to require that the independent review examine the applicability of a national stem cell bank. As I referred to earlier, the high point for me was the voting process, with 53 senators in favour of that amendment, and I hope that that level of support will continue.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Nettle's amendment presupposes the establishment of a stem cell bank, either through the process that the Senate has already agreed to or through some yet to be debated mechanism. On that point I will sayâthrough you, Chairâto Senator Brown: I want to pick up one point that you made about the review going to COAG. The legislation has been amended: the review gets tabled in parliament. So I say to those people who are not aware that that change has been made: that was an amendment that was successfully made to the legislation.</para><para>One thing we do have to bear in mind of course is that we are dealing with different regulatory environments and different intellectual property environments. We do not know about the suitability of a stem cell bank in relation to Australia. We do not know if the UK model is the most appropriate. My great concern is that there has not really been an examination of the IP environment relating to stem cell sciences. This is a point that has been touched upon not only in debate tonight, prompted by Senator Murphy, but also in many other debates on this and other legislation. I think it is premature to simply assume that a stem cell bank is the best option. I like this option and I want it investigated. But, having been involved in the debate on patents in relation to genes and on the issues of gene technology and having actually looked at legislationâor the lack of itânot just in Australia but in other parts of the world since I got into the Senate, I know that we cannot just cook up an answer overnight, especially when there has been minimalâif any; I would argue negligibleâinvestigation of the current IP environment in relation to these issues in Australia. Hence the second reading amendment that I moved on behalf of the Australian Democrats requesting a new reference to the ALRC and to AHEC to examine patenting issues and IP issues in stem cell sciences.</para><para>It may well be that such an examination results in an IP regime that makes a key rationale for establishing a stem cell bank entirely redundantâthat is, access for bona fide researchers to unencumbered stem cell lines. In addition, a consequence of this amendment is to delay the issuing of licences by at least 12 months and possibly two to three years, even if we assume of course that a stem cell bank will in fact be established. I think a number of people have concerns about that in relation to the issuing of licences; certainly some people would not mind.</para><para>But in relation to the general debate on patents, and specifically in relation to genes, I am very concerned that we are looking for a literally overnight solution to much more complex issues about intellectual property. It has been mentioned tonight that there needs to be an examination of/orâin Senator Murphy's terminologyâpossible amendments to the Patents Act. I do not know how much of that we can and should be doing in the context of this legislative debate. On the one hand, I am gratified to hear people talking about these issues but, on the other, I do remind honourable senators that every attempt by me over the last five years to establish a Senate select committee into these patenting issues has been opposed and lost. That is apart from Senator Harradine's support, which I acknowledge here again, two or three times in relation to not only the prohibition of cloning but the broader debate about genetic technology. At the time I was producing amendment bills and private member's bills, the government's argument to me, which I am probably throwing back at everyone now, was, `Look, you have got to examine these issues properly.' I was gratified to see that we got an ALRC inquiry into, for example, genetic privacy, and I ask in the Senate tonight: how many senators here have put in a submission to that inquiry? I do not doubt people's concern about this issue. Through you, Chair: Senator Evans, have you? </para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>â</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>âRight, because I was about to stand corrected. Obviously, we are all busy and we have different portfolios and different responsibilities, but you only have to look at that first report that has been tabled by the ALRC to recognise that these are complex issues. I like the idea of a stem cell bank; otherwise, I would not have supported Senator McLucas not only in her comments but in an amendment that we have cosponsored. But I am not going to pretend that the establishment of a stem cell bank should happen overnight, and that should not be read by anyone in the community, given that we are apparently now broadcasting, or by anyone else in this chamber as a lack of interest in the broader issues in relation to patents and intellectual property rights. I challenge anyone in the chamber to show where there has not been extensive research by me on behalf of the Democrats on this issue, so let us investigate it. </para></talk.start></continue><para>If the issue is a delay in the licensing, through you, Chair, to Senator Brown and Senator Nettle: if you are talking about delay, whether that is an unintended consequence or an intended consequence let us perhaps talk about that. Should the licensing provisions be delayed? Certainly I have spoken to other senators who believe that. I am not suggesting that is my personal opinion. But let us do this right, because we may find another model. If people are going to refer to the UK legislation then let us refer to it, because it is quite different from the legislation we are debating. In fact, as you know, the stem cell bank proposal was not legislated for, as I understand it. Certainly, as Senator Brown said, it came out through the House of Lords inquiry; it was a recommendation. It was established on 9 September, a very good day I should acknowledge.</para><para>I think that we should be very wary of this one size fits all approach. We have not adopted legislation that is exactly the same as in other parts of the world, and there is good reason for that. I do not think we can take on exactly the same model that applies in the UK without comprehensive investigation. That was the intent of the amendment to the last bill; it is the intent of Senator McLucas and my belief of what should happen with this bill. As I say, please do not read that as a lack of support for the notion or the concept, but I do not believe that this amendment is correct. On behalf of the Democrats, I indicate that we will not be supporting this model and I appeal to those senators who supported us on the previous amendment to support the concept.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>6914</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>â The amendment moved by Senator Brown in the name of Senator Nettle is proposing a new clause, 19A.

The establishment of a stem cell bank is likely to raise a number of difficult and complex issues which will take some time to resolve. The process should not be hurried. While I will support an amendment to this bill requiring that the review of legislation include a consideration of the feasibility of establishing a national stem cell bank, I do not support delaying the implementation of legislation until such a bank is established, if indeed it is determined to be necessary to establish one at all. One of the effects of this amendment of which Senator Nettle may not be aware is that, if the licensing committee cannot issue any licences before the establishment of a national stem cell bank, this will effectively ban all ART related research, including non-destructive research. None of the ART training and quality assurance activities that rely on the use of excess ART embryos have anything to do with the derivation of stem cells or associated issues of access and intellectual property. Yet all would be prohibited until the establishment of the national stem cell bank. This would effectively bring ART clinical practice to a standstill. </para><para>I wanted to indicate that Professor Pettigrew indicated to me that there are international discussions on stem cell banks. This is being organised by the Medical Research Council in the United Kingdom, with an invitation being extended to the CEO of the NHMRC to participate. Other countries which have been invited include the USA, Canada, Israel and some European countries. Obviously this is an issue which has brought international concern and involvement. I think that the establishment of a human stem cell bank in Australia ought to be considered in the light of the international discussions as well. I thought honourable senators in the chamber would be interested to know that there is international discussion about stem cell banks. I will not be supporting the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>6915</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe point of the amendment is to meet many of the concerns that senators, including Democrat senators, have expressed about the complex and difficult ethical and social issues that come out of the experimentation with stem cells. We have got a back-to-front argument that says we cannot stop this process, that we have to allow it to continue before we put in place or find the best safeguard which is easily identifiable, is expert and is able to handle those issues. It is back to front. What the Greens are saying is that we should have a national stem cell bank that will regulate and license the use of stem cells. This will prevent patenting, which will allow that research to be driven by commercial gain, or will shut out other potential benefits coming from it. If this bank is not supported then we go without that benefit. This is a matter that we will have to continue debating in the morningâI am aware that there are only 15 seconds left in this debate. Let me say that it is a crucial matter as far as I am concerned. Some members have been talking about amendments to this bank idea, so let us have them.

Union leaders were rightly incensed by the move. Clearly Mr Abbott was using the industry as a political football. In establishing the royal commission, the Howard government has sought to implement an industrial agenda that will curtail the rights and entitlements of workers in the Australian building and construction industry. In light of significant indications that anti-union legislation will be introduced into parliament early next year, I want to reflect on this war of words.</para></talk.start><para>The Royal Commission into the Building and Construction Industry, the Cole commission, was set the task of examining matters relating to the building and construction industry. A special mandate to include any unlawful or otherwise inappropriate practices focused the commission on eradicating corruption and coercion within the building industry. This appears a noble task, with the CFMEU having reported serious issues of corruption in the industry in 2001. In fact, there are a range of matters in the building industry that require government attention. These include a series of large-scale GST scams in the industry, which have threatened the security of workers' entitlements, and occupational health and safety standards that are being dangerously disregarded at the cost of workers' lives and health. </para><para>These are serious issues that affect Australian families. They must be addressed by government. Yet the Howard government, with Minister Abbott leading the charge, are far more concerned with political point scoring and fulfilling their economic agenda at the expense of workers' wages, rights and conditions than they are in cleaning up the building industry. Immediately prior to the establishment of the Cole commission, Mr Abbott heralded it as:</para><para>... a real chance, a once-in-a-lifetime chance, to clean up this very important industry, this industry that has been a hotbed of industrial and economic trouble. It's the last bastion of old-fashioned, ultra-militant, bloody-minded and quasi-Marxist unionism.</para><para>This gets to the bare bones of the issueâMr Abbott's focus is not cleaning up the industry but rather a new round of union bashing.</para><para>In contrast, Labor politicians have argued consistently at state and federal levels that there are many real issues that need redressing in the building and construction industry. Predicably, in the midst of general antiunion rhetoric from the coalition, the real focus of Mr Abbott's attention is those traits of the CFMEU, proud traits of militancy and convictionâthe union working with, and standing up for, its members. A unionised and militant work force contradicts the coalition's conservative agenda, which places private profit above the rights of ordinary Australians.</para><para>The Cole commission has been set the task of legitimising what John Sutton, the National Secretary of the CFMEU, Construction Division, predicts will be a raft of legislative changes which would seek to undermine the strength and rights of the CFMEU. These legislative changes may well include the possible deregistration of the union. The effect of this would be disastrous for the hundreds of thousands of building and construction workers around the country. The deep concern and anger felt by building workers is in evidence through the rallies held and attended by thousands of building workers from across the country outside the Cole commission hearings. Their feelings were summed up well by Peter Lewis from Worker's Online, when he said:</para><quote><para>... ordinary building workersâ</para></quote><para>realise thatâ</para><quote><para>their jobs will be more dangerous and less secure as a result of the Abbott-Cole agenda. They're the ones who are going to get hurt and they are beginning to realise that it is them, not just their union, who is being set up for the biggest sucker punch in recent political history.</para></quote><para>In retaliation to this, Minister Abbott claims: </para><quote><para>... the problems of this industry are costing taxpayers, they are costing consumers, they are costing the economy and they are costing jobs.</para></quote><para>This is aimed purely at arousing antiunion sentiment by attempting to lay the blame where it does not belong. Mr Abbott has consistently made these claims in the context of job productivity in the building industry, arguing that corruption and coercion on the part of the union in relation to industrial action are driving up the costs of construction in Australia. However, statistics fly in the face of these claims. One of the most recent discussion papers produced by the Cole royal commission, the Tasman economics paper, warns:</para><quote><para>... reducing strike activity is not a panacea for improving productivity.</para></quote><para>Workers whose rights are legislated against, in denying their rights to organise and to strike, will not kowtow to business demands of increased productivity. Also, these claims of the need to increase productivity are also questionableâlabour productivity in the Australian industry ranks near the top of OECD nations. An Access Economics report from 1999 placed only the United Kingdom in front of Australia. This means that productivity in Australia ranks higher than that in the United States, which has far more restrictive trade union regulation than Australia, and so supports the suggestions of the Tasman economics paper that stamping on the rights of workers to organise will not increase productivity in the industry. Mr Abbott's focus goes against statistical and historical evidence, and belies a dogged ideological opposition to the rights of workers to organise. And costing consumers? What of this question? John Sutton rightly pointed out that this claim was made against the very industry that delivered the grounds and infrastructure for the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games before time and under budget. </para><para>In Melbourne, where Mr Abbott and the Cole commission's most vicious arguments have been levelled, there is wide acknowledgment that:</para><quote><para>... despite union agitation, theâ</para></quote><para>Melbourneâ</para><quote><para>CBD skyline has continued to boom under the Bracks Labor Government. </para></quote><para>One of the most proud and militant unions in the country, the Victorian Branch of the CFMEU, has worked with the Bracks government, which has no irrational ideological opposition to trade unionism and continues to ensure workers are accorded decent pay and conditions to get the job done.</para><para>It is not the union, or building and construction workers, that are costing Australian taxpayers, the economy and consumers. It is the Cole commission itself. The Cole commission has to date cost Australian taxpayers almost $50 million. The victims of corruption in the building and construction industry are overwhelmingly workers and their families, yet the Howard government has moved prior to the handing down of the commission's report to establish a task force with the aim of weakening their union representation. The government is not sticking up for these workers, and at the same time it is weakening the union that is trying to stick up for them. If the government were serious about these protections, far more would be invested in eradicating corporate crime which in the past couple of years has left thousands of Australians jobless. The government, in funding a witch-hunt aimed at legitimising its own unpopular industrial agenda, is costing taxpayers and consumers the most.</para><para>I will not support any proposed legislation that seeks to implement the coalition's anti-union agenda at the expense of Australian working families. I passionately agree that there are issues that need to be addressed urgently and with government action in the building industry. Most notably, the implementation of occupational health and safety standards in the industry must be ensured for the protection of building and construction workers across the country. Workers' entitlements must be protected and corruption eradicated from the industry. Unlike Mr Abbott, however, I see trade unionism as a means of ensuring these conditions for Australian workers. Unionism is part of the Australian tradition and Australian valuesâ mateship, a fair go and working together to make things better.

Given there are several biopharmaceutic companies in Australiaâincluding the federally funded CRC for bioproductsâthat are actually conducting research on pharma-foods, can the Minister tell us if the Government has any protocols or measures in place in relation to biopharmaceutical research and the potential application, sale and use of those technologies and techniques? Specifically, can the Minister assure us as to what the Government is doing to make sure that the technologies and techniques are not used for illicit purposes, such as the production, sale and consumption of illicit drugs or drugs that would otherwise require a prescription? Also, can we find out what the Government is doing to ensure that the technologies that are being developed are not used by organisations for terrorism purposes?</para><para>I ask a supplementary question. I thank the Minister for the offer, again, to take it on notice. I ask when the Minister believes when she will have that information available for the Senate, and if she can include information as to what exact research is taking place in relation to biopharmaceuticals in Australia, particularly in relation to those that are receiving federal funds through the CRC. Can the minister also undertake to advise the Senate when protocols and measures will be in place, as well as her analysis as to whether the Gene Technology Act and the former ANZFA regulations are appropriate? I think that the Minister should have at least known by today what applications were available. I look forward to hearing from the Minister. </para><para>I will incorporate the answer to the senator's questions of 18 November 2002, into the answer to the questions of 19 November 2002.</para><para>There have been recent media reports highlighting concerns about so-called âBiopharmingâ in the United States. Biopharming is an outgrowth of genetic engineering where scientists insert genes that instruct a plant to make a specific chemical compound. By introducing novel genes, plants are in effect turned into pharmaceutical factories that express the desired drug in their leaves or seeds or fruit. This is seen as a potentially cheaper way of manufacturing vaccines and drugs.</para><para>In Australia, the Gene Technology Act 2000 (the Act) provides for the regulation of genetically modified products. The object of the Gene Technology Act 2000 is to protect the health and safety of people, and to protect the environment, by identifying risks posed by, or as a result of, gene technology and by managing those risks through regulating certain dealings with genetically modified organisms (GMOs). The Act commenced on 21 June 2001.</para><para>The term `deal with' a GMO is widely defined under the Act to mean: conduct of experiments; produce or manufacture; breed; propagate; manufacture, culture and includes the possession, supply, use, transport or disposal of a GMO. Thus, genetically modified (GM) biopharmaceutical research and associated activities involving GM plants and animals are subject to the Act.</para><para>Dealings with GM biopharmaceuticals that involve intentional release to the environment are prohibited under the Act unless they are licensed. No field trials involving a pharmaceutical-producing GM food crop have been approved in Australia. Any organisation that wishes to conduct a field trial or undertake a commercial release of a GM biopharmaceutical must apply to the Gene Technology Regulator (Regulator) for a Dealing involving Intentional Release licence for the genetically modified organism of concern. To be eligible to apply for a licence an organisation must first be accredited by the Regulator under the Act. A key criterion is having, or having access to, a properly constituted and resourced Institutional Biosafety Committee.</para><para>For every application, the Office of Gene Technology Regulator (OGTR) prepares a comprehensive risk assessment/risk management plan (RARMP). The preparation of this plan involves consultation with the States and Territories, the Environment Minister, prescribed other Commonwealth agencies, such as Food Standards Australia New Zealand, the Gene Technology Technical Advisory Committee, and relevant local councils. The RARMP, including draft licence provisions, is then released for public consultation. Industry and the public are invited to make submissions to the OGTR. Following consideration of all submissions, the Regulator makes a decision whether or not to grant the licence, with or without conditions.</para><para>A commercial release of a GM biopharmaceutical would not be contemplated unless there had been extensive field trials under limited and controlled Australian conditions. A key feature of the trials would be to demonstrate whether or not there are any risks posed to human health and safety and the environment could be managed in the Australian context.</para><para>To date, the Regulator has not received an intentional release (trial or commercial) licence application for a GM biopharmaceutical.</para><para>GM biopharmaceutical research that does not involve the intentional release of a GMO into the environment is required to be notified to the Regulator by the Institutional Biosafety Committee. Such research must be conducted in a physical containment facility (eg. laboratory or glasshouse) certified by the Regulator for that purpose under the Act.</para><para>There have been approximately 1700 notifications to the Regulator of which only a very small number involve GM biopharmaceutical research.</para><para>Some examples of contained research work currently underway include joint research by the Queensland Department of Primary Industries, the Queensland University of Technology and University of Southern Queensland who have been working on developing vaccines in plants for oral delivery in edible plants. The Bureau of Sugar Experimental Stations has been working on developing biodegradable plastics from sugarcane, and Murdoch University has been working on producing proteins to control rabbit infertility in grains and legumes. Also, Genetics Australia, Monash University and the Department Natural Resources and Environment have been working to produce GM calves with an extra bovine casein gene to produce more protein in milk at proof-of-concept stage with prospects to substitute other proteins.</para><para>The Co-operative Research Centre (CRC) for Bioproducts has a focus on developing commercially valuable materials produced by plants and other living organisms. The research includes a project âBiopharmaceuticalsâ which evaluates the potential of emerging biopharmaceutical technology based on plant cell culture. Further information in relation to biopharmaceuticals receiving funding through the CRC for Bioproducts would be available from the Department of Education, Science, and Training. </para><para>A dealing with a GM biopharmaceutical involving intentional release to the environment without, or in contravention of, a licence is a criminal offence. In the case of an aggravated offence, the penalty is 5 years prison or $1.1 million per day fine. For a lesser offence, the penalty is 2 years prison or $55,000 per day fine. In some instances the offences are based on strict liability.</para><para>In respect of gene technology being used for terrorism purposes, the Regulator has extensive enforcement powers under the Act. These powers relate to searches and seizures related to offences, to search premises and anything on the premises for evidential material, and emergency powers for dealing with dangerous situations. In addition, the Act empowers the Federal Court to issue injunctions, and also contains a forfeiture provision.</para><para>With regard to the approval of GM biopharmaceutical products for human consumption and sale, the Gene Technology Act only providesapprovals where no other statutory product approval authority exists. In regard to any Pharma-Food products wishing to make a medicinal claim such as a vaccine prevention or protection claim, such claims and the safety, quality and efficacy of the product would need to be evaluated by the Therapeutic Goods Administration to assess quality, safety and effectiveness, before they may be supplied or marketed in Australia.</para><para>If an organisation wished to market their products as foods they would be regulated under the Food Standards Australia New Zealand Act 1991. In relation to the safety of pharma-foods, both the modified animals and crops used to produce such foods and the foods thus produced, must be fully compliant with the requirements of the Food Standards Code, prior to being sold in Australia. The relevant standards include, not only all those applicable to conventional foods, but also the recently adopted Standards governing genetically modified foods and novel foods. The latter two Standards require that all genetically modified and novel foods undergo a rigorous scientific assessment and must be at least as safe as the conventional counterpart foods.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>6921</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Roads: Funding</title><page.no>6921</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 49)</subtitle><id.no>49</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>6921</page.no><name role="metadata">O'Brien, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator O'Brien</name><name.id>8O6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 13 February 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Further to the answer provided to question on notice no. 3531(Senate <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>, 20 August 2001, pp 26019-22), what funding has been allocated to specific projects on each of the roads identified in answers (4)(a) to (d).</para><para>(2)	(a) What is the nature of each of the above projects; (b) what is the level of funding allocated to each of the above projects; (c) over what period has funding been allocated to each of the above projects; and (d) in what category of funding does each of the above projects appear.</para><para>(3)	Is the above information relating to specific projects for all roads identified in answers (4)(a) to (d) provided to each state government or state transport department; if so: (a) how often is this information provided to each state; and (b) when is the above information provided to each state.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>6921</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Fisheries, Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>âThe Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	and (2) The following table sets out the budgeted expense for each project for the years 2002-03 to 2005-06, cost to the Commonwealth of each project, the nature of the projects, and road funding category.

Depending on its class, a document may be retained by Defence, sent to the National Archives of Australia (NAA), or be destroyed.</para><para>In appraising a document, the current policy manual, Polman 3, provides that a document will have permanent archival value if it:</para><para>(1)	identifies important aspects of either Department or Defence Force operations or administrative arrangements in terms of origin, changes or role and functions;</para><para>(2)	shows policy decisions taken by the Department or Defence Force;</para><para>(3)	reveals procedural or operational methods; or</para><para>(4)	reveals;</para><para>(i)	economic and financial management;</para><para>(ii)	internal politics;</para><para>(iii)	international politics;</para><para>(iv)	research and scientific information; or</para><para>(v)	social, statistical or other conditions with which the Department or Defence Force has dealt with since it was established.</para><para>If any of the above items are found in a document, that document is considered one of permanent archival value.</para><para>Under the revised policy, disposal authorities identify which documents should be retained permanently based on the guidelines and directions issued by the NAA.</para><para>The Directorate of Records Management Policy is currently developing functional based disposal authorities to replace the existing RDAs. When completed these will be consolidated with the AFDA to form the Defence Functions Records Disposal Authority (DFRDA).</para><para>(8)	(a)	The department has a huge number of artworks and/or artefacts, including documents, of heritage value. They are primarily managed by the Army, the Navy and the Air Force and reside within a large number of Service museums, ships, messes, unit locations etc. </para><para>(b)	The Army, the Navy and the Air Force are currently documenting the existence, location, interpretation and value of these assets on an ongoing basis. There are several million items involved. </para><para>(c)	Each Service incurs direct or indirect costs to support these activities. The Army and the Air Force operate official museums within their bases. These are predominantly funded by the respective Services and supplemented by public and visitor donations/entry fees. The museums are often stocked with obsolete or discarded military equipment that has been transferred or donated by the Service authority. Whereas the Navy does not have an `official' public museum as such, it does have an official repository for its `Historical Collection' on Spectacle Island in Sydney Harbour. This repository is staffed and funded by the Navy and supplemented by donations received from visitors. The Navy is presently conducting a review of its museum arrangements.</para><para>(9)	No.	The Department has no direct responsibility for the provision of cultural or leisure goods or services.</para><para>(10)	Where Defence utilises contractors or consultants in building works or contracts out its asset maintenance services, arrangements are put in place to safeguard appropriate records and documentation in the standard contract templates.</para><para>Defence has a published Record Management Manual. This manual stipulates Defence policy for all record management activities. These policies are based on International Standards Organisation 15489 and National Archives of Australia guidelines. If Defence contracts out services, the resulting records remain under Defence ownership. The service provider is, therefore, expected to adhere to Defence policy in regard to record management.</para><para>(11)	(a)	No historical guides and publications on heritage were prepared by the department in the 2000-01 financial year.</para><para>(b)	No element of the budget has been specifically allocated for this purpose in the 2001-02 financial year.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">DEPARTMENT OF COMMUNICATIONS, INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND THE ARTS</inline></para><para>(1)	(a)	The Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts has responsibility for two heritage listed buildings: Old Parliament House and the building at Acton, ACT occupied by Screensound Australia. The Department does not have responsibility for other buildings of heritage character.

ScreenSound Australia does not maintain separate information on maintenance and conservation expenditure in the heritage and non-heritage areas of the Acton building. </para><para>Old Parliament House is a heritage building undergoing ongoing refurbishment, as well as routine maintenance. Many items of plant and equipment are being or have been replaced and much of the building fabric is in need of conservation or refurbishment. All works are carried out in the context of the heritage significance of the building and thus many of the ânormalâ construction and maintenance costs in Old Parliament House have a heritage conservation factor. Several areas of Old Parliament House expenditure may therefore be fully or partially attributed to heritage maintenance and conservation works.</para><para>Maintenance and conservation budgets for the 2001-02 (estimated) and previous four financial years are as follows:

During an earlier site survey in August 2002, the US Navy visited Western Australia to discuss the Sea Swap concept with several State Government Departments as well as the Lord Mayor of Perth and the Mayor of Fremantle.

The initial activity will occur in January 2003 and the ship involved will be in port for approximately 15 days.
