In fact, I could not even begin to imagine, 13 years ago when I rose to deliver my maiden speech in the Queensland parliament advocating the reintroduction of the state house in that parliament, that today I would have the opportunity to address the Australian Senate as one of its members, that I would be representing the Queensland interest within the federal parliament as a Liberal senator.</para></talk.start><para>It is most appropriate in a speech such as this that I acknowledge the great contributions that so many have made to my development as a person and to my capacity to pursue my political dreams. The people who have inspired me are many, but six deserve special mention: John Howard, the late Sir William Knox, Sir Robert Mathers, Terry White, my best friend in this parliament Senator Nick Minchin, and someone that few may have heard of—the late Allan Robb, a brilliant lawyer unfortunately cut down in his prime and denied the opportunity of making a most distinguished contribution to the legal, constitutional and political strength of our nation.</para><para>At various times during my 26 years of active political involvement, these great men of great principle and personal strength have supported, sustained and encouraged me. I acknowledge two additional most significant personal debts: to my immigrant parents, Alfio and Sebastiana Santoro, for the sacrifices they have made in an unfamiliar but welcoming Australia for me and my brothers, Sebastian, Guy and Mario—brothers who in turn have been of enormous and much valued support—and to my wife, Letitia, for unconditional support over 20 years and for the greatest gift she has given to me: two beautiful sons, Andrew and Lachlan, two beautiful young Australians whom I love so very dearly.</para><para>There are so many other people whom I need to thank that if I did so in this speech I would be saying very little else. They know who they are and I look forward to acknowledging them in this place. However, there is a most special group of close friends whose loyalty to me over the best part of 26 years has been unconditional: Geoffrey Thomas, Allan Pidgeon, Peter Torbey, Pat McKendry, Michael Caltabiano, Richard Laidlaw, Graeme Quirk, Karl Morris, Peter and Tim Nicholls, Colin Thatcher, Jim Stewart, Darrell Butcher, Kim Jacobs, John Sosso, Eric Abetz, Tony Abbott, Alexander Downer, Lee Benjamin and Desley Wharton. And I say a special thank you to my many friends in the other place for your faith in and support for me. You are good people and you do your families, your constituents and the Liberal Party proud.</para><para>If you believe in the innate goodness of the human mind, then what I describe as progressive conservatism has much to recommend it—and I am a progressive conservative. The Liberal Party is a broad church that encompasses the two great non-socialist traditions of Western political thought: liberalism and conservatism. Its founder, Sir Robert Menzies, said:</para><quote><para>We took the name Liberal because we were determined to be a progressive party, willing to make experiments, in no sense reactionary but believing in the individual, his rights and his enterprise.</para></quote><para>Australia is a new society—grafted by settlement onto the world's oldest continent, itself the home of one of the oldest traditional societies. In such a new society the conservatism of Britain has always been irrelevant, for Australian conservatism, like Australian society, is a blend of both classic liberalism and modern conservatism.</para><para>It is fair to say that in the Liberal Party the difference between those who incline towards one great philosophic tradition or the other is often marginal. Indeed as Liberals we all share a defining belief in the value of the individual and the role of individual enterprise. We cherish the motive force that drives and invigorates human society, namely individual initiative. We treasure that initiative because we have inherent faith in the virtue and zeal with which the vast majority of people are born. More than that, we believe that by restricting the controls and burdens placed on individual enterprise by the state, we liberate the creative intelligence of our citizens which in turn results in a free, open, vibrant and prosperous society. In short, we believe that the common good is achieved by respect for and promotion of the free exercise of the liberties of the people in their many forms—economic, social and personal. </para><para>As a conservative, I believe that order and stability are central to good government and to individual freedom. Individual freedoms will never prosper unless we have a fair and stable society with appropriate laws administered equally. The best system of law and administration is one marked by restraint and a respect for our shared national traditions and aspirations. I believe that liberty and variety lie at the core of our wellbeing. We must value and encourage people who have the guts to have a go and reward them for their effort. We must value differences in our society and be tolerant of those differences. It is indeed those differences that make us great.</para><para>Social and political engineering are prime dangers for our system of governance. We must be ever vigilant to ensure that the people are never again so alienated from our system of government that another One Nation Party is spawned. As political representatives of the Australian people we owe it to them not only to tell them what we think but also to give their opinions the respect they deserve—and remember that reflecting public opinion is not populism; it is the very essence of democracy.</para><para>I value the views of my constituents and come to this place determined to ensure that never again will we need to hear a speech of the sort Sir Robert Menzies felt compelled to make in 1942 when he spoke so eloquently about `the forgotten people'. I pledge during my term in this chamber to ensure that the views and aspirations of the people of Queensland will not be forgotten.</para><para>Finally, as a conservative I believe that our primary goal is to nurture a society that is a caring and prosperous one with the family unit as its core. The family is the prime socialising, nurturing and teaching unit. Without it, our society would wither. I pledge that, during my time here, I will work tirelessly to promote policies that will conserve and enhance the most fundamental unit of our society—the family unit.</para><para>I describe myself as a progressive conservative. I am a passionate Liberal in my core belief about individual liberties and the need for the state to let the ordinary men and women of this country get on with their lives without unnecessary interference. I have always been interested in our industrial relations system for that very reason—not because I do not see a need for unions or because I am in any way anti-union but because I want to see our private enterprise system protected and promoted. As a Liberal, I value the right of freedom of association, including the right of people to form unions or cooperatives to look after their interests. There is no conflict in supporting both goals.</para><para>The first task of any modern nation is to protect its citizens and, as the tragic events of the past year have shown, we must be more vigilant than ever. When our society is under threat, which it is today, I reluctantly accept that individual rights must receive a lesser priority than the protection of the public.</para><para>Conservatism is not about inertia, nor is it about fear of change. It is about respect for individual rights and our shared values. It is about a society of free people—of decent men and women imbued with a great tradition of tolerance and initiative. As a progressive conservative, I want to ensure that this society which I love is protected and that we take care to ensure that we manage change so that we build on our great society and do not undermine it.</para><para>People who know me well know that I come here with a strong record of advocacy for my state. I am a state-righter, and my state has too often been short-changed by federal governments, irrespective of whether they are Labor or coalition. I want to help change that. In cooperation with my Queensland Liberal colleagues, I want to clearly articulate Queensland's interests by focusing on the policy areas that matter to all of us. </para><para>When the Commonwealth was established 101 years ago the building blocks of nationhood were the states, and the sum of the parts was greater than the whole. Over the past century, the balance of that equation has shifted. It is certainly true that many Australians, and a lot of younger Australians, now see little relevance in their state other than as a reasonably efficient working unit of administration.</para><para>Having said this, there can be no denying that the states we represent in this place have rights and that we in this place need to be protective of them. But, like all rights, these are balanced by obligations, and the states must be seen to be meeting these obligations. In my view, the Senate is a very appropriate forum through which they can be held to account.</para><para>For example, the states have a duty to use the tax funds they draw from the Commonwealth responsibly. The states now have access, in the GST, to the first major true growth tax they have enjoyed since they turned over income taxing powers to the Commonwealth 60 years ago in the darkest days of World War II. They have been given a historic opportunity to be truly responsible for tax revenue that comes to them by right, with no strings attached, but is collected by another government which takes on the political odium of doing so.</para><para>They have this benefit because the Howard government had the courage to take the political pain and wear the administrative burden of introducing a broad based consumption tax on their behalf. As a Queensland senator, I shall seek to make Queensland governments, irrespective of their political colour, fully accountable for the way in which they spend the billions of dollars that they get from Australian taxpayers.</para><para>I am a fiercely proud Queenslander. I may be partisan, but I am not going to be irresponsible. We can all argue policy and politics, but sometimes we need to find a way to do so from a national standpoint. Where appropriate, I will not allow my strong state-righter predisposition to discourage me from engaging in the debate about the balance that must be struck between states rights and the national interest.</para><para>The issue goes beyond fiscal matters, particularly at this difficult time in our nation's history. It goes to the heart of national security; for example, to border security—rightly an issue that is of immediate concern to the Queensland government. It certainly extends to native title, something the Queensland government has recently recognised. And it extends to matters such as workers compensation and the broader liability insurance issue. </para><para>Perhaps the most poignant example concerns the supply and availability of water drawn from the great rivers that flow through two or even three states. It illustrates the point significantly and with force. In fact, the time has passed when it can be viewed as legitimate for property rights to differ according to which side of the colonial boundary line that property lies on. Indeed, the time has passed when gun laws can reasonably be within the remit of state governments. These are all things that require not only goodwill in principle but also commitment at a practical level, on all sides, when it comes to considering adjustments in power sharing between levels of government.</para><para>Mr President, I have other clear objectives as a senator. One is the protection and promotion of small business. The Liberal message throughout the party's history has been that it is the party of small business. Small business is the lifeblood of this country's economy—certainly of the Queensland economy. It deserves protection from over-regulation, from irresponsible unionism and, more specifically, from onerous unfair dismissal laws.</para><para>Another of my priorities is education and training. When I was the Queensland Minister for Training and Industrial Relations from 1996 to 1998, I gained much insight into practical ways for improving educational opportunity. One matter I will pursue is streamlining interstate recognition of qualifications—an increasingly important measure when Australians are becoming more and more mobile. </para><para>Further, rural and regional Queensland faces specific problems, particularly now in relation to the drought. The federal government has implemented a wide range of initiatives designed to address these problems. It is important that these programs continue and that they be managed well and cooperatively.</para><para>For most Australians, another vital area of policy is taxation. In 1998, in making its case for taxation reform, the government said:</para><quote><para>Wage and salary earners are hardest hit by our tax system. Personal tax rates are high by international standards and apply to those on average incomes ... There is no incentive for average Australians to do a bit of extra work and earn a few extra dollars.</para></quote><para>Australians recognise that this government has much to be proud of in the area of tax reform. However, I am encouraged by the Prime Minister's comments that further relief for individual taxpayers should be a priority. Consistent with international trends, the reduction of marginal income rates and the adjustment of tax brackets, Australia should also be prepared to consider reducing the overall tax burden on individuals.</para><para>In 2000-01, Australia's personal income tax as a percentage of GDP was 11.6 per cent, compared with the OECD average of 10 per cent and 9.7 per cent for Asia-Pacific countries. With most of Australia's major trading partners having recently introduced or announced reductions in their marginal tax rates or increases in income thresholds, Australia should not be left behind.</para><para>Queensland is a great state. That needs to be said as often as possible and in as many forums as possible, and perhaps especially in this place, the house of all the great states that make up our nation. Let it be said that the component parts of Queensland are great places: the Gold Coast, the Sunshine Coast, Townsville, Cairns, the Far North, the Darling Downs and the west—indeed, all the many varied places and energetic people that make up the rich mosaic of our state. I intend to represent their interests, their views and their aspirations very strongly in this place.</para><para>I want to close by making some further remarks about the Liberal Party and some personal reflections. Part of the privilege of being a Liberal senator for Queensland is being able to work with my senatorial colleagues from Queensland. I would like to place on record my regard for the hard work and effective representations of Senator Brandis and Senator Mason and also acknowledge the diligent ministerial work of Senator Ian Macdonald and his advocacy for his state. There are four Queensland Liberals in this place at the moment. Our joint, collective, strong aim is to increase that number. I also pay special tribute to my predecessor, the Hon. John Herron, and wish him and his wife, Jan, all good fortune in the important diplomatic post that he will take up in the new year.</para><para>It was in the Liberal Party more than anywhere else that I found most people were prepared to get to know me and give me the opportunity to prove my ability and my determination. That is why I am not ashamed to say that I love the Liberal Party. I love what it stands for, I love it for the friends it allowed me to make and I love it for the opportunities it has given me to help make our state and our country a better place to live.</para><para>On this personally significant day I am humbled, as I reflect on my origins, by how good Australia has been to me, my family and to those that I hold dear. I am proud of my Italian origins. I am grateful for the opportunity provided to me by my parents. I recognise the loyalty and the support of many. As a person who came to Australia from Italy at the age of five and who could not speak a word of English, I am very grateful to our nation for what it has enabled me to achieve. Where else could a person in my situation gain the opportunity to be highly educated, to hold responsible jobs in the private and public sectors, to serve 12 years in a state parliament, including a term as a cabinet minister, and to be elected deputy leader of the party in that state?</para><para>At the same time, I have become a proud new Australian who has raised a family and who has met and made friends with some of the most wonderful people in the world. This could only happen in a great country and a great democracy—a country where opportunity still abounds and success stories and dreams can come true. I have been blessed, and I am reminded of what Thomas a Kempis once wrote: </para><quote><para>Be thankful for the smallest blessing, and you will deserve to receive greater. Value the least gifts no less than the greatest, and simple graces as especial favours.</para><para>If you remember the dignity of the Giver, no gift will seem small or mean, for nothing can be valueless that is given by the most high God.</para></quote><para>Mr President, I look forward to serving with you and my other colleagues in this place in the best interests of our nation, our states and our parties.</para></speech></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>7099</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Consideration of Legislation</title><page.no>7099</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator IAN CAMPBELL (Western Australia—Manager of Government Business in the Senate) (9.50 a.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That the provisions of paragraphs (5) to (7) of standing order 111 not apply to the following bills, allowing them to be considered during this period of sittings:</para></motion><para>Charter of the United Nations Amendment Bill 2002</para><para>Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Special Benefit Activity Test) Bill 2002</para><para>International Tax Agreements Amendment Bill (No. 2) 2002</para><para>Medical Indemnity Bill 2002</para><para>Medical Indemnity (Consequential Amendments) Bill 2002</para><para>Medical Indemnity (Enhanced UMP Indemnity) Contribution Bill 2002</para><para>Medical Indemnity (IBNR Indemnity) Contribution Bill 2002</para><para>National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</para><para>Trade Practices Amendment Bill (No. 1) 2002</para><para>Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</para><para>Workplace Relations Legislation Amendment Bill 2002.</para><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>09:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>7099</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Omit the following bills:</para></quote><para>Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Special Benefit Activity Test) Bill 2002</para><para>National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</para><para>Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2].</para><para>In speaking to the motion I will not take up a significant amount of the Senate's time—we have legislation before us at the committee stage—but it is at least necessary to set out the opposition's position. We will not be supporting the motion. We are in the penultimate sitting week of the Senate for this year. At this very late stage of the sitting, with the legislative program in front of us, we need to look at the program critically and make an assessment of and a decision on the priorities that need to be dealt with.</para><para>We have only six days remaining, including today, and numerous bills still to consider. Much of this legislation is, according to the government, urgent. The ASIO bill, for example, is one of the most significant pieces of legislation that we will consider in this sitting, in my view. We anticipate a lengthy and complex debate in respect of that stage, and we have not started it as yet. The committee report was handed down only last night at 11.19 p.m., and as yet the chair of the committee has not spoken about the report. I am sure most members will not even have an opportunity to read the committee report before we end up debating it. We note that the <inline ref="R1656">Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> has already been considered by the Senate. In these circumstances, we do not regard it a priority that it be considered. When you look at the substance of that particular bill, the reason it is being proposed as urgent is:</para><quote><para>The Government has on several occasions sought the introduction of protections for business, and particularly small businesses, against secondary boycott actions.</para></quote><para>There is no claim for urgency within the text of the statement by the government to support the passage of the bill. If you look at the history of that particular piece of legislation, the exemption from the cut-off was—to say it again—firstly, to avoid the great haste with which this government might want to drive through legislation and, secondly, to enable the Senate to have more control when determining which matters are urgent or important and which matters can be dealt with later. The opposition, in relation to the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2], have to then examine each bill upon its own merits. The opposition have been extremely generous to date in terms of our position to the exemption of bills from the cut-off date. In this sitting year alone we have agreed to something in the order of 34 bills for exemption from the cut-off. </para><para>Each bill, as I have said, should stand on its own merits. It should be highlighted that this government has failed to convince us that the Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is urgent. The opposition have already made their position on this particular bill quite clear. That position remains unchanged since the bill was first introduced. The government has had the debate on that bill a number of times before. It knows our position and it knows what our position will be. It is clearly no surprise to the government. The bill does not meet the priority test when applied. Already, as I have said, there is a significant legislative program to be dealt with. There is no practical reason for dealing with this legislation in an urgent way. Similarly, in relation to the <inline ref="R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline>, the government states in one sentence the reason for urgency:</para><quote><para>If the Bill is not introduced and passed in the 2002 Spring sittings, projected savings to the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme will not be achieved.</para></quote><para>That may be a fact, but it is certainly not a reason for urgency for the bill. The bill does not contain urgent measures. There is no adverse effect on Australians if the bill is not considered. There is a program of essentially urgent bills that the government requires to be dealt with in this sitting period. This bill does not fall within that group. Similarly, the reason put forward by the government for the urgency of the <inline ref="R1645">Family and Community Services Legislation Amendment (Special Benefit Activity Test) Bill 2002</inline> is hollow. The initiative contained in this bill is to commence on 1 January 2003. This is a fact—one put forward by the government. It then claims that it is critical that the bill be passed in the 2002 spring sittings ahead of the commencement date so as to have sufficient time to finalise supportive administration. But this bill had only just been reported on in the Senate, with the majority and minority reports only tabled earlier this week. There were over 50 submissions received in relation to that particular bill. The important issue to recall is that there is no stated urgency in the grounds to support the particular bill. The date is the only reason this government has been able to suggest that the bill is urgent, but the date in itself is not a claim for urgency. Therefore there is no merit in considering this bill ahead of other essential bills that we need to deal with, given the small time that we have available to deal with the legislative program in a way that ensures proper debate.</para><para>If the government were serious about the program and about having sufficient time to debate the legislation in the program this year, then it would have considered not setting aside some 10 or 11 days fewer than the number set aside in what might be considered more usual sitting periods. In 2000 there were 71 days set aside. In 2001—an election year, which was terminated from 27 September—there were 52 days. This year, to date, there have been 53 days. In relation to hours, 449.42 hours were set aside this year. Last year there were 442. When you look at the figures for the pattern of sitting, the opposition has met the requirements to expand the program to deal with the hours. We have, to date, provided an additional 55 hours and 24 minutes to meet the government's legislative program—in other words, to allow the government time to deal with the legislation. That is notwithstanding the fact that the government lost something in the order of 22 hours and 58 minutes out of the program due to early adjournment.</para><para>When you then examine the fact that there have been five occasions when the opposition has allowed government business to be dealt with during general business on Thursday, you will see that the opposition has ensured that the legislative program, notwithstanding the tight sitting days that were scheduled, has allowed the government to have sufficient time to deal with the program to date. In total, there have been 231 hours and 32 minutes spent on government business this year compared to 223 hours and 11 minutes spent on government business last year. The percentage of time this chamber has spent dealing with government business has remained in the order of 55 per cent to date, but in the last sitting period it was 68 per cent. The figure of 55 per cent is consistent and not out of kilter with earlier years but, if you look at the last session in this period, the opposition has ensured that there have been sufficient hours to deal with the program, which has been put forward to allow those bills to be debated properly and appropriately and considered sensibly. </para><para>The position we have now is that the government wants to treat the exemption from the cut-off in a manner that does not allow appropriate bills to be considered in the last few days—six in all—that we have, including today. Therefore, it is our position that we do not support the exemption for those bills.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:01:00</time.stamp><page.no>7101</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator ALLISON</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Democrats will be supporting Senator Ludwig's amendment.

What happens here is that the government ministers who are responsible for these bills do not get them together in time and do not get them brought to the House of Representatives, knowing that there is a delay between then and when they come to the Senate, and do not allow the Senate adequate time. This happens at the end of every year, but we are now seeing the cut-off being used more and more throughout the year as well. I feel very defensive about it.</para><para>The mechanism was brought in by all parties, I think, except the Labor Party at the time, because they were in government— please correct me if I am not right about that. It was brought in so that the community could be adequately consulted. All of the pieces of legislation that are on this list are of intense interest to different sections of the Australian community. To accede to the cut-off is to simply say, `Anything goes.' We are back where we were. Ministers who have not done the work and who have not ensured that the bureaucracy, at their assistance, did the work to get the legislation before the parliament in time for it to be properly canvassed with the community by parliamentarians are not going to be rebuked over that. I think they should be, and we oppose this cut-off motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:04:00</time.stamp><page.no>7101</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I accept much of what the Manager of Opposition Business in the Senate said in terms of cooperation and additional hours.

I acknowledge and thank the opposition and all honourable senators for assisting the government in finding additional hours to deal with the busy program of a reformist government that has come back after the last election with a heavy number of reforms.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The one point that should be made is that the <inline ref="R1685">National Health Amendment (Pharmaceutical Benefits—Budget Measures) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> and the <inline ref="R1656">Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> are two bills for which the arguments put—and, I think, quite reasonably—by Senator Brown and others are the fundamental case for the cut-off provision: that is, the Senate should have adequate time to review the provisions of bills, the community should have the time to put their views to the Senate, the processes of the Senate should be allowed to work and, therefore, bills should only be introduced in one session and debated in the next session. That is an entirely reasonable proposition that the Liberal Party supported in opposition; it is a proposition that we continue to support in government. That is why the democratic provisions of the Senate apply. You obviously need a majority of the Senate to say, `This is an exemption.' So you need to demonstrate to the Senate that this bill does not need to wait around for a few months and that it can be dealt with straightaway. Traditionally, the Senate has given us the exemption.</para><para>But I have to say, having agreed with all of those arguments, that I do not think it is logical to apply the same argument for bills that have already been dealt with by the Senate and which have come back here in exactly the same form. In fact, I pre-empt my referral of this matter to the Procedure Committee. I think it is something that should not be looked at in the light of a particular bill or a particular tactical situation at the time. I think the Senate should give due consideration as to whether bills that have been already dealt with by the Senate should still be subject to the provisions of standing order 111.</para><para>You cannot logically make the same argument for the cut-off—that the Senate has not had time to consider it—for a bill that has already been, potentially, through a legislative committee, through detailed consideration by the Senate and the Committee of the Whole, been voted on and been sent back here after insistence by members in the other house. Logically, the Senate has already given that legislation detailed consideration. So I will be referring that matter to the Procedure Committee for consideration as to whether bills that have already been dealt with by the Senate once should be considered subject to standing order 111.</para><para>Having said all of that, we would of course have liked to have dealt with the pharmaceutical benefits measures; they are key budget measures. They will of course have an impact on the federal budget. The Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2] is a key reform measure of the government to help small businesses. We would have liked to have had those bills passed into the law of the land prior to the adjournment at the end of next week. If the Senate votes to not allow that to happen, the government will of course respect the democratic processes of the Senate. But we would have preferred to have seen the measures in place, because they would have improved the Australian economy and improved things for small business.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><para>Original question, as amended, agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>RESEARCH INVOLVING EMBRYOS BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7103</page.no><id.no>R1625</id.no></debateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 3 December.</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Declaration of Urgency</title><page.no>7103</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:10:00</time.stamp><page.no>7103</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I declare the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> an urgent bill and move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That this bill be considered an urgent bill.</para></motion><para>Question put.</para></speech><division><division.header><time.stamp>10:15:00</time.stamp><para>The Senate divided.</para></division.header><para>(The President—Senator the Hon.

I have sought in discussions with the minister to allocate times to the remaining groups of amendments, which will allow a full debate on each section of them. After the drafting of this motion, I have suggested to people—and I would like to put on the record the government's intention here—that if those particular break-ups of groups of amendments remaining on the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> unnecessarily curtail debate—for example, if there were to be more debate on the first group of amendments and we have allocated too much time to the last groups—it will remain open to the Senate to change those allocations, and the government would do that. </para><para>The government's main motivation is to see that the debate will be concluded by lunchtime tomorrow. These time allocations will have ensured that the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline> and the Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002 would have been debated in excess of 47 hours. No-one could possibly argue, even for the enormous gravity and importance of these two pieces of legislation, that that is an entirely unreasonable amount of time—in fact, it is an incredibly lengthy amount—dedicated to those bills. This time management motion which I am moving today will ensure that the Senate spends just under nine hours—in fact, I think it is much longer than that—debating these bills between now and when the debate will conclude just before the lunchtime suspension tomorrow.</para><para>A number of suggestions have been made, and I regard them as suggestions that are seeking to be helpful to the government, to me and to the chamber. Senator Murphy, Senator Brown and Senator Harradine have come to me at different times over the last 24 hours and suggested perhaps sitting late tonight. I do not blame Senator Brown for that one—that was not his idea—but some people have said, `Why don't we sit late tonight?' Others, including Senator Harradine, have said, `Why don't we sit on Friday?' Sittings on Friday create significant problems for senators when we do not have the number of airline seats available that we had prior to 14 September last year. It is very hard, if you change the sitting times late in the week, for the airline—or airlines, in some cases—to rearrange seat availability, and so the government tries very hard to ensure that we can give senators advance notice of late sittings and changes of sittings. For senators who come from Western Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory, for example—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>ZW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Sherry, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator Sherry</name></talker><para>—Tasmania!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>H15</name.id><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name></talker><para>—and Tasmania, which happens to be in the same time zone, Senator Sherry, which is a major advantage for some—it is particularly hard. For those of us who come from the most outlying states, sittings on Friday ensure that, if you are lucky, you get home either late Friday night or Saturday morning. You then have to turn around at lunchtime on Sunday and fly back here again. We have looked at all those options. I have spoken to various people involved in the debate. I have been told by some strong opponents of the bill that they would in normal circumstances expect the bill to have been completed by close of business today. This motion certainly will not stand in the way of that occurring. I would welcome that occurring, because it would allow the government to get on with a number of other bills on the program. This motion will allow us to consider the bill for all of today. I note that it will all be in daylight hours. A very good point was made by Senator Harradine yesterday that it is preferable not to have late night sittings. We will have all of the daylight hours of today to deal with this bill and we will have—to use cricketing parlance—the entire morning session tomorrow to deal with it as well.</para></talk.start></continue><para>The government commends this motion to the Senate. We think it is a civilised way to conclude the remaining stages of the bill. I think the debate has been full, whole, well informed and diligent. The government has sought to encourage that. We are trying here to ensure that we create enough time to deal with the remainder of the government's program. My earnest wish—and I think it can be achieved with goodwill around the chamber, and it is a goodwill that has existed throughout the year—is to have the Senate conclude at the time that is published in the program; that is, at a reasonable hour on Thursday afternoon next week. I will seek, with all senators in this place, to manage the program. If there are bills that have to go back to the other place and then come back here again for reconsideration, we would like to ensure that all of those processes can be concluded by the normal adjournment time next Thursday. </para><para>I am going to work hard with Senator Ludwig, the Manager of Opposition Business, with senators on the crossbenches and with my colleagues in the House of Representatives to ensure that we do not have to have an all-night sitting on Thursday and have the House of Representatives come back on Friday morning. If we can avoid that, it would be desirable. We want to handle the program, ensure that we have vigorous, full debate on the bills on the program, have the votes, and leave this place at a sensible and civilised time next Thursday. We have not been able to achieve that very often in the past but, if we are able to get this motion through this morning, deal with this bill and move through the remaining bills, then the hope of leaving here at a sensible time next Thursday is achievable.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>7105</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Greens totally oppose the guillotine being applied to a great debate in this place on a matter of conscience. The debate on the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> is extraordinarily important not just to the wider Australian community but to the consciences of all members who have been involved, particularly those who have sat here hour through hour determining, listening to, arguing and settling the extraordinarily complex issues that are involved. This bill entails a great matter of conscience. It is about testing of embryonic stem cells. It is about the commercial impulse that is behind the experimentation that takes place there. It is about our regard for life on earth, in the end. It is about human and scientific manipulation of the natural fabric of life on this earth, not least human life. As such, it measures up with the debates on the death penalty, on abortion, on gay law reform, on the Family Court, on euthanasia—enormously important matters which have been conscience matters and open to all members to debate and ultimately decide as best they could on their conscience and on the debate available. I do not know if ever before such a bill has been subject to the guillotine in this place. I do not know that that has ever happened. I find it extraordinary that the government and the Democrats voted en bloc to put this rolling guillotine or gag—the government puts the nice term of `time management' on it— onto a matter as important as this.</para></talk.start><para>That this extraordinarily important piece of legislation is being debated in the second last week of sitting for the Senate is not in the hands of senators here, except those opposite—the government itself and the Prime Minister himself. But to apply implicitly, if not explicitly, a gag on this and to have that threatening the debate is quite outrageous. That the Democrats have supported the government in potentially gagging a vote on a matter as important to the conscience as this is must in itself be quite unprecedented for the Democrats, who have always determined—I think, quite wonderfully—that there should be open and free debate in this place on the most difficult of matters to do with the shaping of our society and its future.</para><para>I would have thought that, in the course of events—and the debate quickened last night—this matter would have been dealt with by today or tomorrow anyway. I think that will still be the case. But now we have a guillotine hanging over our heads. It is a very bad move by the government. Members have not been wasting time in here, I can tell you that. I think that everybody who sat in here would agree. It has been a heartfelt, informative and important debate. To trivialise it by saying that it can be cut off at the whim of the majority—maybe the uninterested majority, at that—and to prevent those who find this matter extraordinarily and hugely important and deserving of the greatest consideration is very bad parliamentary process. I think it is unconscionable: the unconscionable is occurring to what we proclaim as the conscionable. It is bad parliamentary process and a total abrogation of the whole idea that, when we get to complex and important ethical mileposts like this in the progress of our society, the matter should be given greater importance and should not be cut down by a guillotine—one which, on this occasion, is imposed by the government and the Democrats.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>7106</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—That is the best example I have heard yet of weasel words, sophistry and hypocrisy from the Greens, who are trying to get on the moral high horse whilst actually getting in the way of the Senate doing what it is supposed to do, which is to enable proper consideration of legislation. This proposal— which gives plenty of time: people who are involved in the debate are saying that we will probably be finished by then, in which case it has no effect at all; but that does not stop all the moralising, anyway—enables a disciplined and responsible approach to important issues, rather than trivialising the debate by allowing it to waffle on for endless hours. </para></talk.start><para>The alternative is midnight sitting after midnight sitting. Nothing trivialises a debate more than endless speeches that repeat the same thing. We have already seen amendments that have failed being put up again and again, and attempts by those who do not support this legislation—although I respect their right not to support the legislation—and who have the majority of the amendments, continually lengthening the debate, to prevent the legislation going through. Those people are trying to prevent the consciences of those who support the legislation from being exercised. This does not gag a vote. That has been said to the Senate, but it is a falsehood. This enables votes. It enables more informed votes because it will not be at midnight, when people are brain-dead and sick of listening to the ongoing repetition. It will enable an informed vote and it will enable that vote to happen rather than continuing to prevent it coming to the conclusion that it needs to come to.</para><para>Nobody is more passionate or more informed about this issue than the Australian Democrats—with the possible exception of Senator Harradine, who is certainly passionate about it—and we have contributed constructively. But we have also had a committee stage, a comprehensive committee process, committee inquiries with very many witnesses and a comprehensive report. There is no requirement for every senator to be involved in the committee process, but it is worth noting that some people ignore all of those attempts to get informed consideration and do not participate in the committee process. We have heard the moralising from the Greens, but the Greens did not participate in the committee process, turn up to any of the hearings, listen to any of the evidence nor contribute to the report. Then they come in here and talk about an informed debate.</para><para>We have responsibilities if we are going to exercise conscience votes. The Democrats have pioneered, and continue to highlight, the importance of the conscience vote. For us every bill, if someone feels strongly enough about it, is a conscience vote. I wish the other parties would take that into account. That is why we want to ensure that legislation is dealt with properly. It is not just about this legislation; it is about all of the other legislation that we have to deal with and ensuring that it gets proper consideration. If people want to scuttle this legislation—and clearly the Greens are amongst those, by the stance they have taken—that is fine; they can vote against it. But they are trying to prevent the will of the majority of people who support this legislation and these important scientific advancements from prevailing. They can vote against it as they are entitled to, but the majority eventually should prevail on this bill, whether it is a conscience bill or any other bill.</para><para>As I said, for the Democrats on every bill there is the prospect of a conscience vote. But that includes all of the other bills we have to deal with. There are some very important bills to do with refugee issues that the Democrats are strongly concerned about. That legislation will not get proper consideration if we all sit here midnight after midnight, through into next week. For those who want to scuttle this legislation, it is quite reasonable to expect that they would do so. I have sat in on meetings before where we have tried to figure out a decent time line for this bill. People say that we will be able to deal with this in a certain length of time but, when it comes into the chamber, that does not happen.</para><para>So this is about enabling a democratic outcome, an approach where the majority who support the bill—and it is clear that the majority do—will be given the opportunity to have that vote taken. This has been an open and free debate; it will continue to be an open and free debate. The amount of time that has been put into the committee stages of these two bills will add up to 32 hours once the final vote is taken. I believe that is about the second largest time frame for debate in the history of the Senate—far more time than that taken for the euthanasia laws, for example, which had a total debate time of under 18 hours. The total debate time for these two bills will be over 47 hours, plus the committee inquiry and over 38 hours of debate in the House of Representatives. Every issue that needs to be explored and considered in relation to this bill has been dealt with in this committee stage, and there will be ample opportunity for arguments to be put forward in the remaining time. We have another full day. We have until the middle of tomorrow. That is ample time, given the number of issues and the amount of information that is already on the table.  </para><para>It is difficult to suggest any other reason why people would oppose this motion than that they oppose the bill and therefore are trying to prevent it from getting through. As I say, if people oppose the bill, that is fine, they can vote against it, but they should not prevent others who support the bill from being able to ensure that it goes through in an appropriate length of time after proper debate. This will enable all the other important pieces of legislation—which, from my perspective, in some respects deal with much more important life-and-death issues than this legislation—to get proper consideration. So it is about being responsible, it is about being democratic and it is about ensuring that we take our responsibilities properly as senators, that we do not just chew up time for the sake of it and that we do not contribute in an uninformed way to debates that have already had extensive examination by people with expert evidence. </para><para>This approach is one that the Democrats not only support but strongly endorse. There is a suggestion that, because it is a conscience vote bill, it should not be guillotined. I can understand the superficial attraction of that argument, but the view of the Democrats is that every bill before us is a potential conscience vote bill, so it makes no difference to us on this bill as opposed to any other. I recognise that this is a rare opportunity for others in the larger parties to actually exercise some of their brain cells and get their head around an important issue, and we have given them ample opportunity to do that. But this motion does not prevent them from exercising that conscience vote. That is the whole point. If it prevented them, if it somehow or other said, `No, you now have to vote the way we say,' then there might be a point. But it does not curtail their exercising of that conscience vote; it does not curtail the opportunity for people to have their conscience informed, if they wish to do so. Of course, if people had really wished to do so, they would have participated in the committee inquiry stage of this legislation. Every senator was free and able to do that if they wished. All of us have had the opportunity to read the report. All of us have had the opportunity and will continue to have the opportunity to listen to the debate in the chamber as it continues through today and tomorrow. So people will have the opportunity not only to have their conscience vote but to make an informed conscience vote, and they will be far more informed than they would be if they were trying to listen to a debate that waffled on endlessly until midnight, night after night.</para><para>Nonetheless, the Democrats make the point, as always, that we should be sitting more often. I note in Senator Ludwig's previous contribution that he expressed a similar view that we are not sitting often enough. That is something that we should explore as a Senate, because we do have a responsible and important job. The Democrats support this motion because we believe it is important for us to be responsible in the way we act in this chamber. We have a great privilege to serve here. We have a particularly major responsibility and requirement to ensure that we fulfil that job in a responsible manner, and that means enabling all senators to contribute to debate, enabling all senators when they are able to do so to vote according to their beliefs and enabling every piece of legislation to get the consideration that it deserves. Voting against this motion will prevent other legislation from getting the consideration it deserves and will clearly be an attempt by those who oppose the bill to scuttle what is, in the Democrats' view, an important piece of legislation. It contains some significant scientific advances that Australia should be getting behind rather than trying to scuttle. So we support this motion. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>7108</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Bartlett's comments are a serious reflection on senators who strongly oppose the guillotining of a measure for which a conscience vote has been allowed. In all the 27 or 28 years that I have been here, I cannot recall one instance when that has occurred. The cut-off motion for the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> sets a precedent by the government, with the support of the Australian Democrats. Senator Bartlett has got up here and reflected upon the intention of those who will vote against this guillotine motion. Senator Bartlett's comments were a reflection on Senator Brown. That was an improper reflection, because Senator Brown has taken a keen interest in the debate on this bill. I would have thought that the Democrats would uphold the importance of a conscience vote, but no, they do not. In fact, they voted against an amendment of mine which would have given effective protection for those who have a conscientious objection to working in relation to embryonic stem cells. So workers and students were not properly protected in that regard by the vote of the Democrats. That is all it needed; it was a close vote.</para></talk.start><para>I am not going to take my full time, as Senator Bartlett did; I am just going to raise a couple of questions with Senator Ian Campbell. I notice that by, I think, five o'clock we need to have completed divisions 1, 2 and 3 of part 2. Clause 19 is the last provision relating to those matters. I notice that some of the amendments which fall within that area are listed right at the back of the running sheet. Perhaps they should come up in order to ensure that they are dealt with in that particular period of time. If you have a look at the last page of the running sheet, perhaps we could get the amendments to clause 12 up in the order a bit. They could then be dealt with as from now so that they fall within those areas. Possibly we can keep on with these discussions at a later stage.

The reason for that— and I think it is worth articulating this—is that we have a unique period in this sitting of parliament where we have a conscience vote on this legislation. I will not be taking my full 10 minutes; I will be relatively brief. The opposition will not use the procedural motions they have at their disposal to forestall the vote on this motion. Our position is clear: we will not be supporting the guillotine in this instance. As Senator Harradine has in part mentioned—and it is worth while reiterating this—the usual course of events would be for the committee stage to continue until its completion. With the cooperation of senators, my view is that that would have been completed some time this week.</para></talk.start><para>There is no pressure on the legislative program that would require this bill to be declared an urgent bill and a motion such as this to be put in place at this time. We are still in the penultimate week of the sitting period—we are not in the last week. Bills do need to be dealt with in these last two weeks. Essential bills do get dealt with, with due consideration and appropriately, by this house. The use of this device should not be abused. It should not be used to deal with legislation in the committee stage in a way that has been enjoined by all the senators here. It seems to me that there is no pressure to require such a motion before us. Without wishing to take up any more of the time which would otherwise be devoted to the committee stage of this bill, we reiterate our opposition to this motion.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>10:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>7108</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are two issues that I want to briefly address, and I have just briefed informally with Senator Ian Campbell. I take the point he made earlier that there is some level of flexibility to ensure timeliness in this debate. Some issues have already been deferred because they relate to a cluster of issues that can be dealt with all at one time, following the report of the Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills that we are anticipating being tabled around four o'clock this afternoon. There may be some limitations to take account of that report before five o'clock this afternoon, so I foreshadow that that is a likely issue in relation to the timeliness. The issues around a proposed regulation in regard to the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> relate to clauses 8, 11 and 21. My suggestion would be that we deal with them together in looking at the issues around clause 21, and deal with them once, so that we are not duplicating the arguments. That has been the justification for deferring those issues in the debate so far. I should say that I have got Senator Ian Campbell's assurance that that flexibility is what he was envisaging when he said that there would be the ability to be flexible around those issues. </para></talk.start><para>The other issue I wanted to address follows on from Senator Bartlett's comments about the debate. I can appreciate that someone who is not intimately involved in this debate might have a perception about it taking up excessive time. I could agree, for instance, that the debate we had yesterday on Senator Harradine's amendment (3) stayed around that particular amendment for quite a considerable period of time. However, that debate was in fact dealing with a series of amendments. The debate related to at least the next half-dozen amendments, and once the debate occurred around one amendment the committee moved very quickly through the next half-dozen or so.</para><para>This is the second time the issue has been raised that there are attempts to scuttle this debate. I have not heard them directed to me personally, but I find those comments quite offensive. I do not believe that the character of this debate in committee has been of that nature. Unlike the debate in the House of Representatives—where there was no realistic prospect of most, if not all, of the amendments being carried—in this case anyone looking at the running sheet will see that we are considering serious issues related to the character of the regime to be established. </para><para>The question that has been addressed by most of the amendments is that COAG had promised that there would be a strict regulatory regime. This issue was addressed by the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. Various recommendations were raised in the various Senate committee reports, and this committee has been addressing them quite seriously in a series of amendments. Some of those amendments have succeeded, some of them have failed— in some cases they have been very close failures—and some matters have been resolved by agreement. This is how the Senate committee process works. I understand why for some people the amount of time that might be involved is frustrating, particularly if they are not intimately involved in the debate. But there has been concrete work occurring in this committee process, and I find obnoxious any suggestion that the time being taken to do this is simply an attempt to scuttle the bill and I do not think it in any sense accurately reflects the work that has been going on in this committee.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>In Committee</title><page.no>7109</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Consideration resumed from 3 December.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">CHAIRMAN, The</name><name role="display">The CHAIRMAN</name></talker><para>—The committee is considering the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline>, as amended.

That amendment has been circulated and I have written to honourable senators about it and provided certain background to it. The immediate background to it is a decision last night—a very close decision—by this committee to reject an amendment which was to ban the testing of drugs on human embryos and human embryonic stem cells. This amendment provides for the labelling of products which use human embryos or human embryonic stem cells in the testing, creation or manufacture of any pharmaceutical or cosmetic products. Citizens who conscientiously oppose destructive research on embryos should have the right to easily identify drug products created by this research. What is needed is a system of clear product identification. Customers are best placed to know what they morally object to. Whilst it is their responsibility to inform themselves as to whether they would be acting in what they would consider to be a morally complicit way by consuming a product, they need proper labelling to make that informed choice.</para><para>Individuals are certainly not in a position to know what has been involved in the production of drugs, and their capacity to find out is limited, particularly if manufacturers refused to disclose this information. The only way for individuals to protect themselves from inadvertently using a product with which they have an ethical problem is for manufacturers to disclose in a way that is accessible to all potential consumers what in fact was involved in its manufacture.</para><para>Many people consider some practices so deeply wrong that it would be devastating for them to consume products manufactured under such practices and to contribute to the financial benefit of the manufacturer as well as to the product's continued production. `Not tested on animals' is considered an important label on cosmetics by those who have ethical objections to animal experimentation. It is therefore appropriate that similar labelling appears on drugs. Products are labelled because of the consumer's right to know and the need to provide warnings about health risks, and for cultural, ethical and religious reasons.</para><para>Let us take the first point: the consumer's right to know. Consumers may simply want to know more about a product. They may wish to choose to purchase a product that complies with health, environmental, religious, ethical or political values. These values may be regulated or controlled in some way by government. The Trade Practices Act has provisions to deal with false and misleading advertising. Some consumers want to know the fat content of foods, and there is provision for this in Australian labelling regulations. Consumers with sensitivities to certain additives require that additives in products are listed on food labels. Those with environmental concerns may wish to know that a food has been produced organically. This is not regulated for at a national level as such, but the Commonwealth has been a party to accreditation discussions in order to facilitate trade with overseas countries, especially those in the EU. The development of logos for organic foods that comply with production specifications is another approach. </para><para>A well-known recent example is, of course, the labelling of GM foods. The health ministers made it clear that the decision to label GM foods was driven neither by concerns about health and environmental risks nor by concerns about damage to our food export trade. The ministers made the decision on consumer rights grounds. The media briefing paper stated:</para><quote><para>This decision was taken so that consumers could be provided with the information necessary to make informed choices.</para></quote><para>If they can do it for that, they can do it for this. In regard to the health risks, the obvious example is health warnings on cigarette packs. Regulatory passage for warnings about allergens on food labels demonstrates difficulties in achieving mandatory labelling for confirmed health risks. It is only relatively recently that Food Standards Australia New Zealand extended mandatory warning labels to a limited range of allergens. Lobby groups are still pressing for additional warning labels for MSG, for example, and a number of other additives which I will not go into. Food Standards Australia New Zealand's arguments against using warning labels for various substances in foods include that too much information on a label will confuse the consumer, that only a small percentage of people are affected by the issue and that there is not enough scientific evidence.</para><para>Cultural, ethical and religious concerns are additional issues. The Australian food standard governing GM food labelling specifies that additional GM labelling is required where food carries ethical, cultural or religious concerns. If pharmaceutical manufacturers are to be good corporate citizens, then they will need to be responsive to community members' interests in knowing what they are consuming, including what ethically contentious practices their consumption may make them morally complicit in.</para><para>This is a very important matter, and it is of great concern to quite a large number of people. I have just touched the surface. I have been asking questions around the place. If human embryos or human embryonic stem cells are used to test drugs—as permitted by this bill—or, indeed, are used in some way in the manufacture of drugs, then the consumer ought to know. Great concern is expressed by quite a number of people when this matter is raised. This matter was rarely raised during the debate, because people did not know about it. People did not know that this legislation enables human embryos and human embryonic stem cells to be used in drug-testing and drug-manufacturing processes.</para><para>Last night I quoted the chief executive officer of an embryonic stem cell scientific organisation. He said that he cannot wait to get his hands on the stem cells to develop these particular research programs. It is in the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> from last night, so I am not going through it again now. I ask honourable senators to consider that matter carefully. Having very narrowly lost the attempt last night to prevent drugs from being tested on human embryos and human embryonic stem cells, I now believe it is mandatory for this parliament to come clean and to require this information to be provided to persons utilising those drugs.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>7111</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I cannot see any reason why this amendment would not be supported by every member of this chamber.

If we do decide not to label products developed from human embryos, I wonder whether the ACCC would investigate it with regard to truth in labelling. The Greens and the Democrats pride themselves on openness, particularly with regard to openness on labelling and complete information that should be available to the purchasers.</para></talk.start><para>I can see absolutely nothing that would prevent any member of parliament voting for this amendment. If you buy a bottle of tomato sauce or a packet of anything it is required to be labelled. There are many people in this community of Australia who find that absolutely repugnant.

On the other side, you have people such as those Senator Brown represents. They do not want genetically modified food and fight very strenuously to oppose it.

I do not think many Australians would support the commercialisation of human embryos. But even the fair-minded who do so would say that everyone has a right to know what they are buying.

That would be consistent with the position. I can therefore understand why Senator Harradine and other people would be arguing this case. </para><para>Senator Harradine used the example of warnings on cigarette packets.

It did not occur within the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act.</para><para>The other point I make is that some people have a moral objection to animals being involved in any testing, even in the production of pharmaceuticals. There is no legislation to require that for pharmaceuticals for which, at some stage in their development—and it could be 20 years back in research—the intellectual know-how was developed out of work on animals.

This is what I find really difficult. I do not interrupt you when I think you have gone off the track, but it is all very well when I am developing an argument for you to question my argument. I am saying that we are possibly requiring a task which would be nigh on impossible: to go back through all the permutations of the development of a medication—and, as I said, some medications we take now may have been tested on animals way back—and even to trace how far back animals were used to develop the intellectual know-how that led to the development of that medication. Where do you draw the line?</para></talk.start></continue><para>We do have people voluntarily labelling for commercial purposes. They make a choice that they will label to say that food is kosher or halal in the way it is prepared, or that various products are not tested on animals. To require it—to make it mandatory— is an exercise which would put a burden on those who are developing therapeutic products in the future, especially if it carries a penalty—in the way it does in Senator Harradine's amendment—that is onerous in the extreme. But, if the argument is to be had, this is not the appropriate bill—for the same reason that the issue of labelling for cigarettes was done under the Trade Practices Act and not the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act. We do have requirements for pharmaceuticals and for food under different acts; but this is about the testing of embryos, not about the manufacture of pharmaceuticals. As I said, it is outside the scope of this bill and for that reason I will not be supporting the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>7113</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been listening carefully to the arguments put by Senator Harradine and Senator Boswell and the response from the Minister for Minister for Health and Ageing and, quite honestly, I am none the wiser as to the arguments why we cannot support Senator Harradine's amendment. I have listened to the minister's comments, particularly the thrust of the argument—that it is outside the scope of the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline>. This is new ground. We are developing and preparing a legislative and regulatory regime for human embryo stem cell research and the testing of drugs on human embryos, and the debate this morning has confirmed for me 100 per cent that the door is wide open to drug testing on human embryos. That saddens my heart, as I think it will the hearts of many Australians.</para></talk.start><para>It concerns me that we have had some discussion about an acceptance that we have labelling laws in this country. Of course we do. We have labelling laws for food, for drugs and for other products. Here we are establishing a regime for the testing of drugs on human embryos or human embryo stem cells, and we want to put labels on those drugs that might benefit from such testing. There has been the example of smoking and cigarettes. We all know there are labels on cigarette packets in this country. Whether it is as part of the Tobacco Advertising Prohibition Act or whether it is via an amendment to the Trade Practices Act, the fact is that there is a label. There is a warning. It is there—it happens. So the argument in opposition to Senator Harradine's amendment is simply not convincing. </para><para>The minister's argument that it is impossible to go back and it is all going to be too cumbersome for the drug companies and whoever is in diametrical opposition to the arguments put yesterday that we have a very rigorous reporting regime under clause 29 of the bill, which says there has to be a database made available for the public that sets out the type of research that is undertaken under the operation of the act. Let us look at clause 29, which says:</para><quote><para>(1)	The NHMRC Licensing Committee must maintain a database containing the following information in relation to each licence (including a licence as varied):</para><para>	(a)	the name of the person to whom the licence was issued;</para><para>	(b)	a short statement about the nature of the uses of excess ART embryos that are authorised by the licence;</para><para>	(c)	any conditions to which the licence is subject;</para><para>	(d)	the number of excess ART embryos in respect of which use is authorised by the licence;</para><para>	(e)	the date on which the licence was issued;</para><para>	(f)	the period throughout which the licence is to remain in force.</para><para>(2)	The database is to be made publicly available.</para></quote><para>We wanted to improve and expand on that. That is the effort I made with my amendment yesterday: to expand on that database and the reporting process. But the minister is saying, `It is too hard to go back and find out about exactly the types of procedures that were undertaken or the drug testing that was done on the human embryo or human embryo stem cell.' If the reporting procedures are adequate and rigorous, as put forward by the minister and those who are the proponents of this bill, surely the information would be available. Surely it is not that difficult to do.</para><para>In this country we have labelling for food, for drugs and for cigarettes. Why can't we have labelling for drugs which, in the process of the manufacture or testing of those drugs, use human embryos or human embryo stem cells? Why not? It is not that difficult to do. I simply do not accept the argument of it being onerous or a rigorous and difficult process. There is no merit in that argument.</para><para>Let us use a couple of examples. One that I am particularly interested in is the Red Bull soft drink. It has a label on it that says it is not suitable for children, pregnant women or for people with diabetes. It is in small print, and I have a concern about the fact that it is so small that people are not able to see it and about the fact that it is freely available to children, people with diabetes and pregnant women—it is very easy to obtain. Nevertheless, there is a label because of the guarana, the caffeine, in the drink. The same applies to the Viking chocolate bar. It does have an impact. It should not be freely available to children and people with diabetes, because it can have health effects on those people; nevertheless, even for those drink products, there are labels. And here we are talking about human embryos. As I have said many times, each one of us was once a human embryo. We are talking about testing on a human embryo or a human embryo stem cell.</para><para>Senator Harradine made the helpful contribution about the recent changes to the labelling laws in New Zealand with respect to tobacco products and MSG—that they must be clearly notified in the labelling. We have labelling laws in this country and my understanding, from memory, is that they are soon to be upgraded—in December this year, I think—in terms of the rigorous nature of that labelling regime. That is good; we need a rigorous labelling regime. The whole thrust of this is a full, open and transparent process in terms of the consumers' right to know. That has been discussed in this debate already. Why shouldn't consumers know that there has been testing of these drugs on a human embryo? Of course they should know that. As far as it being difficult information to obtain, I simply do not go along with that—it is not valid. There is no valid argument against the amendment. All the arguments are for it. I have heard the minister's points and I do not accept them. I urge senators to think through this particular amendment very carefully and to support it. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:27:00</time.stamp><page.no>7115</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also support this amendment. I have been listening to the debate. It is actually the first time, other than on the second reading, that I have spoken on this issue, but I am prompted to because of the absolute reasonableness of the amendment—in fact, the rightness of the amendment. I think we should come back to the touchstone that we began with on this legislation and the amendments. It is very rare for this parliament to initiate a conscience vote, as we all know. When we are released from our party disciplines and we are on our own with our conscience, we see some of the great moments and great times in the parliament. The last time was in 1997 for the euthanasia debate, and I would consider that one of the finest, most stimulating debates—not results—in the parliament. This is no different; it is just as crucial in its presentation. That is the significance of it.</para></talk.start><para>We came in with a single-purpose piece of legislation. We all understood, when we came into this parliament, that we were in fact debating, as it is titled, the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002—although </inline>some of us would call it the `Research Involving Human Embryos Bill'. That was the single intent. We all came in in good conscience and we were going to vote according to our conscience. The bill was supported on its second reading. For those who in conscience supported the bill on its second reading, their reasons were the great hopes and the great possibilities they believed were within this bill—the fact that human embryo stem cells could bring breakthrough cures. Cures in the area of spinal cord injuries were the greatest ones that were presented, but they were presented in a whole lot of other areas, including diabetes and brain tumours. In conscience, they thought the possibilities were endless; therefore, the bill was accepted and passed. Those of us who did not support the basic single issue that was encapsulated in this bill believed that it was a false hope and that there were alternatives in human adult stem cells. Of course many, including myself, believed that in fact we were dealing with human life and its existence.</para><para>So that is what we began with and that is how the debate should really end—it should begin and end there. I do not think it escaped everyone, because we had 72 of the 76 senators here last night: most people stayed around late last night to vote on what was an absolutely critical amendment to the bill. What that amendment attempted to do was place a ban on pharmaceutical testing. It failed, just failed. My point about last night's amendment failing is that what began as a single conscience issue has changed. The line has now shifted. We voted for almost a second bill, you might say. The line has now shifted to a second conscience vote. What began as possibilities of human embryo stem cell breakthrough medical cures has now moved to a point where, in essence, as far as I heard the debate last night, there is a second element to this bill. The second element is that under the law as it stands there can now be pharmaceutical testing on those embryos. Last night we had a conscience vote for the second time. The line has moved.</para><para>This amendment is simply asking, as you have heard in the debate, for those who could not accept in conscience the initial purpose of the bill and for those who could not accept last night's failure of the amendment, that at least the Senate have labelling upon those products. It is infinitely necessary and reasonable—in fact, it is a right. It is not undermining the consciences of those who initially supported the bill. In fact, it is not even undermining the consciences of those who supported yesterday's amendment, which I would call the second bill. As the other speakers have said, where is the argument? There is already necessary labelling on pharmaceutical goods, on food, on cosmetics—it is there on all manufactured goods. Consider a product on which human embryo stem cells have been used. I do not understand the science of it, but would it be on the first case, second case or third case? No matter how far down the line that stem cell product has been used or experimented upon, consider those who in conscience are against such experimentation, and to a far deeper and greater level than people are against animal testing. There are people who, in conscience, are against that. But this goes one step deeper, I am sure of it. Consider the fact that they will be using that product uninformed. Give them the choice—that is all. Just give them the choice. </para><para>I appeal to the chamber. I appeal to the small `l' liberals—I hate to use those words, which cover both sides of the chamber. If only I could think of another term. I appeal to those for the human rights aspect to implement choice in this legislation—nothing more, nothing less. The initial purpose of this bill is in no way undermined. You are simply giving choice and consumer information—a basic right—nothing more, nothing less. It is a cliche—and so often we hear it in this chamber on so many other issues—to say, `If you don't like it, don't use it. Turn it off if you don't want it.' This choice is denied. This choice is denied to those who want nothing to do with or at least want to be informed in regard to products that have any connection at all with human embryo stem cells. As I say, it is a basic right for those who in conscience did not support the amendment last night, those who in conscience did not support the bill and, quite frankly, even those who in conscience supported the initial purpose of the bill. I cannot see your objection against this. Why wouldn't you concede to consumer information? It is not too hard. I ask Senator Harradine to inform the Senate if this is true: apparently, within the amendment, the labelling would be inside the packet.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator Harradine</name></talker><para>—It can be.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name></talker><para>—It can be inside the packet on the script paper. This is not some cigarette advertising where it is stamped on the front cover: `Human embryos used here.' No, it is for those with a nature of concern about this issue to ask the doctor, which they could, but the doctor of course would not know unless it is labelled and he has seen the product. But if it is labelled somewhere, outside or inside—modestly even—it introduces a choice for those who in conscience stand seriously against this. So I urge the Senate to consider this amendment and to support this amendment. It in no way undermines the initial vote. In fact, it is a slap in the face. It is saying, `There is more to this than when we first started off.' We are already, before it even leaves the Senate, moving the line—something we have been warning against. This will at least show the bona fides of the initial conscience vote.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>7116</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Patterson for acknowledging that perhaps in part the genesis of this amendment was her own comments to the effect that if people had such a strong objection to the use of embryos in this sort of work it would be interesting to see whether they maintained that objection once treatments were developed or related to the destruction of human embryos.</para></talk.start><para>I support this amendment quite strongly because that is essentially the basis of my view. I take strong moral exception to our taking this step of utilising human life. It is a very utilitarian approach and a very dangerous approach. It is likely to have significant implications in the future and it is a step that we should not have taken. I am quite happy to face that challenge in the future. I am quite happy to be able to deal with the issue in the future as to whether I access treatment related to this type of research.</para><para>But the problem is that Senator Patterson's response now to this amendment is to say, `Yes, I can accept that I did issue that challenge earlier on in the piece, but it's going to be all too difficult to hold you to the challenge. It's just all too difficult to do.' I find that very difficult to accept, Senator Patterson. You have argued against Senator Harradine's comments that this is not quite the same as smoking, and I agree with you on that point. I think the better analogy—even though it involves voluntary labelling—is probably the dolphin-free tuna example. People who have problems with consuming tuna that involves harming dolphins want to see tuna cans labelled to indicate that point so that they will not consume that tuna. This is much the same point. </para><para>What we are doing here is establishing a regime for research on embryos, and this is where I do not think your argument that we should do this elsewhere, perhaps under trade practices legislation or the like, holds up either. If we are establishing a regime for research on embryos, then let us make sure that the information stays with it. Let us make sure that it is not too complicated in the future to be able to say, `This research involved the use of human embryos.' Because, if we do not do it now, then you are right: perhaps we never will be able to do it. But if we do it now and, as Senator Harradine is suggesting, make it a requirement of the licensing process that the participants in this process ensure that if it does involve the destruction of human embryos then that information is available for the community as a whole, then it will happen. Then, Senator Patterson, you will in the future be able to hold me to your challenge. We are asking you to be able to do that.</para><para>With respect, the reasons that you have come up with as to why it is so difficult and complicated to do it do not stand up. If we require it now in the regime, that information will be available in the future. If we do it as part of the licensing process, that information will be available in the future. If we put it off onto trade practices or just say, `It's all too hard,' then of course the ethical perspective which is in my view much akin to this third-way ethical perspective—which is really more ethical fudginess—is what prevails in our community. I do not want to be fudgy on this, Senator Patterson. I want you to be able to hold me to my view in the future, which is that I find it quite abhorrent to start tampering with human life for the potential benefit of the community as a whole.</para><para>I did not make this contribution in last night's debate, which went on for a very long time, as to where we are heading on this and whether we should perhaps just restrict this research to the extraction of stem cells. I want to take this moment to refer to an article from <inline font-style="italic">New Scientist</inline> that Senator Patterson herself referred me to, because I think this best emphasises the point. Here is an example of where some progress may be likely in the future in relation to stem cell work—that is, with animals, or cows, in this case. The article reads:</para><quote><para>They ... injected blood-forming stem cells (which also give rise to immune cells) from the cloned fetuses back into the cows. One cow had its immune systems suppressed with drugs.</para></quote><para>They have had some success in this research. But the critical aspect of this research involving cloned cows is that the blood cells injected into the cows came from 100-day-old cloned foetuses. It was not possible to succeed with this research otherwise because for the cells that needed to be extracted— from the liver, I think—you needed the cloned foetuses to develop to the 100-day-old stage. The article in <inline font-style="italic">New Scientist</inline> goes on to say:</para><quote><para>There is no question of allowing human cloned embryos to grow to that stage to harvest stem cells, but Lanza says ACT—</para></quote><para>which is Advanced Cell Technology—</para><quote><para>and others are trying to derive blood stem cells directly from embryonic ones.</para></quote><para>But there is the question of what happens when we fail to get stem cells from embryonic ones or when elsewhere in the world, where we have more liberal regimes on cloning, we are able to look at examples where perhaps the argument becomes, `If we could just let a human clone be developed beyond 14 days to, let's say, 20 days, we could have a liver that was advanced enough for us to be able to extract these cells, and it would have such a significant advance in relation to problems associated with immune deficiency.'</para><para>Where are we then? Are we then contemplating, or elsewhere in the world are they contemplating, that cloned human embryos be allowed to develop beyond this 14 days? This is why I am also not convinced about the 14 days issue in this bill. Those who say that the slippery slope argument has no validity simply do not understand what is happening in science here, and those who do not have a firm view in their mind about what are appropriate limits in this issue also do not understand.</para><para>For those who say things like, `If you are opposed to using humans under a utilitarian type perspective, for the common good, for research, then don't use it yourself in the future,' this is their chance to hold us to that. I must say I am surprised that Senator Patterson has not struggled further against the advice she is receiving and found some way of enabling the likes of me, Senator Harradine and a broad range of people to be able to say in the future, `This is why we found this problematic; this is why we never wanted to go down that path ourselves; this is why we have not accepted the results of that research ourselves.' I want to be able to meet that challenge, Senator Patterson, and I am very disappointed that the government is not allowing us to be able to do that in the future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:46:00</time.stamp><page.no>7118</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—So that we can assist the determination of numbers, I will not be talking, unless necessary to talk, for more than five minutes on amendments from now on, but Senator Boswell kindly invited me to give my views.

We have not advocated the labelling of products or organisms, whether they be GMOs or tobacco, in ways that are unsuitable to the legislation, but certainly we have been strong proponents of labelling. I use the example that has been brought up by others, and that is why I repeat it. I think the Democrats were calling for the labelling of genetically modified foods from 1994 onwards. That labelling debate did not take place during the Gene Technology Bill; it took place in the ANZFA legislative debate, and that was the right place.</para><para>In the same way that we talk about smoking and other health warnings, I think the Therapeutic Goods Act is the place for that debate. I do not think this is the appropriate vehicle in relation to the legislation, and I do not know if the amendment deals with some of the specifics required. Is the labelling meant to include components of the product as well as the finished product? When manufacturers buy components to make their products, and of course they can have several hundred such components, will they be able to access the sort of information that the amendment requires? How exactly should information be detailed on this label? What sort of label exactly is required? I do not think those issues are dealt with adequately. While I think people in the chamber have some sympathy for the notion of labelling, we should get it right through the TGA and other legislation.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Government senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Chair, I was asked to make comment; I will leave my comments there.

I would put on the record, too, that there has been a lot of debate—and I am not going to reflect on a vote of the Senate, as has been done—but in relation to the pharmaceuticals issue and drug testing, let us not forget that in our society there are drug trials, whether or not people have conscience views on those particular issues.

The issue of labelling is extraordinarily important. I mentioned it last night and I will say it again: we are having a conscience vote. I think we, whatever our conscience is here, have the freedom to exercise that vote, which is a difficult one, but we must extend the same privilege to all Australians. That means that people who have objections to the use of embryonic stem cells for the development of pharmaceuticals or indeed cosmetics have a right to know when they go to their chemist or other shop to get those goods that they are free from testing on embryonic stem cells. That is what this amendment does.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Stott Despoja has said that it does not cross the t's and dot the i's. We have a responsibility to see that it does if there is some shortcoming and not simply to say, `It's inadequate; therefore, we don't have any such regime.' I think this is a very crucial amendment. It is about consumers' right to know. It is a very deep ethical matter that consumers should be informed about. There has been a debate in the last week about consumers' right to not be told they are getting low fat foods if in fact there is more than three per cent fat in what it is that they are buying, and we are regulating to ensure that is the case. People have a right to know the level of fat content that is in the food they eat, but who could say that they do not also have a right to know if there has been testing on embryonic stem cells in the development of the pharmaceuticals or the cosmetics they are about to buy? I remind members that last night this chamber voted against a move to prohibit testing not just on pharmaceuticals but also on cosmetics as far as embryonic stem cells are concerned.</para><para>Whatever we might think on this divide about the ethical nature of using stem cells for experimentation, I see a strong argument here that everybody in the Australian community also has their right to conscience. This amendment is about the right of everybody to conscience. I appeal to people who are strongly in favour of this legislation and who have few qualms, or perhaps no qualms, about testing on embryonic stem cells for pharmaceuticals to recognise that other people do have qualms and that it is their basic right to be informed. That is absolutely critical. There is some analogy with the famous French seer's observation: `I might totally disagree with you, but I will defend your right to your opinion to the death.' This is a very critical, deep-seated ethical matter, and we must not deny other Australians, as purchasers of products, their right to not be involved in the experimentation process on embryonic stem cells. They have a right to have those products labelled, and they have a right to be informed. The amendment of Senator Harradine's should be supported for that reason.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>7119</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to pick up on a couple of Senator Stott Despoja's comments, because we might have an analogous issue with the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline> that could resolve this issue. On that occasion, when it was argued that this was not the bill to deal with this issue, the government went away and said, `Yes. We acknowledge there is a problem here, and we are prepared to do it through Customs regulation.' The point that Senator Stott Despoja made here is that the therapeutic goods process is probably the more appropriate way to deal with this, and she quite rightly made a number of points about detail that were relevant to how best to ensure that information related to the product would be available.</para></talk.start><para>I do not see any reason why in this matter, especially given Senator Patterson's comments about this not being the place to do it, the government could not give us an assurance that this information could be ensured to stay within the system through the therapeutic goods process. I would have thought that that would be a fairly straightforward way to resolve this issue—a way consistent with Senator Patterson's earlier comments, `If you have such moral standards, let's see you maintain them into the future.' All we are asking for is that that information be maintained into the future so that we can be held to our position. If this is not the appropriate place to do it, let us do it through the therapeutic goods process.

Anyone of us who has had dealings with labelling issues would know that comments about the simplicity of it all, in particular Senator Barnett's comments, are totally misplaced. We all remember the great debate about whether something was `Australian Made', `Made in Australia' or `Made from products grown in Australia'. We have tortured ourselves over that for years, as we have tried to work out the best way of accurately labelling goods. These issues are not simple; they are not easily resolved. That is not to say that they are not worth following up, and I accept there may be an argument for us to find some way of ensuring that those people who are aware of those issues and want products labelled are able to be satisfied. I do not have any difficulty with that principle.</para></talk.start><para>In this attempt by the parliament to bring national regulation to the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline>, to regulate on a national basis this area for the first time and to bring under national law research that has already been occurring, we have been asked essentially by opponents of the bill—largely by those who opposed it on the second reading—to deal with everything else that they have concerns about. I understand that. They are legitimate concerns, they are a part of the debate and it is important that they be dealt with. But it is a question of whether we can deal with all of that in this bill, and we have had that debate on a number of occasions.</para><para>The issue of labelling is worth pursuing. It will get some attention in the parliament, if it is not carried today. We will have to work through it. But it is complex; it is by no means simple. It is not something that we are going to be able to resolve adequately in the context of the bill today. In another amendment of Senator Harradine's, he suggested that people label their products to say that they had not been tested on embryos—I am not sure if he is still proceeding with that amendment. This amendment tries to go beyond what is practical for this bill. All around the chamber, we accept the message that we will have to deal with that. This is our first go at trying to regulate research in this area and to bring some national consistency and laws to the issue. I think much of the research is a way off yet, for commercial produce.</para><para>A review of the act is included in the bill. There are opportunities for us to pursue that issue but, at this stage, I do not think we are going to solve it by supporting Senator Harradine's amendment. The impact, again, would be probably to scuttle the bill—because it is far more complex, as we have found on other issues, than some senators would have us believe. It is appropriate that we defeat this amendment at this time and that senators look to pursue how we appropriately deal with the labelling issue for any commercial products that evolve from this research. It is a live issue. I do not think Senator Harradine's amendment gets us there today and, quite frankly, I do not think we are going to be able to adequately deal with that today. On those practical grounds, Labor will be opposing the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>11:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>7120</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I disagree with that, but Senator Evans did bring up the point that we had a long and difficult debate on the labelling of `Made in Australia'. You know what happened there, Chair: the commercial interests got their way. You can go to the supermarket now and buy a product that is labelled `Made in Australia' but which is not made in Australia. You can get a bottle of jam where the jam is made overseas and the bottle is made in Australia but, because the bottle cost 50 per cent of the product, it is labelled `Made in Australia'. You are taking home jam you think is made in Australia but it is not; it is made in Chile or in Bulgaria. It is a deception of the public, because the commercial interests got their way. The only way you can be assured that a product is totally made in Australia is to look for the label `Product of Australia', but very few consumers know that. Commercial interests won the day. </para></talk.start><para>There are two reasons why this amendment should be supported. The first is that we need, right at the outset, to make it clear that we are not going to allow commercial interests to get the jump on us on this occasion. The second is that it is in their interests to have this amendment on the books, because they are looking at the profit line in embryonic experimentation. Let us be clear about that; that is the motivation. If they know that they are going to have to label products as being derived from genetic material experimentation, they will have to factor that in to what they are doing. In other words, it is fair to them. If this amendment is inadequate, then I have no doubt that further down the line there will be legislation to make it adequate. But it is a very important signal that we intend that products will be labelled. To vote this amendment down is a very important signal to the commercial interests that, once again, they will be able to get at us and prevent the labelling being proper, when the day comes. I am glad you brought that example up, Senator Evans, because it proves the point, I think, that we need to build this amendment into the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline> now, as a signal to everybody, not just to the consumer but to the manufacturer as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>7121</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I stand again to support Senator Harradine's amendment and to respond to the comments of Senator Evans and, if I heard them correctly, of Senator Stott Despoja.

That is the point: the warnings are on those tobacco products. What we are doing here today is designing a regime—according to COAG, a strict regulatory and legislative regime—for research on human embryos, which through this bill opens the door to drug testing on human embryos and on human embryo stem cells.

I would seek a response from the minister, in the same way as I have asked for one from Senator Evans, that there will an undertaking, a commitment, that within a certain period of time this will be dealt with and will be fixed. Surely we can do that as a minimum. If we all agree that this is an area that requires addressing, let us fix it. I say we should do it now, here in this chamber; but if your proposal is to deal with it elsewhere, can we put that on the record? That might alleviate some concerns. I hope it does.</para><para>This whole thing is like the consumer's right to know and to have full disclosure. Drug testing on a human embryo is a controversial issue.

If that were the case, maybe you would not want to wear those clothes. Maybe that would be inappropriate and you would not feel right about that. Some perhaps would; some would not. Let us see if we can fix this. I would like to fix it here and now. I think the amendment is a sensible one, but I would like to have an undertaking to fix it, if we cannot fix it today.

I am seeking to omit the word `may' and insert in lieu thereof the word `must'. These are provisions where a licence is subject to the condition that, before an excess ART embryo is used as authorised by the licence, certain things must occur. Subclause (5) of the bill states:</para><quote><para>The conditions specified in the licence may include, but are not limited to, conditions relating to the following ...</para></quote><para>It then lists them.

That is very important. You just cannot have the licensing committee saying, `We will not bother about requiring certain things,' for example, the number of excess ART embryos whose use is authorised by the licence. This matter has been discussed in the chamber. In fact, Senator Bishop's amendment last night, which was carried, was specifically about the need to restrict the number of human embryos involved. I believe that this amendment strengthens that. It is no good having it just at the discretion of the licensing committee. There is a need to require certain things, including the one that I mentioned. It is also important to have the detail of persons authorised by the licence to use excess ART embryos, and there is a need to have information about a requirement to report what the program or schedule is for monitoring and so on.  </para><para>I commend the amendment. I hope the government will see its way clear not to leave this to the discretion of a licensing committee. The licensing committee does have nominated people on it, but they are largely from the industry and are very heavily committed to the industry. In those circumstances, it is important that the requirements are legislative requirements rather than at the discretion of the committee.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>7123</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I indicate that I will not be supporting the amendment.

I believe this amendment is not necessary. The NHMRC Licensing Committee may impose any conditions it thinks fit. As such, it is entirely unnecessary to amend the reference to specifically mention measures taken to comply with licence conditions.

These amendments have sought to mandate conditions of either licences that already exist or licences the details of which should be left to the discretion of the NHMRC Licensing Committee. This particular amendment would require licence holders to report to the NHMRC Licensing Committee on two specified dates every year.</para></talk.start><para>I feel as if we have actually had this discussion on a previous occasion but, just to reiterate it, I will be opposing this amendment on the basis that the NHMRC Licensing Committee should have the discretion to require reports with the regularity and at intervals that the licensing committee considers appropriate based on the consideration of each licence application. For example, rather than requiring reports at two arbitrary dates in the year, the NHMRC Licensing Committee may wish to impose as a condition of licence that the licence holder provide a report within a certain number of days of the embryo being used or after a certain number of embryos have been used or within a certain number of days of a monitoring visit by the inspectors appointed under the legislation. There may be other reasons that reporting might be more often than twice a year. In some circumstances, the licensing committee may require the licence holder to report every month, as I think I have said on a previous occasion while speaking on a previous amendment. </para><para>On an entirely practical administrative level, the NHMRC Licensing Committee may also wish to spread the due dates of reports provided by different licence holders over the course of the year so that all of the reports are not received by the committee at the same time and so that the work flow can be better managed. Senator Harradine may also understand that that could lead to closer scrutiny. If rather than having all of the reports coming at the one time they are coming in phased over time because the NHMRC have programmed them to fit the requirements of a particular licence—that is, that they want to monitor after the use of every embryo or for some other reason—and also to manage their work flow better, I would imagine they would then be more able to scrutinise the reports.</para><para> The second part of Senator Harradine's amendment states that the reports to be provided on 15 May and 15 November each year must `include details of the licence holder's effectiveness in advancing knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment'. This may not be practical. For example, if the licence was only issued in April, how could the licence holder be expected to provide a report to the committee in May and include details of advances in knowledge when the embryos may not even have been used? Also, the time scale of scientific research and reporting of such research may be quite long in comparison to the time scale of the licence. The work covered by the licence—that is, the work involving the use of an excess ART embryo— may be only a small component of the overall project. Again, this reinforces the need for a level of flexibility and for the NHMRC Licensing Committee to have responsibility for imposing appropriate and practical conditions given the circumstances of a particular case. For these reasons, I will not be supporting Senator Harradine's amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:37:00</time.stamp><page.no>7126</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The proof of the pudding will be in the eating.

Assisted reproductive technology has existed in Australia for approximately 30 years. Throughout that period, ART clinics have been using excess ART embryos that would otherwise have been destroyed for the purposes of training, quality assurance and research. In all states and territories, such activity since 1996 has been overseen by the human research ethics committees acting in accordance with NHMRC guidelines. In three jurisdictions, oversight has also been provided by regulatory bodies or committees where research that may destroy the embryo has been banned. In these three jurisdictions, applications for licences are considered by the relevant regulatory authority.

This shortage was amply demonstrated by the results of an Australian Bureau of Statistics survey entitled <inline font-style="italic">Private Medical Practitioners</inline>, which was released in late October this year. Although the conventional wisdom, including that of the Australian Medical Workforce Advisory Committee— AMWAC—is that there is an overall surplus of GPs in Australia, with an oversupply of GPs in metropolitan areas and an undersupply of GPs in rural and remote areas and outer metropolitan areas, a relatively recent Access Economics study commissioned by the Australian Medical Association has challenged this and asserted that there is in fact a national shortage of GPs. Using a demand model, the study estimated that there is `currently a shortfall of GPs of between 1,200 and 2,000'. Under a conservative scenario, Access Economics estimated that the `rural shortage is estimated at 700 FTE GPs and the urban area shortage at 500'. This study took issue with AMWAC's benchmarking, stating that `most Australians do not share AMWAC's view of adequate GP supply' and that `AMWAC's assumption of the acceptability of the benchmark is not backed up with any analysis or justification'. </para></talk.start><para>Under the policies of the Howard government, the number of GPs in regional Australia has significantly increased. However, demand for increased numbers of GPs is expected to continue over the next decade, with the Australian Bureau of Statistics estimating that Western Australia's population will rise by 13.1 per cent. Over the same period, the number of people aged 65 years and over in Western Australia is estimated to increase by 1.7 per cent. Elderly people generally consume more health care services than any other sector of the population and present with more complex health problems and with more chronic conditions that require management. Access Economics has estimated that the `demand for GP services based on an ageing population will increase by 1.27 per cent per annum over the next 10 years'.</para><para>The medical work force problem has been alleviated somewhat by a reliance on overseas trained doctors. In 1993-94, there were 664 temporary resident visas issued to overseas trained doctors throughout Australia. By last year, this had risen to 1,923 such visas. Western Australia is very heavily reliant on temporary resident overseas trained doctors to fill positions in hospitals, general practice and locum services; for example, the WA state hospital system is heavily dependent on overseas trained doctors and, without these doctors, the WA state hospital system would undoubtedly collapse.</para><para>In 1997-98 temporary resident doctors comprised 14.9 per cent of the WA medical work force, and 77.1 per cent of temporary resident overseas trained doctors were employed within metropolitan health services. Thirty-six per cent of Western Australia's rural medical work force are overseas trained doctors. There were 646 conditionally registered overseas trained doctors within Western Australia as at November 2001. This comprised: `unmet area of need', 427; recognised specialist qualifications and experience, 90; foreign specialist qualifications and experience and undergoing further training, 11; temporary registration in the public interest, eight; conditional registration for rural and remote general practice, 50; supervised clinical practice, 24; postgraduate training, 32; medical teaching, one; and medical research, three.</para><para>In 2002, 456 temporary resident overseas trained doctors were approved to work in general practice positions in areas of need in Western Australia. By way of contrast, only 58 temporary resident overseas trained doctors were approved to work in general practice positions in areas of need in New South Wales—with a population of 6.5 million in 2001, compared with Western Australia's population of just 1.9 million. The number of overseas trained doctors who were registered in the unmet area of need category has therefore increased by something like 380 per cent since 1996.</para><para>According to the Medical Board of Western Australia, the reliance placed on overseas trained doctors continues and it is considered that the number of locally trained doctors who take up appointments within the public health systems falls well short of meeting the needs of the community. As of September 2002, towns such as Broome, Collie, Donnybrook, Geraldton, Kalgoorlie and Mount Barker are all listed as areas of need with practice vacancies. The Access Economics report points out that due to competition with other countries, such as Canada, it will become increasingly difficult for Australia to recruit overseas trained doctors. The report notes:</para><quote><para>As this competition intensifies, simple demand pressures will push up the remuneration that medical practitioners willing to move to the country will be able to demand. </para></quote><para>Making matters even worse, other countries with doctor shortages are trying to poach Australian medical practitioners.</para><para>A recent study by Monash University and Melbourne University researchers Lesleyanne Hawthorne and Bob Birrell has brought into question the qualifications and fitness to practise of some overseas trained doctors. This study had a particular focus on permanent resident overseas trained doctors and revealed that, in some cases, doctors are working in public hospitals and as GPs in areas of need without having had their skills formally accredited. Permanent resident overseas trained doctors have been required to have their skills accredited by the Australian Medical Council. However, according to this study:</para><quote><para>... in recent years this policy has been effectively thwarted as State Medical Boards have provided `conditional registration' to permanent resident OTDs who have not completed their accreditation or have failed in their attempt to gain this accreditation.</para></quote><para>The study found that the great majority of temporary resident overseas trained doctors are from Britain, South Africa or other societies with medical skills similar to those in Australia. However, it found that the bulk of permanent resident overseas trained doctors:</para><quote><para>... have graduated from non-Western medical schools in Asia, the Middle East and Eastern Europe. Their training varies greatly in quality, relevance to the kinds of health problems encountered in Australia and preparedness for the advanced technology they encounter in the Australian hospital environment.</para></quote><para>These doctors can also experience difficulty in communicating with staff and patients. Surely it has to be said that English language skills are very important when it comes to practising medicine in Australia.</para><para>The President of the Rural Doctors Association of Australia, Dr Ken Mackey, has made the point that the skill levels of overseas trained doctors are variable and the continuity of care provided by the long-term general practitioner is lost. Similarly, the President of the Rural Doctors Association of Western Australia, Dr Graeme Jacobs, has said that there are some problems with overseas trained doctors and those problems are not only in clinical skills areas but also the social and cultural problems of putting overseas trained doctors into a remote area. For example, the WA Medical Board used to send overseas trained doctors to places like Meekathara in the Eastern Goldfields where there was no effective support or supervision, and the doctors concerned felt very vulnerable and exposed. It was hardly a prudent solution to the needs of such isolated towns and hardly fair to the doctors concerned, who felt they were being thrown in at the deep end.</para><para>All of this helps to demonstrate that over-reliance on overseas trained doctors is not in the overall best interests of the health and welfare of Australian patients; although in this regard it should be noted that, in response to concerns raised by hospitals, Western Australia has recently introduced an assessment procedure for overseas trained doctors seeking to be employed in unmet area of need positions in Western Australian hospitals in non-specialist and non-specialist training positions. The process is designed to reduce the potential for OTDs to be in a position where there is insufficient supervision and professional support.</para><para>The use of overseas trained doctors to fill medical work force shortages is essentially a stop-gap measure, and longer-term solutions are needed. One long-term solution would be to increase the number of Australian trained doctors. The University of Notre Dame in Fremantle has come to the conclusion that the only acceptable long-term solution to the doctors shortage problem is to increase the number of medical practitioners training and graduating in Western Australia. This is especially the case because the number of locally trained doctors who take up appointments within the WA public health system currently falls well short of meeting the demands of the community.</para><para>What is therefore required is an increase in the total number of medical school graduates produced in WA. Graduates produced in Western Australia will be more likely to practise within the state. Notre Dame University has pointed out that very few Eastern States medical graduates are prepared to spend their working lives in Western Australia. For some reason, the Nullarbor proves to be an enormous barrier. It is feared that, if there is not an increase in the number of locally produced graduates and trainees in WA, WA will become increasingly reliant on overseas trained doctors. Accordingly, Notre Dame is giving consideration to the establishment of a medical school at its Fremantle campus, using the facilities of other locations in the metropolitan area for teaching purposes as well. Notre Dame University proposes to establish a four-year postgraduate course for a medical degree. </para><para>After meeting with the people involved in planning the format of the proposed medical school, I came away very impressed with Notre Dame's case, not only on the grounds of the need to increase the number of doctors graduating in Perth but also because the focus of the curriculum will be on general practice medicine. Additionally, a new medical school would offer a choice of courses to WA students, the University of Western Australia being currently the only institution in the state that offers medicine. If Notre Dame medical school went ahead, it would be the first private medical school in Australia. It is proposed that the school develop partnerships to deliver its courses, with other universities, such as Curtin, delivering the basic medical science requirements in their curriculums. The school will also make use of the private sector for clinical placements in areas such as private hospitals, the aged sector and general practice.</para><para>It is proposed that the school will take 60 Australian students annually. If the school goes ahead, it will of course be some years before the first graduates are produced and even more before they complete postgraduate training and enter medical practice, but the importance of the initiative is that it will assist to provide a long-term solution to Western Australia's doctor shortage problem rather than the bandaid fix represented by overseas trained doctors. It is said that from small acorns great oak trees grow and, just as the now very large and prestigious UWA Medical School had small beginnings back in 1957, I am sure that, once established, the proposed Notre Dame medical school will develop into an important Australian medical institution.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation: Committee Report</title><page.no>7130</page.no></subdebateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Jacinta (The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT)</name><name role="display">The ACTING DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para><inline font-weight="bold"> (Senator Collins)</inline>—I call Senator Boswell.</para></talk.start></interjection><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>7130</page.no><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name><name.id>XE4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise today to speak on the report of the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee into the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Sec-urity Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>, which was tabled in this place late last night.

But I deliberately went on a diet a few years ago, and I thought that I had some success. I wish to speak on the report that was tabled late last night of the Sen-ate Legal and Constitutional References Com-mittee on the ASIO legislation. I would like to make some comments that I would otherwise have made on the tabling of the report but for the fact that we are in the last two weeks of parliament and that opportunity has not arisen before now. The committee report comes at the end of a short but ex-haus-tive process. The reference was passed onto the committee some six weeks ago by the Senate, and it was a reference into a major piece of legislation. In the interim six weeks, there were not only six long hearing dates, but also an endless number of private meet-ings. It has been a comprehensive process, and I think that the process and the report, in particular, provide a solid foundation for the parliament to consider this legislation into the future. But let us not underestimate the controversial nature of the legislation that the committee was inquiring into. This legislation is, in many ways, unprecedented legislation which demands, and in fact deman-ded during the process, serious attention. It demands close critical analysis of a whole range of complicated legal issues and it also de-mands an appreciation of changing security demands in the new environment which has befallen the world over the last 12 months or so. For me, this has been one of the few examples where senators have, in essence, shed their political guernseys and approached the task and assessed the subject before us. </para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>656</name.id><name role="metadata">Forshaw, Sen Michael</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>XE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Bolkus, Sen Nick</name><name role="display">Senator BOLKUS</name></talker><para>—As far, of course, as that may be possible, Senator Forshaw. But I think that in this particular case, senators had real issues that they had to address, and those issues were addressed on their merits, as I said, with all people having shed their political guernseys in approaching the legislation. </para></talk.start></continue><para>On both sides of the Senate, in the evolution of this reference, individuals have found themselves making recommendations and taking positions that they would not necessarily have started with at the start of the process. The recommendations that senators from both major parties have made are not in line with the starting position of their respective parties. It is good to see, from my side of parliament, that Senator Faulkner has signalled an indication to pick up the report's recommendations, even to the extent that they may have contradicted some pre-existing positions taken by the Labor Party. As I said, the unanimity expressed in the rec-om-mendations of this report, together with the substantive material in the report, provide a solid basis for further consideration—an out-come for the legislation that will be before the Senate over the next 10 days or so.</para><para>It was not an easy issue to focus on because of the highly charged environment in which this legislation and this nation find themselves at the moment. On one side—I suppose on the left side of politics—we have the traditional distrust of ASIO. ASIO is the perennial bogyman in political life and, as such, there is a real capacity for misconceptions to be bred not just about the role of ASIO but also about the sorts of extra functions that the parliament is considering giving ASIO. It has not been helpful that those misconceptions have, I think, blurred the thinking of a number of people in the debate. To them I say, `We understand why you have those concerns, but we can't forever hide behind the attitudes and sentiments that we developed in the sixties. The world has changed and it is important to see this nation, the policymakers of this nation and the role of ASIO in that new environment.' On the other hand, what was not helpful was the climate of fear and distrust of fellow citizens, which impacts enormously on public debate, and national debate in particular, on issues such as this. These factors do not help rational debate, but I think that it is fair to say that, if anyone was to read the report of the committee, they would come to the conclusion that the committee was able to put these sorts of environmental aspects aside and focus on some pretty important fundamental issues.</para><para>As I said, the committee process was comprehensive and exhaustive. We had over 400 submissions in a short period of time. It has to be recognised that all but the submissions from government agencies criticised the legislation, and they criticised it trenchantly and, I must say, forensically. From one-page submissions to theses, in essence, the committee was confronted with the broad range of issues. I do not want or seek to identify an exhaustive list of important and influential submissions. There was an endless list of that sort of submitter. But organisations from the Law Council to individual citizens found the opportunity to put their views to us. We had advice from people from universities and from people in the community who could very well see themselves as being those targeted by this legislation. For instance, the voices of Islamic communities, nationally as well as those from Sydney and Melbourne, were considered by the committee. People from those communities made solid and well thought out submissions. We had submissions from well-experienced people like Gavan Griffith, the former Australian Solicitor-General, who made some quite telling points and advised the committee on the basis of experience he had in cases before the High Court. We also had organisations such as the Public Defenders Office of New South Wales and similar community legal centre structures in Victoria who gave the committee advice from the perspective of the on-the-ground, practical solicitor or barrister who would have to handle the impact of this legislation. </para><para>It was not easy legislation. This has been controversial legislation. The fact that it is controversial is not something that has been generated during the course of this inquiry. This inquiry follows a direct parliamentary committee report—a unanimous report from that committee—which raised some fairly fundamental concerns in respect of the legislation that is being debated by the parliament. It was interesting to hear the chair of the committee, Mr David Jull MHR, make some comments urging sober consideration of the Senate committee's report earlier this morning. In this climate, it is important for the Attorney-General—the chief law officer of this nation—to take his responsibilities as the chief law officer seriously and make a sober assessment of the report and the recommendations of that report. A knee-jerk reaction is not enough and has not fulfilled his responsibilities, as we saw in the early hours of this morning. It is important for the Attorney-General and his department to recognise that this legislation does seek some way to accommodate the government but, more importantly, does so within the spirit, history and tradition of the Australian democratic system of government.</para><para>I would like to thank my colleagues. I think that it is important in this particular instance to thank not just the staff but also colleagues who participated quite constructively in this. In particular, I would like to thank the deputy chair who spent hour after hour in the early deliberations on this legislation with the secretariat and me. I think all colleagues committed themselves to this process with enormous enthusiasm. I would like to thank the staff of the committee: Peter Hallahan, the secretary; Louise Gell; Noel Gregory; Rebecca Eames; Michelle Lowe; the administration staff; and a specialist staffer whom we adopted for this process from the Parliamentary Library, Nathan Hancock. They put hour after hour of not just physical application but also enormously sophisticated and high-quality mental application into this process. I suppose in thanking them I should also thank their families who have spent much of the last couple of weeks without their spouses and parents while they were deliberating on this report. I have also got to thank, I must say, government departments— the Attorney-General's Department, the Aust-ralian Federal Police and ASIO—that came back a number times. I think ASIO came back to us five times with the Attorney-General's Department to help the committee in its deliberations.</para><para>There were probably two substantive threshold issues which were the driving force for the legislation. In short, the stated objective of the legislation was to enable government agencies to extract intelligence information that may substantially assist in the investigation of a terrorist offence and to ex-tract that information with the main objective of avoiding that terrorist threat becoming reality. The information to be sought is not directed to be sought from persons suspected of being offenders, being terrorists, or being in-volved in a terrorist offence. The target people under this legislation are very much those who may have intelligence or knowledge, but who are not suspected of an offence. That is why this legislation is a bit different from the raft of legislation already available to government agencies. As I said right from the start in respect of this particular point, both major parties have acknowledged that this objective—one identified by the agencies and restated by the government—needs to be satisfied, and that objective was unanimously accepted by the committee.</para><para>The second threshold point and major structural point was that, once you recognise there needs to be a capacity to gather that intelligence, who is the best agency to perform that function? Here we were met with a number of options. People put to us a new ACCC or a royal commission model, although I think it is fair to say that all members of the committee thought that was an excessive response to this particular situation. Another model put forward by submitters was the UK or Canadian model with the possibility of developing the offence of having knowledge but not imparting that to agencies. We thought, firstly, that that took the non-suspect into a realm that a particular person should not be in and, secondly, that it was not conducive to distilling the information. That course was not accepted. </para><para>Then it came to a question of competing agencies—AFP or ASIO. On the one hand, should we give the function to ASIO? It was not a function that ASIO traditionally conducted. But in recognising that it was not a traditional function, we also recognised that they had the expertise and the background intelligence knowledge. By giving it to ASIO, there would be enhanced accountability processes available to parliament, particularly, to see how the power was exercised. For the AFP, intelligence gathering we were told would be a new role—although that assertion really did not hold water after a number of submitters spelt out some of the intelligence gathering roles of the AFP. But for me in particular—and I think for other members of the committee—if the AFP were to perform this function, they would have to necessarily build an intelligence gathering capacity. They would probably have to go back to what we were warned about by Senator Ray some six weeks ago: setting up a special branch structure to ensure that they were fully equipped to perform the intelligence gathering and the questioning in particular. So I think it is fair to say that there was a unanimous report and that unanimous report on this particular point was that ASIO could perform the function. The AFP should be in the field, though, in terms of apprehending the particular person of interest, and ASIO's role would be limited in essence to the examination using their enormous intelligence database to be able to do that properly.</para><para>Having decided to go down that road then of course the operational issues became important. How do you supervise the function? What sort of rights should accrue to the person of interest? What sorts of protection should that person get and under what detention regime should that person be kept? If one were to look at the recommendations of the Senate committee, the most striking aspect is that of 27 recommendations, 24 received unanimous support, with government senators having some partial qualification in respect of three of those. For three of the other 27 recommendations, one government senator dissented and the others supported the recommendations. </para><para>In essence, the committee proposes an oversight structure whereby much reliance is placed on retired judges of 10 years experience not only to issue warrants but also to supervise the questioning. At the same time, access to lawyers would be provided on the basis of legal assistance from government. There would also be access to interpreters. The detention regime would be tailored very much towards ensuring that once questioning was over, the need for detention would not continue. But the questioning regime would allow quite comprehensive questioning which, if modelled on the Commonwealth Crimes Act, would ensure that the Commonwealth agencies would have up to 20 hours of questioning under a first warrant.</para><para>This is a very well thought out and comprehensive report which should provide the basis for further consideration of this legislation by the parliament. I do urge the Attorney-General to both chew gum and think at the same time. I am sure it is within the capacity of government to do that. It is important for the Attorney-General to fulfil his responsibilities to treat this report soberly and to recognise the spirit in which it was developed by all sides of parliament. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Forestry: Tasmania</title><page.no>7133</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>7133</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on what is a very important issue in my state: forestry. I start by referring to a letter to the editor by the Premier of the state on 1 November 2002. In that letter, the Premier said:</para></talk.start><quote><para>The truth is that the Tasmanian community has been attempting to find a balance between employment in a sustainable forest industry and conservation for years.</para><para>We had the Helsham inquiry back in 1987. There were at least 15 inquiries prior to that.</para><para>Then followed another nine, including the Forests and Forest Industry Strategy until 1997 when the Regional Forest Agreement was developed.</para><para>By anyone's standards, this represents a scientific and measured approach to maintaining investment and jobs and at the same time protecting large areas of our forests. </para></quote><para>In large part, I do not disagree with the Premier's statement. But it concerns me that whilst we have had those inquiries and those reports, which have contained recommendations, and whilst we have a Regional Forest Agreement that sets down criteria for the management of the forests in both a commercial and preservation sense, the problem is that commitments to the recommendations are simply not there. I refer to the National Forest Policy Statement. It said:</para><motion><para>That it is desirable to maintain and protect the extent and ecological integrity of native forests on public land.</para><para>Accordingly, the Governments will adopt the policy that further clearing of ... native forests for non-forest use or plantation establishment will be avoided or limited, consistent with ecologically sustainable management ...</para></motion><para>The reality is that all of the forests being cleared on native forest public land in Tasmania are being turned into plantations. It raises the question of what we are doing in terms of the obligations that we signed up to in respect of the National Forest Policy Statement that was the basis upon which the Regional Forest Agreements were developed. I want to quote an extract from the Forestry Tasmania <inline font-style="italic">Sustainable forest management</inline> report. At the bottom of page 5 it says:</para><quote><para>What is sustainable forest management? The National Forest Policy Statement of 1992 provides the following definition:</para><para>The integration of commercial and non-commercial values of forests so that both the material and non-material welfare of society is improved, whilst ensuring that the values of forests, both as a resource for commercial use and for conservation, are not lost or degraded for current and future generations.</para></quote><para>That was very interesting, because last Friday I asked Forestry Tasmania exactly where in the National Forest Policy Statement that quote could be found. They were unable to tell me. I suspect they were unable to tell me because it actually is not in there. What the National Forest Policy Statement said in terms of ecologically sustainable management is this:</para><quote><para>The Ecologically Sustainable Development Working Group on Forest Use specified three requirements for sustainable forest use: maintaining the ecological processes within forests (the formation of soil, energy flows, and the carbon, nutrient and water cycles); maintaining the biological diversity of forests; and optimising the benefits to the community from all uses of forests within ecological constraints.</para></quote><para>That is at page 47 of the National Forest Policy Statement. At page 15 it said:</para><quote><para>Ecologically sustainable management of native forests for wood production involves maintaining a permanent native forest estate while balancing these uses.</para></quote><para>It is not possible to do that if you turn a cleared native forest into a plantation. It is just not possible. That is one of the fundamental reasons that forestry continues to attract significant debate in Tasmania. Of course it does not end there. I am a former member of the executive of the Forests and Forest Industry Council. As indicated at page 17 of the Forests and Forest Industry Council's 1990 report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Secure futures for forests and people,</inline> its mission statement said:</para><quote><para>To responsibly and sensitively manage Tasmania's forests in a way that:</para><para>1.	Protects and conserves environmental values;</para><para>2.	Provides long-term job security and additional job opportunities for employees;</para><para>3.	Provides long-term security of resource for industry;</para><para>4.	Provides long-term prospects for competitive markets for Crown and private forest products.</para></quote><para>Again, essentially, none of those things is really being adhered to—none of them. You might say, `What about the jobs and what about the security for industry?' The resource security is there in part but the jobs are being lost. Nobody can say that jobs in the forest industry in Tasmania are increasing. They are not. In terms of Crown forest management—that is, Crown forest; the native forest of Tasmania and public land—on pages 6, 28 and 34 of its report the Forests and Forest Industry Council's further said:</para><quote><para>Pulpwood— </para></quote><para>that is, woodchip wood—</para><quote><para>for export will now be strictly limited to that surplus to domestic needs—</para></quote><para>of which we have none—</para><quote><para>and arising from the predominant sawlog strategy for public forests.</para><para>... it will be necessary to manage the majority of the public forest on an 80 to 85 year rotation (to optimise sawlog production) ... A combination of options mainly requiring an 80 to 85 year rotation for eucalypt sawlogs from wood production forests should be adopted with some areas identified for longer rotations for special timbers.</para></quote><para>Is that happening? No, not at all. Further it says:</para><quote><para>Crown regrowth forests that have sawlog potential will not be clearfelled for pulpwood supply except where:</para></quote><para>·	There are no economically feasible alternatives—</para><para>and there are, and—</para><para>·	It is for domestic pulp and paper production—</para><para>for which we have none, and—</para><para>·	It occurs as part of a transition strategy to transfer domestic pulpwood productions for native forests to supply sourced primarily from specific plantations.</para><para>Again, all of those things are not being delivered. That is why we saw such an outcome in the last state election—despite the fact that the size of the House of Assembly in Tasmania was reduced, four Greens were elected. What does that do in terms of jobs for Tasmanians in the forest industry? It does nothing at all. Of course, we have had many promises regarding development of manufacturing or downstream processing in Tasmania. There have probably been 10 that I can think of during the course of the last 12 years, but none of them has been developed. We have seen all sorts of proposals from Forestry Tasmania, the forest managing body. The latest ones are the two proposed Southwood projects: one in the north-west and one in the south-east. They are proposed as an integrated milling process that also incorporates a biomass power plant. </para><para>I deal first with the biomass energy plant. Last Friday, I questioned Forestry Tasmania with regard to whether or not they had had any discussions with Hydro Tasmania or Aurora Energy about the purchase of the excess power that would be generated by these plants for integration into the electricity grid along with other electricity generated by Hydro Tasmania. They said that they had not. Yet all of the promotional material that you read suggests that this is a viable option; that this is part of the overall development of the Southwood projects. But the reality is that the biomass energy generated from the burning of eucalypt wood is, at this point in time, way too expensive even with renewable energy credits. </para><para>They are proposing a development that will have a power plant, generated by the burning of eucalypt as a biomass energy source, that will provide the power for the integrated sawmill, the rotary peeling plant et cetera, that is more expensive than power that could be sourced out of the power network. They also say that the additional power that will be generated by these power plants will be made available for sale in the state power network. Who will buy it? Why would Hydro Tasmania or Aurora Energy buy power that is more expensive than what they can get from elsewhere? When we get Basslink in place that will be even more the case. Why would they do that? They will not do it.</para><para>We come to the more recent practice, according to Mr Kim Creak of Forestry Tasmania, of exporting whole hardwood eucalypt logs to Korea and China. Everything in terms of the financial future of Forestry Tasmania, as Mr Evan Rolley put it, is `hanging on the Southwood projects'. That is the only way there is going to be any financial future for Forestry Tasmania. </para><para>In an article in the <inline font-style="italic">Mercury</inline> on 13 November entitled `Extra export value in logs with a peel', Kim Creak, the General Manager of Operations for Forestry Tasmania stated:</para><quote><para>... the logs would go to China and Korea for rotary peeling trials as part of an export market development program.</para></quote><para>I can remember back in 1994 reading a similar sort of statement. Here we are eight years on and Mr Creak is saying these logs will be sent there as part of a program to develop a market for rotary peeled veneer. Yet Forestry Tasmania will suddenly say in about 12 months or 18 months time, `No more logs; you have to buy the veneer.' I really do not know who they think they are kidding. The reality is that neither the Chinese nor the Koreans are going to be buying rotary peeled veneer from Tasmania when they can access hardwood logs from around the globe, including from elsewhere in Australia, and peel them in a country where the wage economy is way below ours. Their own manufacturing costs are also far less than ours.  </para><para>I do not know what it will take to wake up Forestry Tasmania and the state government to the reality that this proposal for the future will just not work. We had any number of proposals prior to this, including fibre form. The pulp companies, when they were under licence conditions for the export of woodchips, developed all sorts of proposals for downstream processing. Not one of those proposals has come to fruition. </para><para>The reality is that Forestry Tasmania is selling these logs overseas because it needs the cash; it is doing it for no other reason. That is very unfortunate because what it is doing in the process is destroying the future of the Tasmanian sawmilling industry. That has to be stopped. It is at a critical stage right now, because we are talking about a very short period of time. I hope—I am still an optimist—that the Tasmanian government will take this into account and do some proper research in this area, turn this around and protect the future remaining jobs in Tasmania's sawmilling industry.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Australia Post: Postal Services</title><page.no>7136</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>7136</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Today I would like to talk about the impact of the government's planned reforms for Australia Post and the potential impact of the World Trade Organisation on the future of Australian postal services. It was revealed recently that Senator Alston has planned reforms for Australia Post, which were announced on 14 November. Those plans clearly revealed that the government is still intent on the deregulation agenda of Australia Post. The reforms that the minister has foreshadowed will for the first time effectively allow foreign competition for parts of Australia Post's reserved service. It will be the first major incursion into the reserved service. The reform legislation, which the minister says will be introduced early next session, will weaken the Australia Post reserved service which for years has been protected by the Australian Postal Corporation Act.</para></talk.start><para>The minister says that it is only—and I use his term—`legitimising' the current practice of document exchange, such as Ausdoc, which has been operating, he says, for a number of years. However, in order to `legitimise' these document exchange businesses, the minister seems to think he has to cut into the reserved service of Australia Post. As the minister knows, by `legitimising' this practice he will also be opening the door for foreign competitors, and therefore extending way beyond current document exchange companies, such as Ausdoc, which he has totally ignored. The minister will allow foreign competition into parts of Australia Post's reserved service. That is the bottom line and that is the intent of this legislation.</para><para>We have seen the full deregulation agenda for Australia Post put forward by this minister twice before. The full extent of the coalition's deregulation agenda was first revealed in the <inline ref="R1031">Postal Services Legislation Amendment Bill 2000</inline>. It was resoundingly rejected following a Senate inquiry and in the face of massive public opposition, particularly by regional Australia. The minister then had another go through the secret preparation of amendments to a second piece of postal deregulation legislation called the <inline ref="R1177">Communications and the Arts Legislation Amendment Bill 2001</inline>. It is fairly innocuously titled but there are major implications. Again the minister failed to get any support for his deregulation agenda. The recent announcement that he made is exactly the same deregulation agenda all over again, but this time the government is attempting it in a sneaky and underhanded manner, and the cavalier spin being promoted by the minister is that it is merely endorsing what currently happens. This is dead wrong. Regional Australians will not be fooled by this. It is important that it starts to get a public airing so that people know what is happening. </para><para>This is deregulation of Australia Post by stealth. While the minister attempts to defend this, he is defending the indefensible. The government tried it once before and now they are using a direct approach by legitimising current document exchange providers to try and do it again. Extraordinarily, we have no idea what the impact of this proposed legislation will be on Australia Post, on Australia Post's bottom line in terms of profit or on their services. We have no idea. When we asked Australia Post during estimates hearings they said that they had not even seen the draft legislation, they had done no cost-benefit analysis, they were not aware of it and they were not consulted.</para><para>We already know that big courier and international mail operators such as DHL, FedEx, UPS and TNT subsidiary Spring are poised to take a slice of the action. They are in there ready to go—foreign competitors coming in to compete in relation to this issue. The minister claims that Australia Post accept the government's decision—that is what he says—because they have condoned the practice of document exchanges. In recent Senate estimates hearings—and he was talking on behalf of Australia Post; he was sitting right next to them—the minister said:</para><quote><para>... they—</para></quote><para>that is, Australia Post—</para><quote><para>have no reason to believe that any of the proposals will have an adverse effect on Post.</para></quote><para>Australia Post then went on to tell us that they had not even seen the draft legislation. They had no idea whether it would or would not have such an effect. I find that extraordinary. They were just blindly nodding. What was made extremely clear was that it is a government agenda, not an Australia Post agenda. It is a government push by the minister which Australia Post have not been dealt into. The reality is that it will have an adverse effect on Australia Post. If you open up a section of the reserved service to foreign competition, of course it is going to have an impact on Australia Post, of course it is going to have an impact on Australia Post's bottom line, and of course it will have an impact on services. This is the Minister Alston's first strike on Australia Post's reserved service area. He is a minister who is determined to get the deregulation of Australia Post up in any way that he can.</para><para>The long-term agenda for Australian postal services by this government is eventually to allow full competition from foreign companies to all postal services in Australia through the World Trade Organisation's General Agreement on Trade in Services, known as GATS. This will have a devastating impact on Australia Post. The WTO is currently in negotiations regarding the General Agreement on Trade in Services. These negotiations are about the dismantling of trade restrictions in publicly provided services such as post, telecommunications and water supplies, amongst an extensive list of other areas. Today my focus is just on postal services, but I do want to emphasise that it is a very long list that is encompassed by the GATS and it is a very long list that the government is currently in negotiation about.</para><para>It was made very clear in the recent Senate estimates hearing on 20 November that Minister Alston, when directly challenged, would not rule out foreign competition for Australia Post's monopoly on the delivery of standard letters—he just would not rule it out. I am very suspicious as to why, if there is no agenda. If there is no an agenda, I call on him to rule it out. He would not rule out the effective deregulation of Australia Post under the guise of the General Agreement on Trade in Services. I am aware that the current round of WTO GATS negotiations will see extensive discussion on the liberalisation of postal services. These discussions will include a redefinition of the current WTO definitions of postal, courier and express delivery services, as well as clarification of the role of public and private providers. These seemingly benign discussions have very serious implications for the future of Australia Post.</para><para>As senators would be aware, the community and the parliament were locked out of the negotiations on the Multilateral Agreement on Investment some years ago. It is important, I believe, for us as parliamentarians to ensure that the negotiations on the World Trade Organisation's GATS are not the same and that they are transparent and open. The Australian public must be kept fully informed on each stage of the negotiations and fully informed on what the impact of the negotiations on the General Agreement on Trade in Services will be on their services. It is clear that the approach of the government is that this is `confidential'. It has no plans to make public any details of the position that Australia will take on the GATS before Australia signs up to the agreement. </para><para>During recent Senate estimates hearings, despite repeated questioning, the Department of Communications, Information Technology and the Arts and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade were unable to or would not give any details on the specific requests made in the current round of negotiations. It is outrageous that the representative minister at the Foreign Affairs estimates, Senator Hill, would not even give a commitment that the government would allow parliamentary scrutiny of Australia's GATS negotiations before they were completed. The Australian public and the parliament are being completely left in the dark on this. GATS negotiations should be opened up to full public scrutiny and debate. I am raising these concerns so that, like the round of negotiations on the MAI, more Australian citizens are aware of what happens in international forums without their consent or without any analysis of what impact it is going to have on them directly.</para><para>This secrecy can be seen in regard to GATS and postal services in a discussion paper of the department of communications released earlier this year. This paper gave the impression of a government agency which has little concern for postal services and little concern for the forthcoming WTO negotiations. Whilst I am advised that the paper was designed to consult with industry on Australia's response to these proposals, I am aware that there has been a big delay in that consultation and that there was no intention to consult more widely than with industry. I doubt that even industry is going to get much of a go. There were certainly no negotiations with the critical union in that area, the CEPU. Perish the thought that the government should actually talk to the people who work for Australia Post!</para><para>Even Australia Post itself was totally unaware of any developments in the WTO GATS negotiations that may affect postal services for some time. In fact, in Australia Post's submission in response to the department of communication's discussion paper-, they made two points. First, they urged government to oppose any deregulation of the reserved service through the WTO and to support fair trading in postal and courier markets. Second, Australia Post recommended that the government discuss and agree on a new, clearer classification scheme for the sector to remove the distinction between postal and courier services. </para><para>I am also aware that the CEPU and the Post Office Agents Association Ltd, one of the small business organisations that represent people in the postal industry, located mainly in regional Australia, also made submissions that expressed very similar if not stronger views than Australia Post. So we have the union and the small business sector in the area saying the same thing.</para><para>Contrary to what the department's discussion paper said, these proposals have the potential to seriously affect Australia Post and Australian postal services. This would be through the restriction of services that could be provided by Australia Post or through opening up access arrangements of Australia Post's network to foreign companies—to its obvious disadvantage. The latter was precisely the mechanism that this government unsuccessfully sought to introduce to Australia Post as part of its deregulation agenda—when it was being open about the fact that it was a deregulation agenda, unlike now where we are seeing it being done by stealth.</para><para>Given that the Australian postal market is already open to extensive competition, the Australian government should not support any further liberalisation proposed under the WTO GATS negotiations. I would also argue for Australian parliamentary approval before any resulting WTO GATS agreements are made. Unfortunately, it appears that this will not be forthcoming if the estimate hearings of a couple of weeks ago are anything to go by. Parliament, industry and the people of Australia have a right to be fully consulted and fully informed about any postal service proposals and negotiations. </para><para>Clearly, the WTO GATS negotiation process is emerging as a major motivation for governments to work towards the deregulation and privatisation of postal services throughout the world. A key development has been the release of the European Union's proposals to a wide range of countries, including Australia, for the removal of a whole range of trade `restrictions' in various industries, postal and courier services. The EU, representing 15 countries, has been asking Australia to include in the GATS negotiations all of our postal items and all modes of delivery `handled by any type of commercial operator, whether public or private'.</para><para>My understanding is that, although some GATS rules apply to all services, many apply only to those services which each government agrees to list in the agreement, and there is pressure on governments to add to the list of services that would fall under GATS provisions. Currently, GATS has rules which recognise the right of government to regulate services and to provide and fund public services, and I think the average citizen of Australia would be very thankful that that kind of regulation continues to exist in an increasingly global economic environment.</para><para>But in the current negotiations, all governments are being asked to increase the range of services which they agreed would be covered in GATS and to make changes to the rules of GATS which would in effect reduce a sovereign government's right to regulate its own services. The EU's proposals request that the Australian government take steps to open up domestic postal and courier services by allowing access to the Australian postal market for companies based in the European Union, and there are many of those.</para><para>Given that the only area of the Australian postal market which is not open to competition is the reserved service, I would say that this is obviously what the European Union is after. I am aware of what has happened in the European Union and Great Britain. I would encourage the government to make the WTO GATS negotiations open to parliamentary scrutiny and to at least advise the people of Australia what the impact would be. But what we have here is cloud of secrecy and a `no' from the minister in terms of any information on what is happening with GATS. At the end of the day, the reality is that the decisions will be made without recourse to the parliament or to the people of Australia.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Women: Violence</title><page.no>7139</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>7139</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak about the issue of violence affecting women. In particular, I would like to look at some recent developments in my home state of South Australia and how these issues are affecting or are involved in wider debate about women and gender violence. As many people will know, last Friday marked the beginning of the global campaign called `16 days of activism against gender violence'. As I am sure this chamber is aware, violence is a reality for millions of women around the world, irrespective of their race, culture or age. Although there is evidence to suggest that violence against women is more prevalent among women and girls of lower socioeconomic status, we know that it affects women from every walk of life, whether they are wealthy or poor.</para></talk.start><para>Recognising the global nature of violence against women, the `16 days of activism against gender violence' campaign is global in scope. It is supported by more than 1,000 organisations around the world. A quick web site search, for example, reveals that this campaign will reach from Adelaide to Angola, Croatia to Cambodia, Israel to India and Rwanda to Russia. The campaign will highlight all forms of gender violence, sexual violence and physical violence: violence against mothers, violence against daughters, violence against women in their homes, violence in the community, violence by loved ones, violence by the state, violence against women in the armed forces, violence against refugees, violence in times of peace and violence in times of war. </para><para>The 16-day campaign incorporates four significant dates: 25 November was the International Day Against Violence Against Women, which commemorates the murder of the Mirabal sisters by the Trujillo dictatorship in the Dominican Republic on 25 November back in 1960; 1 December, which we know as World Aids Day; 6 December, which marks the anniversary of the Montreal massacre, when, as you may recall, a man walked into a Montreal university and shot 14 women, engineering students, for being feminists; and 10 December, which marks the 54th anniversary of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, in which nations around the world acknowledge that every human being has a right to life, liberty and security of person without distinction of any kind. The global campaign will utilise as many forms of media as the number of countries that are participating, from video clips, radio advertisements, documentaries, stickers, posters, billboards, calendars, marches, street theatre, visual arts, public debate, seminars, workshops and fundraisers to fair stalls. </para><para>In my home state, I was honoured to launch the South Australian chapter of this campaign on Friday last week, when people gathered at the Migration Museum for the launch. It chose to focus on the issue of adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse. The South Australian campaign seeks to increase community awareness of the prevalence of childhood sexual abuse and the secrecy that so often surrounds this issue. It seeks to increase the community's capacity to respond appropriately to adult survivors, particularly those who choose to disclose their experiences. We know that in Australia one in three women and one in six men—these are horrifying statistics—have experienced this abuse. These numbers clearly identify this issue as a mainstream issue. However, as we know, Australians in the past have been willing to sweep this issue under the carpet or to at least leave it to the experts. Obviously, it is a very difficult issue with which to grapple. This issue is therefore the focus of the South Australian campaign. The slogan of the campaign is: `Listen. Believe. Make our journey easier.'</para><para>As I said at the launch, there are many things I could say about this issue. I could talk about the statistics more. I could talk about the evidence linking child sex abuse to mental illness later in life and what we could do to address this. I could talk about the flaws in the criminal justice system. I could talk about prevention strategies. But the bottom line—and this has come through in this campaign and from people we have talked to who have experienced childhood sex abuse—is simply that they want to feel confident that they can disclose their experiences, that they can be heard and that they can be believed. That is what the campaign is about: ensuring that our community is one in which people feel safe and secure to tell their experiences, a community that is aware of the prevalence of child sexual abuse and refuses to stigmatise those who have been abused. As a community, we have to be honest about this issue. By treating it as secret or taboo, we fail to give legitimacy to the claims of those who have been abused, we turn a blind eye to offenders and we breach our duty of care to future generations. Women's Health Statewide, who launched this campaign, have been at the forefront of these issues in South Australia—among other groups, of course—and I congratulate them on their attempts to raise awareness of the prevalence of this issue and their attempts to increase the community's capacity to respond.</para><para>Another issue which I wish to address is of a serious nature. It is of grave concern to me and many others. Mr Acting Deputy President Ferguson, being a South Australian yourself, you may know about this issue which is starting to dominate debate in our home state. I refer to the emergence of a group known as the Black Shirts in South Australia. The group started in Melbourne, with a view to spreading nationally. The Black Shirts web site states:</para><quote><para>The Black shirts are dedicated to support any and all who crave to bring back the very term marriage and family and stand against any force or power bent on corrupting children or the dismantling of the family unit or the destruction of the marriage.</para></quote><para>Some people may say that this sounds like a reasonable objective, but this stand has taken the form of picketing outside the homes and workplaces of women who are separated from previous partners or who have begun a new relationship. The founder of the Black Shirts, Mr John Abbott, along with others who are similarly clad in black, with their faces and identities often masked, claim that they are working to support the sanctity of marriage and to strengthen the family through leafleting houses, lecturing via microphones or megaphones and visiting neighbours. They claim that the campaign is to alert neighbours and coworkers to `unsavoury actions' and to shame `morally corrupt' women. </para><para>One Melbourne demonstration involved the letterboxing of pamphlets which contained personal information about a family residing in that street and which referred to the woman involved by her first name. I am very worried about these campaigns. I think these are campaigns of harassment aimed at humiliating, undermining, ultimately controlling and potentially terrorising women. It is a signal to women that their choices and their lives are not their own.</para><para>At the same time as the Black Shirts nobly claim that their fundamental code is to stay within the bounds of the law, there is the potential of wholesale flouting of that law. Men are called on to `study the law and then decide if and when and what means to use to protect his own children'. There is a call for men to examine which laws to apply to them and to follow only those, while advocating that an individual accused of a crime be dealt with `by the letter of the law' and not `restrained of their freedom on hearsay and innuendoes only to be denied of what is rightfully theirs'. `Rightfully theirs'—as we approach the end of 2002, women and children should not be referred to as the possessions of someone else, as the possessions of men. The Black Shirts say, `When it comes to protecting our children, the law must stop at the gate.' I have been very careful to use the terminology that has been used by this group so as not to misrepresent them in any way.</para><para>An issue of great concern to the Black Shirts is the failure of the law to deal with adulterers. In relation to adulterers, Mr Abbott believes:</para><quote><para>People should take them out, find the nearest branch and hang them for what they're doing. But unfortunately the law does not allow that, and we are law-abiding. The question they need to ask is how long before the laws change ...</para></quote><para>I hope we see no vigilante behaviour or changes to the law introduced in the near future in relation to this issue. I am sure that these kinds of views are news to the chamber. Marriage breakdown is a sad reality. Rarely is such breakdown the fault of one party. I will not elaborate on that. I think people have differing views but we have laws that reflect this reality. The Black Shirts are picketing in cases where marriage has already broken down, where parties have separated and are trying to move forward. Their aim must be to have women and children return to broken relationships and broken homes. Surely that is the objective if those are their actions. I understand that a meeting of the Black Shirts was held in Adelaide recently and that it was not well attended. I think that speaks well for our home state of South Australia and I hope that it is a signal to people to rethink their actions.</para><para>Another matter of concern in the last element of my contribution today also affects women in South Australia. It is the threat to their right to protest against war and other forms of violence. That right is currently being questioned. The Speaker of the House of Assembly in the South Australian parliament, the Hon. Peter Lewis, ruled last week that monthly vigils held by the Women in Black movement are too frequent and has declared that vigils every three months should be sufficient.</para><para>Women in Black is an international movement which utilises silent vigils to protest against things such as war, rape as a tool of war, ethnic cleansing and human rights abuses all over the world. Founded in 1988 to protest against Israeli occupation of the West Bank, Women in Black—speaking a variety of languages in a growing number of countries—now gather regularly in silent vigil. In New York City they meet weekly on the steps of the New York Public Library. I note that women also gather in Azerbaijan, Belgrade, Italy and England.</para><para>The Adelaide chapter of Women in Black have been holding monthly peaceful, silent vigils on the steps of Parliament House in Adelaide for more than a year. However, it has now been claimed by the Speaker of the House of Assembly that these monthly gatherings are excessive and that allowing such forms of protest will result in a plethora of groups seeking to protest outside Parliament House and will ultimately lead to confrontation. I understand that Adelaide's Women in Black are seeking a meeting with the Speaker of the House of Assembly to discuss this issue and in the meantime intend to silently and peacefully protest. I wish them well with their efforts to gain that meeting. I hope that the South Australian parliament will reconsider that decision. While I may not always share the views of all organisations or community groups, I certainly recognise their right to protest in a lawful manner and one that does not involve intimidation, harassment or terrorism of our citizens, whether they be men or women. </para><para>I put these issues on the record today not only because I and others feel strongly about them but because we are in the midst of the `16 days of activism against gender violence'. It is an appropriate time for us, in the 21st century, to reflect on how men and women are treated in this day and age. I hope that we see some movement from peace-loving individuals. In relation to the issue of the Black Shirts and their campaign, I hope that they are not successful.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 1.57 p.m. to 2.00 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>QUESTIONS WITHOUT NOTICE</title><type>Questions Without Notice</type><page.no>7142</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Sport: Independent Review of Soccer</title><page.no>7142</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>7142</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for the Arts and Sport, Senator Kemp.

Let me turn to the substance of Senator Lundy's question. When I announced the inquiry into Soccer Australia, I am pleased to say that Senator Lundy was very quick off the mark in welcoming the inquiry—it is not often I give credit to Senator Lundy, but this time I do. Senator, because you have not asked me a question, I have not had a chance to thank you for that and I am very pleased to do that.

I am aware of the media reports today that obviously Senator Lundy is aware of. Senator Lundy, you will be pleased to note that I sought advice from the Sports Commission, and it advises that it has made its position very clear to Soccer Australia. The Sports Commission's expectation is that Soccer Australia will make its best endeavours to implement reasonable recommendations of the Crawford inquiry. My understanding from the advice that I have received is that this has been accepted by board members. I think that is very important.</para><para>I make the point that we are a government that consults. We are a consultative government and we listen to people. Because we consult, this inquiry is undertaking widespread consultations with all stakeholders and with the public, and we are very confident that the recommendations that will be produced will lay the foundation for the way forward for soccer. Soccer is arguably one of Australia's most popular sports. It is no secret that soccer has undergone very considerable difficulties in recent years. I put it to Senator Lundy that it is important that this soccer inquiry be supported. I am very encouraged by the widespread support that we have from stakeholders. If I do not get a chance in the supplementary question that Senator Lundy is about to ask me, perhaps if one of my own colleagues could ask me a question later in question time I may be able enlarge on that aspect. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7143</page.no><name role="metadata">Lundy, Sen Kate</name><name role="display">Senator LUNDY</name><name.id>7G6</name.id><electorate>Australian Capital Territory</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I ask a supplementary question.

It is in such stark contrast to the sorts of questions we have had from Labor during the past week. They seem to suffer from policy phobia. It is to be regretted that Labor do not have the same aversion to grubby personal attacks on family members of senators and members as they do to policy.</para></talk.start><para>Earlier this year the government introduced legislation that was designed to protect Australia's 1.2 million small businesses from illegal restrictions of trade imposed by trade unions, but it was defeated because Labor preferred to sacrifice small business on the altar of union expediency. But there is some good news for small business. The government will continue to champion the cause of small business by reintroducing the legislation. So Labor will have the opportunity to put the needs of the millions of people employed in small business ahead of the needs of their union masters. This legislation is important because Australia's small businesses cannot afford to defend themselves when they are the innocent victims of union led secondary boycotts. It is no good having the law if small businesses cannot get access to it. This is quite rightly of great concern to the Howard government, to Senator Tierney and especially to the small businesses of the Hunter region.</para><para>We want to give the ACCC the ability to defend small businesses against these unlawful activities by taking representative action for damages on their behalf. The fact is that the vast majority of small businesses simply cannot take on the trade union movement in a legal case. They do not have the money or the time and are afraid of what the unions will do in the future. If the unions act lawfully then they have absolutely nothing to worry about. But Labor have been directed by their union masters to oppose protection for small businesses because they are worried—and Labor senators have every reason to be worried as well. A boycott by the unions on preselection day would see each and every one of them disendorsed. That of itself would not be a bad thing, but Labor senators should not be bullied by the union thugs. By voting against the <inline ref="R1656">Trade Practices Amendment (Small Business Protection) Bill 2002 [No. 2]</inline> Labor will encourage the unions to bring back the turmoil of the old national stoppages—sympathy strikes they used to call them; coal workers striking in support of transport workers—which would only allow more strikes, industrial unrest and job losses. </para><para>This government is absolutely committed to Australian small businesses, their workers and their families. The only job Labor senators care about is their own and the only other thing they care about is their endorsement by the unions. Yes, 20 out of the 28 Labor senators are former union operatives. We as a government believe that jobs are more important than union power. The threat of unlawful secondary boycotts to Australian small business is real. It will not stop until Labor do what is in the nation's interest and not the unions' interests.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Business: Corporate Governance</title><page.no>7144</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:11:00</time.stamp><page.no>7144</page.no><name role="metadata">Conroy, Sen Stephen</name><name role="display">Senator CONROY</name><name.id>3L6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer.

I can advise the Senate that there have been no illegal entrants via people smugglers in the last 12 months, which is a great achievement in terms of the policy of the Howard government. I particularly wish to give credit to the Royal Australian Navy and the Customs Service through its Coastwatch organisation. This multitiered response has proven to be, at least at this time, 100 per cent successful. It is a great credit to the officials who have carried out this task in the field. I was given some figures that indicated that Customs Coastwatch, which of course operates 24 hours a day, 365 days of the year, expects to fly almost 22,000 hours of surveillance and patrol more than 350 million square kilometres of ocean this financial year.</para></talk.start><para>What the government has done is rely on Coastwatch, through not only its intelligence but its assets in terms of ship assets and aircraft, to patrol the waters surrounding Australia. Further out, Coastwatch is complemented by the assets of the Royal Australian Navy—in particular, the 15 patrol vessels of the Royal Australian Navy and long-range surveillance aircraft. This has provided, as I said, both the intelligence and the capability to address the issue. It has clearly proven to be an effective deterrent and the government and, I think, the people of Australia are obviously pleased that people smugglers, at least up to this time, have largely been effectively dealt with. </para><para>If the record in relation to this particular issue is one of 100 per cent success, how could that be improved upon? It was interesting that to that background Mr Crean, who has been pressed to come up with a policy, last week said that Labor has a policy which will be more effective than the government's in relation to border protection. More effective than 100 per cent successful? We thought: `This will be interesting. Finally, a policy from the new Crean opposition—something that is new, novel and interesting.' And what did he offer? He offered a rehash of the old Beazley policy. One of the few policies of the last election of Mr Beazley was for a coastguard. And so Mr Crean, pressed to come up with a policy in his term as Leader of the Opposition, gave us a rehash of the Beazley coastguard.</para><para>What was it? It proposed: spend another $600 million by creating a new tier of protection somewhere between the Customs Service and the Royal Australian Navy; buy for them three ships and three helicopters and set up a whole new administration in law enforcement. Imagine the training of a whole new level of enforcement in terms of helicopter operations off ships, marinising helicopters and buying the equipment! It was $600 million for three ships. What would three ships add to the 15 patrol vessels of the Royal Australian Navy? Absolutely nothing. It proposed three more ships, however, and a totally new administration. Spend $600 million and say that you have now got a policy that can achieve more than 100 per cent success! What a poor attempt—his first attempt at policy. If there were a spare $600 million, why wouldn't you buy three more ships for the Navy or three more ships for Customs? Surely Mr Crean can do better than this. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Ministerial Conduct: Senator Coonan</title><page.no>7145</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>7145</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I direct my question to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Prime Minister.

I acknowledge the importance of this question from Senator Sandy Macdonald, who has a keen interest in security matters. In the wake of September 11 last year, the Howard government have implemented important initiatives in relation to aviation security in this country. We have budgeted $128 million for increased counter-terrorism first response at major airports across Australia. Previously, this existed only at Melbourne and Sydney, and we are now extending that to airports such as Brisbane, Darwin, Cairns, the Gold Coast, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra, Hobart and Alice Springs. As well as that, I recently commissioned the final three explosive-detection dog teams, bringing to 18 the number of canine bomb detectors in Australia, as opposed to six prior to September 11. These detector dogs are essential in increasing aviation security at our airports. They have been bred and trained to detect no fewer than 19,000 explosive combinations. </para></talk.start><para>Senator Sandy Macdonald also mentioned the question of our air security officers. That program was implemented at the end of December last year. We have seen that grow to where we currently have in excess of 70 air security officers working in Australian skies, and we have seen them work on thousands of domestic flights. I want to acknowledge the cooperation that we have had from airports across Australia and, in particular, the assistance that Qantas and Virgin Blue have given to us. We envisage having this program in place early next year, and we will have 110 officers who will be operating on our air security officer program. We have always said that we would like to see this extended internationally, and we are taking steps to do just that. </para><para>It is important to remember that there are a number of countries which have these programs already in place. Recently, the United Kingdom mentioned that it too was going to look at a sky marshal program, albeit that previously it had rejected such a proposal. The government are developing a program with the United States, Singapore and Indonesia. We are pursuing bilateral agreements on this important issue as a matter of priority. To that end, I visited the United States recently and met with senior officials to progress these negotiations. I can also inform the Senate that I intend to progress in talks later this month the issue of negotiating a bilateral agreement for Australian ASOs on flights to and from Indonesia and Singapore.  </para><para>It is very important that we have an established air security officer program operating not only domestically but also internationally. We have developed a training program which is second to none, and we have had overseas interest in the program that we have developed. Our air security officers are flying on selected domestic flights, and they offer to the travelling public the assurance that we will have not only security but also safety in our skies. This is essential if we are to portray to the travelling public and those people coming to Australia that this is a safe place in which to travel. It also is a very important deterrent to any would-be hijacker or terrorist activity in relation to our skies. This is just part and parcel of enhanced air security in this country. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Family Payments</title><page.no>7153</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>7153</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to the Minister for Family and Community Services, Senator Vanstone.

Senator, you ask me for a calculation for between now and Christmas. I have not done a calculation from today's date versus a week ago or two weeks ago. In any event, the rate at which it happens is not what is at issue; it is the proportion that is at issue. So I do not really know why you put in a rate question. But, in any event, there will again be some people who will get overpayments in the second year of operation of a new tax system for families that put $2 billion more into the pockets of families and that aligned the family benefits with the tax system. Most people, including on your side of the chamber, understand how the tax system works—namely, that some people at the end of the year get a cheque and some get an assessment saying, `You've got to pay more.' This system works on the basis where you have an annual entitlement that at the end of the year families in the same circumstances would get the same amount of money. We think that is fair. Apparently, you have some other view, but we think that it is fair to say that at the end of the year families with the same income and the same number of children of the same age should get the same amount.</para></talk.start><para>Some people—most people, in fact—obviously prefer to take the money during the year, and we pay them on their estimates of income. Some people have underestimated their income to the extent that they have then had an overpayment. However, it is important to note—I had better not say `none' because there is always an exception somewhere, so let me put it another way—that everybody with an income of up to around $30,000 has paid the maximum rate. So for people on low incomes the question of whether they have got the assessment of their income right does not come into play. It is only people who have incomes over that amount who might have some concern. Then there is a second minimum rate level—another income area higher up the scale— where people are paid a flat rate, and then it starts to cut down.</para><para>I have to tell you, Senator, that one of the most depressing things I have to do in my office is to write letters back to people who have complained that they have had an overpayment on their family tax benefit when their family income was estimated to be, for example, around $80,000 or $90,000 and it went up to $110,000. I can tell you that the letters I send back are far more polite than I would actually prefer them to be. This is a very generous country. The maximum rate is paid to families who have incomes under $30,000. There are two taper zones. Within that, as people increase their income, they get less. It is true that at the end of year, if you have overestimated your income or we have not given you enough, you will get a top-up—unlike the situation under the previous government, which did not top up. Of course, if you have earned more than another family in the same circumstances, you will have had an overpayment and we will expect it to come back, presumably by way of a reduction in your entitlement next year. </para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7154</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr President, I thank the minister for her response and ask a supplementary question.

These protection deals are outrageous. Executives are using derivatives to lock in the value of shares and options granted to them as part of their remuneration package and so avoid any fall in the share price. Shareholders, unfortunately, are not able to avoid any fall in the share price—falls which can often be attributed to bad management. So executives are protecting their interests but putting at risk the investment of shareholders. That is what this latest scam is about: taking the risk out of it for some but leaving all of the risk in the hands of the poor mug shareholder who knows nothing about it. This is wrong and the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer should have been prepared to say so, but she did not. Now she goes scurrying out of the chamber and will not stay to debate the issue. She had the chance to say, `This is unethical, this is wrong, and I'll do something about it.' But no, she is running out of the chamber.</para><para>The minister's inaction and silence on this matter is condoning these protection deals. If the protection deals had not been exposed in the press, I am sure that the minister would have been happy to let these greedy executives keep doing exactly what they had been doing. It is totally inadequate that more action is not taken. ASIC have simply written a letter. They have stated that the practice of protection deals is undesirable—not illegal, just undesirable. It is clear then that this is a problem calling for a legislative response. ASIC have written to the ASX Corporate Governance Council. If we are lucky, that council may prescribe some voluntary guidelines. That is the form of Senator Ian Campbell, Senator Coonan and the Prime Minister in dealing with corporate greed: `Just a bit more self-regulation, boys; she'll be right. Greed is good.' That is the message from Senator Ian Campbell; that is this government's preferred response. But executives have shown, through the use of these protection deals, that they cannot be trusted. These deals have come up under self-regulation, under the `We'll look after ourselves, don't you worry about us' culture.</para><para>Australian investors need strong regulation. They need to know that their investments are safe, that management are acting in the best interests of the company. The minister and the Howard government, however, do not want to repose any restraints on the big end of town. We all know why it is— because Senator Ian Campbell, deep down, is nothing more than the spivvy real estate agent he has always been.

In particular, I wish to speak about the constant barrage of slurs and defamatory statements about Senator Coonan and about conflicts of interest that arise. In that context, I think it is very important that the Senate be aware of a classic example of misuse of parliamentary position for personal gain. This relates to Senator Faulkner's ongoing battle with Sydney Water. I referred this matter to ICAC because it did raise some matters of very serious concern to the public interest and I was advised as follows. If Senator Faulkner's property involved a sewer lead-out being constructed for a customer where the adjoining property was in different ownership, construction of the extension to the border of the property would be at Sydney Water's cost. However, the practice at that time was that Sydney Water sought payment from the customer.

My name is Senator John Faulkner, just in case you did not know, but I am ringing in a personal capacity. That, presumably, means that I shouldn't be regarded as trying to lean on you'? What then happened was Sydney Water, of course, accommodated him, and the answer I was given— after preliminary inquiries were made but not an investigation held—was that Senator Faulkner was treated in the same manner as any customer that complained vigorously.

Senator Faulkner managed to put himself in a position where he did not have to pay an amount asked of him because he jumped up and down—as they say, `complained vigorously'—to a number of people and he did so in a personal capacity. If that is not a classic example of a conflict of interest where a member of parliament is using his position to avoid a payment of a sum of money—a privilege that is not accorded to ordinary citizens, who get an account rendered and pay up without realising that they can carry on a treat and avoid paying—then I do not know what is. If the Labor Party are serious about these sorts of issues, they ought to ask Senator Faulkner to take a good hard look at himself and to explain on what possible basis he can make vigorous representations which one of the officers actually noted on the file as `As a matter of urgency, i.e. political influence, work has been started today'.

For a whole week Senator Faulkner, as the Leader of the Opposition in this place, and his fellows behind him have been using question time to trawl the gutter to try to raise allegations against Senator Coonan. But, as soon as the blowtorch is slightly turned towards Senator Faulkner—and he is now racing out of the chamber—he cannot take it, like a glass jaw. </para></talk.start><para>In his contribution, Senator Faulkner said that if there were anything of concern with his sewage pipe he would invite people to look at the documents before they make allegations. Isn't that in stark contrast to what Senator Faulkner and his troops did to Senator Coonan when they falsely alleged in this place in question time that Senator Coonan had made a fraudulent enrolment? They had not seen the document but they made the assertion. Indeed, Senator Faulkner's deputy, Senator Conroy, made that assertion publicly. The form and the document have now been presented. Senator Coonan's signature is not on it. Have we received an apology from either the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition? No—because there is no grace when it comes to the Leader of the Opposition or the Deputy Leader of the Opposition in this place. They will trawl the gutter and if they end up in a dry gully, in a dead end, what do they do? They just drop it and move to another smear. They do not even have the decency to apologise and say that they have used parliamentary privilege—indeed, abused parliamentary privilege—in an inappropriate way. </para><para>The Australian Labor Party, during these past few days, have been fumbling around like a Dad's Army trying to get some questions to make some mud stick on Senator Coonan. Those of us on this side who have the privilege to know Senator Coonan will vouch for her integrity each and every day. I know that Senator Coonan, for example, would not sit in a ministry that allowed the $36 million Centenary House rort which benefits the Australian Labor Party. And when I say it is a $36 million rort, that is $36 million above and beyond the market value of the property. Just in case people cannot remember, in the dying days of the Keating Labor government, the government entered into a contract with Centenary House—a Labor Party operation—to force the Auditor-General in there with a 15-year lease at exorbitant rates, which was completely and utterly uncommercial. At the end of the 15-year lease period, the Australian Labor Party, above and beyond what would be a fair and normal market rate, will have scooped $36 million into Labor Party coffers.</para><para>We know that sort of history; we know it as fact—and Labor have not denied it—yet we on this side have to listen to the galling exposition from the Deputy Leader of the Opposition asserting that somehow we on this side say that greed is good and that we look after ourselves. `Action speaks so much louder than words,' I would say to Senator Conroy and his party. Their actions with Centenary House—for which they have never apologised and for which they have never sought to remediate—show that they are greedy, that they are unprincipled and that they look after themselves.</para><para>It is most unfortunate that the opposition in this nation have no policy to put before the Australian people and therefore think they can avoid criticism by the media for that by trawling the gutter and trying to raise allegations against the minister—none of which have stuck.

In so doing, I simply make a couple of points about the scurrilous and low attempt at a defence of Senator Coonan by both Senator Alston and Senator Abetz. Senator Faulkner has quite clearly shot to pieces the claims made by both Senator Alston and Senator Abetz in his response to them; but he went further than that. Senator Faulkner has said in this chamber that he is prepared to make available all his documentation with respect to his case to anyone who wants to have a look at it to prove that he is beyond reproach on this issue.</para></talk.start><para>Had Senator Coonan made the same offer, the issue of her matters would not have lasted for two days in this chamber; but she did not. Never at any stage did Senator Coonan make the same offer to this chamber as Senator Faulkner did in relation to his matter. Senator Coonan herself has contributed substantially to the mystery surrounding the issues that have quite properly been raised here in question time in relation to her ministerial responsibility. I do not think we need to go any further with the matter than that—to put clearly on the table what Senator Faulkner has offered in his defence and the lack of any offer from the other side concerning the issues raised with Senator Coonan.</para><para>I raise the issue of the answer given by Senator Coonan on the question of corporate governance. Since this government came to power in 1996, we in this chamber have seen legislation consistently brought in aimed at trying to curtail, run over the top of or restrict the operations of the trade union movement—to reduce the capacity of the trade union movement to represent the interests of workers in wages and working conditions. But have we seen the same urgency displayed on corporate governance issues? Of course not. Have we seen this government show any concern about the rip-off that has been occurring at the big end of town with executive salaries? Of course not. </para><para>In fact, it is interesting to note the contrast. When those issues get raised, senators on the other side of the chamber immediately jump up to defend the big end of town. We have seen some shocking examples of exorbitant executive salaries being paid in this country in the past few years.

It is important to the Democrats to ensure that better scrutiny is undertaken of those involved in forcing such a huge number of people onto that vessel. It was confirmed by the minister, as was indicated to the Senate committee earlier this year, that the Australian Federal Police were investigating potential charges against people involved in organising that. In the evidence given by those people who were on the boat and survived, which is a small number of people, there is a very common story not only of being misled about the vessel but of being forced onto the vessel at gunpoint and being prevented from getting off. There is also all of the talk about Indonesian officials being in the vicinity or onshore at the time of the boat being loaded up with the many hundreds of people who were soon to meet their fate. </para><para>It does seem particularly important to the Democrats, given some of the other allegations that have been made about the SIEVX, that we ensure those who were responsible are brought to justice. Given the large number of people who died and Australia's link with the vessel, and particularly given the expected location of where the vessel sank— which was in international waters—then it is appropriate that Australian authorities be involved in investigating the matter. The Australian Federal Police have admitted a number of times that they are involved in, or are aware of, so-called `disruption activities' in Indonesia in relation to people who are contemplating getting on a vessel with the intent of coming to Australia. Given Australia's long-standing involvement in those activities, I think it is particularly important that as much as possible is done to ensure that all information is made available about who was involved, and in what way, in the SIEVX in particular.</para><para>The person who has been identified as being significantly involved, indeed as the organiser of the boat that sank, Mr Abu Qussey, who was identified on Australian television some time back as a key organiser of that vessel, has been in jail in Indonesia for a short period on various offences but will be out of jail by the end of this year. Given the minister's statement that Mr Qussey is a person of interest, it is particularly important from the Democrats point of view that whatever interest there is from the Federal Police be exercised fully before Abu Qussey gets out of jail at the end of the year and is able to disappear back into the community—or indeed to leave Indonesia altogether, given that, as I understand it, he is not a national of Indonesia and possibly not even an authorised resident. He would obviously be a crucial person to be able to question further and for more information to be made public about all that was involved—how many people were involved, in what way and how—in the lead-up to the SIEVX tragedy.</para><para>Three hundred and fifty three people is a lot of people. From the Democrats point of view, this is a major tragedy that has not been adequately recognised. As is completely appropriate, in relation to the hundreds of people who died in the Bali bombings Australian authorities, including the Federal Police, have been working very hard and diligently in trying to ensure that those involved and those responsible are being brought to justice. From all reports, the cooperation between Australian authorities and the Indonesian authorities has been progressing relatively well in a short period. The SIEVX tragedy is now well over a year old, and there certainly does not appear to have been the same degree of urgency or the same degree of intensive investigation in a cooperative way between Australian and Indonesian officials. There is a real risk that a key person involved in that tragedy, which resulted in the deaths of so many people, may be able to walk free in a short period and that the information he holds may not be able to be confirmed or examined. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>COMMITTEES</title><type>Committees</type><page.no>7162</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Scrutiny of Bills Committee</title><page.no>7162</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>7162</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:42:00</time.stamp><page.no>7162</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of Senator McLucas, I present the 15th report of 2002 of the Senate Standing Committee for the Scrutiny of Bills.

Those comments related to the delegation of legislative power and the incorporation of material as in force from time to time. The Committee wrote to the Minister about these comments.</para><para>The Minister has now replied to the Committee's letter in time for it to finalise its consideration of this bill and to report on it today. The Committee is most grateful for the Minister's prompt response, which was of considerable assistance in its non-partisan scrutiny.</para><para>It is at this point that I should briefly describe the Committee's response when scrutinising provisions of bills which appear to delegate legislative power. The first step is to determine that the power in question is actually legislative and not administrative. For instance, in the same Research Involving Embryos Bill the Committee looked at some provisions for guidelines which it concluded were administrative. In such cases, the Committee under its terms of reference scrutinises the administrative provisions to ensure that the power is suitably defined and limited.</para><para>Assuming that the powers are in fact legislative, the next step is to ascertain whether it is appropriate to delegate the powers, or whether the powers are so significant that the bill itself should provide for their exercise. In relation to the Research Involving Embryos Bill the Committee made no comment under this head of its terms of reference.</para><para>The final step is then to determine whether the delegated legislative power is subject to adequate parliamentary scrutiny, which in most cases will mean that it will be subject to disallowance. It is in this context that the Committee scrutinises provisions which provide for the incorporation of extraneous material as in force from time to time. It is one thing for a bill to incorporate, say, a single discrete set of guidelines with legislative effect. It is quite another to provide that those guidelines may be amended with continuing legislative consequences. In this situation there may be a compelling case for full parliamentary control of each exercise of the power. The Acts Interpretation Act recognises this in the case of regulations, providing that they may incorporate existing extraneous material but not such material as existing from time to time. This provision may, however, be negatived by an express provision in primary legislation and I will come back to this later.</para><para>Applying these principles to the Research Involving Embryos Bill, the Committee identified two provisions for the delegation of legislative power. In both these cases, power was given to issue guidelines and codes of practice which, being legislative, it appeared should be subject to parliamentary scrutiny by possible disallowance. In both cases there was the additional consideration that the power included not only the initial legislative guidelines or codes, but also amendments as made and in force from time to time.</para><para>Clause 8 of the bill provides for the issue of guidelines with legislative effect, defining “proper consent” firstly by the Ethical Guidelines on Assisted Reproductive Technology issued by the NHMRC in 1996. That provision alone would have been acceptable, because those guidelines were identifiable and not subject to alteration. However, paragraph (b) then provides for the NHMRC to specify further guidelines, apparently from time to time, which will have continuing legislative effect but which will not be subject to parliamentary disallowance.</para><para>Clause 11 creates an offence of using an embryo which is not an excess ART embryo. Breach of this provision carries a penalty of up to five years' imprisonment, so it is clearly a serious matter. The Committee's comments on clause 11 relate to the definition of ART program, which is an integral part of the offence. Subclause 11(2) defines ART program as one which is carried out under a Code of Practice issued by the Reproductive Technology Accreditation Committee of the Fertility Society of Australia, as in force from time to time. Alternatively, the subclause provides that an ART program is one carried out under any other code or document prescribed by the regulations, as that code or document is in force from time to time.</para><para>Clause 11 therefore effectively delegates legislative power initially to the RTA Committee, who are given authority to issue variations of the Code of Practice from time to time, each of which will, as noted above, form the basis of an offence punishable by a substantial term of imprisonment. It appears that none of these subsequent Codes of Practice will be subject to parliamentary scrutiny. The alternative power in clause 11 is for the regulations to prescribe any other code or document at all, produced by any person at all, and which will be in force as different versions are made from time to time. In this case the regulations are subject to disallowance, but the object of the provision is to subdelegate continuing legislative power which will not be scrutinised and controlled by Parliament. </para><para>The Minister's response to the Committee's comments on clause 8 advised that another Act required all NHMRC guidelines to be tabled within 15 sitting days of being made. The Committee report, however, concludes that while this is a substantial safeguard, it does not provide the same level of parliamentary control as possible disallowance.</para><para>The Minister also gave reasons why the guidelines should not be subject to disallowance. Firstly, the Minister advised that only a small part of the relevant guidelines would address matters related to the bill, to which the Committee replied that it would be possible to disallow only that part. Next, the Minister suggested that disallowance may affect the independence of the NHMRC, but the Committee did not agree that full parliamentary scrutiny of a continuing legislative power would do this. Lastly, the Minister advised that it would be unusual for guidelines made for the purposes of one Act to be disallowable for the purposes of another. The Committee noted, however, that something may be unusual but nevertheless be appropriate.</para><para>The Minister's response to the Committee's comments on subclause 11(2) provided helpful background information on the provision. The response, however, also advised that the Code of Practice itself cannot be made disallowable because it is made by a non-government body. The Committee makes no comment on this, but notes that the same result could be effected by the current formula in subclause 11(2), under which the regulations prescribe the code or other document, although not as in force from time to time. The regulations are then subject to full scrutiny. The Committee's report on the subclause concludes that as presently drafted the constituents of an offence provision punishable by up to 5 years' imprisonment may be determined by non-government bodies without parliamentary oversight or even knowledge.</para><para>The other main bill in the report is the Trade Practices Amendment (Liability for Recreational Services) Bill 2002, which concludes a scrutiny during which the Committee wrote twice to the Minister for advice. The Committee has now finished its consideration of this bill, which provides for corporations to exclude liability for death or injury in relation to the supply of recreational services. The Committee accepts that there are problems in this area which need to be addressed, but the question is to what extent these should affect the personal rights of those who use such services. The Minister's advice and the Committee's comments on it in the report present what I believe is a good survey of these difficult issues.</para><para>Finally, I would like to remind honourable Senators of the usual end of year breakfast sausage sizzle at which Senators and Ministers get together with Committee members in an informal way to celebrate another year of legislative scrutiny by the Committee and the Senate. It is, I believe, a measure of the non-partisan nature of the Committee and its work that we can hold such an event year after year. It illustrates that the Committee is interested only in personal rights and parliamentary propriety. On behalf of the Committee I would like to see as many of you as possible at the function, to which you have all received invitations.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Legal and Constitutional References Committee</title><page.no>7164</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>7164</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator HARRIS (Queensland) (3.43 p.m.)—by leave—I move:</para><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report tabled on 3 December 2002.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to continue my remarks later.</para><para>Leave granted;

That amendment requires a new clause to be added, and it is listed in the documents that you have before you on page 2751. I believe the amendment would improve accountability and transparency and, of course, it is consistent with paragraph 6.4 of the COAG communique about the need for the system to provide for public reporting of research involving embryos so as to improve transparency and accountability to the public. If we are going to have accountability to the public, I believe that the public is entitled to know and to be able to have a say, even if only by way of submission to the NHMRC Licensing Committee, about the suitability or otherwise of the application for a licence to access excess—and I hate that word but I am using the technical term—ART embryos.</para></talk.start><para>The minister has come back and talked— and it is really a non sequitur—about the history of the assisted reproductive technology of IVF.

I am proposing this amendment so as to allow 10 working days from the day that the application is placed on the Internet for the receipt of public submissions in relation to the application for a licence. I think that is consistent with COAG and transparency. Through you, Madam Temporary Chair, I am putting that suggestion to the Manager of Government Business: why not allow a period—and I have suggested 10 working days—for the public to make submissions to the NHMRC Licensing Committee about the propriety or otherwise of the proposal?</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:06:00</time.stamp><page.no>7172</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Manager of Government Business in the Senate</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have been handed the notes in relation to this, and apparently when we adjourned prior to question time today the minister was about halfway through reading that.

I apologise for reading the notes; I know that it is not particularly good Senate practice and that it is pretty boring but I will give it a go. </para></talk.start><para>When COAG made their decision that an additional layer of oversight should be provided on a national level by the NHMRC Licensing Committee, they recognised the changing environment, including that brought on by the potential benefits, that may be gained through the derivation and use of stem cells. COAG did not say, `The existing system is fundamentally flawed,' or `Not only must HREC and the NHMRC Licensing Committee consider all applications, but so must all members of the public.' Nor did they say, `All applications and all assessments must be made publicly available.'</para><para>However, recognising both the desirability and importance of public accountability and the frustrations that many people have felt about the absence of information about approv-ed uses of embryos in Australia, the bill in-cludes a requirement for the establishment of a publicly available database of information about licences. The database will include the following information: firstly, the name of the person to whom the licence was issued; secondly, a short statement about the nature of the uses of excess ART embryos that are authorised by the licence; thirdly, any conditions to which the licence is subject; fourthly, the number of excess ART embryos in respect of which use is authorised by the licence; fifthly, the date on which the licence was issued; and, finally, the period throughout which the licence is to remain in force.</para><para>The extent of the information that will be provided is significant. Not only is it the first time that such information will be available in Australia—I might note, after approximately 30 years of ART clinical practice— but the level of information provided to the public is, to my knowledge, unparalleled anywhere in the world. For example, in the United Kingdom the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Act 1990 does not require the release of any detailed information to the public, nor the maintenance of a publicly available database of the type that we are proposing. The only information that the HFEA—that is, the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority—publish is in their annual report, which includes a one- to five-line summary of the types of research approved. It includes no detail of licence conditions or licence periods. The system proposed for Australia already provides significant disclosure and opportunity for public scrutiny.

I gave an explanation which was incorrect, and the minister pointed that out to me. I would now like to correct the record and state that the claims that human embryonic stem cells could be used in the cloning process have a scientific basis. Firstly, like any other cells in the human body, embryonic stem cells may be fused with an egg, in the `Dolly' process known scientifically as somatic cell nuclear transfer. Secondly, there are reports of mouse experiments in which a mouse was wholly derived from embryonic stem cells.</para><para>See, for instance, Andras Nagy et al, `Derivation of completely cell culture-derived mice from early-passage embryonic stem cells' in <inline font-style="italic">Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America</inline>, volume 90<inline font-weight="bold">,</inline> pages 8424 to 8428, September 1993; and Janet Rossant et al, `Report to the Serono Symposium on Preimplantation Embryo Development', published by Springer, New York, pages 157, 165, edited by B. Bavister, 1991. A similar event is reported by James A. Thomson in relation to embryonic stem cells from marmoset monkeys. See James A. Thomson et al, `Pluripotent cell lines derived from common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus) blastocysts,' <inline font-style="italic">Biology of Reproduction</inline>, Volume 55, pages 254 to 259, 1996.</para><para>These reports on animal experiments indicate that it would be possible to derive a human embryo wholly from embryonic stem cells. This possibility was noted by the Australian Health Ethics Committee of the National Health and Medical Research Council in its December 1998 report to the Commonwealth health minister on human cloning, at section N220, referring to uncertainty about the potential of individual ES cell lines and quoting the article by J.A. Thomson et al entitled `Primary embryonic stem cells':</para><quote><para>It is not known whether human ES cells could form a complete viable embryo by any method, but this possibility has raised the greatest concern about the derivation of human ES cells.</para></quote><para>In the same paragraph that they refer to the Thomson article, AHEC also cite the article by Andras Nagy et al in which there is a description of the production of a completely ES cell-derived mouse. AHEC describes these tetraploid embryos as being incapable of progressing through to development themselves, but as being able to provide an environment in which ES cells could do so. Given that embryonic stem cells have produced embryos in mice and marmoset monkeys, there would appear to be a good chance that human ES cells could, if suitably manipulated, develop into embryos. The history of research in this field would certainly imply that extensive studies of a variety of approaches would be required before one could dismiss this possibility with any confidence whatsoever. </para><para>I mention that because during the debate I was assured by many scientists that it was possible to actually use a stem cell to clone. Unfortunately I gave the minister the wrong reference, which she pointed out to me. That is not the only reason that I am moving this amendment. The amendment is to prevent us from trading in embryonic stem cells or human embryos or any derivatives from those. The reason I put it forward is that in Australia we have certain standards according to which we treat embryos, stem cells and human tissue. We have an AHEC, which is the ethical standards association, and we have a number of NHMRC guidelines. It is illegal to trade in human tissue. I think that would be a position that most Australians would agree with. But it is no good for us, as senators, to say that we will set up strict guidelines and strict regimes for human tissue in Australia if, when these embryos or embryonic stem cells are moved from Australia, we then have no control over them at all.</para><para>I pointed out in my last speech that, if we sell guns or some types of radioactive material, we always sell them overseas with a rider that says that you cannot on-sell these products and you can only use them in certain ways—you cannot develop an atom bomb; you can use this particular uranium in a certain way. It is called an end-user certificate. But we do not have any such thing in Australia for this case. At the Senate committee that investigated the evidence on this, I asked on a number of occasions what happened to embryonic stem cells that went out of Australia. At the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee on 29 August, Ms Matthews said:</para><quote><para>The results of the research would be able to be sent overseas. If you are talking about the embryonic stem cell lines and whether they could be sent overseas, yes, the embryonic stem cells could be sent overseas.</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>If stem cell lines are subsequently sent to Singapore, the use of those stem cell lines is permitted in accordance with Singaporean law.</para></quote><para>Dr Morris said:</para><quote><para>The licence would only apply to the work undertaken in Australia. If something is exported to another country, the laws of that country would apply.</para></quote><para>Ms Matthews said:</para><quote><para>Leaving aside the customs regulations, under this bill there is no prohibition on the export of the products of embryos, such as embryonic stem cell lines and other products.</para></quote><para>The NHMRC provided additional responses to the Senate committee. The response to questions raised indicated that the bill does not directly regulate the exportation of an excess ART embryo and the exportation of human embryonic stem cell lines. It said:</para><quote><para>It should be noted that COAG did not address the matter of exportation of human embryos from Australia. It is proposed that the NHMRC, in consultation with the Department of Health and Ageing, Customs and other relevant agencies, develop further advice ...</para></quote><para>It clearly states there that there is no provision to regulate the use of our Aussie embryos and embryonic stem cells that are sent overseas.</para><para>On the cloning bill last week or the week before or whenever it was—time get confused—we all voted down cloning in Australia. It was a unanimous vote of both houses of parliament. Yet here we have today, a week or so later, that we can actually send stem cells over to Singapore. BresaGen and ES Cell have said that they will operate a company in Singapore. They will open an office in Singapore to develop embryonic stem cell lines. I pulled off the net this morning a news report from the ALS news entitled `Singapore backs embryo cloning'. It says: </para><quote><para>The Singapore government will allow the cloning of human embryos for certain research projects giving the island state some of the world's most liberal guidelines for stem cell research.</para><para>Singapore hopes the guidelines will allow local firms to take a leading role in stem cell research that could lead to both profits and cures for disease.</para></quote><para>I have established that animals have been cloned from stem cells—both monkeys and mice. I now establish that the Singapore government does allow cloning. It is well established that ES Cell and BresaGen are opening an office in Singapore.</para><para>I want to say that it is no good us passing a bill that says that we prevent cloning in Australia, which was carried unanimously by both houses of parliament, and then turn our backs and say that we can send embryonic stem cells and other stem cell products to Singapore—or to anywhere in the world, for that matter—and from then on, once they are out of the hands of the Australian law that we set up on trading in human tissue, it is a freewheeling, laissez-faire situation out there, where you can expect anything from any country that does not have our high ethical standards. I said in my previous speech that we cannot say that we have done the right thing, that we can sleep easily in our beds tonight and that we have put down guidelines and legislation that will prevent cloning and then turn our backs when embryonic stem cells go out of Australia.</para><para>I am very concerned about this. I think there are two very important issues in this bill. One is the testing of drugs and the other is the export of embryos and embryo stem cells. I just cannot think how we can say with any justice, any conscience or any degree of morals or ethics, `Let's look after our Aussie embryos in Australia; but, when they go overseas, it is up for grabs.' I do not think that anyone believes that. I do think the punters out there—the voters—believe that. I think they would say that, if it is good enough to put in very strict regimes in Australia for Australian grown stem cells, then surely the same rules and the same regulations must apply when those stem cells go overseas.</para><para>Unfortunately, I must have asked about this half a dozen or a dozen times, and no doubt Senator Harradine will back me up on this; and we were told constantly and honestly—and I thank them for that; there was no obfuscation—that, once they are out of Australia, anything goes. The only way I can see that you can stop this is to support the amendment that I am putting up, which says that you cannot trade in human embryos overseas. Otherwise we are really hypocritical. We would be hypocrites to pass legislation in Australia but walk away from it when the embryos go overseas.</para><para>I would like the people who are listening in to this debate and watching it on the screens in their offices to give this very careful consideration—not just to come down here and say, `I voted on this side and I'm going to continue to do so; I'm going to lock in to that.' I am asking them to think about this, to think about what will happen and whether they believe that the people who elected us would want that to happen. I know there are a great many people in Australia who find this repugnant. There would be a great many people in the conservative churches, or any churches, who find this repugnant. Not only the people who have a religious commitment but all people would find repugnant our walking away and washing our hands of embryonic stem cells so that Singaporean companies and governments can make a profit. I must admit that they were honest: they want to make a profit. That is a great motivation; I am a person who likes to think in terms of making a profit, but not at the expense of ditching every ethic that we have. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:31:00</time.stamp><page.no>7176</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be very brief, because it is almost five o'clock.

As was explained by the minister previously, they must get the approval of the donors if stem cells are to be derived. The fact of the matter is that the donors do not have any control over where the stem cells go. They have control over the embryo but once they give consent to the dissection of the embryo for the purpose of extracting embryonic stem cells they have no way of having control over them. Under those circumstances, the extraction may take place and those embryonic stem cells may be sent overseas.  </para></talk.start></continue><para>The other night, the issue was whether or not a human embryo could be derived from that embryonic stem cell. If it is the case that an embryo can be derived from the treatment of an embryonic stem cell, that is using that embryonic stem cell to create a clone of the donor couple who gave the approval. In the debate the other night, the minister was asked whether or not that was possible. I am asking a question, but before the response I want to let you know this: the National Health and Medical Research Council, in paragraph 2.20 of the <inline font-style="italic">Scientific, ethical and regulatory considerations relevant to cloning of human embryos </inline>report, which was sent to Dr Michael Wooldridge on 16 December 1998, says, `Yes, there are examples where embryonic stem cells have been placed on a bed of tetraploid embryos.

That was stated in paragraph 2.20 of the NHMRC document. I am very surprised that the other night the minister was told something contrary to this, presumably by the NHMRC, when in their own document they have said that this is a possibility. It has not occurred with humans to the present moment, but what happens to a stem cell donated by a couple here if it is able to be developed in a country that does not have the ban on cloning that we have? You could have a clone of the donor couple. The question is: should that be allowed? Clearly, in my view, we should not allow that. As Senator Boswell says, it really undermines the purpose of the bill that was adopted unanimously—that is, the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>, which bans the cloning of human embryos.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:35:00</time.stamp><page.no>7177</page.no><name role="metadata">Campbell, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN CAMPBELL</name><name.id>H15</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Parliamentary Secretary to the Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—There are a number of things I would like to respond to in the remarks made by Senator Boswell and Senator Harradine. Senator Boswell pleaded to our colleagues, who are glued to their monitors following this debate—I do not mean to sound sarcastic—to listen to the arguments. I think it is fair to say that most senators have probably concentrated more on this debate than any other debate in recent times. Certainly, because of my role as Manager of Government Business in the Senate, I have had to speak more than just about anyone else in this place to the supporters of the bill and those who are opposed to this bill. I think that there is a very deep understanding of many of the issues that are being discussed. That clearly means that the outcome will be representative of the views of the Senate as a whole, ultimately. I join with Senator Boswell in his plea—not to the extent of suggesting that people are not concentrating on the debate but to pay tribute to the level of interest that there has been in the debate.</para></talk.start><para>I know, from coming in here for divisions, that senators do not always know exactly the amendment that we are dealing with at the time, but overall they have been following this debate very closely. I do not think it is fair to pretend or to even assert that all senators are not following it or taking an interest in it. I think we are all taking it very seriously. Some senators, such as Senator Harradine, Senator Boswell and others, are living it and breathing it, amendment by amendment. Not everyone is as interested. I think we should be all proud as senators that the debate has been well informed and that most people are paying attention to those areas that are of particular concern to them. I know that Senator Patterson, for example, is approached regularly by colleagues saying, `What is the amendment? Do you have details?' Everyone is trying quite hard to make informed decisions, and I think that generally the debate in this place has been of a significantly better quality, as in most cases, than the debate in the other place. </para><para>I turn to Senator Boswell's and Senator Harradine's particular remarks—and I have been provided with these notes by the ministers and officers. Senator Boswell did cite a paper by James A. Thomson and others, a co-author of which was John Hearn, who gave evidence before the Senate Community Affairs Legislation Committee. The paper was one of the original papers describing the isolation and culture of embryonic stem cells. The paper did not show that embryonic stem cells could form embryos. Rather, when cultured at a high density, these cells formed embryoid bodies. These are collections of cells of different lineages but they have no ability for organisation, as occurs in an embryo. The ability to form embryoid bodies was evidence that the stem cells were pluripotent. John Hearn, who is from the Australian National University, has advised that human embryonic stem cells do not have the capacity to form advanced embryoid bodies, as described in the paper for marmoset stem cells.</para><para>Senator Boswell has indicated that the reason he moved this amendment—which was, as Senator Boswell would agree, defeated in a slightly different form earlier— was the concerns that embryonic stem cells could be used to create human embryos or could be used in cloning experiments overseas. They are obviously very legitimate and sound concerns. In relation to this, yesterday Senator Boswell provided the minister with citations from three peer review journals which he says support his claim that a mouse has been wholly derived from embryonic stem cells. The minister has obtained expert advice on these articles and can assure the chamber that this is not the case. </para><para>The articles cited by Senator Boswell relate to work that was undertaken about a decade ago. That work was undertaken prior to the discovery of the technique known as somatic cell nuclear transfer, or SNCT, which was used to develop and create Dolly the sheep. The work reported in these journals shows that, when the mouse stem cells were mixed with certain other mouse cell types in culture and the combination of cells was placed in a mouse uterus, it was possible to achieve a viable mouse embryo. The technique reported was cumbersome and had a very low success rate in mice. As a technique for the cloning of animals, this research was overtaken by the development of SCNT, which has been used successfully, albeit with a low success rate and significant health problems, in resultant cloned animals in a range of mammals, from mice to cows.</para><para>However, in relation to the concerns raised by both Senator Boswell and Senator Harradine regarding the possibility that human embryonic stem cells could be used in the cloning of human embryos, this is theoretically possible. The technique of SCNT, whereby the nucleus from any cell of the body excluding sperm and eggs—for example, skin, liver, muscle, brain and theoretically any stem cell, be it embryonic or adult—is transferred into an egg which has had its nucleus removed, could theoretically be used to clone a human embryo. However, in this respect a human embryonic stem cell has no advantage over any other human cell that has a full human genome. Any human cell can be used in the SCNT procedure, along with a healthy human egg.</para><para>Under the <inline ref="R1624">Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill 2002</inline>, this technique, or in fact any other technique that may be developed to clone human embryos, is banned with strong penalties. The export and import of prohibited human embryos is also banned and, as announced during debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill, the government is banning the export of all human embryos and the import of viable products of human embryo clones through changes to the customs regulation. In relation to Senator Boswell's concerns that human embryonic stem cells will be taken overseas and used in the cloning of human embryos, I hope I have explained that human embryonic stem cells are not unique in this regard. Senator Boswell wants to prohibit international trade in embryonic stem cells, and I can see that this concept will get some support. However, this bill is not the appropriate forum in which to address such concerns.</para><para>I say in parenthesis that Senator Harradine, in the introduction to his remarks, said that this bill allows this to occur. It is not actually this bill that allows it to occur; that is not quite specifically accurate. I think Senator Harradine and Senator Boswell would agree with me that they would like this bill to not allow it to occur. This bill does not particularly change the situation, and we are saying that this is not the bill to address those concerns. I think it is also fair to say that the government, during the debate on the cloning bill, did in fact give an undertaking to ban the trade in materials from related human cloning and to review it in 12 months. So I think it is fair to say that the government have shown their bona fides in relation to this issue and the concerns about the trade in human embryonic stem cells that Senator Boswell and Senator Harradine have raised. </para><para>This amendment is outside the scope of the <inline ref="R1625">Research Involving Embryos Bill 2002</inline>. Of the two bills considered, it would have been more appropriate for such an amendment to be moved to the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill. In fact, such an amendment was discussed but not supported. I mentioned during the debate on the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill that the Prime Minister has undertaken to amend the Customs (Prohibited Exports) Regulations 1958 to provide for a 12-month prohibition on exporting human embryos, during which time the government will determine the most appropriate way of regulating such exports. I have also stated the government's intention to amend the customs regulations to implement a ban on the import of viable materials derived from human embryo clones, and again this bill will be reviewed after 12 months.</para><para>With regard to Senator Boswell's revised amendment, considerable work is required to understand the ramifications of such a proposal and to work out the details, if it is considered desirable. Some of the details to be considered would include, firstly, whether the proposed ban would be extended from embryonic stem cells to other human tissues, given that any human tissue could be utilised in cloning techniques. I understand that such an arrangement, for example, may prevent the transfer of human tissues required for transplant. Secondly, would the proposed ban only cover trade where money is exchanged? What about where cells are given freely to colleagues in other countries? Such an arrangement would set a dangerous precedent, as the international scientific community relies on collaborative research programs that depend on international sharing of resources in order to extend global research efforts.</para><para>If these proposals were to gain support it could result in the Australian research and medical communities being isolated from international counterparts. Such a result would have disastrous effects on Australian research efforts and, therefore, on the future health and wellbeing of Australians. It is also fair to say it would have a disastrous effect on the development of world-wide leading edge research. Therefore, it would have an effect on the attraction of scientists and medical researchers to develop their careers in Australia or in fact to enter into those careers in the first place. I am sorry for delaying the Senate for so long, but I think Senator Boswell and Senator Harradine in particular would appreciate the detail we have gone into in responding to their concerns and also the sympathetic nature with which the government has viewed similar concerns in relation to its consideration of these trade issues with regard to the Prohibition of Human Cloning Bill. For these reasons, we will not be supporting this amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>7179</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I certainly thank Senator Campbell for his contribution. He raised some good points, including the notion of free trade—that is, the free exchange of materials—which I suspect he might get questioned on in a moment. I think that is an interesting point to put on the record. In relation to Senator Boswell's comments—and I think once again there has been reference to examples that were raised in the previous debate on a similar amendment—I want to put on the record the proposition that embryonic stem cells are in fact totipotent. I will use the definition in the House of Representatives human cloning report. It states that totipotent `describes a cell or structure that can produce all cell types including placentas'. That means one that is capable of giving rise to an organism. That notion is not proven and that was the point I made in my contribution to the debate on Senator Boswell's previous amendment. </para></talk.start><para>The evidence that we have to date suggests overwhelmingly that that is not the case. As I alluded to when speaking about the previous version of this amendment, I acknowledge that there is a case of mice embryonic stem cells giving rise to an embryo, and I described some of the circumstances involved in that at the time. It is very important to remember that in this experiment, as I pointed out last time, the ES cells were on a bed of embryos. It is important to note that we do not know exactly what it was that gave rise to the embryo, whether it was the embryos or whether it was the ES cells. I think it is important to note that, in the evidence to the committee, Dr Tonti-Filippini qualified very carefully any claims that this experiment proves that ES cells are totipotent.</para><para>The point that I want to emphasise is that the whole proposition is highly speculative and I suppose we acknowledge that, by virtue of it being an innovative field, science is speculative. Presumably we want to guard against things that we perceive as dangerous, and we want to regulate for things that may or may not happen. But I think this is a very difficult and inappropriate area at the moment. I think that, if there is evidence that ES cells are totipotent, we should come back and amend the legislation. But I do not think this highly speculative proposition and discussion should result in the amendments before us. I do not mean to have `Groundhog Day' on this matter. I understand that there was some allusion to the comments that were previously made and the examples that were put on record, but I advise the chamber that the Democrats will not be supporting the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:51:00</time.stamp><page.no>7180</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank Senator Ian Campbell. He conceded that it was possible to clone if you put any sort of isolated nucleus from an embryonic stem cell or any stem cell into an egg. I think that is what he said. This is a well-thought out amendment. I have said `trade' and trade means commerce, and it means trading. It does not mean exchanges in science; it means getting a commission, a remuneration or a consideration for what you have done. This is why I changed it. It means that someone must make money. Someone must get a commission or a remuneration out of it. I very clearly said it is only human embryos, human embryonic stem cells or any product derived from human embryos. It is nothing to do with blood or any other human tissue that may have to be exchanged. That should put down the fears of Senator Ian Campbell. AHEC, which is the ethical committee of the NHMRC, were so concerned about these papers that they put a report in to the minister at the time. That shows that it can be done and they were concerned.

I refute what you have said, Senator Ian Campbell. I know you said it with goodwill but in effect you conceded my point. You conceded it could happen although you said it was remote. You conceded that it happens in animals. To our knowledge, there has never been a human clone in the world so you cannot say, `It has not been done with people,' because cloning has never been done with people. Cloning has been done from stem cells with monkeys and mice. The next step could be human cloning but no-one has ever done that. It is illegal around the world except in Singapore.

On a practical note, by the time the lab work is complete and written up, the licence probably will have expired anyway. There are problems with this amendment. While I acknowledge the intention behind it, I think that it is a very difficult thing to assess in practical terms and, once again, I am sure that our views as to what constitutes a significant advancement could vary substantially as well.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>7183</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>— Senator Harradine's amendment seeks to amend clause 26 to include an additional ground on which the NHMRC Licensing Committee may suspend or revoke a licence, and that is if the committee has evidence that there has been insignificant or no advances in knowledge or improvement in technologies for treatment. I will be opposing the amendment because I am of the opinion that the licensing committee should have the discretion to set conditions and make decisions on the basis of the merits of each case. </para></talk.start><para>Firstly, it would be difficult to judge any project before it is completed with respect to whether or not it led to a significant advance in knowledge, and the NHMRC Licensing Committee would only cover the work involving the use of an embryo and not all other aspects of the research project. At the stage in a research project when the benchwork has been completed and the results written up and published—at which point it may be possible to judge the outcomes of the work—the licence will have already expired. Therefore the amendments suggested by Senator Harradine would at best lead to a judgment being made after the licence has expired; at worst it may lead to projects being judged and terminated prematurely.</para><para>To illustrate how this would operate in the context of the legislation, I will go through a hypothetical scenario. A person applies for a licence to use an ART embryo to undertake certain research and satisfies the NHMRC Licensing Committee that there is likely to be a significant advance in knowledge which could not reasonably be achieved by other means. Assuming that the licensing committee is satisfied that all the other requirements for the issuing of a licence have been met, the committee then issues a licence for the use of the embryo for the purpose detailed in the application. The licence holder subsequently uses the embryo and fulfils the reporting requirements in accordance with the conditions of licence. The NHMRC Licensing Committee then decides that the results of the research do not constitute a significant advance in knowledge. Given that the embryo has been used and the licence is no longer in operation, what then would be the point in suspending or revoking the licence, because the embryo would already have been used for the purpose described in the application and in accordance with the licence conditions? I believe that this is an important area in which the licensing committee should have discretion to make decisions on the basis of the information available to them, and for these reasons I will not be supporting the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>7183</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to indicate that One Nation will support Senator Harradine's amendment. The reason for that is that both the minister and Senator Stott Despoja have referred to clause 26 of the bill having the head of power to revoke the licence. The minister also went on further, immediately preceding me, to say that if the person uses an embryo then the licence ceases to exist. I do not believe that that is technically correct. A licence can be to use multiple embryos. If a person has not been able to show that there is a significant improvement in knowledge and technology then that would be a reason for that licence to be revoked—and Senator Harradine's amendment will very clearly do that. </para></talk.start><para>If the conditions set down by the NHMRC do not actually have in them a requirement for that experiment to improve technology then there is no head of power under clause 26 under which they can revoke it. So, firstly, licences can be issued for multiples of embryos and, under clause 26, unless the licence explicitly says that one of the requirements of the licence has to be for the improvement of knowledge, there would be no way that the NHMRC could revoke that licence. The requirement that Senator Harradine's amendment brings in is that there must be a significant improvement in technology. Therefore One Nation supports Senator Harradine's amendment for those reasons.</para><para>Question negatived. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:19:00</time.stamp><page.no>7184</page.no><name role="metadata">Bishop, Sen Mark</name><name role="display">Senator MARK BISHOP</name><name.id>2L6</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My understanding is that the subsequent amendment to be moved by Senator Barnett achieves essentially the same purpose as the amendment moved in my name.

They are for serious offences with penalties of up to five years imprisonment. We are not talking about being late with the reporting of an annual report or something like that; these are where there has been, in many of these cases, an intentional or reckless disregard for the licensing regime or the legislative or regulatory regime. So we are talking about serious offences. Indeed, it is only appropriate that there should be an automatic revocation of the licence. There will be an argument that the NHMRC, or the licensing committee at least, needs a level of discretion in terms of the suspension of a licence and the types of conditions and sanctions that may be imposed on the licence holder. But this is about penalties where convictions have taken place. We are talking about serious offences.</para><para>I draw the chamber's attention to the report of the Community Affairs Committee, of which I was a member.

The way that came to my mind that this might be achieved was by picking up on some of the evidence brought before the committee on how the Europeans deal with commercialisation. Whilst this particular model might not suit us in the long term, it is a relatively simple way of ensuring that the horse does not bolt in relation to stem cell lines until we achieve a measure to deal with the commercialisation of this research that suits our particular circumstances.</para></talk.start><para>I have accepted in part the concerns raised by Senator Stott Despoja that a stem cell bank per se, and certainly the British model of a stem cell bank, may not be ideal for Australian circumstances and our regime here. I made the point quite forcefully on the last occasion that that is not an excuse to do nothing. In particular, where we have COAG, the Premiers and the Prime Minister saying we have a strict regulatory regime, principal in the ethical position that many people take is that this work should occur for humanitarian purposes and not for profit or for commercially related purposes and that we should follow the lead of the many countries that have found a variety of different means of curtailing the profit or commercial motive in furthering this research.</para><para>Amendment (R8) seeks to do that by saying that, essentially, a licence holder would lose their licence if they sought a patent in relation to unmodified stem cells. I think it is necessary to make this point too, because I know that some of the responses to my amendment have said that this would have a substantial impact on investment and that this research should go ahead. With respect, that ignores what most other regimes established to deal with this type of research have put in place in their own circumstances and it maintains the position that we should just do nothing until somewhere in the never-never we might come up with something appropriate to our particular circumstances. Under a strict regulatory regime, we should have something that prevents the horse from bolting until, if we have not got it ready now, we have the appropriate system in place to deal with these commercial interests suitable to Australia's particular circumstances.</para><para>As I have said, I looked at the European model, which we heard evidence about in the Senate inquiry. I raised this in the earlier debate but I will repeat it for senators who may not have attended at that time. In his submission to the inquiry, Mr Ilyine from Stem Cell Sciences, even though they are part of, in a sense, the commercial interests in this area, said they supported the establishment of a stem cell bank. The interesting component when I started questioning Mr Ilyine was that he had some knowledge of the UK and the European models for dealing with commercial interests and in fact advocated that such should occur. When he spoke about the European model he said:</para><quote><para>The unmodified human stem cell line in Europe, it would be argued, comes from nature and therefore should never be patented because a patent granted in this domain would be so broad as to be hugely inhibiting to discovery, because any discovery made on the back of that would have to relate to the original patent holder. So the European position is to say that discoveries made when using such cell lines are indeed patentable when they have novelty and all of the factors that go into making a patent. However, the unique biological material itself should not be patented because it is of human nature. </para></quote><para>There are two issues bound up in that quote. Firstly, there is the ethical position and, in part, even a sociological position that human nature itself should not attract patents. Some of that quote prompted Senator Stott Despoja's earlier remarks in relation to genes and gene sequences. As well as that, they said that there are good commercial reasons why this should not occur either. Mr Ilyine said that if we allow patents on stem cell lines themselves then we will create problems commercially because the patents will end up being so broad as to capture any further work in relation to those stem cells, and that will inhibit commercial work. That is an important point, too, because some of the arguments have been that this will damage commercialisation. Here is Mr Ilyine saying quite clearly that certainly from a European perspective the contrary is the case: you might inhibit research by, in a commercial sense, allowing commercial value to reside where perhaps it should not. I do not think that there is a great deal more that I want to say about this matter at this stage.</para><para>I am happy to deal with amendments (R8) and (R9) together. Amendment (R9) is part of that package. It essentially would ensure monitoring powers in relation to, at least, the Australian patent system. I accept that some concerns have been raised that internationally it might be difficult to keep tabs on whether someone who should not be seeking a patent has done so in Hong Kong, the US or the like. But, in a competitive industry, I think that if that does occur the industry itself can probably ensure that that information becomes available to the licensing committee. In the sense and terms of the limitations of our jurisdiction, that is probably the best we can do. At this stage, I seek leave to move amendments (R8) and (R9) together.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><quote><para>(R8)	Clause 26, page 18 (after line 31), at the end of the clause, add:</para><para>	(2)	If a licence holder, or an associate of the licence holder, applies for a patent under the <inline font-style="italic">Patents Act 1990</inline>, or for a patent under patent legislation in any other jurisdiction, for any unmodified stem cells from human embryos, the NHMRC Licensing Committee must, by notice in writing given to the licence holder, revoke each licence held by the licence holder.</para><para>	(3)	In subsection (2):</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">associate</inline> in relation to a licence holder, includes:</para><para>	(a)	any employee, employer, principal, officer, trustee, agent or contractor, however described, of the licence holder; and</para><para>	(b)	any other person as prescribed in the regulations.</para><para>	(4)	Subclause (2) ceases to operate when the review required by section 47 of this Act is completed and the Commonwealth Parliament enacts legislation regarding commercial interests.</para><para>(R9)	Clause 36, page 26 (after line 26), after paragraph (f), insert:</para><para>	; (g)	obtain during normal business hours from the Register of Patents information regarding any application for a patent by a licence holder.</para></quote><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name></talker><para>—Mr Temporary Chairman, I rise on a point of order.

Senator Collins has moved an amendment to clause 26 of the bill which would require the NHMRC Licensing Committee to revoke automatically a licence if the licence holder applies for a patent under the Patents Act 1990 `for any unmodified stem cells from human embryos'. I think we could all agree that the patenting of biological lines raises difficult political, ethical and commercial issues. We discussed some of these matters last night, but I want to put them back together on the record. </para></talk.start><para>Patents law is a complex matter which cannot be addressed in an ad hoc way through this legislation. Any possible amendments should only be contemplated after very careful and detailed consideration to ensure that they do what is intended. This is a matter, as I have indicated before, much better dealt with in the context of a separate review process. The legislation was never intended to regulate stem cells; it only regulates the use of embryos. Any move beyond that would take the legislation far beyond the original intent of COAG. It is not absolutely clear to me what Senator Collins means by using the term `unmodified stem cells'. My understanding is that patents will be granted if inventions meet the statutory patentability requirements such as novelty, inventive merit, industrial application and adequate disclosure of the invention in the patents specification.</para><para>The amendments only catch a very limited class of people and therefore lead to inconsistencies and an unequal playing field. For example, what would be the impact on people who are not licence holders under the bill? Making amendments to this bill will not stop people who are not licence holders from seeking a patent. If these amendments were supported, we could have the situation where a licence holder had completed their initial research on embryos, the licence period had expired and the researcher would then be free to apply for a patent. It would also not stop people overseas registering patents in Australia.</para><para>A number of years ago, the US issued a patent known as the Thomson patent through the Wisconsin Alumni Research Foundation for the commercial application of certain stem lines. WARF also filed for a patent in Australia but subsequently allowed the application to lapse. The point is that any amendments restricting what licence holders can do and what they cannot seek a patent for would have absolutely no impact at all on this scenario and the capacity of a US organisation to seek a patent in Australia. This reinforces the need to avoid ad hoc changes to this legislation and to address the matter at the source, as I said, through Australian IP legislation. In a similar vein, Senator Collins's amendments do not appear to deal with existing patents but rather only revoke licences from those who apply for new patents. This seems to be rather anomalous. Licence holders who make new patent applications will have their licence revoked and will be unable to continue the research. However, licence holders with existing patents will not be affected.</para><para>Further, under the amendments, a company that is a licence holder would still be able to grant IP rights under a patent—for example, an exclusive licence to another company to continue the work started by the original licence holder. There is nothing to prevent the company to whom the IP rights have been transferred from being granted a licence from the licensing committee, provided, of course, that it meets the criteria in the legislation. I would add that IP licensing arrangements such as these are extremely common. I am aware of a number of Australian companies that hold licences from organisations who have patented certain processes overseas and it would appear that they would not be affected by the amendments. All of the issues regarding the patenting of biological material apply equally to embryonic stem cells, adult stem cells and all other cells and tissues.</para><para>During the debate on this bill there has been much discussion about the developments that have occurred as a result of the use of adult stem cells. The therapies which were developed as a result of the use of adult stem cells would not have been possible without commercial investment and accompanying IP protections providing the capacity for companies to market the therapies. The same opportunities should be considered in relation to embryonic stem cell research. </para><para>On the basis of the debate in the Senate it is clear that we all want to see the potential of stem cells being turned into therapeutic products which can help people—we might have a disagreement about whether they are embryonic or adult stem cells—but this must be done properly. To do this properly, to undertake extensive studies and trials and properly test the efficacy and safety of the therapies, takes significant investment. The size of the investment required simply cannot be met solely by governments and academic institutions, and therefore it must be supplemented by private investors. The fact is that private investors will not invest unless they stand to make a return on their investment, and they can do that only with proper intellectual property arrangements. </para><para>Senator Collins has attempted to include a sunset clause to repeal the operation of her amendment if the review under clause 47 is completed and parliament enacts legislation regarding commercial interests. It is ambiguous as to what type of amendments would need to be passed to give effect to the sunset clause. The term `commercial interests' is very broad and it would be difficult to know as a matter of legal interpretation whether or not the sunset clause has become operative. It is very unusual to repeal a provision, and I am sure that lawyers would have to exercise their minds about that.</para><para>I want to add an important development that has occurred, but it has not just happened as a result of the bill; it has been under way for some time. I announce that today the Prime Minister has agreed to a proposal by the Attorney-General for the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake an inquiry into intellectual property. This is very important for those people who have a concern about the patenting issue. I would like senators who are listening in their rooms to take heed of what I am saying. For those of you who have half an ear on the debate, I would like you to really concentrate at this point because some people have a concern about the patenting issue.</para><para>I reiterate that today the Prime Minister has agreed to a proposal by the Attorney-General for the Australian Law Reform Commission to undertake an inquiry into intellectual property issues raised by genetic information. The proposal arose out of a joint Australian Law Reform Commission and Australian Health Ethics Committee reference on the protection of human genetic information. The inquiry will focus on human health issues, including the impact of current patenting laws and practices relating to genes and genetic and related technologies, the conduct of research, and the Australian biotechnology sector. The inquiry will also focus on any problems with current laws and practices, with the aim of encouraging the use of intellectual property to further the health benefits of genetic research. Biotechnology Australia advised that stem cells would be in the scope of the review.</para><para>As I argue now and have argued earlier, it is vital that this be dealt with not in an ad hoc way but in an overall way, taking into account the fact that this bill is about embryos and not stem cells, and the fact that it does not cover adult stem cells. Therefore, I will be opposing the amendment, because I consider that it would pre-empt the outcome of the review. The government has already made a commitment to review the patenting arrangements of genetic material in Australia. To act on this bill in an ad hoc, knee-jerk way is simply not appropriate. I will be opposing Senator Collins's amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:41:00</time.stamp><page.no>7188</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Perhaps I should take this moment, if the minister has managed to attract the attention of people watching this debate, to respond to a few of those issues, because I think that they deserve a response now. The minister says that she is not clear on what is meant by `unmodified', yet that was the evidence that we received in the committee as to how the European model works. So I am a bit confused about why she is not aware of what seems to be a clear history of dealing with `unmodified' versus `value adding' or developments in relation to the stem cell lines themselves.</para></talk.start><para>Moving on to other issues, the other day we covered the issue of the distinction between adult stem cells versus embryonic stem cells. The difference—and why many of us believe that we need to be very careful about what commercial interests we involve in relation to embryonic stem cells—is the simple fact that to create them involves the destruction of human embryos. If you have the ethical position that you want to restrict how many of these embryos are destroyed to create stem cells, you seek to limit the commercial interests to create more. That is the issue. If you have, as COAG told us, a strict regulatory regime, you do not leave dealing with this issue for `ron' when you might hear the result of an ALRC review. You do not wait that long; you have something in place that will prevent the horse from bolting now. </para><para>Senator Patterson, I have not claimed that what you refer to as my `ad hoc process' is perfect. I have sought to draw on the experience that has occurred elsewhere in the world, and the principal areas that we can rely on are Europe and the UK. The proposal that we look at a stem cell bank has arisen from the UK experience. Senator Stott Despoja and others have raised many valid issues about why we should not necessarily go straight down that path now in the form that they have and that it would benefit us significantly to see how it has operated in the UK. With respect to the European experience, we have a reasonably straightforward way of at least introducing some constraint in this area.</para><para>While Senator Patterson says that it is ad hoc and that it should not be in this legislation, and a variety of other excuses, we already know that if the Prime Minister is serious about an issue he can give us a commitment that he will deal with it in another area. If that is really the only stumbling block then the Prime Minister will say, `We'll deal with it through customs regulations, for instance, in that case.' So the message that the Senate clearly gets from your contribution is that we are happy to leave the horse unbolted; we are happy to let the horse out.</para><para>You may say to us that establishing this review is significant and should impact on other senator's minds but, with respect, Senator, when will the result of that review happen? I do not think that you gave the Senate the benefit of the advice of how quickly that review will occur and when we might have the recommendations of it. But if it is not within the six-month period, then the horse will bolt. It is as simple and as straightforward as that.</para><para>One of your claims was that a licence holder could simply pass the stem cells on to somebody else who could seek a patent. That is why we have the word `associate' in the amendment. We are saying `a licence holder or an associate'. A licence holder is not going to pass these stem cell lines on to somebody else if they risk losing their licence. You did raise one valid issue in relation to what could happen once the research has been concluded and a licence is no longer necessary, but the point of the matter is that there is—as you referred to it, and I am glad that you reminded me—the sunset clause here. The sunset clause will mean that this restriction will not apply once an appropriate regime is established and in place.</para><para>Maybe I am being far too optimistic here. But I would hope, given the nature of research in this field, given how long it is going to take for the licensing arrangements to get up and into operation, given a myriad of other factors, that the government would get its act together on the alternative regime before research projects are being licensed, concluded and then traded. Seriously, Minister, if we are waiting that long then maybe we should have something far more significant here. Perhaps you are suggesting to all senators listening that they should really be favouring Senator Murphy's amendments rather than mine because you are just not serious.</para><para>If the government is serious about this review, it will accept that it is important to prevent the horse bolting now and at least establish an appropriate minimum line, which is that the stem cells themselves should not be patented. We have good evidence from Europe that says that there are commercial impacts of allowing that to occur anyway. If you pick up the argument that perhaps it is not going to be meaningless anyway because the patenting regulation would just deal with value itself on top of these stem cells, then your argument about the supposed large commercial impact of doing this is a bit circular. In fact, it is quite circular. On the one hand you cannot argue that there are going to be dire commercial implications of putting this restriction on commercialisation and on the other hand say that the commercial limits involved here are really so significant as to be meaningless. You cannot run both arguments. It is not logically coherent.</para><para>I am interested in how other senators respond to this issue but I can only reinforce the point that this is an interim step. Of course it is ad hoc, but the Prime Minister's sunset clause in this bill is ad hoc. There are many other ad hoc provisions in this bill. This amendment seeks to ensure that we are serious about this being a strict regulatory regime. For those senators who accept the ethical position that there is a middle way here but we are still concerned to ensure that human embryos will not be used willy-nilly, this is a way of trying to ensure that commercial interests will not prevail in utilising more embryos than might be necessary. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>7190</page.no><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name><name.id>FX5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will begin my response to Senator Collins's amendment by reading part of an answer given to a question I asked yesterday, which was incorporated by Senator Minchin today.

The Patents Act is the legislation that must ultimately be amended to give the type of protection that we need for potential investors in this areas and in order to ensure that any therapeutic, medical or remedial findings that come about as a result of stem cell research, particularly embryonic stem cell research, are going to remain affordable to Australians who are in need of them from a health point of view.</para><para>The government's vision for biotechnology—and this in the explanatory memorandum which I circulated with my amendment—states:</para><quote><para>... consistent with safeguarding human health and ensuring environmental protection, Australia captures the benefits of biotechnology for the Australian community, industry and the environment.</para></quote><para>That is an admirable goal, but what I cannot understand is that, given that the biotechnology age has been around for a little while, we have not proceeded to deal with one of the fundamental issues.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator Stott Despoja</name></talker><para>—Are you really surprised?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—I should not respond, because this is a very serious issue, but I am not really surprised. I take that interjection from Senator Stott Despoja. I know why she made it, and I think it was justified. But we are now proceeding with a piece of legislation that is going to allow more research that will offer up opportunities for patents to be claimed. Let us look at what has happened thus far in respect of patents in this area. Most of them have been claimed by overseas companies. How is that really going to assist Australian industry?</para></talk.start></continue><para>Why should it be the case that, at some point down the track, as a result of patents claimed now, patents which have been claimed previously or patents which are likely to be claimed in the future by overseas companies, particularly large pharmaceutical companies, Australians get to pay through the neck for the medical remedies and therapeutic services that might be provided to them through medical findings? Why should it be the case? I know we have all heard the minister in respect of the cost of the PBS. By way of an example in terms of the types of cost, a UK hospital received demands for $US6,000 to use a gene for cystic fibrosis which was employed to screen patients for that disorder. Is that the sort of process that we want to allow ourselves to be caught in? I would think not. I think that at the least we ought to be setting down some rules in respect of patentability. We ought to put them in place before we allow more research to be considered. </para><para>I have heard Senator Patterson say, `This is all about stopping the bill.' This is not about stopping the bill. That simply is not the case. The Patents Act could be amended very quickly, and it could be amended by next February next year. There will not be any significant advances, given that nothing has really happened in respect of embryonic stem cell research anyway, but we should proceed to put in place the rules of the game first. Would such an amendment—be it mine or even Senator Collins's—have any impact on investment? Yes, it would. It would actually assist it.</para><para>The same sorts of rules apply in the UK, in France and in Germany as I have proposed in my amendment. They are exactly the same. The only difference is this: they apply across the board. They do not choose between embryonic stem cells, for instance, and adult stem cells. I am happy for that to be the case, because I think ultimately the Patents Act should probably be amended to take account of that. It should have that broad coverage. But there is a difference— and I think Senator Collins has referred to this difference—when you look at it from an ethical point of view. The ethical issue is that you actually have to destroy the embryo to extract the stem cells. That is why I restricted my proposal to embryonic stem cells. I think it is fundamentally important, given what has happened with the National Stem Cell Centre and given the evidence that has been drawn out in the course of the committee hearings in respect of who is in which position with which company, located where, et cetera.</para><para>It is of fundamental importance that we make sure with this type of research that we have got the laws in place to ensure, as I said and as the government said, that, consistent with safeguarding human health and ensuring environmental protection, Australia captures the benefits of biotechnology for the Australian community. That is what this has to be consistent with, and that is what we should be doing. If we do not do that, we will be back here saying, `Woe is us; the PBS is confronted with another massive blow-out,' because all the things that we have discovered—and in part publicly funded, I might add—have been patented somewhere else in the world. If you look at the patenting that is happening around the world, there is a trend towards more patenting of upstream research. That is the basic research area. In terms of the issues that I was looking at in the US, for instance, it has been estimated that over 90 per cent of current US patents—and I think I put this in the explanatory memorandum—are never exploited. That tends to suggest one thing—that is, that they are to block other people from using them.</para><para>In the US they have what is known as the Bayh-Dole Act, which deals with licences on a case by case basis and which sets down very substantial restrictions and intellectual property sharing requirements. I do not think that we want to do that but, if you look at what has happened in the US with regard to the restrictions that they have alone and the type of investment that has occurred since those things have been in place, you can see it has not hindered it; in fact, it has enhanced it. I am suggesting a very simple, straightforward approach. It is consistent with the WTO requirements on the TRIPS agreement. It is consistent in part with what happens with the US, only it is a different approach. It is consistent with those laws in the UK, France and Germany. The UK act states:</para><quote><para>An invention of a method of treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy or of diagnosis practised on the human or animal body shall not be taken to be capable of industrial application. </para></quote><para>The Patents Office manual sets out the definitions of surgery, therapy, diagnosis et cetera. In France, the Intellectual Property Code says:</para><quote><para>Methods for treatment of the human or animal body by surgery or therapy and diagnostic methods practiced on the human or animal body shall not be regarded as inventions susceptible of industrial application within the meaning of Article L. 611-10. This provision shall not apply to products, in particular substances or compositions, for use in any of these methods.</para></quote><para>I am talking about something that is already in place in other countries in the world. It is as straightforward as that. I do not want to take up any more of the committee's time, because I know we have our backs to the wall in terms of time. But I want to say that this is imperative; we do not have time for an Australian Law Reform Commission review that could take 12 months or longer. Then it could take another six months to begin developing legislation or amendments to the Patents Act. These things can be done very quickly. If they had any effect on the timing and operation of this act it would be very minimal. As I said, I am sure, given the legislation that exists around the world, that a legislative draftsperson could come up with a proposition that would be more than adequate to deal with these issues so that this parliament could pass the legislation in the first two weeks of next year. That would have no effect on the research that is proposed to be allowed under this particular bill.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>7192</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to address some remarks to both Senator Collins's and Senator Murphy's amendments. In doing so, I will place on the record Labor's formal view about these issues of commercialisation and patents. I will try to be brief because I know other senators want to speak in the time available. The first point I want to make is that the bill does not deal with the issue of patents and intellectual property, as it is intended that existing intellectual property and patent laws will apply to research involving embryos just as they apply to all other forms of research. A number of senators have moved amendments that are directed towards ensuring that research involving embryos which has been approved by the licensing committee cannot be patented or, alternatively, that if a patent is applied for then the licence will automatically be revoked. I think that raises fundamental issues about the purposes of patent law.</para></talk.start><para>It might be worth while to set out the basis for Australia's laws and why we have patent laws at all. Patent law has the main aim of increasing the general pool of knowledge by encouraging researchers to disclose the outcomes of their research. In return for disclosing their research and to make it worth while for researchers to do so, the Patents Act grants the researcher certain rights during the period of the patent—currently 20 years for a standard patent. In this way, patent laws encourage research to proceed. Substantial effort and substantial investment are put into research with the aim of saving and sustaining lives. Without the protection of the Patents Act, which is offered for the benefits of the research, much of that research would not take place.</para><para>The purpose of the bill is to regulate the circumstances in which research involving embryos may proceed. At its core is a fundamental commitment to that research going ahead. I know a number of senators in this chamber do not want that research to go ahead. That is their view, but for those of us who are arguing for the research to go ahead the patent laws will provide some comfort and a part of that approach. Amendments which seek to cut off from stem cell research the rights which the Patents Act affords to all other research would fundamentally detract from that core purpose of the bill, which is to support continued stem cell research subject to the strong safeguards and protections contained in the bill.</para><para>At COAG the Prime Minister and each of the premiers agreed that properly regulated research involving embryos should proceed. I think these amendments are inconsistent with that clear intention. I also think that there is a problem in that we all know patent law is a complex area. Senator Murphy has further convinced me of that through his contribution. It is complex and it is difficult, and ad hoc changes to complex areas of law can create more problems than they solve. If stem cell research did throw up new issues which challenged the adequacy of existing patent law, Labor would prefer to see a considered approach which is well grounded and which seeks to preserve the balance between researchers and the community. </para><para>In the majority report of the Senate committee that inquired into this bill it was suggested that the ALRC and the Australian Health Ethics Committee could be well placed to inquire into and deal with the issues raised. That report noted that the ALRC and the AHEC were already undertaking a comprehensive review of the issues relating to the protection of genetic information, and it recommended that it would be appropriate to give them another reference to consider the issues of patenting, intellectual property and stem cell science and that this reference should feed directly into the review of legislation. That seemed to me to be a most sensible suggestion from the committee and one that would allow us to deal with the issues in the appropriate place. I am very pleased to see that the minister has tabled a letter from the Prime Minister which does authorise that referral to the Australian Law Reform Commission.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—I have not tabled the letter.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>AX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator CHRIS EVANS</name></talker><para>—I have a copy of the letter. I presume the minister will seek to table it. I think that would be useful. It is a letter from the Prime Minister to the Attorney-General agreeing to the reference of these issues to the ALRC, and I think that is helpful. Labor welcomes that commitment and believes that it is the most appropriate means by which the complex issues relating to intellectual property and patent law should be properly further considered.</para></talk.start></continue></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:05:00</time.stamp><page.no>7193</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Senator Evans has really said, `Go ahead; put the cart before the horse,' and Senator Collins has said, `Let's let the horse bolt.' Just for your information, this chamber did express its view as far back as 12 years ago when I moved to amend the patents legislation. As a result of that the patents legislation says that `human beings and the biological process for their generation' are not patentable inventions. I really was not aware of the existence of stem cells at that time and I am not sure that too many people were. Clearly, however we look at it, that was the intention of the legislation. If you look at the debate at that time, the intention was clearly to exclude that area of human life.</para></talk.start><para>I am mindful of the time, although I would happily go on for quite a while dealing with this question of patents, because it is an area that I have been interested in for some considerable time. I was successful on at least that particular occasion, for what it is worth, in getting the Patents Act amended. I support the proposals that have been put forward by Senator Collins and Senator Murphy. I think that they are not mutually exclusive—in other words, both can be supported, and I support both of them.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>7193</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—First of all, it is possible to agree with comments that have been made by both those in favour of and those against the amendment. I say that because I begin by acknowledging the complexity of the Patents Act. I think it was really interesting that, in response to Senator Murphy's question, Senator Minchin provided reference to the section of the Patents Act—the section that Senator Harradine was involved in—that refers to human beings and the biological processes for their generation as not being patentable inventions. I wonder, therefore, whether there is a legal interpretation that suggests that what Senator Collins is attempting to do might actually already be covered. I suspect that it would be a very grey area. As senators would know—and certainly Senator Harradine would know— that section of the act does not exclude the patenting of genes and gene sequences. </para></talk.start><para>I do not think the Patents Act is sufficient; I think it needs to be changed. I welcome the Prime Minister's announcement that there will be an inquiry—essentially a recommendation in my second reading amendment. I also echo, though, the concerns raised by Senator Collins in relation to the time frame. I think we need more specifics on this one. Certainly, people who have been debating the Patents Act since 1990—including some of us who have been debating it since 1995—want better assurances. It is a good win; it is a good announcement by the government—I do not mean to detract from that. But I also know that the ALRC and AHEC have full plates. I know that they are in the midst of the genetic privacy inquiry, which has taken a long period of time—mind you, it has been comprehensive and far-reaching, and I hope it will result in not only valuable recommendations but also legislation. That inquiry is perhaps the best example of how long these processes can take—yes, because they are complex but also, on the other hand, because they require political will.  </para><para>Absent from a debate about Patents Act reform has been political will. No matter how many times people stand up in this place and acknowledge that we all have sympathy, we all have concerns, we all have ethical debates—and it has been from people who have voted time and time again against changes to the Patents Act; I do not mean to detract from the complexity of the debate, I do respect the deeply held views of everyone in this chamber and I am not impugning anyone—the voting record shows that previous attempts to change the Patents Act to stop the patenting of things that occur naturally, such as biological materials and parts of a human—and I talk specifically about genes, gene materials, genetically engineered organisms, genetic engineering, genomes, altered organisms, progeny of genetically engineered organisms et cetera—have been stymied. </para><para>This debate says three important things to me today: yes, we are ready for a debate about patents; yes, we are ready for a long overdue inquiry into the Patents Act; and, yes, there is finally the political will to change it. In the same way that Senator Collins is calling me on this one—I acknowledge that; Senator Collins knows my views and knows that I support her amendment—and now that I have heard other people's views, I am going to call her and them right back. In 1986, 1984, 1990—September 1990 was one of the attempts to change the Patents Act—</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>GB6</name.id><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator Jacinta Collins</name></talker><para>—Do you want me to argue for another conscience vote?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>3I6</name.id><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name></talker><para>—Indeed. I do not want a conscience vote; I want the political parties to adopt these changes. I say that through the temporary chairman to Senator Boswell. Senator, in 1990 you voted against changes to get rid of the patenting of genes and gene sequences, but I can tell that that was not your view. I know that from personal discussions with you, and I want you to convince your caucus to that effect. I want the National Party and the coalition out there ready to make these changes. Maybe political parties will be, after this inquiry.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I acknowledge the difficulties, but I also wish to acknowledge a point that I think Senator Evans made well to the people in the chamber—that is, when we talk about the horse bolting, we have to acknowledge that research is taking place now. Just because we have just got around to dealing with some of the jurisdictional or regulatory issues in Australia in relation to, firstly, prohibiting human cloning and, secondly, dealing with research involving human embryos does not mean that this is not already going on. I understand that it has implications for our scientists and our researchers. I understand that it has implications in terms of intellectual property and whether or not there is the same incentive for people to get involved in the research. But it works in other ways, too; it works from the opposite perspective. I asked back in 1996:</para><quote><para>Will the patenting of genes and gene sequences—</para></quote><para>you can insert Senator Collins's references to unmodified stem cells in here as well—</para><quote><para>inhibit the free flow of information on which science and the advance of science ultimately depends? </para></quote><para>If you have free access and availability, there is an argument that you encourage research. I do not want scientists and researchers to not be compensated for the work that they do, and that is where the debate comes in about whether you own the particular biological substance, the organism, the cell, the gene or whatever, as opposed to the processes involved in coming up with the products, inventions or what have you. There is a distinction which I think has been recognised in the past that says, `Yes, intellectual property rights are important, and so is compensation.' So in that respect I do acknowledge the argument that scientists could go offshore. I do not want that to happen, hence my support for this legislation. </para><para>I am probably in a difficult position. Senator Evans made reference to those people who do not support this legislation but who may be supporting this amendment— not as to their motive, I acknowledge. There may be people who do not support the legislation but who support the amendment, but I am one of the people who are passionate about having some legislation in place and so having a regulatory environment. At the same time I am in favour of embryonic stem cell research and adult stem cell research going ahead. That is on record. That, hopefully, is well known by now. But at the same time I cannot resile from the fact that there is one thing I believe strongly—that is, you do not patent those biological processes, those aspects of humanity. There are reasons for that. They may be inspired among us by religious or spiritual beliefs. They may be personal reasons. It may be simply the abhorrence that human life should be owned in any way. It may be because commercial exploitation of humans is something that we strongly oppose. It may be because of those research implications and the fact that the free flow of information is potentially inhibited by commercial interests or people owning these substances.</para><para>It is not so much with mixed feelings that I support Senator Collins's amendment, because I support the intent of it, but I make it very clear too that this has been a long time coming and I will be moving very soon to see that we have a general business debate on the Patents Amendment Bill 1996, moved by me in this place on behalf of the Democrats. If we are going to do this properly, then let us talk about real patents reform that better reflects the ethics and the spirit not only of this debate but of our nation. Then we will be in line with the Inter-Parliamentary Union meeting in Madrid in 1995—I think it involved 114 national parliaments—which called for the prohibition of the patenting of human genes. The resolution underlined the `urgent need to ban the patenting of human genes' and `prohibit all financial gain from the human body or parts thereof, subject to exceptions provided for by law'. Obviously there are going to be arguments for exception, and I am sure that debate will happen through the ALRC-AHEC inquiry.</para><para>I acknowledge the Prime Minister's letter—I have seen a copy of that, and when it is tabled I am sure there will be more debate—and I appreciate the Prime Minister and the government taking on board those concerns in the ideas for the terms of reference outlined in the second reading amendment. I recognise all the other qualifications and arguments from all sides in this debate, because I do think Senator Evans and Senator Patterson made a good point about ad hoc reform. But, when there is an issue such as this and there is a core philosophical debate, I will support that debate.</para><para>I hope that the legislation is successful and I hope that, with the opportunities over the next two years as we review this legislation, and certainly in the short term, when we will have the broader AHEC-ALRC inquiry, we will come up with better ways of addressing patent reform issues. But for now I am called on this amendment: it is an issue— as I have said repeatedly ad nauseam, I have no doubt—that I have been more passionate about than just about anything in this place, so I welcome the opportunity to perhaps get that into law for the first time.</para><para>But this is only the beginning, and again I put on notice those other senators who have expressed their concern about patents. When the gene sequences bill or the next patents amendment bill comes up and I move amendments on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I will be looking for support, particularly from Senator Boswell on behalf of the Nationals. Senator Harradine's support has been there on this issue for a long time, so I know where he will be voting. Senator Murphy, your view is quite evident from your amendment. I think your amendment is quite broad ranging. I think its implications for not only the processes involved in research but also obviously the results of that research are quite far ranging. I am not sympathetic to having such a change to patents law unless we talk about it in the context of other changes to the Patents Act. It is not the same philosophical, easy, `vote for me' response, inasmuch as any of these debates is easy. Having said that, I hope in no way to hold up this legislation but I do see this as an opportunity to make a significant philosophical change to Australian law. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>7196</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In rising to support both Senator Collins's and Senator Murphy's amendments, I will firstly speak very briefly on Senator Murphy's amendment. I believe that it does have merit and that it also has practical application. Just recently I spent some time on the north coast—that is, the Sunshine Coast in Queensland—and members of the CSIRO were able to relate to me that one of the reasons that they could actually carry out the research and developments in technology that they were doing was that they could access intellectual property that was in the public domain. If they had had to take into account the paying of royalties in relation to either the technology or the samples that they required, that would have impacted on their ability to carry out that research. I support Senator Murphy's statement that he believes that, by not allowing the patenting of developments or actual samples deriving from embryos, we will encourage the actual research.</para></talk.start><para>Senator Collins's amendments will provide for a licence to be automatically revoked if a person applies for a patent as a result of holding an NHMRC licence. The minister pointed out that there are problems in respect of an amendment that is not strictly designed to achieve that end. However, there is a considerable history in this place, even during the 3½ years I have been here, of legislation being brought in, which has had an impact on aspects other than those relating to the relevant bill. If it was the government's intention to eventually amend the Patents Act, all they would have to do is bring in a consequential amendment to delete the relevant section from the legislation. During the interim, the amendment will have carried out its purpose with clarity. It would neither hold up this legislation, nor detract from the assessment of the Patents Act.</para><para>In conclusion, I express One Nation's support for the amendments. The intellectual property right that is derived from any embryo research—and I believe that that should be only in relation to IVF—should stay in the public domain. There should be no commercial gain derived from a human being in that respect. Senator Murphy's amendment can coincide with that of Senator Collins and it would merely require the government to bring in a consequential amendment when they alter the Patents Act.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>7196</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I support this very important amendment.

I want to pick up on some of the points that were made during the debate. Firstly, Senator Evans says that the Patents Act provides protection—yes, it does. It provides protection for patent claimants but it does not provide protection for the Australian community, from a health point of view, in findings that might go to therapeutic, surgical and other remedies. It does not provide protection to ensure delivery to the Australian community of those things in an affordable way. That is what it does not do.</para><para>I am not suggesting ad hoc changes. As I said, there is ample legislation around the world in countries like the UK, France, Germany and Canada—and even take account of what exists in the US—for a smart draftsperson to give consideration to this in a very considered way, not in an ad hoc way, and to develop legislation and to determine the shortcomings if there are shortcomings in the application of legislation overseas. That is not going to take a long time. If you read the Senate report you will see that medical treatment applications from embryonic stem cell research are yet to be made. We are not holding anything up here. What Senator Collins suggested in her amendments was very valid. Why should we proceed to put legislation in action that allows for research and subsequently allows for patents to be claimed? As I said, there is a tendency now for patents to be claimed more and more on the basic, upstream research and that is the fundamental problem. I do not want to see an ad hoc approach.</para><para>I welcome what the minister has said in respect of the Australian Law Reform Commission inquiry. That is great. But why now? It seems that this is a response to the circumstances that have arisen out of the debate on this bill. Yes, the Australian Law Reform Commission and AHEC may have made some recommendations that this needs to be further considered. But even the NHMRC guidelines, which have been around for a while, say that more consideration needs to be given to this. Why is it that we suddenly decide we should do something about patents right now?</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name></talker><para>—That didn't happen.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>FX5</name.id><name role="metadata">Murphy, Sen Shayne</name><name role="display">Senator MURPHY</name></talker><para>—Minister, I read out the answer that was tabled by Senator Minchin today, and he says:</para></talk.start></continue><para>In light of recent concerns regarding patenting in the human biotechnology area the Government is giving active consideration to a review of this issue.</para><para>Well, that is great. But, you see, actively considering a review is not going to solve the problem following the proclamation of this piece of legislation and the research that will occur shortly thereafter. Nor will it solve the problem of the potential for patent claims to be made. If the government were really serious about `safeguarding human health' and ensuring that `Australia captures the benefits of biotechnology for the Australian community', as was stated in the government's vision for biotechnology, then it would not allow this research to take place until it had put in place the types of patent laws that are necessary. I say to Senator Evans that there need to be patent laws that will enhance the investment in this area, not stop it or discourage it. I note that Senator Stott Despoja, although she is not here at the moment, said that this has been a long time coming. Yes, it has, and we should not allow legislation to pass through this parliament and to become active without doing this first. This is not a question of adhocery. This is a very serious matter. This is about protecting the national interest from a human health point of view. That is what we should be doing.</para><para>As I said at the outset of this debate, I do not have a philosophical or ideological position with regard to research involving embryos; I really do not. But I think the objective of this parliament should be to ensure that the legislation that we pass passes in a sound way and has the capacity to operate in the public interest. That is what is important and that is why the amendments that I have proposed should proceed. They do not stop the effect of this bill overall, but they will ensure that the right foundation in terms of patents laws is in place to make sure that we really do get the Australian public interest at the forefront and not on the back foot.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:40:00</time.stamp><page.no>7198</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I will be very brief. In speaking in support of the amendments, I would just like to very quickly run through a list of the countries world wide that not only have prohibited patenting but have even prohibited research. In Austria, stem cell research on human embryos is prohibited. In Belgium, stem cell research on embryos is prohibited. In France, research on embryos is prohibited. In Germany, stem cell research, the use of spare embryos and the production of spare embryos are prohibited. In Hungary, the life of the unborn child must be protected from the time of conception. In Ireland, the right to life of the unborn child is equal to that of the mother; stem cell research on human embryos is banned; and the production of spare embryos is prohibited. In Italy, in 2002, the lower chamber of parliament passed a bill that proposed to ban human cloning, experiments on human embryos and the freezing of embryos. Norway prohibits research on embryos and bans their use for any purpose other than reimplantation into the donor. In Poland, under law introduced on 7 January 1993 and amended in 1996, the life of the unborn child must be protected from its conception. In Switzerland, the constitution prohibits the use of medically assisted reproduction for research purposes and the fertilisation of more ova than are capable of being immediately implanted.</para></talk.start><para>If there is this perceived problem that Australia is out of step with the rest of the world and that the rest of the world will run off and put all the patents in place, I say that there is a list of countries whose position is the same as Australia's.

I place on record One Nation's support for Senator Murphy's amendments.</para><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>7198</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move amendment (13) on sheet 2696:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(13)	Page 19 (after line 3), after clause 27, insert:</para></quote><para><inline font-weight="bold">27A  Custody of excess ART embryos following suspension, revocation or surrender of licence</inline></para><quote><para>		Where a licence authorising use of excess ART embryos is suspended, revoked or surrendered, all excess ART embryos in the custody of the licence holder must be returned to the ART practitioner from whom they were obtained within 7 days of the suspension, revocation or surrendering of the licence.</para></quote><para>That is self-explanatory.

It is seeking to make it a requirement that excess ART embryos in the custody of a licence holder be returned to the ART practitioner from whom they were obtained should the licence be suspended or revoked. It ignores the fundamental principle of the consent of the couple, which is integral to the current bill, as well as to ART clinical practice. The amendment requires that the embryos be returned to the clinic irrespective of the wishes of the couple who have already made the decision to donate the embryos to research. Under the bill, a couple can independently decide that they no longer require their ART embryos for the purposes of achieving pregnancy and then decide to donate their embryos for research. They would then decide whether to give consent to use their embryos in a particular licensed research project. As part of that process of obtaining consent, the couple will be given a number of alternatives to consider. One option will be to donate their excess embryos to research. Another will be to let their excess embryos succumb.</para></talk.start><para>I want to be very clear on one point. As part of ART practice, couples must make difficult decisions about what is to be done with their embryos once they have finished their program. It is something that should not be taken lightly. Thousands of embryos succumb every year as part of the normal ART practice. I understand that the figure in South Australia alone is some 4,000 a year. The decision to allow an embryo to succumb is made by people often at the end of their ART treatment. Once a couple have made the decision to donate their embryos to research, I think that it is problematic to try and return these embryos to the couple—which is the only reason I can see for Senator Harradine requiring the ART clinic to take them back. Couples will make what they think is a final decision, only to be told later that the decision was not given effect to and that they have to make more decisions about their embryos. I am also concerned that Senator Harradine's amendment appears to impose a continuing legal obligation on the clinics, even though those clinics may not be licence holders in relation to those embryos and have no existing relationship with those embryos. It is not apparent what these clinics would be expected to do. I also note that, in many cases, it will be the ART clinic which will be doing the research under a licence and it is not clear how Senator Harradine's amendment would work in that situation. For those reasons, I will not be supporting the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:45:00</time.stamp><page.no>7199</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Because of the time, I will just say it would be an interesting exercise at sometime in the future to point out the gobbledegook that has been provided in that response.</para></talk.start><para>Question negatived.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>7199</page.no><name role="metadata">Collins, Sen Jacinta</name><name role="display">Senator JACINTA COLLINS</name><name.id>GB6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to withdraw amendments (3) to (5) on sheet 2696 revised.

As far as I am concerned, it is consistent with amendments (R2) and (R4). It relates to clause 11 of the bill and is the subject of very close consideration by the Senate Scrutiny of Bills Committee, of which I am a member. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee issued its 15th report of 2002 this afternoon. I draw it to the attention of senators and, specifically with respect to clause 11, I draw the attention of senators to the following:</para><quote><para>In relation to the Minister's advice about the provision itself, the Committee confirms its earlier comments that the subclause provides for the continuing exercise of legislative power without parliamentary scrutiny.

However, provision for the incorporation of material as in force from time to time dilutes this safeguard.</para><para>The Committee notes that paragraph (a) of the subclause does not even include this protection, but instead provides for the RTAC—</para></quote><para>that is, the Reproductive Technology Advisory Council—</para><quote><para>to issue codes of practice directly from time to time.</para><para>The result is that under paragraphs (a) and (b) of subclause 11(2) the constituents of an offence provision punishable by up to five years' imprisonment may be determined by non-government bodies without parliamentary oversight or even knowledge. </para><para>The Committee continues to draw the Senators' attention to the provision...</para></quote><para>I think that sums it up. I really urge senators to think this one through as carefully as they possibly can. The Scrutiny of Bills Committee has provided a good report. It is on the public record. We are saying that, if the bill goes through as it is and the amendment is not successful, then you are establishing a regime that sets up a non-government body to establish a code which can change from time to time without any parliamentary oversight and which can set up an offence of up to five years imprisonment. That, with respect, is bad law. It is bad for the Senate and for parliament in any legislature to set up a regime where you can have a non-government body providing such advice and consequences. </para><para>I urge all senators to support this amendment which will have the effect of basically omitting subclause (2) and saying that the ART program means an assisted reproductive technology program carried out in accordance with regulations as prescribed from time to time. It is quite simple. It is set out in the regulations, which are a disallowable instrument in the Senate. They can be prescribed from time to time. It is simply a matter of drawing out of the code what is there now and writing the regulations, and you can set them up in a matter of days or weeks or months, however quickly you would like to do it and it is done—bingo, finished. And we have parliamentary scrutiny pursuant to clause 11. So I urge the senators to support this and I certainly urge the minister to do so as well, and I will leave it there for now.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:55:00</time.stamp><page.no>7201</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As honourable senators know, I have had longstanding membership of the Scrutiny of Bills Committee and the Standing Committee on Regulations and Ordinances and have a great regard for what they do.

So by saying that these cannot be used, we are banning ART clinical practice.

Couples undergoing ART treatment at a clinic often form very complex relationships with clinic staff as they go through the emotional roller coaster ride of successive attempts at IVF treatment.

There is a regime, which has been established in this legislation—and I use the terms used in the legislation—for the use of excess ART embryos for the purposes of experimentation or research, whichever word you prefer. That whole structure is based upon two rocks. We have been told, `Don't worry, these applications for a licence to destroy human embryos are to go through a human research ethics committee.' That is the principal foundation of the whole structure: `Don't worry about things that go through this particular committee.' There is another foundation of this whole process and that is accountability and information. The bill does not provide for this information. In fact, it is a secretive approach because the decisions and the evaluation of an application for a licence from the NHMRC Licensing Committee are withheld and kept secret from the public.</para><para>I know that the NHMRC has had a culture of secrecy over a period. That has been loosened up a little bit, perhaps over the last two years. Before that, there was a culture of secrecy and I fear that elements of that are still there, and this is one of them. The human research ethics committee will not provide the information as to why it has decided to approve or reject an application. Let me again give an example: a drug company, or a scientist who is involved with a drug company, seeks to use embryos or embryonic stem cells to test drugs. Where does the application go? It goes to the human research ethics committee. Who appoints the human research ethics committee? The institution— the drug company. The minister will say, `But it's been established according to the NHMRC guidelines.' </para><para>I do not have time tonight to go through all those NHMRC guidelines, but the fact of the matter is that the committee is predominantly research oriented. Two people from the community will be appointed under the guidelines, but preferably they will be from a community very close to the institution. I put it to you that it is not appropriate to have a situation where that organisation is not accountable to anybody. It is certainly not accountable to the public, because the public does not know and is refused the information as to why the committee has acted as it has about an application. I propose to ensure that at least that information is made available to the public.</para><para>I am concerned about the fact that the committee is appointed by the institute that makes the application for a licence. That creates many problems. In addition, these sorts of committees very often do not have the resources that are needed to give a truly independent evaluation of the research project for which a licence is required from the National Health and Medical Research Council Licensing Committee. I raise these matters and I would like some response in the first instance to the question: is the government going to do something to ensure that information is made available to the public in the interests of accountability and transparency?</para><para>Progress reported.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ADJOURNMENT</title><type>Adjournment</type><page.no>7205</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

It is one of Australia's more important trade relationships. In the year 2000, a parliamentary report on Australia's trading relationship with the Middle East was tabled. Since then, an enormous amount of work has gone into fostering relationships and into identifying and engaging in new parts of the Middle East market. Recently, members of the Joint Standing Committee on Foreign Affairs, Defence and Trade participating in a visit to the Australian forces deployed to the international coalition against terrorism also spent some very valuable time in Dubai and received a number of briefings on Australia's success in trade with the Middle East and the Gulf region. For example, through groups such as the Australian Business in the Gulf group— known by the acronym ABIG, and which is now helping about 200 Australian companies to negotiate the trading environment of the Gulf region—and Austrade and in myriad other ways, we are taking great advantage of the opportunities that exist. </para></talk.start><para>During the time that we spent in Dubai, members of the committee owed much to Consul-General Peter Linford and his team, including Paul Morgan and Alex Fraser, who gave us a very interesting overview of our success in engaging in the Emirates market. The Emirates are consistently among Australia's top three markets in the region, and that is a steadily growing level of trade. Two-way merchandise trade between Australia and the UAE has risen by almost 60 per cent over the last two years, from $1.3 billion in 1999-2000 to $2.0 billion in 2001-02. Australian exports to the UAE grew by 43 per cent over the period and imports from the UAE rose by 87 per cent, so this is a very dynamic area.</para><para>The UAE is our second-largest Middle Eastern market after Saudi Arabia, but I think its importance extends beyond those statistics. It is the region's major transport hub and plays a key role in facilitating our flourishing trade relationships with the entire region. In fact, that two-way trade relationship between Australia and the Middle East grew by almost 50 per cent between the years 1999-2000 and 2001-02. It is an interestingly popular regional base for Australians. I myself have friends living there, and more than 4,000 Australians live in the UAE. Over 70 Australian companies have offices there.</para><para>I also want to remark upon the important development of the growing diversity of our exports to the UAE. Traditionally, we have been well known in the region as a supplier of quality foods and raw materials but it is good to see that manufactured products are now matching that success. Between 1995 and 2001, Australian-manufactured exports to the UAE grew on average by over 25 per cent per annum and the share of total Australian exports to the UAE rose from under 18 per cent to what is now around 30 per cent. These are creditable figures. </para><para>It must be acknowledged that that impressive growth is largely due to the outstanding success of our motor vehicle exports. These exports only began in 1996, but by 2001-02 they had grown to a value of over $200 million. Australian-built Camrys, Chevrolets and Magnas have succeeded in the UAE because of their high quality, strong price competitiveness and ability to meet the requirements of that local market. These attributes also underpin other Australian manufactured exports to the UAE such as industrial machinery, ships, medicines, scientific equipment and furniture.</para><para>Australian exports to the Emirates in 2001 were valued at $1.2 billion while total imports were valued at $930 million. The major exports include alumina, motor vehicles and agricultural products. However, the really dynamic and great opportunity for Australia is the expanding market for Australian educational, architectural and other professional services. If we can make the most of that market, it will be of enormous benefit for Australian business. Petroleum products account for most of the imports.</para><para>This is not success that happens by itself. It is the result of a very concerted effort by the Minister for Trade, Mark Vaile, and his predecessor, Tim Fischer, to improve our trade performance in that part of the world. One good example is a problem that was identified in the timely allocation of tourist visas from the region, an issue which was raised with us on our visit and included in the committee's report. After discussions from Minister Vaile and others, and of course our diplomatic representatives in the region, I understand that DIMIA will allocate a permanent full-time migration officer to the post in Dubai in February next year. It is hoped that that will facilitate a more effective distribution and allocation of visas as appropriate.</para><para>As the committee's report mentioned, the delegation visited two very impressive facilities, the Jebel Ali Free Zone and the Dubai Aluminium Ltd smelter. The port in Dubai is quite mind-blowing. It is a large, modern deep-water port, with 19 cranes capable of moving 12,000 containers every day. That is a better rate of container processing than that which is achieved in either Singapore or Hong Kong. The free zone provides a tax-free operating environment for businesses, like those made available under our government's manufacturing-in-bond legislation. Businesses operating in the zone have access to a range of support facilities and services, and the important thing to note from Australia's point of view is that 20 of our own companies are located there.</para><para>The delegation also visited Dubai Aluminium Ltd, known as Dubal, which is the largest single-site aluminium smelter in the world—I have to add that, from close inspection, it is probably one of the cleanest. The smelter's location is very important for Australian suppliers of aluminium because it services markets in Europe, Asia, the Far East and America with equal ease. It is important to note that most of the alumina used by Dubal is purchased from Australia and that they use more than one million tonnes of Australian sourced alumina per year, so it is a very important market for us.</para><para>The Dubai experience mirrors the success that Australia is enjoying across the Gulf region. The Middle East, which includes North Africa in this case, was the fastest -growing regional market for Australian exports in 2001-02. Indeed, it is fair to say that that market is a pacesetter in terms of both growth and diversification—and has been for some years. Minister Vaile has been an advocate of the region's potential for some time and has visited the region on a number of occasions since he became the Minister for Trade in 1999.</para><para>For example, in the last six months alone, Minister Vaile has led two trade delegations to the Middle East to emphasise the importance that the government places on trade with the region and to underline that, despite the uncertainties that may exist, Australia is approaching the region on a business as usual basis. </para><para>The first of these two trade delegations, in July, was to Libya, where new opportunities for trade have arisen since the suspension of UN sanctions in 1999. It was a very broad-ranging delegation with representatives from the agricultural, industrial, oil and gas, technological and services sectors. The wide-ranging discussions held by the minister in Libya identified further areas where we could provide both products and services. Substantial progress was achieved on the sale of agricultural produce, oil and gas exploration equipment and services and veterinary pharmaceuticals.</para><para>More recently, in September this year the minister led an Australian delegation which attended the ninth meeting of the Australia-Iran Joint Ministerial Commission. During that visit the minister met with President Khatami, former President Rafsanjani and a range of the economic ministers in Iran. That created the opportunity of reinforcing existing commercial ties and of opening new areas of cooperation. There were 53 members in that delegation, which represented 39 separate companies including AWB Ltd, BHP Billiton and Woodside.</para><para>It is also interesting that Minister Vaile's efforts in boosting our trade profile have generated positive media coverage in Iran. Australia is depicted as a modern, technologically advanced economy and a valued supplier of wheat and other primary commodities. Iranians have expressed strong support for Australian investment in Iran, and we now have agreement to negotiate an Investment Protection and Promotion Agreement between the two countries.</para><para>We have recently had the opportunity to help exporters achieve some important trade wins in Iran. For example, the AWB has confirmed a major contract for over half a million tonnes of wheat to Iran. The Australian company Seaspray has secured a deal to supply Iran with two Incat-designed ferries valued at $US12.2 million. Mr President, I know that will impress you, as a Tasmanian senator. That construction is to take place in Iran but, importantly, most of the materials and technologies are supplied from Australia. We also have the example of a South Australian company which has been contracted by Iran to provide a package of services designed to promote Iran as a tourist destination and for them to do that themselves. The package includes training, infrastructure development, tourism development, tourism planning and marketing advice.</para><para>Across the board, we have had very strong successes—successes which can only grow. It is important to look, for example, at education; that is an enormous opportunity for Australia's quality educational institutions to form a very strong presence. We need to further our investment links, particularly in trade-creating sectors. We have a number of measures in place to do that, and I can only comment favourably on a range of those and say that it is very important that, as well as focusing on our own region and on traditional trading partners, Australia makes the effort to develop our potential in areas such as the Middle East. That is certainly the leadership that the trade minister is providing.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Grey Electorate: Student Essay Competition</title><page.no>7207</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>7207</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to speak tonight about two young people I have had the pleasure of having with me in Canberra this week. They are in the advisers box here tonight, which is a great joy. These young folk, Alice Krige and Rehaan Bharucha, are year 11 students who entered and won a competition I conducted for all year 11 students in the South Australian electorate of Grey. The competition required the students to write a 750-word essay about an issue of national interest and of interest to the Australian parliament. The students were also required to express an opinion in those essays. My understanding from feedback is that the length of the essay made it very difficult, but my view was that a longer essay would have made it easier, given that I was not so much looking for an academic paper as testing their ability to convey a message and a view.</para></talk.start><para>Rehaan, a student from John Pirie Secondary School at Port Pirie, wrote about `Islamophobia', drawing a comparison between the teachings of the Islamic faith and the Christian faith. Alice, a student of St Joseph's School at Port Lincoln, wrote about citizenship. The judging was undertaken in two stages. The first stage of judging was undertaken by my staff, who checked for accuracy of fact and other things, like relevance to a federal issue rather than a state based issue. The final stage of judging involved a panel of four judges consisting of representatives from the state education department, Catholic Education and independent schools, and me. The twist here was that we had no knowledge of the author or the school they were from, to avoid any biases or favouritism. It was, if you like, a blind judging not unlike a blind wine-tasting. On this occasion, however, we got it right. The prize for our winning entrants was a week in our electorate office in Adelaide and a week with us in Canberra. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YE4</name.id><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator Boswell</name></talker><para>—What was second prize?</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>009D2</name.id><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name></talker><para>—Senator Boswell, I was thinking of first prize being a ride in my Volkswagen, but there was a bit of opposition to that! During the week in Adelaide, Rehaan and Alice accompanied us on various visits to industry and the state parliament. We showed them what the majority of senators in this place would be doing in their electorates. I think the highlights were the visits to the forensic science centre; a visit to Bedford Industries, a workplace and training centre for people with disabilities; and a discussion with a lawyer who represents detainees of the Woomera and Baxter detention centres. My staff also explained their roles and gave an overview of the various types of constituent inquiries that are dealt with by a Senate office.</para></talk.start></continue><para>While in Canberra this week, Rehaan and Alice have been shown the way the parliament operates and had the legislative process explained. To that end, I should place on record my thanks to the Black Rod's office, the Parliamentary Library and other Parliament House staff who have been of assistance to us during that period. Alice and Rehaan will also be visiting other places of significance such as the National Gallery, the National Museum and Old Parliament House.</para><para>It has been a great privilege for me to have spent time with two young people of this calibre. They are both wonderful ambassadors for their schools and their respective cities. I think their parents can take pride and comfort in the exceptionally bright and accomplished children they have raised, and I think Alice and Rehaan have exceptional futures before them. My understanding is that Alice is interested in pursuing a career in pathology and Rehaan has a great interest in archaeology. There may be some likenesses there. They have been an inspiration to me, and I think they will be an inspiration to many others. I look forward to hearing of their achievements as they go through life. I also look forward to comparing their views of the Australian parliament and politicians after their time with us with the views that they expressed prior to spending time with us.</para><para>In closing, I must particularly thank two of the staff from my office—Rosie Falco, who has become a surrogate mother, and Paul Marcuccitti, who has become a big brother—for the efforts they have made to make this program work. Hopefully, the success of this program may be extended to other senators. I seek leave to table the essay entries by Rehaan and Alice. I showed these to the government whip, Senator Ferris, prior to entering the chamber and she had no difficulties with them.</para><para>Leave granted.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Business: Corporate Governance</title><page.no>7208</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>7208</page.no><name role="metadata">Watson, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator WATSON</name><name.id>VJ4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Tonight I wish to place on record some aspects of good corporate governance.

In addition to analysing existing governance arrangements, the review will address the selection process for board members and office holders, the mix of experience and skills required by boards, the development requirements of boards and their relationship to government.</para><para>The <inline font-style="italic">Australian Financial Review</inline> reported in September on the results of a study commissioned by Horwath New South Wales and conducted by the Newcastle Business School.

The OECD has stated:</para><quote><para>If countries are to reap the full benefits of the global capital market, and if they are to attract long-term capital, corporate governance arrangements must be credible and well understood across borders. Where companies do not rely primarily on foreign sources of capital, adherence to good corporate governance practices will help improve the confidence of domestic investors, may reduce the cost of capital, and ultimately induce more stable sources of financing.</para></quote><para>I will now move on to the important issue of risk management. It is important that boards understand the degree of risk and areas of risk and are able to distinguish between what I call `pure risk' and `speculative risk'. Further, boards should have plans to manage the different levels of risk. In the superannuation area, where I have a particular interest, Deloitte's national superannuation partner, Mr Richard Rassi, believes that the most significant area of governance requiring improvement is the area of risk management, with boards needing to be aware of all key strategic and operational risks facing their funds. </para><para>Audit committees, of course, are an important ingredient of corporate governance. The membership should all be independent directors, as many failed corporations have got into trouble with the chair coming from either the chief executive officer or the chief financial officer. Audit committees comprising independent directors are an important element in corporate governance arrangements. Some common better practices associated with audit committees include: operating to an approved charter which clearly sets out its authority and lines of responsibility; having unfettered access to both the internal and external auditor functions and having in place processes for regular communication with the internal and external auditors; having unfettered access to executive management; and having access to all correspondence between the auditors and management, in particular all audit reports and responses thereto. In addition, the audit committee must set out and agree to the CEO's remuneration.</para><para>What about the role of ASIC in corporate governance? This role is increasingly important, and I think the increased influence of ASIC in this area is a reflection of the lack of interest from the major accounting bodies, which should cover aspects of good corporate governance in their audit reports. The Chairman of ASIC, Mr David Knott, whom I greatly respect, recently stated that ASIC has been vigorous in enforcing good corporate governance. In the last four or five years in relation to accounting issues, ASIC has successfully achieved restatements in company accounts of more than $3 billion—a great amount of money.</para><para>Looking at recent corporate history, we have had the corporate failures of HIH, NRMA, One.Tel, Pasminco, Harris Scarfe, Centaur and Ansett in Australia, and the big one of Enron in the United States, just to name a few. In the last three years in Australia alone, 69 people have been sent to jail in relation to corporate offences. Last year 19 people were imprisoned—11 of them company directors—and currently 111 defendants are on criminal charges.</para><para>I found it extraordinary that, on the back page of today's <inline font-style="italic">Financial Review</inline>, there appeared to be an implied attack on Mr David Knott for being too hard on at least one corporate person who had certainly failed in his duties in terms of good corporate governance. The paper seemed to take the attitude that it was a situation of overkill. I think that it is an appalling indictment of a newspaper for it to print that sort of rubbish, because we have to raise our standards and not be apologists for these sorts of people who have ripped off millions of dollars from innocent people.</para><para>Following public concern, the Australian Stock Exchange has set up the Corporate Governance Council. The council should be good both for companies and for the ASX. Corporations are now increasingly being called upon to have governance systems extending beyond their traditional focus to cover such areas as consumer protection; the rights of individuals, including employees; and environmental impacts and sustainability. Environmental and social sustainability management has now been firmly placed on the corporate governance agenda, and this is a good development.</para><para>Companies are being pressured to adopt higher standards of non-financial reporting and to provide more economic, environmental and social performance information. This is in order to provide more insight into the vision and effectiveness of management in anticipating a wider range of risks and opportunities in the marketplace. The focus on corporate governance is driven not just by the corporate failures of the past but also by the challenges of the future. I trust that our current interest in the issue of corporate governance is not cyclical—it does seem to come and go—and that it will be a permanent feature of good accounting practice in this country.</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 7.46 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DOCUMENTS</title><type>Documents</type><page.no>7210</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Tabling</title><page.no>7210</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>The following government documents were tabled:</para><para>Administrative Review Council—Report for 2001-02. </para><para>Australian Rail Track Corporation Limited (ARTC)—Report for 2001-02.</para><para>Bankstown Airport Limited—</para><quote><para>Report for 2001-02.</para><para>Statement of corporate intent 2002.</para></quote><para>Camden Airport Limited—</para><quote><para>Report for 2001-02.</para><para>Statement of corporate intent 2002.</para></quote><para>Commissioner of Taxation—Data-matching program—ATO's interaction with the program—Report for 2001-02.</para><para>Hoxton Park Airport Limited—</para><quote><para>Report for 2001-02.</para><para>Statement of corporate intent 2002.</para></quote><para>Productivity Commission—Report—No. 15—Cost recovery by government agencies— Government response.</para></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>7212</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Foreign Affairs: Sponsorship of Journalists</title><page.no>7212</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 718)</subtitle><id.no>718</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7212</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 30 September 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to trips to Indonesia, sponsored by the department, for Australian journalists:</para><para>(1)	How many journalists were sponsored in 2002.</para><para>(2)	What was the total cost of the program in 2002.</para><para>(3)	What was the total cost of the program in 2001.</para><para>(4)	What was the purpose of the sponsorship.</para><para>(5)	Which journalists were sponsored.</para><para>(6)	What is the basis on which journalists are selected.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>7212</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Five journalists were sponsored during financial year 2001-2002. </para><para>(2)	The total cost of the program in financial year 2001-2002 was $44,660.</para><para>(3)	The total cost of the program in financial year 2000-2001 was $44,791.</para><para>(4)	The Journalist Scholarship program of the Australia-Indonesia Institute (AII) is designed to encourage Australian journalists to learn more about Indonesia.  </para><para>The AII provides funding support to Medialink for exchanges between Australian and Indonesia journalists.

On the basis that the assessor is not asked to give advice or make assumptions, there is no reason why an assessor's report should be rejected. </para><para>Detail on the range and nature of reports other than from the assessor are not recorded, however it would only be an unusual circumstance when an “alternative” assessment is requested for a claim. It is not unusual, however, in the event of a significant claim, for Defence Service Homes Insurance (DSHI) claim staff to request additional reports, as the circumstances of the event unfold. For example, DSHI claim staff may request the assessor to obtain Police reports, take Statements, supply further particulars of damage, etc once the initial cause of loss is known. It is the role of the claims officer in State Office to take into account the full range of issues surrounding the claim (assessor's report, other reports from police where relevant, client claims history, policy limits etc) in making a determination on the claim.</para><para>(6)	At the same time the policyholder is formally advised that the claim is not accepted, he or she is advised of their rights to dispute the decision through the Internal Dispute Resolution (IDR) process, a process that is endorsed by the General Insurance Code of Conduct. The IDR involves the details of the claim, and the ensuing decision, being reconsidered by a nominated senior Defence Service Homes Insurance (DSHI) staff member. If, in the event that the policyholder is not satisfied with this outcome, he or she is able to take the matter to the Insurance Enquiries &amp; Complaints Ltd (the IEC). The IEC is independent and will negotiate with all parties in an attempt to achieve a satisfactory resolution.</para><para>(7)	(a) and (b) The Defence Service Homes Insurance (DSHI) has in place procedures to identify fraud claims. This process is undertaken on a monthly basis using recently resolved claims as a base. To date only one claim for fraud has been identified that emanated from the Queensland DSHI Office in 1998. This matter was finalised through a process of mediation involving a Queen's Counsel (rather than litigation). </para><para>(8)	(a) and (b) Each State Defence Service Homes Insurance (DSHI) branch selects a panel of qualified assessors to act on behalf of DSHI. This is done by a select tender process, and reviewed every two years. Only those assessing companies that meet national accreditation standards are considered for the tender process. The procedure to appoint assessors to the panel is pursuant to the General Insurance Code of Conduct, which is monitored by the Insurance Enquiries &amp; Complaints Ltd. The procedure ensures that selected assessors are properly and adequately qualified, determines the hourly rate/fees, sets up the standards by which the assessor must represent DSHI and includes key performance indicators by which DSHI staff are able to ensure the quality of the assessor's work.</para><para>(9)	The number of claims assessors currently used by Defence Service Homes Insurance by State is as follows:
