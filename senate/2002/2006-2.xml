Even with the passing of time it is still impossible to make sense of those brutal and inhumane attacks. Australia must now confront the reality of an attack in our own region that is just as vicious, evil and senseless—an attack which has claimed around 180 lives, many of whom we fear will be Australians.</para><para>As the Senate meets, many Australian families are already grieving over the loss of their loved ones. Others will be praying for family members who were seriously injured in the explosions and are now being cared for in hospitals in Denpasar and Darwin. Even more are waiting anxiously for news of family members still unaccounted for in the wake of the explosion. This is the reality of the tragedy that is unfolding for these families, their friends and their communities. This is the reality of the human tragedy that is unfolding for our nation. As a nation we offer our deepest sympathies to the families who have lost family members in this senseless attack. We also give our support and compassion to those families uncertain of their loved ones' whereabouts and safety. And, of course, we have provided immediate assistance to those who have suffered serious injuries, many of whom have now been airlifted to Australia. </para><para>I thought I should provide some detail to the Senate of the events as we understand them and the responses that have been made. Three explosions occurred on Saturday night. The main explosion was at the Sari nightclub at Kuta Beach at 11.05 p.m. Two minor explosions also occurred about the same time at the Philippines consulate in Manado in northern Sulawesi and near the US consulate in Bali. Reports of casualties from the main explosion are over 180 deaths and about 300 injured; 113 injured Australians were hospitalised. As of some little time ago 14 Australians were confirmed dead. The Indonesian authorities are treating the explosions as terrorist attacks and believe that the principal explosion was caused by a large car bomb.</para><para>In relation to the Australian domestic response, as the explosions took place outside Australia the Minister for Foreign Affairs has primary responsibility. Early yesterday morning DFAT formed an interdepartmental emergency task force which met a number of times yesterday and included not only the consular authorities but Defence and other relevant departmental agencies, including Emergency Management Australia, which is coordinating the reception of injured Australians in Darwin, and the Protective Security Coordination Centre, which has held an emergency meeting of the Special Incident Task Force, which looks at such issues as current threat assessment. The current counter-terrorism alert for Australia remains at special CT risk, which has been the risk level since September 11, 2001. The threat to Australian interests in Indonesia remains unchanged at high, and other regional threats remain unchanged as a result of those meetings. To assist with the investigation in Bali there is a joint AFP and ASIO team comprising some three ASIO officers and 12 AFP officers, including specialists in investigations, disaster victim identification, intelligence and forensics. The team has received cooperation and support from the Indonesian government.</para><para>Four C130 aircraft and associated aeromedical evacuation teams have been deployed from RAAF Richmond to assist with evacuations. These aircraft are conducting continuous shuttles between Darwin and Bali. A fifth aircraft will launch about now carrying urgently needed additional medical supplies. There have been three sorties from Denpasar overnight. This morning 15 casualties were transported to Darwin on the first aircraft—sadly, one died en route—22 casualties on the second aircraft and 15 casualties on the third aircraft, including eight Australian citizens and foreign nationals including one South African, one Swedish national, three Germans and two New Zealanders. One further C130 task is in progress conducting another evacuation today.</para><para>Two aircraft will shortly be retasked to move injured personnel from Darwin to southern capitals' burns units to relieve the strain on the Darwin hospital facilities, and I think there is some civilian support—I saw reference to the South Australian government—offering aircraft for that purpose as well. One P3 aircraft was deployed yesterday to take consular officials, together with ASIO and AFP personnel and other necessary personnel, to Denpasar. The ADF has also provided two ambulances to Bali, where they are being used to ferry casualties from the Bali hospitals to the airport for loading onto aircraft. It has provided medical teams, including Reserve members, to assist in patient care and the prioritisation and coordination of transfer of casualties. The ADF has facilities both at the hospital in Denpasar and at the airport. The domestic response—in particular, the very professional and prompt response from officials, whether they be consular, AFP, defence or others concerned—has done Australia proud in this instance; we are particularly proud of their efforts.</para><para>We would also like to make specific mention of the many offers of support and help that we have received from overseas: from the United States; from Britain, which is sending investigative officers as well; from New Zealand, which has offered a C130, an offer we have accepted—that aircraft will be in Australia later today and will then be deployed to Darwin to be used as necessary; and from other countries as well. The sentiments of support and practical offers of assistance are very much appreciated. </para><para>The government's National Security Committee of cabinet met this morning. It has decided on a number of things but, in particular, Mr Downer, as Minister for Foreign Affairs, and Senator Ellison, as Minister for Justice and Customs, will travel to Indonesia either later tonight or early tomorrow morning. They will travel firstly to Bali to express our sympathy and support for those who are injured who remain there and their families and then on to Jakarta, where they will be offering further assistance and support to the Indonesian government in its efforts to find those who are guilty of this horrendous crime. Cabinet has also decided to review domestic security arrangements, notwithstanding the very significant increases that have been put in place over the last 12 months, including, as all senators will recall, doubling our counter-terrorism capability, putting in place a capability to address chemical, biological and radiological weapons, increasing domestic security at strategic installations and airports and on aircraft and the like. Nevertheless, in the current circumstances, cabinet believes that it is again necessary to look at the precautions we are taking, including the legislative reform that we recently undertook to ensure that it is adequate to meet these very difficult sets of circumstances.</para><para>This weekend's attacks are a horrific reminder that we do live in a changed world. They are a reminder that we ignore the threat of terrorism at our own peril. Since the attacks in the United States last year, our government has worked to ensure that Australia is as ready as possible to prevent, or to respond to, a domestic terrorist attack. We have made no secret of the fact that terrorists can strike anywhere at any time and that our nation and its citizens are not immune from the tragic consequences of such attacks. We have invested heavily in our domestic agencies and, as I said, have moved to strengthen our laws to give those agencies the powers they need to hunt down terrorists. We have responded internationally through our participation in the Global Coalition of Nations, which is committed to confronting terrorism at its source. We must now make a commitment that these senseless and brutal attacks we have witnessed in Bali will not cower our nation. We must stand firm in our resolve to bring about an end to the threats of terrorism, wherever they lurk.</para><para>The weekend bombing of innocent civilians in Bali has outraged our nation and outraged the world. We condemn this act of barbarity in the strongest possible terms. To the families who have lost loved ones in this tragedy, again we extend our sympathies and commit our nation to ensuring that those who are responsible for this horrendous crime are tracked down, punished and made responsible for this senseless loss of life.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>5083</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to support the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. On behalf of the opposition, I extend our deepest sympathy to the families and friends of all those Australians and other nationals killed, injured or missing as a result of the tragic and despicable events early yesterday. On Sunday morning we all awoke to the terrible and shocking news of the bomb blasts in Bali. While the full extent of the tragedy is still unfolding, Indonesian officials are now indicating that the overall death toll is 188 people; this number may even rise. Many Australian lives have been lost.</para></talk.start><para>First and foremost, our thoughts go out to family and friends who have received the tragic news of the loss of a loved one. Our thoughts are also with those waiting to hear news of whether a loved one is safe. Communities across the nation are waiting anxiously for news about sporting groups that travelled to Bali for end of season celebrations. So many Australian lives and communities have been shattered. Most recent media reports indicate that 110 people are injured from the bomb blasts and that 220 people are still unaccounted for. The Labor Party fully supports the swift action taken by the federal government in dispatching medical teams to assist on the ground and to evacuate the worst of the injured to Australian hospitals. This is particularly important where significant burns injuries have been sustained, and we thank our Defence Force and other medical staff for their dedication and skill. </para><para>These attacks did not occur in Australia, but they did occur on our doorstep—they did occur in one of Australia's best loved tourist destinations: Bali. The impact will be felt not only by Australians but also by the people of Bali and Indonesia. The current assessment by both Australian and Indonesian officials is that a terrorist organisation carried out this horrific crime. We still do not know whether these bomb blasts can be linked to the al-Qaeda network, nor can it be confirmed whether the Indonesian terrorist group that has links to al-Qaeda, the Jemaah Islamiah— whose spiritual leader is the radical cleric Abu Bakar Bashir—committed these crimes. What we do know, and what is on the public record, is that in recent times the Jemaah Islamiah terrorist organisation has planned bomb attacks in the South-East Asian region that have specifically targeted Western countries, including Australia.</para><para>Last January, local authorities in Singapore arrested 13 members of the Jemaah Islamiah who were planning to bomb the Australian, British, American and Israeli embassies or high commissions in Singapore. Another 21 suspects were arrested last month in Singapore. They were also linked to the plan to bomb a number of Western targets in Singapore. Those arrested included members of the Jemaah Islamiah group. Recently the United States has warned that South-East Asia now has the world's highest concentration of al-Qaeda outside Afghanistan and Pakistan. This is not a new phenomenon. For many years concerns have been raised about minority extremist groups in South-East Asia, including the Jemaah Islamiah.</para><para>Whoever turns out to be identified as the culprit of this terrible crime in Bali, the attacks have indicated the need to continue the fight against terrorism, particularly in the South-East Asian region. Yesterday's bomb attack is thought to be the worst terrorist crime in Indonesia's history. It is certainly the worst ever terrorist event in respect of the number of Australians killed. The victims of this terrible crime were enjoying a holiday, spending time with friends, celebrating the end of a football season. Overwhelmingly they are young men and women—tourists from many parts of the world, not only Australia but Singapore, Britain, France, the Netherlands, Germany, Ecuador and America. So many innocent lives have been lost because of these appalling crimes; so many others have been injured, some with severe burns.</para><para>On September 11 last year we were all deeply affected by the horrific loss of life from that premeditated and cowardly terrorist attack in New York and Washington DC. The victims of that attack were also not just Americans. As we said at the time, it was not just an attack on New York or the United States of America but also an attack on freedom and democratic values everywhere in the world. The bomb attacks in Bali are not just an attack on Bali or Indonesia but an attack on many nations, including ours. The bombing in Bali is the worst terrorist attack, in respect of numbers of victims, to have occurred since September 11. It has brought home to Australians how vulnerable we are and how important it is to fight the people who have perpetrated these crimes.</para><para>We welcome the Prime Minister's decision to conduct a wide-ranging national security review. We also welcome the government's assistance to Indonesia, medical help for the victims and offer of ASIO and AFP agents to assist with investigations. We thank the ADF, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and all those from other agencies for their efforts to get many injured Australians back to hospitals in Australia for medical treatment. We welcome the Prime Minister's call for greater cooperation in the region to combat terrorism. We also welcome the assistance the Australian government has offered Indonesia to help them fight terrorism. Australians must respond to this tragedy in a united way. We must work closely with our neighbours in Indonesia. We must work closely with the intelligence-gathering authorities in Indonesia and around the world to stamp out terrorist cells.</para><para>This attack brings home the terrible fragility of human life. Let us make no mistake: it was designed to do just that. These murders, deliberately directed against civilians, were intended to frighten as much as to kill. They were intended to enrage, to heighten tension and to provoke more violence, and of course fear and anger are the weapons of terrorists as surely as are explosives, guns and knives. Fear and anger will never prove effective weapons against the Australian people. We can and we will pursue those who use terror as a tactic; we can and we will discover those who are responsible for this crime and bring them to justice in a court of law. But we should not act rashly. We now have strong and balanced laws to deal with terrorists and terrorist organisations, and I am certain the Australian people will want to see us use those laws to respond to the outrage in Bali. </para><para>It is important that we be clear and clear-headed in our response to this horrendous attack. First, we must work more closely with Indonesia to find and punish the perpetrators. As I said, we welcome the news that both AFP and ASIO officers have gone to Bali to assist the Indonesians with their investigation. That is an appropriate first step, but we will need to do more. Second, we must have the best possible intelligence about terrorists and their operations. Intelligence is the key to prevention. We must have clear and effective lines of communication between our security intelligence agencies and agencies in all South-East Asian countries. ASIO and other Australian agencies have already received increased funding for this purpose, but more work may be needed to make sure that everything that can be done is being done. Third, we need to build stronger regional links to defeat terrorism. Singapore, Malaysia and Thailand have already taken many positive steps since September 11 last year to clamp down on Islamic extremists. We support the fact that the Australian government has signed a number of antiterrorism agreements with these regional countries, but regional coordination of antiterrorism activities remains underresourced and less than fully effective. Finally, and most importantly, we must redouble our efforts to strengthen the international coalition against terrorism. Terrorism is now the major threat to international peace and stability. The coalition that was built after September 11 needs to regather and refocus its attention. We must bring the same resolve and determination which motivated the formation of that coalition to meet the terrorist threat in South-East Asia.</para><para>When Australians have faced threats to our security in the past, those qualities that Australia and its people possess—resolution, determination, courage and compassion— have come to the fore. In this adversity, we must do the same.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:25:00</time.stamp><page.no>5085</page.no><name role="metadata">Boswell, Sen Ron</name><name role="display">Senator BOSWELL</name><name.id>YE4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>NP</party><role>Leader of the National Party of Australia in the Senate and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister for Transport and Regional Services</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the National Party, I rise to support the motion today in relation to the horrendous attack in Bali late on Saturday night. I extend my sympathy to all Australians who have lost loved ones and those who are presently experiencing the uncertainty of not knowing the whereabouts and condition of their relatives. Our thoughts also go to those who have been injured in the attack and who are receiving medical attention either on their return to Australia or in Indonesia. We also remember the people who have gone through this horrendous experience and are now dealing with their own thoughts, of what was asked of them and of their personal escape from injury. It seems that there were many acts of heroism, unselfishness and assistance throughout this terrible mayhem. Great assistance was given to fellow sufferers. We also remember all the victims from New Zealand, Britain, France, Germany, as well as the Indonesian people themselves who have suffered so dreadfully through this callous act of cruelty and destruction.</para></talk.start><para>We hear the news with the heaviest of heart. Of the terrible death toll of 180, 14 Australians have been identified among the dead and one Australian died in transit from Denpasar. The news is that 110 Australians have been injured, with a further 220 unaccounted for at this stage. This figure should not be confused with the Australian death toll, which is unlikely to be known within the next 48 hours. This suffering has affected so many Australians. Yesterday, on my return home, I received a call from one of the Kingsley football team's families, who had been trying to access the help number unsuccessfully. I requested the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to respond to the family directly, which they did. Unfortunately, they could only advise that their son was missing and, after inquiries, is still missing today. When I put the phone down, the enormity of this attack, this crazy act of violence, came home to me. This act of violence has been inflicted on Australia's young people; this has been a senseless killing, maiming and injuring of Australia's youngest men and women. I believe the furthest thoughts from their minds would have been of politics, world tension or terrorism. They were just out enjoying themselves on a holiday. </para><para>I thought: this cannot happen to Australia in one of Australia's most popular holiday destinations. But the truth is that, after September 11 last year, anything can happen and it can happen anywhere around the world. Our freedom, the way of life that we have taken for granted in the Western world, is being challenged by people with completely different ideas and values. These terrorists are not concerned about their own people— many Indonesians have been killed and maimed. They do not care about the economy of their own country or their people— their livelihoods and businesses. Tourism is one of the mainstays of the Indonesian economy and will shut down. Chaos, parliamentary uncertainty and the undermining of democratically elected governments is the agenda of terrorism.</para><para>We must not let this occurrence spook us into pretending that, if we do not respond to terrorism and face the issues, somehow Australia will escape acts of violence and terrorism. Appeasement never works when you are dealing with terrorism. The act of terrorism in Bali must be a call to Australians that, since September 11, we live in a different world. We must accept that the world has changed and be prepared and vigilant, and we must commit ourselves to continuing to work against terrorism. The Australian government is doing all it can to assist in alleviating the suffering. Through the Australian defence forces, aircraft with medical teams on board are ferrying the injured to hospitals in Perth and Darwin. Qantas and Garuda have increased their numbers of flights to return Australian holiday-makers to Australia. As usual, the Australian government is doing all things possible and responding in a bipartisan way, supported by the opposition. The Prime Minister has responded on behalf of Australia. Our defence forces and medical personnel have immediately responded in their usual efficient way.</para><para>This was an horrific attack—an act of killing and maiming of innocents described by our Prime Minister as `indiscriminate, brutal and despicable'. Sadly, it was an act of terrorism in our region of the world. The Australian government is working with the Indonesian government to ensure that they find and bring to justice those responsible for this terrible act. Already officers from ASIO and the Australian Federal Police are assisting Indonesian authorities in their investigations. Our existing agreements with Indonesia on counter-terrorism provide a good framework for our work together. This horrific loss of Australian and other lives in our region brings the activities of extremist groups closer to our attention. The international community has immediately supported all Australians with good wishes and condolences and quickly condemned these acts of barbarism.</para><para>It is very fitting that we move this motion in the Senate and mark with the adjournment our respect for this senseless loss of life in Bali—for these hugely tragic events and the loss of so many innocent lives. We are outraged and we condemn this act of barbaric terrorism. We condemn those who take innocent lives and who use as their methods such despicable acts of terror and indiscriminate violence against innocent people. As the Australian government further commits to working with the Indonesian government and others to bring to justice those who are guilty of this horrendous crime and those who harbour and support them, we must firstly consider those amongst us who have suffered, and are suffering now, their own personal loss of family and friends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:33:00</time.stamp><page.no>5086</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—This is the second day of sadness stemming from the attack in Bali, and there will be many more in the weeks and months to come. Our thoughts today must be with those who are personally touched by this tragedy and, on behalf of the Australian Democrats, I offer our sincere condolences to the many Australians who have been directly affected—those who have lost loved ones and those who are grappling at the moment with the terrible uncertainty of having family members and friends unaccounted for. The Democrats also acknowledge the outstanding work currently being done by Australian service personnel, both regular and reserve, and particularly by the medical personnel. We thank the Indonesian medical personnel and other Indonesian authorities for their care for, and assistance to, Australian people in the aftermath of this disaster, as well as the many Australian volunteers in the area who have come forward to help out. We note the rapid response of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, including setting up a hotline for those seeking information. </para></talk.start><para>For now, the first priority must be getting additional medical aid to all of the victims and bringing Australian civilians home, but we will soon need to turn our attention to the security measures we need to take in our region. Rather than largely focusing on the other side of the world, we need to care more about what is happening in our neighbourhood. People of many nationalities were killed and injured in these attacks, but the blow to Australia has been significantly broad and brutal. The bombings occurred on our doorstep at a destination well known to be frequented by many Australian tourists. It is probable that the death toll will be larger than the number of Australians killed in the World Trade Centre attacks. I remind all Australians, though, that this attack on innocent holidaying civilians was not the action of a particular religious or ethnic group. It is almost certain that many Muslims were also killed in this attack. I make the plea that all Australians recognise that this is the act of violent, hate filled extremists who deserve no nationality and represent nobody but themselves. No religion should be held to blame for this attack. The attack is against the principles of Islam, of Christianity and of any religion. The people who perpetrated this attack are the ones who deserve to be, and must be, punished.</para><para>The Democrats remind the government of its responsibility to focus its diplomatic, security and peacekeeping efforts on the Asia-Pacific region. Whilst political debate in recent months has been around Australia's possible involvement in a war on Iraq, the Democrats wish to emphasise that Australia's primary responsibility is to our immediate region. We hope that Australia's responsibility to the Asia-Pacific region will be highlighted in forthcoming responses from the defence strategic review and the security review that are now being undertaken. Our military, strategic and intelligence resources are limited and, in determining how and where they are committed, we must be sensitive to our own important and unique position in this region. Indeed, the Minister for Defence recently acknowledged the substantial extent to which Australia's finite military resources are currently committed when he noted that:</para><quote><para>... our troops are more heavily engaged (than) at any time since at least Vietnam in a multitude of tasks around the world.</para></quote><para>This makes it all the more ridiculous that some of our military and financial resources are committed to the so-called Pacific solution—targeting those fleeing persecution rather than targeting terrorists who are threatening Australia's safety and security. Whilst the safety of individuals must always be a primary concern, this is not the time for Australia to be withdrawing military and intelligence personnel and resources from our immediate region—for example, withdrawing peacekeeping troops from East Timor or Indonesia.</para><para>We must work together with our neighbours, including Indonesia, to develop a coherent, coordinated strategy to address the threat of terrorism and social instability in the Asia-Pacific region. We must address the causes of terrorism, not just its devastating effects. We must honestly look at the implications of the foreign and economic policy of our nation and of other nations around the world, and whether appropriate, honest and just changes to those policies can assist in reducing some of the causes of terrorism. Australia signed a memorandum of understanding with Indonesia several months ago in which our two nations agreed to work together to combat terrorism. We do hope that this will assist the coordination of investigations into this recent attack. We acknowledge the rapid response of President Megawati of Indonesia, who visited the area yesterday, and the Democrats thank her for her commitment to act swiftly in investigating this incident. </para><para>We welcome the fact that the Australian Federal Police and ASIO are assisting Indonesian authorities. As with most attacks of terrorism, there will be difficulties and challenges associated with bringing the perpetrators of these crimes to justice; by their very nature, terrorist organisations are diffuse and stateless, and it is often very difficult for terrorist attacks to be attributed to particular individuals or even groups of individuals. We acknowledge that there will be political difficulties for President Sukarnoputri in acting decisively with respect to Indonesian organisations that harbour terrorists. Political courage is what is required at this time, and support for those who need to take these actions is important. Australia must show leadership and support in this situation, and work together with the Indonesian government and other states in our region to address the threats to the safety and security of our region. It is not just Australians who are at threat here, of course, but civilians of all the nations of our region, most of whom have far fewer resources to work with towards tackling this threat.</para><para>The Democrats take this opportunity to reaffirm our commitment to the United Nations and its vital role in promoting and protecting international peace and security through collective action. However, we recognise that, in this instance, the role of identifying the perpetrators and bringing them to justice will probably be primarily in the hands of the Indonesian and Australian governments. It is important that, following this latest tragedy, Australia once again demonstrates and reaffirms its commitment to principles of democracy, freedom, compassion and tolerance—the very principles and way of life which terrorism seeks to undermine. The Australian Democrats do not support a war against terrorism if it includes unjust actions, the undermining of international law and of basic civil liberties, or responding to violence with blind vengeance or more violence. We expect that in the coming months the debate on Australian security will—indeed, must—focus more on South-East Asia and the Pacific region and on our nation's responsibilities in that area. There will be discussion on how best we can use our limited defence and intelligence resources, and I have no doubt there will be discussion on the lack of prudence in the earlier use of inflammatory language around the war on terrorism. This is a time for measured and considered language.</para><para>It is probably a coincidence that this attack has occurred one year, one month and one day after the September 11 attacks. The most obvious similarity is that the attack was targeted at civilians. Over many years, thousands if not millions of Australians have enjoyed the hospitality of the Balinese. Bali was first established as a popular tourist destination by Australian surfers, and today it is very common for sporting clubs to travel there at the end of the season. I believe that this weekend alone there were around 20,000 Australian tourists there. Because of its geography, a large number of Western Australians in particular were in Bali, and the Democrats Western Australian senators, Senator Murray and Senator Greig, have asked me to make special mention of the community impact this will have on a smaller capital city like Perth. Having said that, we recognise that in those Bali clubs there were people from all over this country and from many other countries around the globe. As well, of course, Indonesians in the region have been hurt by this, and many more will be hurt by the no doubt devastating effect it will have on the local economy there.</para><para>We will remember those people. We will remember them not only as victims of a vicious, indiscriminate attack that occurred without warning, but as they were: loved members of families, sons and daughters, partners and parents; many with their team mates celebrating sporting successes—all of them having fun. Many were young and all were innocents. Our thoughts and hearts go out to them and their loved ones. Our resolve is firm on assisting to bring those responsible to justice, and on doing whatever is just and right that will help prevent such terrible crimes from occurring in the future. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>5089</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the Senate for allowing me five minutes to associate myself with the remarks made by previous speakers in offering our deepest sympathy not only to the Australian families whose members have died or have been seriously injured but to families from all nations. We are part of humanity and at this time of suffering we share that grief together. We are all shocked by the occurrences of the last 48 hours and by this barbaric, cowardly attack. We now have to consider what our response will be. It is easy, but futile, for us to crawl back into our shell and adopt an isolationist policy and for people within Australia to shun anything Indonesian. If nothing else, the last 48 hours have proven to us how close this near neighbour of ours is to our shore. We need now to look to the future. </para></talk.start><para>We are grateful for the work that has already been done and for the response that has been made by not only the government and the opposition but all members of the parliament. We thank the Defence Force, the medical personnel, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the AFP, ASIO and a whole host of other people who, at the drop of a hat, have gone to assist in this area. I believe we do have an opportunity to reaffirm our commitment, our friendship and our cooperation with Indonesia. I would like to see this opportunity seized on with the announcement of a further package of cooperation with Indonesia in the area of security—which has been agreed—in the areas of poverty reduction, basic health and education and in a strengthening of business and institutional ties between Australia and Indonesia. We need to realise that Australians should make contact personally with the Indonesian people. Of course, to do that, it is important that we are able to communicate in their language—Bahasa Indonesia, for example—and out of all of this I would like to see an emphasis on language: for example, government support in schools for not only the restoration of the National Asian Languages Program but also its enhancement so far as Indonesia is concerned. </para><para>Whilst we are mourning our dead and injured, we also express our grief and sympathy for the families of those Indonesians who died or who were injured. This evil act has brought suffering to the Indonesian people in general, as it has brought suffering to us in general. We should resolve now to ensure that that shared suffering will mean a deeper and closer relationship with our near neighbour.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:47:00</time.stamp><page.no>5089</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator BROWN</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I join in supporting the motion moved by the Leader of the Government in the Senate, Senator Hill. On behalf of Senator Nettle and the Australian Greens, I express our utter horror at this monstrous and cowardly act of terrorism which has killed or injured 400 innocent people in Bali. Behind the bomb blast is a hate and destructiveness which can be given no quarter in human society and which has no part in our global community of the 21st century. Our hearts and our deepest sympathy and empathy go out to those who are injured and who are suffering unthinkable agony as a result of the blasts. So many so young with so much life in front of them have been cut down by this murderous act. </para></talk.start><para>Our hearts also go out to the thousands of Australians, Indonesians, New Zealanders, Europeans, Americans and Filipinos and to people from so many other countries who are today waiting in dread for news of their loved ones in Bali. In a world where border fences are lower than ever before, this hideous act of inhumane violence in Bali finds Australia and Indonesia bound not just as victims but also in the urgent task of aiding all those victims and tracking down the criminals who are responsible. The Greens support 100 per cent the Howard government's emergency response to the disaster and are united with all others in this national parliament in our grief and our wish to help the victims in every way possible as soon as possible. It will take a very long time for the wound that Australians have suffered in Bali to begin to heal.  </para><para>We as a nation want to help in that process to our utmost, and we will. In the process, it is important that the pluralism of viewpoints which we value so highly in our nation will be encouraged and not discouraged, as we also look to a long-term view of finding peace and security in our region and in the world. While terrorism must be tackled as a priority, for we are ineluctably in a new period of terrorism, this must not be at the expense of our democratic society; our freedoms, which have endured two world wars, or our growing place as an independent nation with the ability to help lead the world to a fairer, more secure future—and that means all of the world. Not least in our global outreach, let Australia concentrate on civil rather than on military engagement necessary to find that peace and security. The last six words of this motion which say that we reaffirm Australia's commitment to the war against terrorism in the rest of the world do not include the potential for Australian involvement in an attack on Baghdad, with all the consequent loss of innocent lives that would entail. It is much better that the billions of dollars that would cost go instead to aid and building strong bridges with our neighbours, in particular with Indonesia. </para><para>Rather, the Greens want to see Australia helping to close the gap between rich and poor in this world, between the haves and the have-nots and between the powerful and the powerless people of the world. We are all equal human beings on this planet. If there is any good to come from this awful moment, let it be our long-range commitment to encourage and bolster those in Indonesia, the vast majority of our neighbours, who want the prospect of more democracy and more opportunity—Australian levels of opportunity—for their children and their future. In this is the key to securing our own children's security and future.</para><para>As Mahatma Gandhi observed, the world has enough for everyone's need but not for everyone's greed. A sharing world without need will be a world where terrorism is starved of much of its ill-conceived motivation. Let us aspire in this terrible hour to such a world. Our thoughts are with the thousands of people suffering so much today. We stand with our fellow senators, helpless in undoing this tragedy, heartfelt for its victims and hopeful, indeed determined, that we can contribute to a less violent tomorrow.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>5090</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to concur with the message of condolence moved by the government. Today parliament pauses to reflect upon a shocking national tragedy. The two explosions that occurred in Bali, Indonesia, at the Sari nightclub and near the US consulate, have killed more than 187 people. So far it has been confirmed that 14 Australians have died in the bombings and 40 were injured, 15 seriously. My deepest condolences go to the families and friends of the Australians who were murdered in this act of terror. My heartfelt sympathies also go to the families and friends in Indonesia and the citizens of other countries who have been killed or injured. I want to commend Australia's immediate response to this terrible tragedy and the Australian military, non-government organisations, businesses and those from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Federal Police and ASIO who have so swiftly provided assistance to those affected by this event. As always, Australians can be relied upon to help their mates in times of crisis and need. I also note that Australia is extremely grateful for the tremendous outpouring of support from international communities.</para></talk.start><para>Regrettably, we cannot say that this attack is a complete surprise. There have been several warnings about terrorism in our region from US officials and the intelligence community. The US Ambassador to Australia, Mr Thomas Schieffer, warned Australia not to be complacent in the war against terrorism, saying that Canberra is on al-Qaeda's hit list. Late last week we were warned that our oil refineries and power stations may also be at risk. I also recall the comments of Kurt Campbell, from the Centre for Strategic and International Studies, who said that Australia should follow developments in Indonesia and ensure that we do not exacerbate already rising fundamentalist calls. With US forces still engaged in Afghanistan and preparing for action in Iraq, Washington clearly wants Australia to take the antiterrorism lead in South-East Asia. </para><para>We have all been touched by the graphic and sometimes undignified pictures brought to us by the media: shots of body bags, bodies totally blown apart lying in the streets outside nightclubs and even bodies lying uncovered in a morgue. These are inappropriate because they intrude upon the privacy of the relatives of the parties who are shown in those scenes. With the Bali attack, there have been renewed calls for Australia and other nations to help stamp out terrorism on Indonesian soil. But amongst this bloodshed and death we should pause to consider the ramifications of retaliatory action. I would like to remind senators of a passage from Romans 3 where Paul, in writing to the church in Rome, says the following:</para><quote><para>I shall be condemned as a sinner. Why not then say, “Let us do evil so that good may come.” Some people indeed have insulted me by accusing me of saying this very thing. They will be condemned, as they should be.</para></quote><para>Paul is clearly saying there that you cannot carry out an evil act and purport that good will come from it. Ambitions aside, Australia may be ill prepared to face its most formidable challenge—that is, terrorism in our region. This situation demands cool heads and rational planning and the perpetrators must be brought to justice. But do we want to bring home more direct action to Australia? Recent demonstrations in Australia have called for peace—a reflection that many members of our community have a deeper longing to be a force for good in the world.</para><para>One Nation supports paragraphs (a) to (e) of Senator Hill's motion. In relation to paragraph (f), One Nation believes that Australia's commitment to continue the war against terrorism in our region and in the rest of the world should be put to a referendum of the Australian people before the government makes that commitment. Today many of us voice copious prayers as we watch the gruesome scenes in Bali unfold. We offer prayers for peace as plans are made for war. We must not allow violence to undermine our faith in our freedom or death to sew fear and hatred. As people of faith, of whatever religious tradition, we honour the victims of this terrible tragedy and pray that we will have the courage and strength to make this a better world.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:00:00</time.stamp><page.no>5091</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I thank the Senate for the opportunity to support this motion this afternoon. It is most appropriate that we pause at this time to remember all of those affected by this barbarous attack in Indonesia and in particular that we extend condolences to the families and friends of those who have already been identified as amongst those who have been killed. In particular now we must support those who have been critically injured and support the families and friends of those who are waiting for news of loved ones or of team-mates, who they know are somewhere in Bali but still have not been in touch with those at home and, in many cases, unfortunately are presumed to be either amongst those critically injured or dead. </para></talk.start><para>As a South Australian senator, I want to particularly support those South Australians waiting for news—we know there are some South Australians missing; as yet, none have been confirmed dead—but also to congratulate the South Australian government on its very quick action in chartering two Lear jets to take medical teams north. They have already brought patients back to the burns unit of the Royal Adelaide Hospital. I understand that this will be continuing and that similar action will be happening interstate.</para><para>Our thoughts today must be with the survivors and the families of the survivors of this horrific attack on innocent holiday-makers in a place that tens of thousands of Australians every year have presumed is safe—a place for happy times and a place to relax. We are very lucky to have the medical expertise to deal here with those who have been severely injured, particularly those who have been severely burnt. Our thoughts today are also with the medical teams and the many volunteers that are helping on the ground in Bali, as well as now in Darwin hospitals and hospitals in other parts of Australia. We congratulate them on their dedication.</para><para>As time goes by, we must remember that those affected by this tragedy will be traumatised in an ongoing and permanent way. Their lives will be changed forever. Those who have survived will need ongoing counselling and support as they remember this time. It is a time that, for many of them, will probably redirect the road they take in the years to come. On the positive side, it is also a time to congratulate the efforts already being put in by ASIO and the AFP. We hope that their efforts will lead us, in a very short space of time, to understand who has done this and why on earth this has been done by these fanatics. We must caution, however, that we do not jump to conclusions, that we wait to see exactly who is responsible, and then pursue them with the full force of the appropriate laws. </para><para>In closing, I want to say that we must avoid using this atrocity as a reason for upping any consideration of Australia's involvement in direct actions in Iraq. We must work internationally to reduce the risk of international terrorism. We must work to be one of those countries actively trying to reduce inequality and poverty. We will not ever reduce terrorism by terrorising an entire country. Indeed, if we do attack Iraq with the US, those with a passion for death and destruction—the sorts of people who have been involved in this incident—will only have another cause to rail against and to try andattract further support for their terrorist activities. While fully supporting Australia's efforts against horrific acts and terrorists who would perpetrate acts such as this, I say very strongly that we must not go ahead with any attack on Iraq, which would basically mean terrorising an entire nation.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—All honourable senators will have constituents affected by the awful events in Bali.

The CCG considered complex issues concerning possible prohibitions on age discrimination, as well as necessary exemptions. The CCG considered existing anti-discrimination laws, issues raised in the consultations to date, and the range of areas of public life that the legislation might cover. The CCG also considered the role the Human Rights and Equal Opportunity Commission might play in administering the legislation, including education and awareness-raising, complaint-handling, and policy development.</para><para>The CCG established Working Groups on Superannuation, Insurance and Financial Services, Health and Medical Services, Employment, Training and Unpaid Work, Children and Youth, and Commonwealth Laws and Programs not covered in the other Working Groups to discuss these issues in detail. The Working Groups met throughout September 2002.</para><para>The next stage of this process will be a second plenary meeting of the CCG on 9 October 2002 in Canberra. At that meeting, the CCG will discuss an information paper setting out detailed proposals for the age discrimination legislation. The proposals in the information paper will build on the extensive consultation on this proposed new legislation. It is expected that the Government will consider the CCG's proposal before the end of 2002.</para><para>(2)	The states in which the members of the Core Consultative Group currently reside are

the Government to consider. As noted in the answer to part 1 of this Question on Notice, the second plenary meeting of the CCG will be held on 9 October 2002. At that meeting, the CCG will consider an information paper on age discrimination reforms. I expect to bring a submission to Government based on the CCG's proposals before the end of 2002. After the Government receives the CCG's proposals, the Government will consider the next steps in this process of developing the age discrimination legislation.  </para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Reviews</title><page.no>5106</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 591)</subtitle><id.no>591</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5106</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Defence, upon notice, on 28 August 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	With reference to the Defence Management Audit Branch, what were the Top Management Directed Reviews conducted by this branch for each of the following financial years: (a) 1999-2000; (b) 2000-01; and (c) 2001-02.</para><para>(2)	For each review, can the following details be provided: (a) the nature and scope of the review; (b) the days allocated to the review; and (c) who directed the review.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5106</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Top management directed reviews often comprise audit investigations into allegations or complaints against individual officers or work areas. It is in the interest of good governance that Defence has an effective internal mechanism to conduct such reviews. It is important that such reviews provide objective and frank findings based on all available material and interviews with relevant officers. The value of such reviews is likely to be reduced if audit techniques and procedures are revealed, and if those involved know that information supplied is likely to become the subject of public debate. I am, therefore, not prepared to risk lessening the effectiveness of the internal review function by providing the information requested.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health: Bulk-Billing</title><page.no>5106</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 593)</subtitle><id.no>593</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5106</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Health and Ageing, upon notice, on 29 August 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	What is the electorate-by-electorate breakdown (ie. by federal electorate division) of the percentage for unreferred attendances bulk billed for the 12 months ending: (a) 30 June 2000; (b) 30 June 2001; and (c) 30 June 2002 (period of processing).</para><para>(2)	What is the electorate-by-electorate breakdown of the number of unreferred attendances bulk billed for the 12 months ending: (a) 30 June 2000; (b) 30 June 2001; and (c) 30 June 2002 (period of processing).</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5106</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator Patterson</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1) and (2)	The percentage and number of unreferred attendances bulk-billed, by federal electorate division, for the 12 months ending: (a) 30 June 2000; (b) 30 June 2001; and (c) 30 June 2002 (period of processing) is detailed in the following table:

Data on the number of food retail businesses are not available.</para><para>(3)	KPMG Consulting and the Allen Consulting Group estimated the cost of percentage ingredient labelling and the Nutrition Information Panel.</para><para>KPMG Consulting estimated the cost to industry in Australia and New Zealand to be $394 million to implement these, with a further $55 million per year in ongoing costs. On the basis of the number of stock keeping units likely to be affected in Australia of 100,000 the cost estimates for Australian industry would be $219 million to implement and $31 million per year ongoing costs.</para><para>The Allen Consulting Group estimated the cost to industry of implementing the new requirements to be $100 million, but did not have data to independently measure the extent of ongoing costs.</para><para>(4)	Yes.</para><para>(5)	The Code is enforced under the State and Territory and New Zealand Food Acts. The penalties that may apply will vary according to the specific State or Territory legislation.</para><para>The Imported Food Control Act 1992 requires imported food products to meet the requirements of the Code. The maximum penalty for importation of food that does not meet the relevant standard is 10 years imprisonment, or $66,000 in the case of an individual and $330,000 in the case of a corporation.  </para><para>(6)	Yes, depending on the circumstances.</para><para>(7)	The Code is enforced by the States and Territories under State and Territory Food Acts. Imported foods are covered under the Imported Food Control Act 1992 which is enforced by AQIS.</para><para>(8)	(a)	The formal review of nutrition labelling commenced in December 1997 and pursuant to the Australia New Zealand Food Authority Act 1991, a minimum of two rounds of public consultation were undertaken during the review. The draft joint Code was released on the ANZFA website for public consultation between March and May 2000. Additional and extensive consultations were held with industry during that period. </para><para>	(b)	During the review of labelling requirements, consultation occurred through public notification in newspapers and through distribution of information circulars and requests for comments as well as through many meetings with industry bodies and individual businesses. The final draft Code was widely circulated to industry for comment in 2000 before Ministers on the Australia New Zealand Food Standards Council agreed to adopt mandatory nutrition information requirements at a meeting on 24 November 2000. A communiqué was widely circulated to media and other stakeholders on that date.</para><para>(9)	Prior to the adoption of the joint Code, ANZFA established a communication and implementation strategy for nutrition labelling and other aspects of the new Code. Since Ministers agreed to the new Code in November 2000, ANZFA has deployed the following strategies to assist industry during the two year transition to the new requirements:</para><para>	-	a local call cost phone/email industry advice line was established in January 2001. Initially, the advice line handled approximately 60 inquiries per day, and currently it handles approximately 100 inquiries per day;</para><para>	-	a set of 12 comprehensive interpretive User Guides and numerous fact sheets were provided free on the Food Standards Australia New Zealand (FSANZ) web site. This includes a guide to nutrition information labelling;</para><para>	-	a nutrition panel calculator that incorporates over 2000 food ingredients and enables development of nutrition information labels in the mandatory format for the majority of foods was also provided free on the FSANZ web site and was launched in November 2001;</para><para>	-	a comprehensive training package and seminars for industry and jurisdictional health officers was delivered throughout 2001 and 2002 mainly in conjunction with State and Territory enforcement bodies; and</para><para>	-	in 2002 as the end of the transition approaches, FSANZ has issued reminders of the need for industry to address the required labelling changes through numerous media releases, distribution of information circulars and brochures to stakeholders (including all local councils in Australia), and through presentations at key conferences, in particular to industry associations.</para><para>(10)	The evidence on lives saved was compiled from two sources of data on diet-related disease:</para><para>·	The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare (1999), The burden of disease and injury in Australia; and</para><para>·	The New Zealand Ministry of Health (1999), Our Health, Our Future - The Health of New Zealanders.</para><para>These publications measure the burden of disease on the respective populations of Australia and New Zealand. Diet-related risk factors were identified and measured in terms of mortality. To help avoid over-estimation, the risk factors were halved for the purposes of this calculation.</para><para>The analysis of the potential impact on public health due to the change from voluntary to mandatory nutrition labelling was based on a scientific study reported in the Journal of Law &amp; Economics, October 2000 by Alan Mathios; The impact of mandatory disclosure laws on product choices: an analysis of the salad dressing market. This study examined consumer purchasing behaviour of benchmark products before and after the introduction of mandatory nutrition labelling in the United States (US), and observed that after nutrition labelling became mandatory, there was a fall in the market share of the least healthy products. On the assumption that the US experience is relevant to Australia and New Zealand, results of the US study were then used to estimate the impact of the introduction of mandatory nutrition labelling in Australia and New Zealand. </para><para>(11)	An industry association submission made to FSANZ earlier this year claimed that figures obtained from a range of companies expressed the view that 98.5 % of their food labels would comply with all the new labelling provisions of the Code by 20 December 2002.</para><para>At a recent industry conference on food labelling it was reported by Ron Cossen, Director of Ronald L Cossen and Associates, that 61% of companies represented at the conference will be `ready' and the remaining 39% will be `almost ready' on 20 December this year. These figures were based on responses to a questionnaire distributed to, and completed by, conference delegates. </para><para>Recent qualitative research undertaken by FSANZ with stakeholders indicates that larger sized manufacturers are well informed about the labelling changes and have made significant progress in changing labels. However there were concerns about the awareness of small manufacturers about the new labelling requirements and their capacity to implement changes by the end of the transition period.</para><para>Transitional `stock-in-trade amendments' were made to the Code in June this year. Those amendments permit food products manufactured and packaged under the old requirements prior to 20 December 2002 to be sold up to 20 December 2003, in the case of short shelf life foods (i.e. less than 12 months). For long shelf life foods (i.e. greater than 12 months) foods manufactured and packaged prior to 20 December 2002 will be allowed to be sold until 20 December 2004.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport: Bass Strait Vehicle Equalisation Scheme</title><page.no>5112</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 599)</subtitle><id.no>599</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>5112</page.no><name role="metadata">Brown, Sen Bob</name><name role="display">Senator Brown</name><name.id>QD4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 29 August 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to Senator Brown's question on notice no. 573, notice of which was given on 21 August 2002, in relation to fees charged for bicycles on Bass Strait ferries: Why is a $6 charge to remain in the peak season?</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>5112</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>A $21 year round rebate for bicycles was introduced to allow bicycles to travel for free, as do some cars, motorhomes and caravans, in TT-Line's low and shoulder season.
