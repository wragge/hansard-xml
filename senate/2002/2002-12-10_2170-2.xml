I know she has a personal as well as a professional interest in the drought. Her family in the southern highlands is, like many other families on the land, experiencing real difficulties as a result of the very dry conditions. The federal government's $1.2 billion package will help alleviate some of the more disastrous impacts of the drought and will allow farmers to replant when the drought eventually breaks. The package will also allow farmers to keep breeding stock alive in these very difficult periods so that, again, when things return to normal, breeding stock will be there to lead the charge back to a profitable rural Australia.</para></talk.start><para>Money can never compensate for the effects of the drought, but the Commonwealth's $1.2 billion dollars will go a long way towards helping out.

I was pleased to see that Premier Peter Beattie, the Labor Premier of Queensland, has actually congratulated Mr Howard on his new drought package. Senators will be aware that the package consists of an extra $368 million, on top of the $360 million previously announced and the $400-plus million forgone in revenue that the Commonwealth did without to prop up the farm deposit scheme. Senators will also know that the new package announced by the Prime Minister includes an income subsidy for those affected farmers—an interest rate subsidy of five per cent or 50 per cent of what they have currently been paying. Of course, it is interesting to note that, generally speaking, the interest rates in the economy these days are what the interest rates would have been back in Labor's days with the 50 per cent subsidy. That is how interest rates have fallen. That has helped with the overall ability of farmers to see this drought through. So there is that interest rate package there. </para><para>Where more than 80 per cent of the farmers in a particular state are in the drought deficiency category, the whole state will automatically be declared for relief. The criterion for this is a rain deficiency of one in 20 years over the nine months between March and November of this year. Even though some farmers do not fall into that category, they may be eligible for relief if the normal exceptional circumstances situation applies. But for the normal exceptional circumstances to apply the state governments have to put in the application. In Victoria we have not had one application to date for exceptional circumstances, and in my own home state of Queensland there has only been one application so far. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></answer></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>DISTINGUISHED VISITORS</title><type>Distinguished Visitors</type><page.no>7534</page.no></debateinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>10000</name.id><name role="metadata">DEPUTY PRESIDENT, The</name><name role="display">The DEPUTY PRESIDENT</name></talker><para>—Order!

As my Liberal Western Australian colleagues would be especially aware, for some weeks now the government has been stating that changes to the industrial and workplace relations laws in Western Australia will have a devastating impact on Western Australian small businesses. The first concrete test of this was the recent Yellow Pages business index survey.</para></talk.start><para>I was saddened but not surprised to read the headline `Small business unhappy' in the <inline font-style="italic">West Australian </inline>newspaper story about the survey. According to that report, more than one-third of small businesses owned in Western Australia say that the state Labor government is working against them. Only 13 per cent of respondents in the Yellow Pages survey said the state Labor government was supportive. That is even lower than Mr Crean's approval rating! Thirty-nine per cent said the state government worked against them. This is in stark contrast to the federal government, where the results show that small business support for federal government policy has in fact improved by five per cent. Small businesses are saying that the major reasons for the increase in small- and medium-enterprise support for the federal government are its policies and that it is trying to help small business. That is exactly what we are trying to do with our attempts to repeal Labor's unfair dismissal laws and our attempts to protect small business from secondary boycott.</para><para>Labor have continually said that their industrial relations reforms would have no impact on small business. Well, let us hear from the small businesses. A recent article said:</para><quote><para>Emily's Country Kitchen is closing this month and Cafe Sails only opens during weekdays ... Dylans is preparing to by-pass the changes by using the Federal Australian Workplace Agreements, and Beachside Cafe pre-empted the changes and now predominantly employ staff as contract workers.</para></quote><para>We have four small businesses, all prepared to have their names identified, saying the Western Australian Labor Party's industrial relations laws are costing jobs.</para><para>Jean-Claude, who operates a small business in Subiaco, is reported as saying that the new industrial relations laws meant his staff were now covered by three awards instead of one. So, when the Labor Party talks about red tape, all they need to do is look in the mirror to see what they have done in Western Australia, where small business workers are now covered by three awards instead of one. The report goes on to say:</para><quote><para>No amount of juggling the roster could avoid heavy penalty rates for overtime and weekend work ... Chez Jean-Claude opened in 1997 with a staff of four. Now 42 people work there.</para></quote><para>It also says that customers have been told that prices would rise 15 per cent because of the higher costs. If you want to know what the Labor Party does for small business, look no further than Western Australia. Small businesses are closing; small businesses are sacking people. Labor's anti small business policies are really antijob policies. Our small business policies are projob policies, and that is why we support small business.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Defence: Budget</title><page.no>7535</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:14:00</time.stamp><page.no>7535</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister for Defence.

For example, we have seen a substantial reduction in local production in Canada, despite the fact that they have had a very generous film offset scheme which is designed to attract a lot of the runaway production from Hollywood, and California more broadly. I think our industry has stood up remarkably well. The other point that is worth making is that one should not simply regard Australian films—films about Australia by Australians—as the sole determinant of the success or prosperity of the Australian film industry. The whole reason that state governments have supported the Warner Bros facility on the Gold Coast or the Fox Studios in New South Wales, and why Mr Bracks has been playing lip-service to the need to provide funding for a third film production facility in the Docklands, is that an industry in this country that is not solely dependent upon Australian producers and Australian directors but that can accommodate the world's best is a much healthier industry because it provides a lot more opportunities for employment for up-and-coming artists, producers, film crews and all of those who very much appreciate the benefits of a wider, export focused industry.</para><para>What we have seen in this country in recent years is that we have been able to improve on both fronts. Certainly we are very popular by world standards, and places like Ireland have done their best to try to undercut us. But our film offset announcement of September 2001, together with the $93 million that we provided for the film industry, very much addressed the needs of all the local film bodies and received an overwhelmingly positive reception because it did hit all the right buttons. So the government is entitled to be proud of what it is doing to support the industry. But ultimately, of course, it depends very much upon the creativity and the skills of those in a sector which is notoriously cyclical. So you cannot expect to be world's best every year but I think we are doing pretty well.</para></answer><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>7537</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Mr Deputy President, I ask a supplementary question.

The industry is a very substantial one, not just in respect of the production sector but also in terms of the postproduction sector. We are world's best practice: a lot of Hollywood studios use our postproduction sector here, and we are trying to find ways of providing more opportunities for them to aggregate demand and get some of that broadband traffic across the Pacific so that we can provide even more services.

That, in my terms, is a substantial increase, not a reduction as suggested by the honourable senator, and the result across the three services will be a significantly improved capability at the end of that period. Even in the 12 months that I have been in the job, cabinet has approved some $2.5 billion of acquisition projects that were within the Defence Capability Plan set out in the year 2000 but which of course need to be approved on a project-by-project basis when they reach the acquisition stage. I hope that puts the honourable senator's mind at rest.

These questions or similar questions were asked by the honourable senator in the estimates committee and what was explained to him at that time is that the funding is ramped up over the period of 10 years. Basically, the program is put in place to achieve a certain enhanced outcome by the end of 10 years and, as the projects develop and the acquisitions take place, funding is ramped up. If we take, for example, the possible purchase of the joint strike fighter, we have committed at this stage to the design and development phase some $300 million. If the government ultimately goes to acquisition, it could be out to $12 billion. Naturally, there is a stepping up process as these projects develop, and if the honourable senator looks at it in that light he will see how wrong he is.</para></talk.start></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title> Environment: Water Management</title><page.no>7538</page.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>14:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>7538</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—My question is to Senator Hill, the Minister representing the Minister for the Environment and Heritage.

It is an issue of needing to claw back what is necessary to sustain the health of the natural systems. That is obviously much more complicated. On the issue of a national system, our approach has been through the previous COAG direction to seek consistency across the nation, although not to dictate one national scheme.

We have put $151 million, for example, into the National Museum—on time, on budget. Again, it is very good value for money in terms of a new structure. You might remember that this was the same National Museum that Labor went to the 1993 election promising to build and, as soon as they got into government, what did Mr Keating say? He said it was a mausoleum on the banks of Burley Griffin and he was not interested. That was par for the course; we all knew that. Whatever it takes to get there but, once you get there, who cares? We used the $1 billion Federation Fund for some very important capital contributions to the National Gallery of Victoria; to a number of regional art galleries around Victoria; to the National Portrait Gallery, into which we breathed new life; and to the National Institute of Circus Arts, which has been established. So it is a pretty impressive track record.

So they did, for Creative Nation, which turned out to be more about multimedia and Mr Keating's indulgences than about anything to do with delivering to the arts community. Do you remember the Keatings—$700,000 to the Keating family's personal pianist?

The ships are designed to increase their capability, particularly in relation to air defence, and to operate up until the introduction of a new air defence destroyer.

That is an emotive term. It does have Dickensian overtones. Clearly no-one wants to see child exploitation or children being in danger in the workplace, but there is often a hidden agenda in these sorts of issues. The hidden agenda is really quite a simple one: it is the unions who want to see their members paid full adult wages, and they very much dislike young people earning a bit of income on the side, which can often assist them—</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Opposition senators interjecting</inline>—</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LD4</name.id><name role="display">Senator ALSTON</name></talker><para>—I know that you have to cluck; that is the party line, isn't it?

Mr Beattie also pays lip-service to this concern that the ACTU is expressing: `We also share concerns that excessive work hours may be interfering with the education of some young people.' As we know, some young people are getting real-life experience as well as useful money to support them for entertainment and for any other purposes.</para></talk.start></continue><para>I have to say that I was very impressed with Senator Murray's comment when he went to the ACTU executive to talk to them about this very serious issue. As I recall, he said something like, `It's like attending a meeting of alcoholics who are all sitting around a table arguing about the severity of the drink problem.' Of course, when you ask anyone on the ACTU executive, `Who actually works a 38-hour week?' none of them do by a country mile. They are all in there working as long as it takes to get the numbers to be able to ensure that they get into the Senate in due course when this lot have had enough. These guys are working flat out and, if you told them that 38 hours was enough and they had to go home, they would say, `No way. Once I get into the Senate I am happy to work 38 hours or less, but until I get that meal ticket I will be working very hard indeed.' So we understand the sort of duplicity that is involved in these sorts of calls. I think that Senator Murray got it absolutely right. It is really a cover for paying more overtime for doing precisely the same amount of work. That is really what it is about. </para><para>So whilst I think one has to be very genuinely concerned to ensure that there is no exploitation or lack of safety in the workplace, particularly for young children, one also has to acknowledge that, if you asked the young children themselves, they would probably say that, by and large, they were very happy, thank you, in having the opportunity to gain that employment. They would probably also say that they were very unhappy at the attitude of the unions—and, of course, their proxies in this chamber—who are wanting to displace them, based on the theory that somehow more money will be paid for precisely the same work.

We will take that advice on board. But in the meantime let me say to you that responsibility for the welfare of children lies overwhelmingly with the state governments. If the Queensland state government has all of these outrageous concerns that need to be addressed then it ought to do something about them. It should not just conduct another inquiry and run around the countryside presumably taking evidence from the Labor Party about how they are concerned about their own constituents not getting paid full wages; it should actually take some action. Presumably it has laws to deal with these issues and, if people are being forced to work in insalubrious circumstances or if they are being put at risk then one would hope that either there are laws in place or there should be laws in place.

Given the personnel shortages in the ADF, why are you employing more civilians?

But I do applaud this new found interest in defence on the part of the Labor Party. The next challenge of course will be to write a policy. They tried one in relation to a coast guard. The best they could do was pick up what Mr Beazley had written before the last election so they suggested spending another $600 million. But was it on defence? No. They said, `Create a new tier of law enforcement.' We would have Customs and we would have Defence—the Navy—but that was not good enough. They wanted a new level of defence and they would call it a coast guard. They said they would give it three ships and helicopters and say that it could cover the whole of the Australian coastline. A whole new system of administration and bureaucracy— $600 million, three ships—and it would have achieved next to nothing in terms of added value. If the Labor Party were really interested in defence, they could have said, `We will raise an extra $600 million and give it to the Navy.' They could have given it the extra three ships.

Shortly after the attack the intelligence and security agencies<inline font-weight="bold">1</inline> searched their records to ascertain whether there was any information that warned of the attack. The Director-General of ONA, who coordinated the search, reported to the Prime Minister that no material that specifically warned of the attack was identified.</para><para>2.	The Australian Federal Police (AFP) conducted a similar search, with the same negative result.</para><para>3.	Following media suggestions that there had been such intelligence, on 23 October 2002 the Prime Minister wrote asking me to:</para><para>·	review all relevant intelligence available to Australian intelligence and security agencies, and associated intelligence assessment processes, to establish whether there was any information that warned of the bomb attack in Bali on 12 October 2002; and</para><para>·	propose relevant recommendations in the light of my findings.</para><para>4.	The intelligence and security agencies are not normally taken to include the AFP. In view of the possibility that the AFP might have been in a position to receive relevant intelligence I sought and obtained clarification from the Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet that I should include the AFP in the inquiry.</para><para>5.	The agencies all maintain detailed. searchable electronic records of the great bulk of the intelligence they receive. There are also, in some agencies, some hard copy records that are not converted to electronic form.</para><para>6.	The inquiry identified approximately I70 search terms one or more of which would be likely to be contained in intelligence that could have warned of the attack. They ranged from broad, obvious terms like “terrorism” and “Bali” to relatively obscure ones, such as aliases of possible perpetrators (the full list of terms is at Annex 1 to this report). </para><para>7.	They included the terms that the agencies had used previously (see paragraph 1), as well as terms identified since the attack, such as names of suspects. More names were added, and fresh searches done, as investigations into the attack continued.</para><para>8.	A team established for the purpose in each agency searched the agency's electronic records back to 11 September 2001 using all these terms.</para><para>9.	The inquiry supervised these searches and, where necessary, authorised modifications to take account of the agencies' different information technology systems.</para><para>10.	Each team identified and examined possibly relevant records listed as a result of the searches. The inquiry did likewise. Thousands of records were examined in this way.</para><para>11.	Much intelligence is shared between the intelligence and security agencies. In the unlikely event, therefore, of one agency's records not revealing the existence of a particular item of intelligence, this methodology would be likely to identify the item in the records of other agencies.</para><para>12.	The inquiry also had direct access, from a computer terminal located in our office, to ASIS and DSD intelligence reports and conducted separate searches of those records as necessary.</para><para>13.	The inquiry also examined each agency's hard copy holdings. For this purpose it accessed subject indexes maintained by the agencies and perused files that appeared likely to contain intelligence warning of the attack if such intelligence existed.</para><para>14.	It was possible that, notwithstanding the breadth of the searches, someone in an agency might recall seeing relevant intelligence. Each of the intelligence and security agencies, at my request, circularised staff asking that anyone who had seen or heard of, or who believed they may have seen or heard of, such intelligence, bring it to the notice of the agency or this inquiry. The AFP had previously taken similar action, without result, so I did not repeat the request there.</para><para>15.	At the time of the searches referred to in paragraph 1, the agencies contacted cooperating overseas agencies that would have been likely to provide relevant intelligence. Each searched its records and confirmed that it did not have such intelligence and could not, therefore, have passed it to Australia.</para><para>16.	The inquiry concluded that there was nothing to be gained by repeating the requests to overseas agencies, noting also that in the United States, the United Kingdom and New Zealand there had been official statements to the effect that no such intelligence was collected.</para><para>17.	The Defence Imagery and Geospatial Organisation does not collect intelligence of the kind that would have forewarned of the Bali attack. At the start of the inquiry I confirmed with the Director that it had no such intelligence and that its collection activities would not have provided any. It was not necessary to do searches of the kind undertaken in the other agencies.</para><para>18.	One agency has a number of electronic records of foreign language intelligence, collected shortly before the attack, that was not reported because on it did not meet the criteria for high interest intelligence at the time.</para><para>19.	Under normal circumstances this material would have been discarded but the agency head decided, before the inquiry was announced, to retain the records in case they contain something significant. It is unlikely that they do, but to exclude the possibility the records will be examined in detail.</para><para>20.	Rather than wait for that process to be completed, which will take some time, I have decided to report the results of the inquiry to date. A second and final report will be produced as soon as possible.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Results</inline></para><para>21.	The electronic searches resulted in thousands of “hits” on the various terms used. The nature of the searches, however, caused. many records to appear multiple times on the lists generated.</para><para>22.	A small proportion of these appeared, on the basis of the record summaries, to be possibly relevant. Nevertheless, the majority of the records were individually examined.</para><para>23.	In the months before the attack there were numerous intelligence indications of possible terrorist activity, including activity in Indonesia, with foreign interests or foreigners as likely targets.</para><para>24.	Annex 3 contains samples of intelligence records and assessments identified by the inquiry as indicative of the kind of intelligence related to the terrorist threat available in the months before the attack. </para><para>25.	One intelligence report, obtained from foreign liaison sources, mentioned various places, including Bali, as possible loci of terrorist activity should certain specified circumstances eventuate. Those circumstances did not eventuate in the time between receipt of the intelligence and the attack. I am advised that it is clear from the Bali investigation that these circumstances were not relevant to the attack.</para><para>26.	No other intelligence was received that specified Bali as a likely or possible location for a terrorist attack.</para><para>27.	Furthermore, even with the benefit of hindsight and knowledge of possible and likely perpetrators, the inquiry could not construe any intelligence, even intelligence not mentioning Bali, as possibly providing warning of the attack.</para><para>28.	ASIO's threat assessments during the period covered by the inquiry appropriately reflected the risks suggested by the available intelligence. Assessments by other agencies also contained realistic appreciations of the risks to Australian interests from action by extremists.</para><para>29.	One person came forward as a result of the invitation to members of the agencies referred to at paragraph 14. This person did not, however, have. any information about intelligence warning of the attack but wished to offer views on intelligence collection and analysis.</para><para>30.	The inquiry noted, and where necessary followed up, instances of public allegations that warnings had been issued before the attack. None of these proved to have any substance.</para><para>31.	The inquiry's conclusion, therefore (subject to the further work mentioned in paragraphs 19-20), is that there was no intelligence warning of the attack.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Agency functions</inline></para><para>32.	It was apparent from media reporting in the period after the attack that there is much ignorance and confusion about the respective functions and responsibilities of the agencies in relation to terrorism.</para><para>33.	The inquiry therefore prepared, on the basis of information provided by the agencies, a summary of these functions and responsibilities. It is Annex 2 to this report.</para><para>34.	It is also evident that there is a perception in some quarters that the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security is not sufficiently independent, or lacks sufficient powers, to conduct an inquiry of this kind. This is incorrect.</para><para>35.	The Inspector-General is an independent office created under the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act 1986. The Inspector-General is appointed by the Governor-General in Council for a fixed term. Although a minister can ask the Inspector-General to undertake an inquiry, the conduct of inquiries is entirely at the Inspector-General's discretion and cannot be directed by anyone.</para><para>36.	In conducting inquiries the Inspector-General has powers equivalent to those of a royal commission, provided by the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security Act. These include the power to compel production of information and documents and to take evidence on oath. The Inspector-General has full and unfettered access to the premises, personnel and records of the intelligence and security agencies.</para><para>37.	All the agencies provided complete cooperation and assistance during this inquiry. They each provided substantial dedicated resources to conduct the various search tasks that the inquiry required and they complied energetically and enthusiastically with all the inquiry's requests.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">Recommendations</inline></para><para>38.

ASIO maintains close cooperation with other Australian intelligence agencies, with the AFP and with state police services, participating in relevant inter-agency committees. It works closely with ONA in performing its assessment function. It also hosts a counter-terrorism coordination unit with officers from other agencies including the AFP. The purpose of the unit, which is advisory, is to ensure that no significant counter-terrorist investigation is hampered through failure to apply appropriate and available agency resources to its resolution.</para><para>3.	ASIO is not just concerned with activity that occurs solely in Australia. It advises on and evaluates intelligence concerning terrorist activity overseas relevant to the protection of Australian interests. It tasks Australian intelligence collection agencies in relation to terrorist persons and activities overseas and maintains liaison with a wide range of overseas agencies through ASIO and other staff at Australian diplomatic missions.</para><para>4.	Preparation of threat assessments, for which ASIO has sole responsibility in the field of terrorism, is an important ASIO function.

He resorted to talking about a proposal for the coastguard and about how well our troops are doing. He effectively said, `Don't worry about that; it's all okay.' The minister's answers today reflected that he, like the department, is not on top of the financial management of Defence. The critics and former senior people in Defence are saying that the management of Defence is in very poor shape. This is not a view made up by the opposition; rather, it is a view adopted by a former deputy chief of the defence forces and a view contained in the ASPI report released the other day. It is also the view of the Audit Office, which actually saw fit to put a qualification on Defence's financial reports last year.</para><para>It is true that Defence is under enormous operational strain at the moment and that our service men and women are doing an excellent job and performing very well under very difficult circumstances. There is no argument in Australian politics about that, and that is not the issue at stake. They have done tremendously well under very difficult circumstances. But, if we look at the financial management of Defence, if we look at the acquisitions made by Defence and if we look at a whole range of issues that go to the effective management of Defence, there are very serious question marks and very serious concerns. It is so bad that the report on the strategic review released by the Australian Strategic Policy Institute said:</para><quote><para>More effective reform of Defence is the most urgent long-term defence policy challenge the Government faces.</para></quote><para>It went on to say:</para><quote><para>Defence reform is not just a matter of fiscal probity—it's a matter of long-term strategic necessity.</para></quote><para>ASPI has identified the major problem in Defence as its management and fiscal issues. That confirms the view expressed by Lieutenant General Des Mueller, who recently retired as the Deputy Chief of the Defence Force, and of course it confirms the judgment made by the Audit Office. We have a serious problem inside Defence. After almost seven years of the Howard government, after four ministers of defence and after so-called reform after reform after reform under different ministers promoting particular biases they held, we have very serious concerns about the ability of Defence management in this country to explain where the money has gone and whether in fact it is worth putting in more.</para><para>ASPI basically said in its report the other day that it is not worth putting any more money into Defence, because they would only waste it. That is a terrible indictment of the management of Defence and it is reflected in the minister's inability to answer questions about that financial management and his inability to answer questions at estimates hearings about it. At estimates I spent a great deal of time trying to get the minister to explain where the extra money outlined in the white paper had gone, where the $500 million had gone. But the minister was unable to give us a satisfactory explanation about how the money had been spent. </para><para>We do know that, despite all the talk about the white paper, the actual money spent on equipment and capital projects has reduced, and it will keep reducing in the out years as well. The government said, `We've got this white paper and more money is going to go in,' and Labor endorsed and supported that. But, when you look at the budget, the money is not there. It has not been spent on capital projects and it is not there for capital projects in the out years. But we do know, for instance, that there is $800 million in the bank account. While the troops are under enormous pressure and while there are serious concerns about issues like ammunition and the ability to train with live ammunition inside our Army, there is $800 million sitting in the bank. The troops are after $30 or $40 million extra for ammunition, yet the Department of Defence has $800 million in cash on the short-term money market at the same time as the minister is going to cabinet saying that he needs more money.</para><para>Something is very wrong. The Audit Office has said there is something very wrong, ASPI has said there is something very wrong and the former Deputy Chief of the Defence Force has said there is something very wrong. The minister today was unable to provide satisfactory answers about the management of financial matters inside Defence. This is a very serious public policy concern that needs to be addressed. The minister has to come to terms with it and we need some answers about where the money is going and whether we are getting value for money. Or are we going to have a further series of Seasprites and heavy torpedoes that will see Australian taxpayers' money wasted for want of proper management? Will we see more terrible acquisition decisions taken that cost us millions of dollars for projects that are years late and that let down our troops? <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>7550</page.no><name role="metadata">Ferguson, Sen Alan</name><name role="display">Senator FERGUSON</name><name.id>EP5</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I am amazed that Senator Evans would choose today to attack this government's record in defence, particularly as he quoted ASPI's view when speaking to his motion that the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Defence.

We heard Senator Kirk talking about a decrease in the number of personnel in the ADF while the money being spent on consultancies and bureaucrats was increasing.</para></talk.start><para>Let us have a look at Labor's record. Its record on defence showed a lack of commitment to personnel, to funding, and to capability and management over 13 years. Over 13 years in office, the Labor Party cut 15,000 ADF personnel, including the disbanding of two full-time Army battalions made up of some 3,000 personnel. They have the hide to get up here today and talk about a lessening in the numbers of some 1,500 people in personnel. Two battalions were scrapped. It is just as well that Senator Evans is leaving the chamber because I am quite sure that the last thing that he wants to be reminded of is the record of Labor when they were in government and their attitude towards the funding and management of our Defence Force. Combat capability was run down; the two battalions that were scrapped to pay for a Ready Reserve initiative were nothing more than a financially flawed cost cutting exercise which was only designed to operate for 50 days. That is Labor's record on defence and yet we have Senator Evans standing up here today criticising this government's attitude towards Defence priorities. Combat capability was run down with deficiencies identified by the Army's own self-assessment which stated: </para><quote><para>... units are not adequately prepared for combat ... Army lacks sufficient combat power ...</para></quote><para>	...	...	...</para><quote><para>... units are understaffed, poorly equipped and have low readiness levels.</para></quote><para>That was the state of the Defence Force under the Labor government. This happened as a continuing process over 13 years. Defence spending under Labor was reduced from 9.4 per cent of total budget outlays before Labor to eight per cent in 1994-95, and inefficiency and mismanagement were rife. This is Labor's record on defence and they have the hide to get up here in this chamber and question the efficient manner in which our Defence Force is being conducted today. The coalition has delivered the biggest increase in Defence funding for more than 20 years. Labor's record was to decrease funding; the coalition's record is to deliver the biggest increase in Defence funding for more than 20 years. </para><para>The white paper is a blueprint for the future security of Australia and for building a stronger and more reliable Defence Force. Look at what the coalition has achieved since it has been in government. It has helped to restore peace and security to East Timor under the United Nations operations that achieved very set objectives. It has tightened border security to address concerns such as illegal immigration, terrorism, drug trading, illegal fishing, piracy and quarantine infringement. It has improved pay and conditions for ADF personnel and it is committed to increasing Defence funding by an average three per cent per annum over the coming decade.</para><para>Labor try to criticise this government for what it has achieved in Defence. They made a flippant remark about having four ministers for defence since 1996. I am not sure whether my figures are entirely accurate but I seem to remember the Labor government having 11 ministers for immigration in 13 years. Immigration is the most important issue that has been confronting Australia for a long time. We have had one minister for immigration for all of our period in government, and what an outstanding job he has done in conjunction with the Defence Force in making sure that we have secure borders and that we have a policy of border protection that is the envy of much of the world.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>7551</page.no><name role="metadata">Ludwig, Sen Joe</name><name role="display">Senator LUDWIG</name><name.id>84N</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take note of the same issue. Firstly, Senator Hill's answer to my question, which was specifically in relation to consultants, missed the mark completely. We were looking for an answer from the government about what they have been doing with the Department of Defence. We found that they have not been able to support the troops on the ground at all. When you look at the Defence annual report to 30 June 2002, Defence held $835 million in cash—$800 million of which was held in interest bearing term deposits and was not available to pay off current debts, as claimed by the minister. This is well above the $313 million projected in the budget papers released in February this year. </para></talk.start><para>So, in the five months from February to June, there was a $520 million increase in the projected cash holdings in the department. The department have been squirreling away their money; they have not looked at how they are going to support or help their troops on the ground. When asked about this massive jump, they could not give a valid reason and so they said nothing. They were completely at sea in trying to explain where they were going to spend the money and how they had accumulated that much cash. They admitted that the $835 million was over the needed $600 million, so there is a credibility gap.</para><para>The leaked report earlier this year about ammunition shortages in the Army noted that the government was saving approximately $80 million a year by not buying ammunition. If I have any idea, the troops on the ground would be sick of walking around saying `bucketful of bullets' instead of using a machine gun. They would be fed up with it. When you look at the justification that $280 million went to consultants, that money could have been used to buy ammunition. Dry firing is no fun. Dry firing does not help train soldiers. It is a tool and an instrument, but it is not effective at the end of the day when you need experience on the ground.</para><para>The ammunition shortage was acknowledged in the latest Defence annual report, which noted that the readiness of many Army units has been compromised because of the shortage of ammunition. In addition, the annual report notes that many units are struggling to retain their capacity because of ageing equipment. The government was given an opportunity today to explain to the Senate why it was holding massive cash reserves, why it has been able to increase payments to consultants from $84 million to $280 million and why it has 30 per cent of the total civilian salary, but it was unable to explain satisfactorily. When we look at what is happening on the ground—the minister must be turning a completely blind eye to the issue—we find that the troops are not getting a fair go at all. </para><para>I recently visited 6RAR at Enoggera. I am sure that you, Mr Acting Deputy President Brandis, have been there as well. We find that there is a lack of IT training. We find that computer training for soldiers to help our field soldiers is lacking—it is not being provided for. That $800 million could have been used to support them. We know without doubt that they are keen, professional soldiers. There is no criticism directed at their keenness, their professional attitude, their ability to accept training or their ability to work effectively. But what they are lacking is a minister with some vision to ensure that they get the training and equipment that they need.

I make the opening point that they have not had one defence minister in the last six years. We have had four very good defence ministers. The present Minister for Defence, Senator Robert Hill, is an outstanding minister. As somebody who is very interested in these matters in this chamber, I have a great deal of confidence in Senator Hill. I have confidence in his administration of his department. Furthermore, I have confidence in the Department of Defence. The proof of the pudding is in the eating. The Labor Party might have forgotten that. When the Department of Defence and the ADF are asked to do something, they do it. They give the government options and they carry out its tasks. That must be the most important thing for any military force anywhere in the world.</para></talk.start><para>When we came to power—our proceedings are being broadcast, so it is nice to remind people of this—we had a $10 billion black hole and a momentum of Labor deficits of $96 billion that had been run up over the previous eight years. We were determined that, whilst we might manage the economy and balance the books in a way that allowed the government to do the things that needed to be done, one area of government expenditure that was going to be protected was defence. We have done that and we have stuck to our word on that. In recent times since the defence white paper we have increased defence expenditure in real terms— forced, I know, and quite appropriately so, by the commitments in the war against terror—because we happen to believe that protecting the nation, its citizens and its international obligations is probably the most important priority of any government. The government take that priority seriously and will continue to do so. The people of Australia recognise that the government have taken that stand and that it is the right stand for Australia.</para><para>Australians have always expected their defence forces to play a useful and, dare I say it, modest role in world affairs. We are in a position to help our neighbours and our friends. We have done so in peacekeeping around the world—for example, in East Timor, which was a particularly courageous and appropriate role. When the history of this government is written, nobody, friend or foe, would say that the commitment made by the Prime Minister and the government in doing what needed to be done in East Timor was not one of the very best things that the government has done. The commitment that we have made in the war against terror and the role that our SAS troops have played in Afghanistan have added to the tradition of Australian troops being regarded as some of the most courageous and best in the world. The SAS company in Afghanistan—T1 troops that they are—showed that in training, equipment and leadership they were probably some of the best troops ever to leave Australia. I think I speak for all Australians in acknowledging the job that they have done in Afghanistan and welcoming them home to their families this Christmas. </para><para>The government have been determined that our defence effort be appropriate and proportionate to what the Australian people demand, in line with our military tradition of not imposing our will on people but providing the proper military response when international affairs get out of balance. In the very short time left to me, I will mention some of the places where our ADF are still serving. They are in the Middle East, where we have over 600 troops in the war against terror and to impose the United Nations sanctions against Iraq. We have a Middle East commitment where the UN Truce Supervision Organisation is supervising the truce agreed at the conclusion of the first Arab-Israeli war. We have troops in Bosnia and in Sierra Leone. We have peacekeepers in the Sinai, Eritrea and Ethiopia. We have the Navy in the Southern Ocean doing the very important job of fishery protection. The ADF supports the Australian Fisheries Management Authority through Coastwatch to enforce Australian sovereign rights in fisheries in the Southern Ocean. We have the continuing commitment to East Timor, where we still have 1,100 personnel as part of the UN mission to support the East Timor administration—<inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:22:00</time.stamp><page.no>7553</page.no><name role="metadata">Marshall, Sen Gavin</name><name role="display">Senator MARSHALL</name><name.id>00AOP</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I also rise today to take note of the answers provided by Senator Hill, as Minister for Defence, to a range of questions asked by Labor today during question time. I rise to do that to focus on what can only be described as this government's failure to deliver Australia's defence forces with the necessary capital equipment that is strategically viable and at costs that fall inside the spending limits set out in the Defence budget. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute, an independent non-partisan policy organisation, recently released its 2002 strategic assessment in which a damning critique of Defence procurement is presented. The ASPI report identifies a series of problems that highlight the Howard government's mismanagement in Defence. </para></talk.start><para>For the benefit of senators and others, I shall outline a number of these problems now. They include the government's decision to abandon the tender process and buy torpedoes that are too heavy for the Collins class submarines, forcing Defence to raid $200 million from other projects to cover the cost blow-out. As a result of the government's interference, taxpayers will pay $450 million for torpedoes that do not fit our submarines. Despite allocating funding, the government has not ensured that essential electronic warfare protection and long-range weapons have been delivered for our FA18s and our F111s. It was recently revealed that the government has spent $200 million on the long-range AGM142 missile, but it will take at least nine years to fit them to the F111s. The government rushed into a decision to buy the F35 US joint strike fighter without any thought as to how Australia will maintain its air combat capability until the likely delivery date beyond 2015. Our existing FA18s and F111s will struggle to fly past 2010. Any strategically viable interim capability to fill the gap will be prohibitively expensive, with ASPI estimating the cost at an additional several billion dollars. The $1.4 billion frigate upgrade project, started three years ago, is already running more than two years late. Some ships will now be upgraded with just seven years left out of their 35-year service life. We cannot forget the government's contract to buy 11 second-hand 40-year-old Seasprite helicopters, which are more than three years behind schedule. The government was even funding a maintenance facility for these helicopters which we do not have.  </para><para>These bungles in defence equipment procurement represent a big black mark against this government's defence management capabilities and serve as a costly reminder to the Australian taxpayer of just how imperative strategic and careful management of the Defence portfolio is. The Australian Strategic Policy Institute states that, before looking for new Defence projects to fund, the government should concentrate on actually delivering what is already in the capability plan. In the words of the ASPI report:</para><quote><para>We think that it would be best to consolidate progress on the already ambitious Defence Capability Plan before setting new goals.</para></quote><para>This may be obvious, but the government must take heed. The ASPI review provides a clear analysis that Australia's long-term defence capability is most at risk from the failure of the Howard government to manage defence effectively. I quote the ASPI report again:</para><quote><para>If the government simply bails out Defence every time costs escalate, it will remove any incentive for Defence to contain costs and seek innovative solutions.</para></quote><para>The ASPI report follows comments from recently retired Lieutenant General Des Mueller that the management of defence equipment purchases needs a complete overhaul. In saying this, he clearly believes that the government's recent purchasing reforms have failed. The Audit Office and Defence's own Management Audit Branch have also raised serious concerns about the high likelihood of further capital equipment project failures over the next three to four years that could cost taxpayers millions of dollars. Given what I have just said, and what we have heard during question time today and in the motions to take note of answers moved by Senator Evans and Senator Ludwig, this government is failing our defence forces and, in turn, placing our country at risk.</para><para>These are testing times for Australia's security and, as such, Australia's defence forces. Australians deserve and require policies within the Defence portfolio that are carefully calculated and performed to precision. It is clear from what we have heard today that this current government is not in a position to fulfil that requirement.</para><para>Question agreed to. </para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Arts: Film Industry</title><page.no>7554</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>15:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>7554</page.no><name role="metadata">Ridgeway, Sen Aden</name><name role="display">Senator RIDGEWAY</name><name.id>8G6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the answer given by the Minister for Communications, Information Technology and the Arts (Senator Alston) to a question without notice asked by Senator Ridgeway today relating to the film industry.</para></motion><para>Yesterday, I asked similar questions in relation to the Commonwealth government's support for our national cultural institutions. Indeed, the minister confirmed that the government is undertaking a review of all of the major national cultural institutions across the country. I am concerned about the message that this sends to those institutions as well as to the groups that use them, particularly school groups, family groups and low-income earners, but more particularly the professional practising artists out there who have all contributed in one way or another to issues concerning national cultural identity. Today, the minister's answer to questions about ongoing funding to the Australian film industry was a very simple one. He has, however, come out from behind the bush and given some more answers about which institutions we are talking about, and he was also including the Film Finance Corporation, the Australian Film Commission and the Australia Council as part of that review.</para><para>It appears to me that the government is focused solely on the budget bottom line and somehow the bean counters have got together and realised that the arts sector is easy pickings in terms of financing the so-called war on terrorism and related border control measures. I think what the minister and the government fail to understand is that the Myer inquiry and the Guldberg report stated that for every $1 of public money invested in these institutions there is a $3 dollar return. The Myer inquiry talked about 20,000 people employed in the arts sector, an industry that is contributing $160 million annually as a return. It is a serious investment and there is a good argument about providing support for these industries. </para><para>I turn to the minister's comments today in relation to the film industry itself. Although he keeps talking about figures that somehow say that the industry is in good shape—and overall we are talking about an eight per cent increase—we know that the Australian feature production level was boosted this year by two high-budget foreign feature film productions, <inline font-style="italic">The</inline><inline font-style="italic">Crocodile Hunter </inline>and <inline font-style="italic">Swimming Upstream</inline>. The problem, of course, is that when you have foreign feature productions being done this financial year and in the previous financial year—films like <inline font-style="italic">Moulin Rouge</inline>—they often distort what is happening in the Australian film production industry, and this is what needs to be spoken about. As Kim Dalton, the Chief Executive Officer of the Australian Film Commission, recently said:</para><quote><para>Although foreign production activity in Australia is increasing, it's important to recognise that local production remains the foundation of the industry. It is Australian productions which bring Australian stories to our cinema and our television screens and which over the years have promoted Australia so successfully overseas. It is also Australian productions which discover and promote our local talent and which are so often the training ground for our world class crews.</para></quote><para>We need to keep in mind that, since 30 June this year, the government has withheld some $16 million from the Film Licensed Investment Company scheme, commonly known as FLICS. FLICS contributed $16 million of investment over the financial year 2001-02 but, with the pilot scheme set to completely wind up in June next year and with no new investments having been considered since July this year, that is $16 million that the government will not be injecting into the Australian film production industry in this country. What that says is that the outlook for Australian film production and feature films being produced here and globally looks very grim, and the possibility of raising finance for Australian feature films overseas, which is something that has been a crucial element in the investment structure for our films, is becoming tougher.</para><para>When we consider that in another context, TV drama has fallen from $240 million to $212 million. That is a decline of 12 per cent in terms of our own TV producers producing shows for Australian consumption. Whilst there has been some increase in relation to in-house production, we need to keep in mind that for the first time in 20 years no adult miniseries have been produced in this country. We are relying upon the big box office hits that foreign feature films often produce as a result of foreign investment. That is distorting the figures. The film production industry in this country is seriously distorted and seriously in crisis, and it needs assistance.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><petition.group><petition.groupinfo><title>PETITIONS</title><page.no>7555</page.no></petition.groupinfo><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>1</name.id><name role="metadata">The Clerk</name><name role="display">The Clerk</name></talker><para>—Petitions have been lodged for presentation as follows:</para></talk.start></interjection><petition><petitioninfo><title>Immigration: Detention Centres</title><page.no>7555</page.no><no.signed>728</no.signed><name.ids><name.id>DT6</name.id></name.ids><names><name>Senator Bartlett</name></names></petitioninfo><para>To the Honourable the President and Members of the Senate in Parliament assembled:</para><para>The petition of the undersigned shows the concern for the human rights of children held in Immigration Detention Centres and Immigration Reception and Processing Centres around Australia.

We have a Privileges Committee report here which indicates that three prominent scientists in Australia have been highly offended by the remarks made by Senator Boswell and have categorically denied the allegations made to the Senate by him. Dr Peter Jonson has indicated that he has had no personal relations with Professor Trounson, Dr Geoffrey Vaughan or Dr Moses. Professor Brian Anderson was described as a prominent Trounson supporter and he has indicated that he has had no contact with Professor Trounson whatsoever. </para></talk.start></continue><para>I would like to particularly refer to the remarks that Senator Boswell made concerning Dr Geoffrey Vaughan. Dr Vaughan was the subject of a vindictive attack by Senator Boswell on 12 November. Senator Boswell claimed that there has been a pattern of research funding decisions that raise serious concerns about conflicts of interest. He further called on the government—and remember that he is a parliamentary secretary in the government—to launch an investigation into a number of recent research grants. I say this because I am the shadow minister for science and research. I take a particular interest in some of the claims that are being made by Senator Boswell. I have listened to him at estimates, where he managed to cross over from the government side to the opposition side in order to make a number of claims. </para><para>I am particularly concerned about the remarks he made about Dr Geoffrey Vaughan, who was a former Deputy Vice-Chancellor at Monash University. I am also very concerned about the remarks made about the other two individuals named. In Senator Boswell's eyes it seems that Dr Vaughan's crime is to be a scientist concerned to ensure that the fruits of Australian scientific research are realised in Australia for the benefit of Australians. His first accusation was that Dr Vaughan misused his position as Chairman of the CRC Committee to direct research funds in such a way as to obtain a commercial benefit. I notice that a similar claim was made about Dr Peter Jonson allegedly taking commercial advantage of grants, but these were grants that were actually entered into two years prior to Dr Jonson's commencement with the CRC.</para><para>A claim was made about Dr Vaughan that, as a member of the Industry Research and Development Board, he gave a $4.9 million grant to BresaGen, a company of which he was a director. It was claimed that he had been involved in some inappropriate way in misdirecting a biotechnology innovation fund grant of some $245,000 into another company that was associated with Professor Alan Trounson. In short, what Senator Boswell implied was a serious conflict of interest, impropriety and a lack of honesty on the part of Dr Vaughan. In doing so he tried to sketch a nasty little conspiracy that explained why, in his view, the majority of the Senate was being misguided in the support of the stem cell legislation.</para><para>It seems to me that what was being done here was an attempt to actually undermine, to discredit, supporters of embryonic stem cell research. Dr Vaughan has sought, through the Senate processes, to set the record straight. I welcome the claims that he has made and I call on Senator Boswell now to make that abject apology and to explain himself before the Senate for his clear failure to address the basic questions that were raised by Dr Vaughan in his response.</para><para>With regard to the allegation of misuse of the position of Chairman of the CRC Committee, Dr Vaughan has indicated, in correcting Senator Boswell, that the CRC Committee provides advice to the Minister for Science but does not make any direct grants whatsoever to any applicant. More specifically, Dr Vaughan has also clearly stated that the CRC Committee has never received an application for funding involving the company that Senator Boswell claimed that Dr Vaughan was associated with. So much for that first allegation.</para><para>The second allegation with regard to the role and operation of the CRC Committee and the CRCs in general shows the ignorance of the informers that Senator Boswell appears to have. It is very revealing. What you see here is that their interest lies not in improving the research outcome or better public policy but in character assassination. As far as I am concerned, what we have got is an accusation. It reads:</para><quote><para>Vaughan was also appointed to the industry R&amp;D board that subsequently gave Vaughan's own company, BresaGen, a grant of $4.9 million ...</para></quote><para>It is simply a ludicrous proposition. The facts are that, while BresaGen was awarded in May 2000 the grant referred to by Senator Boswell, Dr Vaughan was not appointed to the R&amp;D board referred to by the senator until September 2000—four months later. That shows a similar pattern to the previous allegation I have referred to. What we have got is taking retrospectivity just a bit too far.</para><para>Thirdly, Senator Boswell seeks to claim that somehow Dr Vaughan exerted his influence in relation to the Biotechnology Innovation Fund grant, BIF, to IngenKO, another company associated with Alan Trounson. What we have is seemingly a failure to understand what actually occurs within the research industry in terms of the government allocation. Full declarations of interest are required by DEST, and in fact Dr Vaughan removed himself from receiving any papers—not even agenda papers—with regard to any of these matters before the IR&amp;D Board. Responsibility for the BIF awards was delegated to the board's biological committee, a committee of which Dr Vaughan was not a member, and he consequently played no part in its deliberations in awarding any of the grants. </para><para>The list of those slandered by undistinguished coalition senators goes on, and Dr Vaughan joins that list. We have seen Justice Kirby, and many other eminent Australians who have committed public service, be unfairly and vindictively attacked within this chamber. I do not think the magnitude of Senator Boswell's blunder can be underestimated. As a parliamentary secretary in this government, you ought to be making an abject apology here today, Senator.</para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>WH4</name.id><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGauran</name></talker><para>—Yes, but are you going to defend Trounson?

Senator Boswell has implied impropriety in relation to my activities on these bodies. He has linked the conflict of interest to my position as a Director of BresaGen Limited and a perceived association with Professor Alan Trounson.</para><para>I should like to bring to your attention the following matters:</para><para>·	The activities of the CRC Committee are under continuous review of a probity auditor appointed by the Commonwealth. The committee considers matters of conflict of interest as a key agenda item at every meeting of the committee.</para><para>·	I have declared my directorships, all shareholdings, and all other areas of potential conflict to the Department of Education, Science and Training (and to the Department of Industry, Tourism and Resources in the case of the IR&amp;D Board) and this information is held on the appropriate departmental registers.</para><para>·	The CRC Committee is a committee of advice to the Minister for Science. The committee does not make direct grants to applicants: through its terms of reference it only gives advice to the Minister who is responsible for all funding decisions.</para><para>·	The CRC Committee has never received an application for funding involving BresaGen Limited.</para><para>·	Senator Boswell has stated that “Vaughan was also appointed to the Industry R&amp;D Board that subsequently gave Vaughan's own company, BresaGen, a grant of $4.9 million to find a stem cell therapy cure for Parkinson's”. The facts are that BresaGen was awarded a START Grant in May 2000 and I was appointed to the Board in September 2000.</para><para>·	Whenever any matter related to BresaGen is discussed at the IR&amp;D Board my conflict is declared by me in advance and I remove myself from the meeting. I do not receive any related agenda papers, I do not participate in any discussion, I am not involved in any way in any decision making, and I do not receive the minutes of the particular agenda item.</para><para>·	Senator Boswell has linked me to Professor Trounson because I held the position of Deputy Vice-Chancellor of Monash University. I resigned from Monash more than 10 years ago. Since that time I have held Australian Government and industry appointments.</para><para>·	Senator Boswell has linked my name in the debate to other people he has identified, namely Peter Jonson, Alan Trounson, and Bob Moses. I have never had any personal commercial interests or dealings with any of these people.</para><para>·	The START grant awarded to the “Trounson company” Copyrat was made under delegation by the Biological Committee of the IR&amp;D Board. I am not a member of that committee and played no role whatsoever in any part of the process. </para><para>·	It is implied that I was associated with the Biotechnology Innovation Fund (BIF) award to the “Trounson company” IngenKO through my membership of the IR&amp;D Board. Again, the Board delegated, through its legislated powers, the full operation and allocation of BIF awards to the Biological Committee of the Board. I am not a member of the Biological Committee and thus played no part in the award of any grant to IngenKO, nor indeed in any other award or grant of BIF Funds.</para><para>·	I have never been involved with the funding bodies responsible for the award of the Biotechnology Centre of Excellence, Major National Research Facilities, ARC or NHMRC grants.</para><para>The implications that I have abused a conflict of interest because of my role on the CRC Committee, as a member of the IR&amp;D Board, as a Director of BresaGen Limited, or in my previous role of Deputy-Vice Chancellor on Monash University are without foundation and an unwarranted attack on my reputation, honesty and integrity.</para><para>Yours sincerely,</para><para>(Signed)</para><para>(Dr) Geoffrey Vaughan MSc PhD</para><para>13 and 19 November 2002</para><para>—————</para><para><inline font-weight="bold">(B) Response by Dr Peter Jonson</inline></para><para>I note from Hansard, 12 November 2002, that Senator Boswell has mentioned my name in a context that implies possible impropriety in matters of decisions about Commonwealth grants.</para><para>I wish to make the general point that in my experience the Commonwealth processes in this area are very tight. Careful and explicit attention is paid to avoiding actual or potential conflicts of interest. A probity auditor is appointed by the Commonwealth to monitor the processes and report afterwards. Certainly this was the case in the two committees I have chaired for the Commonwealth.</para><para>In regard to the matters raised by Senator Boswell, I simply say there is no way in which any conflict occurred or could have occurred.</para><para>I have had no past commercial relationships with Professor Trounson, Dr Geoffrey Vaughan or Mr Bob Moses.</para><para>The CRC [Cooperative Research Centre] which I chair won its grant in April 1999; my association with it commenced in March 2002.</para><para>I ceased to be Managing Director of ANZ Funds Management in April 1999. Even during my time in that role I would as a matter of policy have had no detailed knowledge of shares held by the portfolio managers, who were judged on results, not inputs.</para><para>My personal and family share portfolios are managed by a professional fund manager on a basis that is entirely at his discretion and with no input from me. He confirms, incidentally, that he has never invested in BresaGen on my behalf.</para><para>I had earlier written to Senator Knowles [as Chair of the Committee Affairs Legislation Committee] about the appointment of Dr Dianna deVore to the Board of MNT Innovation Pty Ltd, which was made well after the award of the Commonwealth Government and made entirely on merit.</para><para>Yours sincerely,</para><para>(Signed)</para><para>Peter D.

According to the record of Hansard, Senator Boswell stated “Another prominent Trounson supporter, also on the ARC [Australian Research Council] board, is Professor Brian Anderson from the Academy of Science—and a great believer in cloning.”</para><para>I write to object in the strongest possible terms to the implied maligning of my integrity by Senator Boswell. This statement is a clear abuse of parliamentary privilege.</para><para>First, I am not a “prominent Trounson supporter” and indeed, have no recollection of ever meeting the man, before we found ourselves placed on the same stage by conference organisers at an Innovations conference early this November. He is not a Fellow of the Australian Academy of Science.</para><para>Second, I am not “a great believer in cloning”. Indeed, during my Presidency of the Australian Academy of Science, the Academy published A Position Statement on Human Cloning in February 1999 that stated:</para><para>“Council considers that reproductive cloning to produce human fetuses is unethical and unsafe and should be prohibited. However human cells derived from cloning techniques, from ES cell lines, or from primordial germ cells should not be precluded from use in approved research activities in cellular and developmental biology.” </para><para>Third, I object most strenuously to the implication that my personal relationships and personal beliefs impinge on my decision-making as a member of the board of the Australian Research Council.</para><para>For the record, I also note that to the best of my knowledge no member of my family or myself has any direct or indirect association through any investment or financial instruments with commercial activities with which Professor Trounson is associated.</para><para>The offending, and offensive, sentence should be struck from the official record of the Federal Parliament.</para><para>(Signed)</para><para>28 November 2002</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Senators' Interests Committee</title><page.no>7570</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>7570</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:23:00</time.stamp><page.no>7570</page.no><name role="metadata">Denman, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator DENMAN</name><name.id>FY5</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In accordance with the Senate resolution of 17 March 1994 on the declaration of senators' interests, I present the Register of Senators' Interests incorporating current statements of interests, including new statements of interests and notifications of alterations of interests lodged between 25 June 2002 and 5 December 2002.</para></talk.start></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Treaties Committee</title><page.no>7570</page.no></subdebateinfo><subdebate.2><subdebateinfo><title>Report</title><page.no>7570</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:24:00</time.stamp><page.no>7570</page.no><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name><name.id>00AOO</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties, I present the 50th report entitled <inline font-style="italic">Treaties tabled 15 October 2002, </inline>together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and minutes of proceedings and seek leave to move a motion in relation to the report.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOO</name.id><name role="metadata">Kirk, Sen Linda</name><name role="display">Senator KIRK</name></talker><para>—I move:</para></talk.start></continue><motion><para>That the Senate take note of the report.</para></motion><para>I seek leave to incorporate my tabling statement in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The statement read as follows</inline>—</para><para>The report contains the results of an inquiry conducted by the Joint Standing Committee on Treaties into three treaty actions tabled in the Parliament on 15 October, concerning double taxation, medical treatment for temporary visitors, and research, development and training relating to nuclear science and technology.</para><para>The first treaty considered by the Committee was:</para><para>·	An Amendment to the double taxation agreement between Australia and Vietnam:</para><para>Mr President</para><para>This treaty proposal, in the form of an Exchange of Letters, arose because of changes Vietnam has made to its domestic laws regarding foreign investment. Vietnam has sought Australia's agreement that the relevant tax incentives will remain substantively the same as those previously agreed between the two countries. In effect, the treaty ensures that tax sparing arrangements previously agreed to in the double taxation agreement continue until 30 June 2003, when they will expire permanently. </para><para>Tax sparing is an arrangement where tax foregone by a foreign country on the income of an Australian resident is deemed to have been paid. Thus the tax foregone is credited as if it were actually paid. The Committee has considered such arrangements in past reports, most recently in Report 48, where tax sparing arrangements with Malaysia were considered and the Committee agreed that they be extended to 30 June 2003. </para><para>Tax sparing arrangements are targeted to foster genuine economic development and relate to active business income, for example, the construction of power production infrastructure, the development of ports to facilitate export processing, the expansion of heavy industry and the plantation of new forests for commercial exploitation.</para><para>The Committee has had ongoing concerns about the manner in which information on double taxation agreements, including tax sparing arrangements, is provided by the Department of the Treasury, and has sought to ensure that such agreements are in fact in the national interest. The Committee was concerned that the OECD has reservations about tax sparing policies in general. The Committee was also advised that these arrangements are no longer preferred government policy, however, the Committee agrees with Treasury that the Australian Government ought to honour its commitments to tax sparing arrangements with Vietnam until the previously agreed date. The proposed Exchange of Letters accomplishes this objective by recognising changes in Vietnamese domestic law, thus providing security for Australian investors in Vietnam. The Committee also accepts that this is conducive to continuing the strong bilateral relations between the two countries. </para><para>The Committee acknowledges Treasury's continuing efforts to provide specific details in National Interest Analyses relating to double taxation agreements and is looking forward to receiving information from the Department on the historical costs and benefits of such treaties when similar amendments or extensions are considered. </para><para>Mr President</para><para>The second treaty action considered in this report is:</para><para>·	An amendment to the agreement between Australia and Ireland on medical treatment for temporary visitors.</para><para>This bilateral Reciprocal Health Care Agreement enables visiting residents of one country to access the public health system of the other, to obtain any treatment that is immediately necessary prior to travelling home. This particular agreement covers public hospital and pharmaceutical care. </para><para>Reciprocal Health Care Agreements are of particular assistance to persons who are fit to travel overseas, but are unable to obtain insurance. This could be because, for example, they are over 70 years of age, or have a pre-existing medical condition. Australia has RHCAs with New Zealand, Italy, Malta, Sweden, the Netherlands, Finland, the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland. These countries have health systems of an equivalent standard to Australia.</para><para>Until the introduction of the National Health Amendment (Improved Monitoring of Entitlements to Pharmaceutical Benefits) Act, access to PBS benefits was automatic upon presentation of a valid prescription. The Act now requires people to produce evidence of their entitlement to PBS benefits. For Australians, this would be a Medicare card. The amendment to this agreement introduces a requirement that Irish visitors requesting access to the PBS produce a passport to access the PBS entitlements, thus bringing the treaty into line with Australian law. </para><para>The third and final agreement considered in this report is:</para><para>·	An extension to the Regional Cooperative Agreement for research, development and training related to nuclear science and technology</para><para>Mr President</para><para>The Committee understands that the Regional Cooperative Agreement, the RCA, is an important mechanism in fulfilling the technical co-operation provisions of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Continued membership of the 1987 RCA is therefore one way for Australia to meet its obligations to co-operate with other parties in the peaceful uses of nuclear energy under that treaty.</para><para>The Committee was advised that the non-proliferation treaty is the centrepiece of the non-proliferation regime which, for over a quarter of a century, has helped maintain Australia's immediate strategic environment free from nuclear weapons.</para><para>As a party to the NPT, Australia has made a commitment to facilitate the exchange of equipment, materials and scientific and technological information for the peaceful uses of nuclear energy.</para><para>The 1987 RCA also allows Australia to participate in international collaborative projects and to maintain and extend a national capacity in cutting-edge nuclear technologies. The Committee understands that the cooperation program covers six broad thematic sectors: health, environment, industry, radiation protection, agriculture and energy.</para><para>The Committee was advised that Australia is leading half of the projects in the health care sector, especially for the training of medical technicians, medical graduates in oncology and in medical physics. The Committee was advised that there is a critical shortage in the Asia-Pacific region of medical physicists, who are essential to ensure that optimum performance is obtained from equipment that represents considerable investment by the countries involved. </para><para>The RCA program has matured over the years since its inception, from capacity building into applications that assist in addressing and providing solutions to environmentally sustainable development programs and challenges of collective importance. </para><para>The Committee concurs with evidence it received that Australia has been playing a lead role in developing management strategies to enable RCA Member States to take on more responsibility for the development and implementation of the program. Also, the Committee agrees that the extensive networking that occurs between the counterpart agencies engenders a cooperative atmosphere that assists mutual understanding and facilitates regional contact across a wide range of science and technologies.</para><para>Mr President </para><para>It is the view of the Committee that it is in the interest of Australia for the treaties considered in Report 50 to be ratified and the Committee has made its recommendations accordingly.</para><para>I commend the report to the Senate. </para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation

follows</inline>—</para><para>The Copyright Amendment (Parallel Importation) Bill 2002 further demonstrates the coalition Government's willingness to act in the best interests of consumers, the education sector and business. </para><para>The central aim of the bill is to improve access to a wide range of software products and printed material on a fair, competitive basis by permitting the parallel importation of such goods.</para><para>`Parallel importation' is the commercial importation of non-pirate copyright material without the permission of the Australian copyright holder. </para><para>At present, software products and printed material (books, periodical publications and printed music) are not subject to open and genuine competition.</para><para>This is because copyright law allows local rights holders to control importation of these products.</para><para>This has significant implications for Australian consumers and businesses as Australia is a net importer of copyright material.</para><para>The bill offers the prospect of cheaper prices and increased availability of products for all Australians, but especially for small businesses, parents and the education sector.</para><para>Unlike the Labor Party's `use it or lose it' policy, the Government's policy is not about benefiting foreign rights holders, and maintaining import restrictions and monopoly distributions at the expense of Australian businesses and consumers.</para><para>Many argued in 1998 that the relaxation of parallel importation restrictions for sound recordings would devastate the Australian music industry.</para><para>But, the industry is in good shape and there is no evidence of the claimed 50,000 job losses. </para><para>The recording industry grew after the 1998 reforms, with reports of around 2.9 per cent growth in 1999 alone.</para><para>Many top selling CDs are over 30 per cent cheaper (and sometimes less than half-price) than prior to parallel importation.</para><para>This is despite impact of the GST and unfavourable exchange rates.</para><para>Claims were also made that piracy rates would soar as a result of the CD reforms, and similar claims are likely in relation to software.</para><para>In a report in January 2000 the Australian Institute of Criminology, on the available data, could find `little evidence of the increase in CD piracy predicted by opponents of liberalisation'. </para><para>According to published industry statistics, Australia has comparatively low software and sound recording piracy rates.</para><para>Industry data on software piracy rates in New Zealand has recorded a decrease in the piracy rate since the introduction of parallel importation there. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Books</inline></para><para>To enable maximum community access to competitively priced products, the bill permits parallel importation of all major forms of printed material.</para><para>A 1999 review by the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) found that for best selling paperback fiction, the price difference between Australia and the USA had exceeded 30 per cent on average over the previous four years.  </para><para>As recommended by the Intellectual Property &amp; Competition Review Committee, the printed material provisions will be delayed for 12 months to allow the book industry to undertake contractual adjustments. </para><para>The Committee noted that it had not been provided with any evidence to substantiate printing industry claims in relation to the beneficial effects of keeping the current restrictions. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Software products</inline></para><para>The bill allows parallel importation of all software products including business, education and home software and pay-per-play video arcade machines. </para><para>A 1999 ACCC report recorded that over the past 10 years, Australian businesses and consumers have had to pay an average of 27 per cent more for packaged business software than their US counterparts. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Coverage</inline></para><para>Some Australian rightsholders have attempted to prevent parallel importation of sound recordings by relying on the copyright in secondary material included on the music CD.</para><para>This bill will close this loophole by allowing parallel importation of copyright protected `accessories' other than feature films. </para><para>As the Government has not fully assessed the impacts of allowing the full parallel importation of `cinematograph film' on the Australian industry or consumers, the bill does not allow the parallel importation of `feature film'. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Enforcement Provisions</inline></para><para>To assist copyright owners to enforce their rights under the changed arrangements the bill gives them substantial procedural assistance. </para><para>It provides amendments so that, as for sound recordings, in civil importation action involving software or printed material, the defendant will bear the onus of establishing that a parallel imported copy is not an infringing copy. </para><para>In addition, criminal penalties for infringement of copyright are severe, including up to five years imprisonment for each offence. </para><para><inline font-weight="bold">Conclusion</inline></para><para>This bill will open up new business opportunities and allow easier fulfilment of specialist needs.</para><para>It balances the needs of copyright owners and copyright users. </para><para>Copyright owners will continue to be fairly remunerated, but in the context of a global

Transport and Regional Services portfolio. These amendments are contained within three schedules to the Bill.</para><para>Schedule 1 of the Bill streamlines International Air Services Commission processes through amendments to the International Air Services Commission Act 1992.</para><para>In 1992 the International Air Services Commission was established to act as an independent body for allocating capacity available under Australia's air services agreements to Australian airlines.</para><para>The Government's success in negotiating significantly increased capacity has created opportunities for the Australian community, particularly regional Australia. The changes have also increased opportunities for Australian airlines, provided that they can respond more quickly to changes in what is an increasingly global market. </para><para>These opportunities are available for new carriers as they arise to take the place of Ansett International.</para><para>Therefore the Bill simplifies the process of allocating capacity to ensure that Australian airlines are not unduly delayed by Commission procedures from putting Australian capacity into the market to compete with foreign airlines.</para><para>The Government will retain the Commission's role of assessing the viability of airlines applying for capacity to operate international air services. This is particularly important as new airlines press to take advantage of these opportunities. It is reasonable to seek evidence from applicants that they are capable of using the resources that are allocated to them and this Act provides that Commissioners be selected for specific skills that are directly relevant to this assessment.</para><para>Further, there is an obligation for a Government each time it licenses a services provider. The Government needs to be satisfied that the licensee can actually provide the services it is licensed to perform.</para><para>The next major component of the Bill, Schedule 2, initiates a statutory framework for handling aviation security information and reforms the regulation of the carriage of munitions and implements of war on civil aircraft.</para><para>Aviation security arrangements seek to protect major commercial airline passengers against acts of unlawful interference—such as aircraft hijack or aircraft sabotage. Aviation security allows Australians to place confidence in the aviation industry by reducing the threat to members of the travelling public and the business community.</para><para>Schedule 2 will introduce a statutory framework for the handling of aviation security information. This framework is designed to encourage industry to provide regular and accurate information to Government on how it complies with the aviation security standards. The receipt of this additional, targeted security information will assist the Government to deal with and resolve compliance issues within the industry in a timely and effective manner.</para><para>Schedule 2 also reforms the regulation of the carriage of munitions and implements of war on board civil aircraft. The amendments will eliminate duplication and bureaucratic approval processes, whilst maintaining standards. Regular carriage of munitions will be able to be authorised through regulations, to increase accountability and transparency. The Minister will also retain the ability to make instruments to authorise the carriage of munitions.</para><para>Consequential to the repeal of the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986, Schedule 2 repeals references related to the Federal Airports Corporation Act 1986.</para><para>In summary, the new security standards to be initiated under Schedule 2 to the Bill will be focussed on the security outcomes to be achieved by Australia's civil aviation industry and will support an effective industry compliance program.</para><para>The Government Amendment to Schedule 2 in the House of Representatives removed the repeal of the current aviation security arrangements. It was originally intended that the aviation security arrangements be consolidated into the regulations.

Senator Tierney and Senator Allison worked tirelessly with the subcommittee to produce a report which I think should provide the basis for quite serious action by government. I suspect that this is a report that neither the government nor the opposition will find comfortable in many respects. This is—I emphasise this—a genuinely unanimous report, and I commend the courage of Senator Tierney on raising some of these matters which, as I say, I hope may produce some serious debate within government.</para><para>The inquiry into the education of students with disabilities attracted considerable interest. The committee received some 247 submissions and it heard from 122 witnesses around Australia. Interest groups included parents and students with personal accounts that often highlighted a sense of frustration, stress and disappointment with practices that have failed to help students and their families. Disability groups, professionals, parents and student groups provided a comprehensive analysis of disability education and they raised a series of concerns which this report has sought to address. There are approximately 115,000 students with disabilities funded under specific Commonwealth funding around the Strategic Assistance for Improving Student Outcomes program—the SAISO program—in schools. However, this figure grossly underestimates the number of students requiring extra support in the classroom because of the learning problems associated with a disability. This is because eligibility for Commonwealth funding is based on a narrow definition of disability. Approximately 18,000 students enrolled in university and some 62,000 students enrolled in TAFE courses have a disability.</para><para>The committee agreed that students with disabilities pose a considerable policy challenge for all governments in Australia. The number of students with disabilities attending schools and enrolling in post-secondary education is increasing. There have been increases in the diagnosis of disabilities such as autism and learning disabilities such as ADHD. The net result, of course, is that strong competition now exists for special needs funding across the various sectors. The issue is further complicated given the substantial number of students with learning difficulties, as opposed to learning disabilities, who are also educationally disadvantaged for reasons other than the disability but who nonetheless require funding support. While all state and territory education departments have developed inclusive policies for the education of students with disabilities, differences exist in the extent to which student needs are addressed, assessed and funded. In part, this arises because nationally consistent definitions of disabilities do not exist. The result is inequities between the states and territories in relation to funding support. It also makes national comparisons about the performance of students with disabilities almost impossible. For these reasons, the committee has recommended that the Ministerial Council on Education, Employment, Training and Youth Affairs, MCEETYA, develop nationally consistent definitions of disabilities.</para><para>One important mechanism that will give a level of consistency to the delivery of education for students with disabilities is the finalisation of nationally agreed educational standards. The Disability Discrimination Act 1992, along with similar state and territory laws, makes it unlawful to discriminate against a person on the grounds of disability. Those claiming discrimination have a right to lodge a complaint with HREOC. The development of a set of nationally agreed educational standards will clarify these rights and obligations. Quite clearly, there is a series of problems with the fact that so few people are able to take claims of discrimination forward because of this inconsistency across the various states and territories, because of the expense and because of the clear level of frustration that exists with the existing complaints resolution processes that operate within the states. The committee has also found it almost beyond belief that an agreement on educational standards has eluded MCEETYA for over six years. I want to emphasise that point. For six years the states and territories and the Commonwealth have been arguing the toss about such a basic concept. Given the importance of the educational standards to the overall legislative scheme that is designed to reduce discrimination in education and the unconscionable delaying tactics of some states, the committee believes that it is the responsibility of the Commonwealth to bring these standards into force unilaterally. </para><para>The basis for disagreement over the standards is, of course, the indeterminate cost of adopting them. Putting aside whatever legal mumbo jumbo is presented here, the fundamental question is the issue of costs. The committee believes that conflicting evidence about these costs needs to be resolved. Some state and territory governments argue that the introduction of the standards would impose no additional costs on governments. Others argue that the costs would be substantial. The regulation impact statement prepared by the Commonwealth for the July 2002 MCEETYA meeting estimated the implementation cost to be $328.3 million to $334.3 million for schools and $18.1 million to $24.1 million for the VET sector. The committee agrees that the Commonwealth, state and territory governments should share the costs of implementing educational standards. It also agreed that MCEETYA was the appropriate forum to determine the extent to which these costs should be shared.</para><para>The committee concludes that there is a need for a much clearer and more prominent role for the Commonwealth in educating students with disabilities. In particular, the Commonwealth should be in a position to provide a legislative and policy framework for this crucial area of public policy. It must, as a matter of urgency, formulate and promulgate disability standards for education. This is a matter for the Attorney-General. The cost of implementing these standards, which could be considerable, should be shared between the Commonwealth and the states. MCEETYA is the appropriate forum in which to determine how that cost burden should be borne. Enhancing and making more proactive the role for the Commonwealth which is envisaged by this committee in this area will especially assist and support the smaller jurisdictions, where resources and staffing issues are particularly acute and problematic. The training of specialist teachers and support staff is a matter where Commonwealth support and coordination are especially required. States such as Tasmania and the Northern Territory cannot easily devote financial resources to this area. The Commonwealth has a particular role in coordination and training.</para><para>I turn to the matter of Commonwealth funding itself and the funds that are currently made available for the education of students with disabilities. The committee has a shared concern about whether Commonwealth funds reach down to the level where assistance is required. I want to emphasise that. This is a matter that goes right across the political divide within this chamber. It is hard to follow the money trail. The committee cannot be assured that Commonwealth funds are being used as parliament intended. Reporting processes need to be strengthened and we believe that the current accountability guidelines are inadequate. A number of organisations used the inquiry to seek claims for increased funding. The committee did not see its role as being the one proposed by the supposedly neglected interest groups. The committee proposes that the non-government school organisations, for instance, be given additional specific funding for students with disabilities. The committee took the view that such funding proposals need to be considered within the broader context of the State Grants Act funding, which all members of the committee describe as at least very generous. </para><para>With regard to other issues, the committee has considerable concerns about the training of skilled and dedicated teachers to work in schools and about the extraordinary strains being placed upon teachers to fulfil the multitude of obligations now being asked of them. In regard to post-secondary education, we are particularly concerned about the failure of the vocational education system to fulfil its obligations. Frankly, my personal view is that that is a national disgrace. I am concerned that there is a need for greater work to be done in this. This inquiry has had a profound effect on me. It has allowed me to gain some insight into the difficulties faced by children with disabilities and their families. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:38:00</time.stamp><page.no>7577</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The inquiry of the Senate Employment, Workplace Relations and Education References Committee into the question of children with disabilities produced a fairly rare thing for this committee—a unanimous report. The last unanimous report that it produced was on children at the other end of the educational spectrum—gifted children. It has had two inquiries into atypical children at both ends of the spectrum: children who are gifted and children with disabilities. </para></talk.start><para>The committee received evidence from right around Australia and we spoke to parents, teachers, administrators, academics and to concerned citizens. We developed a view that has produced a report with 19 unanimous recommendations. As I mentioned before, that is a rare thing for this committee. That has occurred because of our concern that children who fall outside the normal spectrum of learning across each state in this country are disadvantaged. There need to be major changes in the approach to pre-service education, in-service education, the diagnostic procedures and to the support for these children when they are at school. </para><para>One of the current problems in education that is exacerbating the situation for these children is the philosophy of inclusive education. Inclusive education means that the classroom teacher is expected to teach across the full range of abilities of children from those who are particularly gifted to those with educational disabilities and, in some cases, with profound disabilities. This philosophy can work if it is resourced properly, if teachers have appropriate pre-service training and if, after having got into the classroom and teaching in that situation, they have ongoing in-service education. We found uniformly around Australia that that was not the case, that the diagnostic implements used to assess these children were greatly inadequate and often applied far too late, that when these children were included in a classroom the teachers had not had proper pre-service training and, as a matter of fact, in many cases had not had any pre-service training in this area—it is not mandatory in any state with the exception of New South Wales and Western Australia—and that after teachers had begun teaching very little was done about their in-service training needs. </para><para>There is in Australia in relation to this issue confusion not only between state and federal levels of responsibility but also across the states on the relationship and roles of health and education departments. We received considerable evidence from parents who were not experts on medical and educational conditions but who sensed at a very early age of their child that there was something seriously amiss with their learning ability. They had sought help from the state education or health departments and on many occasions they expressed their extreme frustration that they could not find assistance. </para><para>What is particularly sad about this is that early intervention in many of these conditions can make a great difference. In particular, if a hearing disability in a child is picked up early, that can make an enormous difference to that child's education. Some states are now beginning to introduce screening of children at birth for hearing disabilities. This will make an enormous difference to children in these situations—even in very extreme conditions of disability such as autism. There is evidence that very early intervention for children with autism will make an incredible difference to their education and life outcomes. But very little work has been done not just in Australia but anywhere in the world on carrying out this identification of autism in children at a very early age and then putting in the programs to work with them.</para><para>The problems that the committee discovered in the city areas were even more profound in rural and regional areas. Because of the sparsity of populations and the geography of the country, it is often difficult to get the health needs of children with disabilities in regional and rural areas attended to within a reasonable distance and it is also more difficult to find an appropriate school for these children. The vastness of this country creates a particular problem for children who are in rural and regional areas.  </para><para>One of the trends we found disturbing is a pattern of gradual shutdown of special education schools across this country. There is a very great need for parental choice in this area. In some situations it is better for a child to be in an integrated class situation, and that might be the wish of the parents. There are other situations where the parents may wish—and even educators see it as appropriate—that they are in a special school. But if these schools increasingly shut down, the chance of parents having a choice is diminished. Then if their child goes to a school where the teachers have not had proper pre-service training and have very little in-service training in disabilities then the educational and life outcomes for these children are greatly diminished.</para><para>One of the hopeful approaches we did see in special schools—and we advocate more of this—is what are called `lighthouse schools'. This is where the special education school becomes a lighthouse for in-service training in disability education for the surrounding schools. Courses can be run and offered by people in the special schools because these people do have specialist training that the classroom teachers do not have.</para><para>One of the very important things that we must ensure is that all the money that is allocated for disabilities education is actually spent for this purpose. One of the most disturbing things we found around all states was that, with the advent of global budgeting, it was incredibly difficult to establish whether the Commonwealth money that had been allocated to a child in a school in the area of disabilities was actually spent on that. Perhaps it was; perhaps it was not. There are no accounting mechanisms that show that this is happening. The committee is calling for the state governments to put in accountable processes so that the dollars sent to the school for disability education are spent appropriately. One parent I spoke to in Nowra said that according to the standards her child should have had $6,000 a year additional funding spent because of her disability. From the evidence there was no way that was happening. We suspect this is quite widespread. One of the most effective ways to get additional money into special education and teaching children with disabilities could be to make sure that the money that is allocated is spent appropriately on the children.</para><para>The final thing I want to touch on is the issue raised earlier about agreed national standards. Through MCEETYA the state and federal ministers have been meeting on this for six years and they have not come to an agreement. We must come to an agreed position at some time. The entire Senate committee urge MCEETYA to come to a nationally agreed educational standard and then work out between the state and federal governments, both of which have funding responsibilities in the area of disabilities, how that is going to be shared.</para><para>I commend this report to the Senate. There has been a lot of good work done. I commend the work of Senator Carr and Senator Allison, who were with me on this committee, and the secretariat. We have produced an excellent report with 19 very worthwhile recommendations. We urge MCEETYA to have a very serious look at these. Let's see if we can advance the cause of education and the possible life outcomes for the most disadvantaged people in our community—those that have an educational disadvantage.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech></subdebate.2></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>TRADE PRACTICES AMENDMENT (LIABILITY FOR RECREATIONAL SERVICES) BILL 2002</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7578</page.no><id.no>R1610</id.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Report of Economics Legislation Committee</title><page.no>7578</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>16:49:00</time.stamp><page.no>7578</page.no><name role="metadata">McGauran, Sen Julian</name><name role="display">Senator McGAURAN</name><name.id>WH4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>NP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the Chair of the Senate Economics Legislation Committee, Senator Brandis, I present the report of the committee on the <inline ref="R1610">Trade Practices Amendment (Liability for Recreational Services) Bill 2002</inline>, together with the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record of proceedings and documents presented to the committee. </para></talk.start><para>Ordered that the report be printed.</para></speech></subdebate.1></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>ASSENT</title><type>Bills</type><page.no>7579</page.no><id.no></id.no></debateinfo><para>Messages from His Excellency the Governor-General were reported informing the Senate that he had assented to the following laws:</para><para>Excise Laws Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002 (Act No. 107, 2002)</para><para>Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002 (Act No. 108, 2002)</para><para>Health Care (Appropriation) Amendment Act 2002 (Act No. 109, 2002)</para><para>Members of Parliament (Life Gold Pass) Act 2002 (Act No. 110, 2002)</para><para>Medical Indemnity Agreement (Financial Assistance—Binding Commonwealth Obligations) Act 2002 (Act No. 111, 2002)</para><para>Higher Education Legislation Amendment Act (No. 3) 2002 (Act No. 112, 2002)</para><para>Excise Tariff Amendment Act (No. 1) 2002 (Act No. 113, 2002)</para><para>Customs Tariff Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002 (Act No. 114, 2002)</para><para>Egg Industry Service Provision (Transitional and Consequential Provisions) Act 2002 (Act No. 115, 2002)</para><para>Egg Industry Service Provision Act 2002 (Act No. 116, 2002)</para><para>New Business Tax System (Consolidation and Other Measures) Act (No. 1) 2002 (Act No. 117, 2002)</para><para>New Business Tax System (Franking Deficit Tax) Amendment Act 2002 (Act No. 118, 2002)</para><para>Taxation Laws Amendment Act (No. 5) 2002 (Act No. 119, 2002)</para><para>Broadcasting Legislation Amendment Act (No. 2) 2002 (Act No. 120, 2002)</para><para>Family Law Legislation Amendment (Superannuation) (Consequential Provisions) Act 2002 (Act No. 121, 2002)</para><para>Australian Animal Health Council (Live-stock Industries) Funding Amendment Act 2002 (Act No. 122, 2002).</para></debate><debate><debateinfo><title>BUSINESS</title><type>Business</type><page.no>7579</page.no></debateinfo><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Rearrangement</title><page.no>7579</page.no></subdebateinfo><para>Senator COONAN (New South Wales— Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer) (4.49 p.m.)—I move:</para><motion><para>That intervening business be postponed till after consideration of government business order of the day No. 2 (Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 and three related bills).</para></motion><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>AW5</name.id><name role="metadata">Carr, Sen Kim</name><name role="display">Senator Carr</name></talker><para>—Were we advised of this change in the program?</para></talk.start></interjection><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>009D2</name.id><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator Buckland</name></talker><para>—I was advised when I came into the chamber that we were doing this bill.

I want to cover three issues particularly. The first is the insurance crisis, the second is the medical indemnity insurance market and the third is the government's response to date. Liability insurance protects the insured against the consequences of being legally liable for injury or damage to third parties. There are a number of types of liability insurance, including personal liability insurance, public liability insurance, professional indemnity insurance, medical indemnity insurance and product liability insurance. In their discussions, the state and federal governments have tended to focus on tort law reform as a response to rising insurance premiums. Other cost drivers such as September 11, the HIH collapse, the cyclical nature of the insurance industry itself, the cost of reinsurance, poor management and prudential monitoring have not been properly addressed.</para></talk.start><para>As a consequence of various roundtable discussions and meetings that have been held, state governments across the country have enacted or are in the process of enacting legislation that in the view of the Australian Democrats severely limits an individual's right to sue and their entitlement to damages. The assumption that there is a correlation between tort law reform and the cost of insurance was proved incorrect in a recent study conducted in the United States. In the USA, there was no difference in the cost of insurance at the end of the day for states that had little or no tort reform and states where large-scale tort reform took place. In the view of the Australian Democrats, a solution to the present and very public concern about the affordability and availability of public liability insurance and professional indemnity insurance requires a holistic national approach.</para><para>While the state and federal governments have tended to focus on tort law reform, this approach creates more problems and questions than it answers. Some weeks ago, when we dealt with the first in the series of bills concerning the binding agreement, I asked a number of questions. I will ask them again. I am yet to hear from the government—more particularly, the minister—what answers tort law reform provides for those who are seriously injured as a result of another's negligence. How does tort law reform ensure that the sick and injured will be cared for in the long term and that they will be appropriately compensated? How does tort law reform encourage individuals, businesses and service providers to take greater care to prevent accidents? How does tort law reform ensure that businesses and organisations can get insurance cover when no insurer will provide a policy? How does tort law reform help prevent corporate collapse of insurance providers?</para><para>According to the <inline font-style="italic">Bills Digest</inline>, medical defence organisations, state government funds and commercial insurers provide medical indemnity to health professionals such as doctors. The medical defence organisations are established as not-for-profit mutual organisations for the benefit of their members, rather than for the financial benefit of shareholders. MDOs do not issue insurance contracts and are not insurers themselves per se. But in exchange for subscription income from the membership of the MDO, they do provide protection to their members.</para><para>I think it is important that the <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline> record show that there are seven major medical defence organisations in Australia. These are United Medical Protection, or UMP, one I think that we all familiar with; Medical Defence Association of Victoria; Medical Indemnity Protection Society; Medical Defence Association of South Australia; Medical Defence Association of Western Australia; Medical Protection Society of Tasmania; and Queensland Doctors Mutual Ltd. Most of the MDOs rely heavily on reinsurance to protect their financial position and to provide cover to doctors and other health practitioners. MDOs can raise additional capital under their current structural arrangements by charging increased subscriptions or making a call to members for an additional amount of money. </para><para>Since 1999, four of the main MDOs have been required to call on their members for additional funds. These were UMP, the Medical Defence Association of Victoria, the Medical Indemnity Protection Society and the Medical Defence Association of South Australia. All of them have made calls to their members for an increase because additional funds were required to operate. Given those circumstances, it is appropriate to ask the question: if the medical defence organisations are having to make extra calls upon their membership, what assurance can there be that they are operating with the required prudential precautions? Considering the sequence of events that has led to the crisis in the health industry and the availability of insurance cover or professional indemnity cover, it is important to put this in context. The medical indemnity insurance market has been in crisis for some time and will perhaps continue to be, depending upon what other responses are given by the government.</para><para>The first point to note is that a provisional liquidator was appointed to UMP and its wholly owned subsidiary Australian Medical Insurance Limited on 3 May of this year. The collapse of UMP insurance would have left 60 per cent of doctors in Australia without professional indemnity cover. There has been a large increase in the cost to medical practitioners of subscribing to medical defence organisations. Medical defence organisations have not made sufficient provision for incurred but not reported claims. One of the features of liability insurance is its long tail. This means that there can be many years between an injury occurring and an insurer receiving notice of a claim. As one of the bills in the package notes, such claims are referred to as `incurred but not reported claims', or IBNRs. For claims that have occurred and have not been notified to the MDO, the MDO is unable to assess the amount of money it will need in reserve to meet the costs of these claims.</para><para>The following is a list of the government's responses to the medical indemnity crisis. On 31 May 2002, the government announced that it would provide assistance to UMP and AMIL to cover payment of claims finalised and claims for incidents occurring between 29 April and 30 June—subsequently extended to 31 December of this year—under an existing or renewed policy. On 23 October this year, the Prime Minister announced that the government would implement an additional set of measures to address the medical indemnity crisis, including an extension of the `claims made' guarantee by the Commonwealth to UMP members from 31 December 2002 to 31 December 2003. This offer is contingent upon the New South Wales Supreme Court allowing UMP and AMIL to continue in provisional liquidation and authorising the provisional liquidator to accept the extension of the guarantee.</para><para>The Prime Minister went on to say that the government would provide funding for incurred but not reported liabilities of doctors in MDOs where the IBNRs as at 30 June 2002 were unfunded. The Prime Minister also said that the government would provide reimbursement for medical indemnity providers—both MDOs and medical indemnity insurers—on a per claim basis for 50 per cent of insurance payouts over $2 million for incidents notified on or after 1 January 2003 and provision for premium subsidies to obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs who undertake Medicare billable procedures. Access to the subsidy was conditional upon practitioners attending incident management and quality assurance programs. Measures were put in place for cost recovery. For the unfunded IBNRs, there will be a levy imposed on the members. Finally, measures were announced to place providers of medical indemnity insurance on an appropriate prudential and commercial footing that will involve an expanded role for APRA.</para><para>On the last response, prudential regulation is not covered by this package of bills. The Australian Democrats are disappointed that this area is not covered. We are extremely concerned about that, because these medical defence organisations would not have got into the problems that they had if APRA had had some capacity to be able to monitor them. As we put on the record regarding the Medical Indemnity Agreement (Financial Assistance—Binding Commonwealth Obligations) Bill 2002, acceptance of this legislation is something that we are forced into, given the state of the health industry and the need to provide cover for doctors and other practitioners. The medical sector is unable to function without security of indemnity, and we do not wish to be responsible for any further uncertainty in the future. That said, MDOs cannot be allowed to continue to operate in such a way that the situation with UMP is able to happen again. </para><para>It is important to remember that UMP/AMIL was, as I have said, the largest medical insurer in Australia, with coverage of approximately 60 per cent of medical practitioners nationally and providing 90 per cent of the cover in my home state of New South Wales and in Queensland. The company got into this predicament as a result of offering unsustainably low premiums as part of its strategy to try to obtain further market share. Thus, when its returns on investments became tight and the reinsurance market began to tighten, which was quickly followed by the collapse of HIH and then September 11, UMP found itself in the unenviable position of being unable to remain solvent. It is appalling that this situation was even allowed to happen in the first place. As we know, prudential regulators like APRA do not have any power over medical defence organisations. This allowed the organisation to get into dire circumstances without coming to the direct attention of the regulator. Disappointingly, the organisation retained its market growth strategy even after knowing that it had sunk into serious trouble.</para><para>Dr Ian Lumsden McVey, Chairman of the Medical Indemnity Protection Society, put it this way while giving evidence to the Senate Economics References Committee inquiry on 10 July this year:</para><quote><para>... a more elegant way of expressing it would be: on the data that we had, if we had priced as UMP had then we would not have been in a prudent financial position.</para></quote><para>When asked whether he agreed that UMP had historically been operating through a process of underpricing premiums to bid for market share, he responded by saying:</para><para>I not only agree; I know it was so ...</para><para>He added:</para><quote><para>Any premium, of whatever size, if it is not enough to cover the assumed risk, is going to lead to failure of a business. I do not think there is any difference between the prudential behaviour of the governance of an insurance industry and that of anything else ... from our experience, the rates they—</para></quote><para>`they' being UMP—</para><quote><para>were charging in Victoria were bound to lead them into an unfunded position, and they took a particular philosophical view that IBNRs—of which you have no doubt heard huge amounts— were not to be counted. Prudent organisations said that they are to be counted, because they are a liability ... and only one is likely to default— one out of six.</para></quote><para>Having said that, it is disappointing that the government has once again come to the chamber with a short-term, bandaid solution when it is patently obvious that prudential control is required for MDOs. Many within the industry also believe that this must happen. If the government wants to argue that it has not had time to install this control, I would argue that there has been ample time and that even a short-term measure should be in front of us today.</para><para>In a response to this package of bills by the Australian Medical Association in a recent article in <inline font-style="italic">Australian Doctor</inline>, Pamela Burton, legal counsel for the federal AMA, had this to say:</para><quote><para>The package is a significant step forward in the short term but its goals are very limited in relation to the problem of escalating claims and costs.</para><para>... We have major problems still with aspects of the package. It does not achieve the long term reforms needed to put medical indemnity on a sound footing. </para><para>... The Government's choice to subsidise certain high-risk groups within the profession does not address the increasingly unfordable premiums of other groups.</para></quote><para>The package of legislative reforms that we are considering is designed to ease the pressure being placed upon providers of medical indemnity. Principally, it targets incurred but not reported claims, which UMP failed to include as a liability and which ultimately got it into the position in which it now finds itself. It also targets high-cost claims, with funding support being offered to medical indemnity providers who have claims that fall within two categories: unscrupulous business activities that have led to the taxpayer having to foot the bill for yet another corporate failure, and a failure that is still without the necessary safeguards to prevent it from happening again. </para><para>The package also puts in place the arrangements for the government to provide subsidies to certain sectors of the medical profession that are seeking medical indemnity cover, but it still excludes medical professionals such as midwives and others within the medical sector that are not covered by MDOs but which are vital to the health system. These are things that I have spoken about previously. It takes little investigation to find out just how much the insurance and indemnity crisis is affecting our community.</para><para>I would like to take a moment to put on the public record the effects this insurance crisis is having on other groups and organisations that will not benefit from this package of bills. The first of those, Dharruk Aboriginal Medical Service in Western Sydney, has seen its professional indemnity premiums rise by 150 per cent. While doctors, some midwives and dentists working at the service have individual professional indemnity cover, the service does not have insurance at an organisational level for protection against vicarious liability actions where the service could be held at least partially liable for actions of those employees. The only suitable cover that could be found would have cost them $96,000, and this included a significant rise in the organisation's excess from $2,000 to $10,000. That is an extraordinary leap from previous years.</para><para>Organisations like the Dharruk Aboriginal Medical Service and countless others across the country operate on a shoestring budget. They do not have stockpiles of excess cash or moneys to meet any of these increases in operating overheads, and the type of increase is simply not sustainable. It has, and will continue to have, an impact on these services being provided to communities. Whilst at this stage the evidence of the scale and scope of the effects on services is just beginning, members within these support services have marked it as a significant and growing problem. It is not going to go away; we are going to have to come back and revisit it. We also need to consider that these organisations are at the front line in the war against medical problems by providing medical services to those in most need in our society, yet there is no publicly funded bailout package for them.</para><para>Another organisation that I want to mention is paying $28,000 for its medical malpractice-professional indemnity insurance cover. Last year it paid only $11,000. It too has been slugged with an increase of $17,000. This is on top of its separate public liability insurance, for which it is also paying almost $12,000 in premiums for this financial year. The questions that have to be asked are: where will these already stretched organisations get the extra dollars from to be able to provide a service, and what price can we put on the health of all Australians?</para><para>Given the debate that has occurred on this particular issue and the fact that there will be more to come in the future, we ought to be making sure that the system that is there to provide health cover is affordable, has the capacity to provide services, particularly to those in remote locations and, more particularly, as I have said on many occasions, recognises the vital role that midwives play in birthing processes for children being delivered. They need support and so far that has not been forthcoming from the government. We still ought to be making that call and giving them the support that they require. I move:</para><quote><para>	At the end of the motion, add: “but the Senate:</para><para>	(a)	notes the fact that midwives have been left out of the package as were Indigenous and community medical centres that are dealing with enormous increases to their insurance bills and high excess charges, and calls on the Government to take action regarding these; </para><para>	(b)	notes that the Government has failed to offer assistance that has made a practical differences to those others within the medical services sector, such as midwives and Indigenous and community medical centres, who remain either without indemnity or insurance cover, or who are paying unsustainably higher premiums; and</para><para>	(c)	calls on the Government to urgently take action to remedy this situation”.</para></quote></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:13:00</time.stamp><page.no>7584</page.no><name role="metadata">Buckland, Sen Geoffrey</name><name role="display">Senator BUCKLAND</name><name.id>009D2</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I seek leave to incorporate my speech on the <inline ref="R1677">Medical Indemnity Bill 2002</inline> and related bills in <inline font-style="italic">Hansard</inline>.</para></talk.start><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows</inline>—</para><para>I rise to speak today on the four medical indemnity bills before us.</para><para>The rationale behind these bills is to put into place specific instruments to tackle the problems regarding the medical indemnity insurance crisis.</para><para>Over the last year or so we have seen the insurance market experience a series of blows, witnessing the collapse of HIH Insurance and the terrorist attacks on the World Trade Centre Towers on 11 September 2002.</para><para>These collapses and catastrophes in the insurance market have largely contributed the current difficulties we are experiencing in the medical indemnity market.</para><para>Through these events, we have come to realise that the insurance arena is a fallible one and at some point there has been a serious lack of foresight on the part of the industry.</para><para>In summary, the Medical Indemnity insurance market is made up of Medical Defence Organisations (MDO's), state government funds and commercial insurers which all afford medical indemnity cover to various health professionals, such as doctors.</para><para>The ethos of MDO's is that they are a not-for-profit mutual organisations.

The United Nation's Human Development Index released in July of this year stated that Australia's indigenous people whose poor living and health conditions meant that Australia ranked amongst the worst in the developed world for poverty.

In December 2001 the Prime Minister was late to announce a National Indemnity Insurance Summit, which convened on 23rd April 2002. The summits communique did no more than announce that work would begin on a range of issues that had been identified as early as the Tito report. You will recall the Tito report came from a review chaired by Fiona Tito and was established by the previous Labor Government in 1991, for a review of professional indemnity arrangements for healthcare professionals.

These cases place a disproportionate burden on the costs of medical indemnity insurance. Having a catastrophic medical injury scheme would be a significant contribution to stemming exponentially increasing premiums for medical indemnity insurance.</para><para>Medical Defence organisation also requires assistance in obtaining reinsurance.

There is no doubt that the crisis in medical indemnity insurance has had a serious impact upon the provision of medical services throughout Australia. Doctors around the country either have chosen early retirement to avoid the prohibitive increase in medical indemnity insurance premiums or have increased the fees they charge patients to cover the inflated premiums. The effect of medical indemnity insurance increases has had an impact on patients and doctors around the country. Capping medical indemnity insurance premiums is essential to the future of our health system. However, there are cases where individuals have been infected with serious illnesses as a result of their medical treatment. It has been estimated that there are thousands of Australians who have been infected with hepatitis C as a result of blood transfusions using donated blood. There are a number of cases where individuals have been infected with hepatitis C at the very time they were being treated for another ailment.</para></talk.start><para>Screening of donated blood in Australia was introduced in 1990. According to the Australian National Council on AIDS, Hepatitis C and Related Diseases, between five and 10 per cent of hepatitis C cases in Australia were as a result of a blood transfusion before the introduction of screening of blood for hepatitis C. The Red Cross estimates that, since the introduction of standard hepatitis C testing, the chance of being infected with the disease as a result of receiving a blood transfusion is approximately one in a million. The odds of being infected are extremely low, but for those who are unfortunate enough to be that one person in a million, the reality is a life which is seriously hampered by what is an insidious and infectious disease. Hepatitis C, in its more serious cases, can lead to chronic liver disease.</para><para>This issue was raised in question time yesterday by Senator Harradine. Currently there is an inquiry into why patients contracted hepatitis C through blood transfusions. This inquiry was commissioned by Senator Patterson in August and is being conducted by Professor Bruce Barraclough, the Chairman of the Australian Council for Safety and Quality in Health Care. The Australian Labor Party supports the inquiry and hopes that it can bring resolution to what is an issue which has diminished the quality of life of thousands of Australians. It is expected that the inquiry will report in the new year. Blood supplies in Australia are almost always at inadequate levels, and any concerns regarding the quality of donated blood can only serve to undermine the public's faith in blood supplies in the country.</para><para>One of the most concerning elements of the `tainted blood' issue is that only some of the victims of tainted blood transfusions have been compensated for their pain and suffering. The <inline font-style="italic">Sunday </inline>program interviewed a number of patients who have been compensated but also spoke to a number of patients who feel betrayed by the organisation which provided them with the blood. These people should be adequately compensated for the financial and emotional effects of sustaining an illness as serious as hepatitis C. </para><para>Recently, Canadian police filed charges against a blood supplier and a pharmaceutical company for criminal negligence causing bodily harm for their part in the transmission of HIV and hepatitis C during blood transfusions. In total, 1,200 people were infected with HIV and thousands were infected with hepatitis C. While I doubt the value of suing organisations which provide a valuable service to the community, the manner in which countries such as Canada are dealing with this issue demonstrates the gravity of the situation. As yet, very few Australians have tested their cases in the courts.</para><para>We should not forget the objective of any type of insurance when considering these bills, which is to provide people with adequate compensation for any suffering they endure. While medical indemnity insurance must be brought into line so that our health system remains accessible, we must keep in mind the people who have suffered serious consequences as a result of their medical procedures. The medical indemnity insurance crisis is one which must be dealt with as quickly as possible. The integrity of our health care system must be dealt with swiftly and effectively. The bills we are debating are long overdue.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:18:00</time.stamp><page.no>7587</page.no><name role="metadata">Lees, Sen Meg</name><name role="display">Senator LEES</name><name.id>8U4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to place on record my disappointment in the <inline ref="R1677">Medical Indemnity Bill 2002</inline> and related bills, their narrow scope and what they highlight about the vested interests in our health system. They should in fact be renamed the `doctor indemnity bills', as the only section of the medical work force that they actually deal with is doctors. I do not deny that professional indemnity insurance for doctors is a very important issue, and that is why this chamber will no doubt pass these bills today. However, what concerns me is a wide range of other health professionals who simply have not been considered by the government or, if considered, the whole thing has been determined to be too difficult and has been put in the too-hard basket.</para></talk.start><para>I note that on 28 March this year the government announced that it would provide a short-term guarantee of up to $35 million to United Medical Protection and Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd, UMP-AMIL—the insurer of about 60 per cent of Australia's doctors. Some $35 million was very quickly offered to sort out this problem. Remember that figure; I will come back to it later.</para><para>The current package of bills being debated by the chamber gives effect to the government's policy announced on 23 October this year. The announcement included an extension of the guarantee to UMP-AMIL to the end of next year. It involves subsidising the insurance premiums of obstetricians, neurosurgeons and GPs performing procedures. It is a scheme to meet 50 per cent of the cost of claims of payments greater than $2 million. It involves funding of the incurred but not reported liabilities, the IBNRs, by those medical defence organisations. It also includes a levy, over an extended period, to recoup the cost of funding these liabilities for members of the relevant MDOs.</para><para>I am pleased to note that the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission will now monitor medical indemnity insurance premiums to determine for us whether or not what is being charged is justified, and that is certainly positive. But what is all of this going to cost? It seems that it will cost around $246.5 million over four years. That is what the government has allocated in the mid-year review. As I stated earlier, I do not deny the need for the government to act in this area. However, I want to know why—and the midwives and parents, young mothers-to-be in particular, want to know why—this government has leapt to the aid of doctors but has not been prepared to look at the problems faced by other health professionals.</para><para>Prior to the withdrawal of insurance for midwives last year, there were about 150 midwives, all women, practising independently in this area—that is, those practising outside of hospitals. I am aware of the fact that a number of these women have continued to practise without insurance—a very risky thing indeed. But the problem has extended into our universities. While some of these issues have been dealt with, we still have problems with midwifery students and some nursing students actually getting insurance so that they can do their clinical placements and then graduate. </para><para>For those people who argue that midwives cannot get insurance because they pose too high a risk or that we really should not worry about insurance for midwives because Australian women prefer the medical model, I want to dispel those myths. Firstly, independent midwives cannot get insurance, despite the fact that midwife assisted pregnancy and delivery for healthy women is the preferred option for many women if that choice is available and despite the fact that there has never been a successful litigation against a registered midwife in Australia. The WHO recommends the midwife as:</para><quote><para>... the most appropriate and cost-effective type of health care provider to be assigned to the care of normal pregnancy and normal birth.</para></quote><para>The OECD countries with the lowest peri-natal mortality rates have maternity care systems in which midwives provide primary care for up to 80 per cent of pregnant women. The truth is that maternity services primarily delivered by midwives are safer, the rates of intervention are significantly lower, the rates for breastfeeding are significantly higher and Indigenous babies in particular seem to benefit, with fewer born underweight.</para><para>Now that we have dispelled the myths, let us go back to the government's approach. The health minister's comments in this area have not been consistent. She said:</para><quote><para>Medical indemnity, like all insurance, is facing significant issues. We have the state health ministers coming together with the medical defence organisations and leaders in that industry, with the medical profession itself, to address the medium, short and long term ... I think we need to look at the whole area, the whole field. It's very important we address the issues across the board.</para></quote><para>Most of us took that to mean the issues across the board, and working with the states to look at a true medical indemnity insurance package—not a doctor indemnity insurance package. Addressing the issues across the board would involve a closer look at why we have this medical indemnity crisis. If the government had begun to look at why, I think it could have sorted out some of those problems, particularly in the high-risk area of obstetrics. Why are the premiums for obstetricians spiralling? I understand that some of them pay up to $60,000 a year. Why are more women suing their obstetricians? What is the problem out there?</para><para>There are a range of other issues, besides ones relating specifically back to maternity services, such as the availability of other supports if the baby is facing long-term needs. We all know the disability payment for children is very small and quite difficult to access. Let us concentrate for a moment on the actual medical issues. Recent media reports suggest that up to 70 per cent of specialists will have left this area by 2012. I do not know whether this is simply scaremongering, but it is a constant reporting back of the number of specialists who feel like just walking away from the profession. I make it clear that I am certainly not attacking those professionals who are doing a tremendous job delivering babies, particularly those facing very difficult circumstances in rural and remote areas. They definitely deserve all our support. However, I think we need to look at the way we deliver maternity services as a whole in this country, because it is a huge part of the problem. It has to be addressed if we are to make any long-term changes.</para><para>For a range of reasons, Australia is locked into a highly specialised medical model for delivering normal babies. According to recent research by the University of Newcastle, the use of surgical procedures and drugs in childbirth is now so common that many women are doubting their ability to give birth naturally. Again, I am not criticising the doctors. It is becoming an expectation. Women are actually asking to have a caesarean. If their friend had a baby delivered by caesarean they think that is the way, so they ask their obstetrician. It is very difficult, in this litigious environment, for the obstetrician to say no. </para><para>If we look at the cost of this model, we see that it is wasting millions of dollars by treating healthy women, with normal pregnancy, as specialist cases. According to the author of some research from the University of Newcastle, Professor Kathleen Fahy:</para><quote><para>Women under the care of obstetricians will have twice as many caesareans as those being cared for by midwives. There is an absolute correlation that the more medical intervention there is, the more complications you will have ... With less medical intervention, you'll make less mistakes.</para></quote><para>We have an alarmingly high rate of obstetric intervention in Australia, and from the statistics it now seems that something like 80 per cent of births have some sort of medical intervention. That is a staggering figure given that the WHO suggest it should be somewhere around 15 to 20 per cent. In addition, our very high rate of caesarean births is some 15 per cent higher than the WHO target. Going with this high rate of intervention, the most recent maternal mortality report shows increased numbers of maternal deaths. Australia's high rate of intervention in childbirth is unsustainable. Each intervention increases the cost of maternity services as well as the risk of litigation.</para><para>I take this opportunity to suggest an alternative—it is only part of the solution to the professional indemnity crisis but it is something this government should consider working through with the states, because it would save an enormous amount in public health expenditure—and it is community based midwifery. We are not talking about a situation in which, when a women turns up at the hospital, the first person she sees as she is about to give birth is the midwife—until the doctor arrives. We are talking about community based midwifery, where she is supported throughout her pregnancy by the midwife. The midwife ensures that the home is ready for baby. The midwife will be there at birth, whether the woman chooses to give birth in hospital—which is what happens with the midwifery program in the northern suburbs of Adelaide—or the family chooses for the birth to happen at home. The midwife will then follow the woman through for the first few weeks of baby's life.</para><para>In New Zealand, this program of choice sees some 70 per cent of women choosing the community midwife as their primary care giver. Firstly, it delivers substantial costs. We have the potential in Australia to save an enormous amount of money for the state and federal health budgets. Secondly, it overcomes the problem of the withdrawal of obstetric specialists, by providing community midwifery services to complement them in their role in the health system. If it is right that in 10 years we will have only about 30 per cent of the current work force of obstetricians left, those who can take their place are the community midwives. The obstetricians will be there for those women who do need some surgical intervention and some specialist medical support.</para><para>Thirdly, it would improve the risk profile of Australia's maternity services by lowering intervention rates and reducing the likelihood of litigation. The experience in New Zealand has shown that the insurance problem can be largely resolved by providing women with the choice of a known midwife, by ensuring ongoing information and support throughout a pregnancy and by establishing appropriate counselling and mediation systems, where a woman's grief over a difficult birth where a healthy baby is not the end result is treated with respect. The woman is well supported to understand what happened and why rather than being treated defensively as a potential litigation risk.</para><para>Fourthly, it would bring Australia into line with international best practice. Fifthly, it would better meet the needs of Australian women. It would give them and their families a choice in terms of greater continuity and one-to-one care. Finally and sixthly, it would address the dramatic decline in regional maternity services in recent years as community midwifery services can be readily and cost-effectively established in urban and rural and regional settings.</para><para>To return to the amount of money I mentioned at the beginning of my speech, which was $35 million from the government, all the Australian College of Midwives wanted when they approached the federal government earlier this year was $1 million. At that stage that would have ensured the provision of insurance to community midwives then struggling to get insurance. And they were not struggling because of any risk. They were struggling to get insurance because insurance companies decided that they could not be bothered—there were not enough of them and they would simply write that whole area off their books to save any hassles and, indeed, any paperwork. </para><para>My final comment about this issue and this legislation is that the decision by the federal government to provide professional indemnity insurance for only a portion of the medical profession—only for doctors—appears to contravene the spirit of the national competition policy. It also directly conflicts with the many recommendations of some 30 state, territory and Commonwealth inquiries into maternity services since 1985. They have stated the need for midwifery-led community based care to enhance the care now provided by obstetricians. I believe that the time is now well and truly overdue for this government to take some leadership on this issue, to work cooperatively with the states and to tackle the professional indemnity problems for all health professionals and not just the chosen few. I foreshadow that I will move a second reading amendment—it has been circulated—which specifically deals with the lack of interest this government has in supporting midwives.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:32:00</time.stamp><page.no>7590</page.no><name role="metadata">Webber, Sen Ruth</name><name role="display">Senator WEBBER</name><name.id>00AOT</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Like the previous two speakers, I rise to express some concern about the narrowness of the government's response to the medical indemnity crisis confronting this country. In my view, these bills underpin the government's response to the medical indemnity crisis. They illustrate the bandaid approach that it adopts on most difficult issues. This reflects a very conservative approach to governing Australia. I think it was Woodrow Wilson who once said, `A conservative is a man who sits and thinks, but mostly sits.' This solution is the best that the government can come up with for a problem that has been confronting our country for quite some time. In a shallow view of the problem, the government addresses only the immediate difficulties confronted by UMP, AMIL and their members. The government does not examine whether the entire system of professional indemnity coverage is broken and in need of major reform. Rather, it uses this opportunity to apply a bandage and hopes that the system will limp along. The government does not seem to concern itself with the problems inherent in the system; it just concerns itself with papering over the cracks.</para></talk.start><para>In my view, there are two issues working within this crisis. The first relates to the need to provide medical indemnity coverage for UMP, AMIL and their members and for other organisations. The second relates to other professionals, particularly other health professionals, who are denied any form of cover at all. In the case of the members of UMP the bottom line is that this problem stems in part from one simple premise: it is not just the underfunding or the lack of fully funded policy but that, as with most medical defence organisations, their members pay the same fees for coverage regardless of their claim history. It is common practice in other forms of insurance that your claim history determines your level of risk and therefore your premium. It is incumbent on individuals and organisations, therefore, to reduce their risk—to engage in risk management as the main method of reducing premiums.</para><para>Most medical defence organisations take a different approach. Whether you have no claims, one claim or 100 claims, you get to pay basically the same premium. There is no benefit, therefore, in being a good doctor— one who has no claims made against them and one who has engaged in transparent and accountable risk management practices. You get to pay the same as the doctor down the road who has had claim after claim lodged against them. As I have mentioned before, the apologists for the current system and for the proposal to paper over the cracks will tell you that that is because this is not really an insurance scheme. We are told instead that it is a medical defence fund. It seems to me that professional indemnity coverage needs to be like any other kind of insurance fund and there needs to be a fully accountable and transparent process. When we are told that it is a medical defence fund, as I have said, we are told that if people have claims of negligence made against them then the fund steps in and either contests the action or settles the claim. Strictly speaking, that is correct. However, the general principles that hold true for other types of insurance should hold true in this case—including that if you take steps to minimise the causes of litigation then litigation is reduced. </para><para>Insurance companies expend enormous effort in ensuring that risk is minimised to limit costs. A medical defence fund should operate on the same basis. As John Castles, the President of Professions Australia, has said recently, `Good risk management averts litigation.' So here the government has a chance to address a major failing of the system. Why did the government not insist that UMP and other like organisations look to risk management as a means of operation? Instead, from day one the government focused on using a bandaid to address this crisis. The government initially sat on its hands and then extended support to the fund to allow it to continue operating only when it looked like it was going to fall over. The government claims that the problem was that the cost of membership of UMP and other funds had reached the point where the indemnity cover was becoming unaffordable. The perceived result was that doctors would withdraw from practice or restrict their activities to low-risk procedures.</para><para>But the fact remains that this government has singularly failed to take full advantage of this opportunity to fix the entire system. A scheme should have been created that rewarded those doctors who engaged in risk management. Indeed, a scheme should have been created that covered all health professionals, not just doctors. A scheme should have been created that rewarded those doctors who did not make any claims. Instead, we get another bandaid approach, the Australian taxpayers get to foot the bill and still we have no firm commitment as to what it is going to cost in the long run.</para><para>This approach is similar to that which has been adopted with insurance generally—that is, the major reform to the system will restrict the rights of individuals to seek redress for injury as a result of negligence. But did the government fully examine all of the other options? We are told that they did, but the bottom line is that the government decided that real reform of this system was way beyond them. What we get instead is window-dressing. We get a cobbled together solution that does not address the underlying problems and solves only the immediate need of ensuring that all doctors—and, as Senator Lees has pointed out, only doctors—who are members of medical defence organisations have medical indemnity cover.</para><para>The second failure of this government is in not addressing the needs of health and other professionals. There is a crisis; there is no doubt that there is a crisis. But this crisis extends much more broadly than just to doctors. All this government has addressed so far in this debate is the specific issue confronting doctors. As Senator Ridgeway has raised in this place a number of times and as Senator Lees has spoken of more recently, the crisis of cover extends to other professionals, especially to independent midwives. I have had several meetings with independent midwives in Western Australia in relation to this problem. Without the foresight of Western Australia's own Minister for Health, Bob Kucera, and his willingness to find a solution, there would now be no independent midwives practising in my home state.</para><para>The government's short-term expedient solution only works for doctors. One has to wonder whether it is because they are running scared from the AMA. Solutions in this day and age should not be constructed in isolation; solutions should require an approach that addresses all elements of the problem. The government provide a single approach for a very complex issue. They will fix the immediate concerns of all doctors who are members of UMP, AMIL and so on, and the rest of the medical professions can look after themselves. Just like their approach in other portfolios, they shift the responsibility to others—in this case, the states. The states can go out and fix tort law and limit or extinguish individuals' rights to seek redress. Rather than look at the whole system, we get a stop-gap, short-term solution.</para><para>Why did the government not consider a system that addressed these problems for all health and other professionals? One has to wonder whether it is because it was all too hard. The key, as Professions Australia point out, is not to do with proportionate liability, because that approach is all about benefiting mainly the professions, not the community they serve. Rather than just accepting a stop-gap, bandaid approach to the problem, this group seem to be prepared to offer alternatives. The alternative offered by Professions Australia, which they recommended to COAG recently, is the adoption of a risk management strategy as it applies in New South Wales under the Professional Standards Act. As their recent correspondence to most of us in this place states: </para><quote><para>Professional standards schemes are designed to help protect consumers. They are legally binding arrangements which aim to improve the standards of members of professional and other occupational groups.</para></quote><para>Whereas the government's response is about propping up, as a temporary expedient, a system that is not working, Professions Australia recommend changing the system entirely to allow it to operate more effectively in the future. Rather than simply restricting consumers' rights, surely the government should be keen to look at any change to the system that would reduce the number of cases litigated. Risk management and other reforms have a major impact on the number of cases and the way they are litigated. But, perhaps again, that is all too hard. Professions Australia go on to say:</para><quote><para>Risk management has other benefits too. Having effective complaints and discipline arrangements means that shonky practitioners can be weeded out following customer complaints, be expelled from their association, and become ineligible for limitations on liability.</para></quote><para>In other words, it is not just about reducing the rights of individuals to seek redress, it is not just about getting the states to engage in law reform, it is not just about propping up the existing system.</para><para>The government had an opportunity with this legislation to bring about very real reform. There was an opportunity to look at the success of the New South Wales Professional Standards Act and how it has reduced litigation. The government also had the opportunity to develop a transparent and accountable mechanism for regulating professional conduct. Instead, the government took the soft option. It refused to take on the members of what is perhaps Australia's most militant union, the AMA, and just bailed them out with little or no requirement for them to make any real changes.</para><para>In my view, this legislation fails on two grounds. Firstly, it does not fully attempt to enforce risk management or other strategies to limit litigation. There is no real attempt to identify the shonky practitioners or identify procedures that would minimise risk. Secondly, there is no attempt to address the legitimate concerns of other professionals, particularly midwives. This legislation is, of course, required because the government has taken so long to address this problem and has done nothing. Without this legislation there is a very real risk that Australians will be without adequate medical practitioner coverage. However, the fact that it is required should not exonerate the failings of the government's approach. Ad hoc, short-term, expedient approaches do not provide lasting solutions.</para><para>Senator RIDGEWAY (New South Wales) (5.44 p.m.)—On behalf of Senator Allison, I seek leave to incorporate her speech in the second reading debate on these medical indemnity bills.</para><para>Leave granted.</para><para><inline font-style="italic">The speech read as follows.</inline></para><para>I rise to speak on the Medical Indemnity and Associated Bills 2002</para><para>The explanatory memorandum states that these Bills provide for</para><para>·	Commonwealth payments in relation to claims forming part of unfunded incurred but not reported (IBNR) liability of medical defence organisations as at 30th June 2002;</para><para>·	Commonwealth payments in relation to the part of the cost of large claims against MDOs or medical indemnity insurers in relation to incidents notified after 1 January 2003;</para><para>·	Subsidies to assist medical practitioners in meeting the cost of indemnity coverage;</para><para>·	Payments by members of MDOs to the Commonwealth to cover the cost to the Commonwealth of payments in relation to unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities; </para><para>·	Payments to members of United Medical Protection Limited (UMP) to the Commonwealth to cover the cost to the Commonwealth of any payments under the deed of indemnity between the Commonwealth, UMP, Australasian Medical Insurance Limited (AMIL) and the provisional liquidator of UMP/AMIL.</para><para>The package of legislative reforms is designed to ease the pressure being placed on providers of medical indemnity. However there are grave concerns that the Bills do not prevent the situation providers have found themselves in, from happening again.</para><para>This situation is a direct result of the business practices of MDO's who have failed to ensure that their risks were covered. There has been a total failure of insurers who had a responsibility to the doctors and specialists who were paying them and to the general public who were relying on the doctors.</para><para>The general public already pay, they pay for Medicare and in many cases as is encouraged by this government pay for private health insurance. They have an expectation that the doctors and specialists will be there to treat them.</para><para>The crisis in Medical Indemnity insurance has shaken that expectation. People can no longer be confident that their doctors will be available. They certainly cannot be confident that midwives will be available for home births. This affects all areas of health provision, from specialists to GPs and midwives, from public to private hospitals.</para><para>There are essentially two options open to the Government: take no action, and let market forces determine a solution; or intervene to address the IBNR issue, reduce uncertainty around large claims, and ensure that doctors could have access to affordable indemnity cover.</para><para>Not taking action in relation to UMP would lead to large numbers of doctors covered by UMP becoming uninsured and consequently withdrawing from providing medical services. It would also result in many persons with successful claims against doctors arising from past incidents arising in the course of medical practice being unable to recover damages except from the doctor's own assets.</para><para>One of the features of liability insurance and the main cause of the current crisis, is the many years between when an injury occurs and the time an insurer receives notice of the claim.</para><para>These claims have occurred but cannot be notified to the Medical Defence Organisations. The MDO is unable to access the amount of money they will need in reserve to meet the costs of these claims.</para><para>Medical Defence Organisations chose not to calculate the costs of these IBNR's when they were charging for insurance. This failure has led to the collapse of the industry and the need for the government to help these MDO's to pay for claims, which they had not adequately provided for in the past.</para><para>The Medical Indemnity Bill 2002 puts in place a scheme to fund the incurred but not reported liabilities of medical defence organisations where they do not have adequate reserves to cover these liabilities.</para><para>It is estimated that one MDO alone; UMP which has insured over 60% of the medical workforce, has unfunded IBNR's of $460 million. Meeting the cost of unfunded IBNR's as they emerge will remove the liability in relation to these costs from the balance sheets of MDO's that have not fully provided for these liabilities and ensure that these claims will be met as they emerge.</para><para>The Government has said it will fund IBNR's of doctors that were in MDO's at 30 June 2000 where the IBNR's are unfunded. For unfunded IBNR's there will be a levy imposed on the members. A contribution, spread over a number of years, from members of medical defence organisations with unfunded IBNR's to cover the cost of Commonwealth assistance in meeting those liabilities.</para><para>Beginning in 2003-2004 financial year, the levy payment by doctors to meet the cost of IBNR payments will run over five years. Doctors who have to pay the levy, which will be limited to 50% of their 2000-2001 premium, can either pay a lump sum, pay by instalments or they can defer payments for a year.</para><para>There is no doubt that this will place our GPs under additional financial pressure, in fact the government has recognised this, that is why they are attempting to ease the pain by spreading the contribution out over a number of years.</para><para>There has already been a large increase in the cost to medical practitioners of subscribing to MDO's. In some cases doctors have been paying over a third of their income for indemnity cover, and deciding to leave the profession altogether or cease certain high-risk procedures such as obstetrics.</para><para>The second systemic issue is that the uncertainty around large claims had led to commercial insurers either deciding not to enter the market or else deciding to leave the market, thus reducing competition. </para><para>Increased financial pressure is the last thing doctor's need. We are already seeing a crisis in bulk billing due to the costs facing doctors.</para><para>We have seen the second consecutive largest annual decline in GP bulk billing.</para><para>Australian families are paying more for a trip to the GP than ever before. Health Insurance Commission figures for the September quarter saw the average cost to see a doctor who does not bulk bill is now $12.57. Up 51 since the Howard Government came to office.</para><para>The government has made much of the argument that bulk billing is still practiced by an average of 70% of doctors. An average figure means little to those who live in rural and regional areas, little to those who live in suburbs where they have to travel to find the doctors that do bulk bill.</para><para>In rural areas the odds of seeing a bulk-billing doctor are stacked against you. There are few GP's available and those that are cannot afford to practice bulk billing.</para><para>These people don't have the luxury of making the choice many people are being forced to make; that is of travelling out of their way to visit a doctor who bulk bills. The reality is that if your area doesn't have a bulk-billing doctor you have three choices; pay the money, go to the public hospital or don't see a doctor.</para><para>Medicare was not designed to give access to a health system through the public hospital system. There is simply no way a hospital can run a medical service similar to the local doctor surgery and it should not have to, but increasingly that is what it has been forced to do.</para><para>So we have a rolling effect, the problems with medical indemnity have added to the pressure on GPs who are already under enough pressure and have already begun to cut back on bulk billing, those who can't afford to see a doctor go to the public hospital and add to the problems the public hospital is experiencing by clogging up the emergency section with ailments that should be seen to by a GP.</para><para>Whilst the debate on these bills has focussed quite rightly on catastrophic injury claims and access to specialists, I would like to draw you a simple example of the effect of the loss of bulk billing to your average family in any part of Australia.</para><para>A trip to the doctor can cost between $32-$4l. Many will send the claim straight off to Medicare for you, but many don't so that means paying upfront. Now $32 may not mean much to those of us here, but it can be quite a bit out of one's budget. Anyone who has had children will know that they often need to go back to the doctor within the same week, bringing the cost to $64. Most families will tell you that when one child is ill the others tend to follow so a family of three or more can face costs that go over $96 for doctors' visits. Add prescription medicine to that cost and you have quite a hole in your weekly expenditure.</para><para>I would like to remind the Senate that one of the first actions of this government was to close Medicare offices around Australia. This has made it almost impossible to recoup money quickly enough to assist the weekly budgeting of the average family. This has affected those with small children; it has affected the elderly, those who work and those without transport. They now have to add the stress of travel to Medicare offices to the stress of coping with an illness.</para><para>Many parents faced with this stress won't take the kids back for the second check up, they may not collect the second lot of antibiotics and they risk their children developing illnesses such as ear infections which can lead to long term levels of deafness. It can lead a parent who has two sick children already to hold off taking the third to the doctor when they need to. Or lead to three children waiting for hours at night in the public hospital emergency room to see a doctor.</para><para>Medicare was put in place to protect these people. Too often we hear of the necessary but dramatic examples of people needing doctors when we talk of Medicare but we need to stay aware of the day-to-day burdens on GP's and families. Your GP is your first line of defence in protecting you and your children. A childhood illness or illness affecting the elderly can develop into a medical emergency all to easily. A GP should be able to present an accessible determination and treatment before that stage.</para><para>Medicare was designed to be a universal system to provide access to health regardless of your ability to pay. It was built on the premise that people in a country like Australia, should not have to risk their health or their family's health because they cannot afford a doctor.</para><para>We need to be protecting this premise, and as a government working to restore the public's faith in a system designed to assist them. Our nation cannot afford to be in the situation it finds itself today.</para><para>In closing I would like to note that although the Government has undertaken to keep the medical indemnity sector under review and ask the ACCC to monitor the costs of medical indemnity cover. This package does not contain measures to monitor the effectiveness of the Governments assistance in reducing costs of medical indemnity or any prudential measures to address the operations of medical indemnity providers. </para><para>Senator Ridgeway has carriage of this legislation for the Democrats but I will be moving an amendment in the committee stage on the subject of tobacco smoking. It may be the case that the definition of recreational services under the Trade Practices Amendment (Liability for Recreational Services) Bill 2002 does not include smoking but we would like to be absolutely sure that this is the case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>7595</page.no><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator HARRADINE</name><name.id>6H4</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>IND</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to speak on the <inline ref="R1677">Medical Indemnity Bill 2002</inline> and related legislation before the Senate. This legislation was brought on by the collapse of United Medical Protection and its subsidiary, Australasian Medical Insurance Ltd, on 3 May this year. Most of my concerns relate to a bill yet to reach the Senate, but these matters are all closely related. I understand that the Assistant Treasurer, Senator Coonan, will be consulting further with Tasmanian practitioners and the Tasmanian government to work through some of these concerns.</para></talk.start><para>In my own state of Tasmania, the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania, which covers 80 per cent of practising doctors, has not had any financial problems and has been offering coverage to doctors for over 100 years. Under the changes proposed by the government, the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania and other discretionary medical defence organisations will have to move to a new insurance model. While I support making the regulatory system stronger to protect doctors and their patients from the risk of a medical defence organisation collapsing, I am concerned that this might mean fewer benefits to members for an increased cost, especially when the Tasmanian organisation has been run without apparent difficulty under the current legislation.</para><para>I am concerned that the legislation encourages medical defence organisations to offer the more limited `claims made' cover rather than the `claims incurred' cover offered by the Tasmanian MDO. Under a `claims made' cover, a doctor must be a member of the medical defence organisation not only at the time an incident occurs but also at the time it is reported to the defence fund. `Claims incurred' cover would allow doctors to be covered whenever the claim is incurred as long as they were members when the incident occurred. This is obviously a more flexible option. The `one-size-fits-all' insurance model will benefit those medical defence organisations which have found themselves in financial trouble but will lead to increased costs for the many successful groups offering coverage to doctors.</para><para>Once again, I support minimising risks through a good regulatory regime, but I am concerned that the poor management of some MDOs is impacting negatively on the cost of coverage for Tasmanian doctors. I understand that the Australian Prudential Regulation Authority has agreed that the new insurance model means that doctors may have court decisions awarding damages against them that are higher than their policy cover. That is obviously something that concerns medical practitioners and is something that will need further discussion with the Minister for Health and Ageing.</para><para>The new legislation is expected to lead to a rise in premiums for many doctors who had cover with funds who were not in financial trouble—who had made provisions for liabilities arising from incurred but not reported claims and who would be able to cover claims against their members. The Medical Protection Society of Tasmania estimates that its expenses in moving to the new model will be approximately $1 million in set-up costs, extra administrative fees of $500,000 per annum and an extra $5 million in capital. This is likely to cost each member of the Tasmanian group around $1,500 per annum for four to five years—and this is of concern to patients down the track. In the end, those patients will bear some of the impact from these increased costs. It is, of course, good that there will be protection against the possibility that an MDO may collapse, but the average Tasmanian will be paying for this as costs are passed on to them. The Medical Protection Society of Tasmania is not unregulated; it is subject to Commonwealth and state corporations legislation. Perhaps a system of prudential regulation can be negotiated which can build on this regulation while having a smaller impact on costs, or the impact of the transition to the new regime can be minimised. </para><para>I will not repeat what I have said before about midwives but, as I have also said before, I am very disappointed that midwives are not included in this medical indemnity package, and I urge the government to do so for all the reasons that have been given. I fully support the need for the government to address the problem of medical indemnity but I want to highlight the impact of these changes and the concerns of my constituents. I urge the government and, in particular, Senator Coonan to talk to the Medical Protection Society of Tasmania, the state branch of the AMA, and other interested bodies so that their concerns can be taken into account in establishing this new legislative regime. I have received correspondence from Senator Coonan to say that that is her intention, and I look forward to hearing further on how the consultations are proceeding.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>17:50:00</time.stamp><page.no>7596</page.no><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name><name.id>LI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Health and Ageing</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to take a bit of time to respond to some of the issues that have been raised, because I presume that we are not going to have a long committee stage. I think it is appropriate that, in summing up, I therefore respond to some of the comments that have been made.</para></talk.start><para>The <inline ref="R1677">Medical Indemnity Bill 2002</inline> and related bills deal with many of the issues facing medical indemnity insurance. It is probably the most difficult thing that has not been totally health related which has faced Health. It has crossed portfolios—not just Health but Treasury, Attorney-General's, and Prime Minister and Cabinet—with the Prime Minister seeing it as such an important issue that he appointed Mr Max Moore-Wilton to chair the interdepartmental committee to address this issue.</para><para>Not only was it an issue for the Commonwealth; it was also an issue for the states in addressing tort law reform, and I have to give credit to Senator Coonan for the role she has played in driving the issue of tort law reform in the states. We had a meeting here in Canberra on, I think, 23 April with about 80 people, including all the health ministers from every state and territory, all the medical defence organisations, the chairmen and presidents of all the colleges and the plaintiff lawyers. Anybody who was anybody and who had anything interesting to say about medical indemnity was gathered in that room just after Easter to try to address the issue.</para><para>Some of the comments that have been made here are very far from the truth in the sense that the government has not consulted and has acted in haste. We have done a huge amount of work. It is not normal in the chamber to pay tribute to senior public servants, but some people in both Treasury and Health have worked inordinate hours since Easter. Some of them—this issue rose just before Easter; I think the Prime Minister had a meeting with some senior medical people on Easter Thursday—worked all over Easter and have worked weekends and day in, day out since them. For anybody to come in here and say that it is a knee-jerk reaction or it is a quick and dirty fix does not understand the process that has gone on behind the scenes.</para><para>Sometimes we were hindered. For example, with the guarantee, we had to wait until the Supreme Court in New South Wales could accept the guarantee because the court had to be sure that the various creditors of UMP-AMIL were being treated equally, not just the doctors. Some doctors thought there was something untoward about our guarantee when it was a need to make sure that all creditors were dealt with. It has been a very long process. I want to put on the public record my appreciation to my colleague Senator Coonan for her cooperation, to Mr Max Moore-Wilton, who chaired the committee, to all those officers who worked on the RDC and to all the officers who supported it. It has been an inordinately difficult task to address. I remind people that the issue was of no making of any government but arose for a whole number of complex reasons.</para><para>The package of legislation deals with many of the issues facing medical indemnity insurance. It removes the burden of unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities from the industry. This means that medical defence organisations that have properly provisioned for these liabilities can make a fresh start and have their slates wiped clean. If the government had not acted in this way, in all likelihood UMP would have been placed in full liquidation by now, with an excess of liabilities over assets of $460 million. Inordinate calls would have been made on those doctors who are members. It would have left the Australian community facing enormous difficulties in getting medical services. Some 60 per cent of doctors across Australia would have been uninsured for incidents arising from their practice over many years. We would have faced the imminent prospect of these doctors withdrawing from service until they could find appropriate cover. The remaining six medical defence organisations could well have faced considerable pressures in dealing with an influx of doctors trying to buy alternative cover. </para><para>The legislation allows UMP and any other medical defence organisation with unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities to move forward into the future in a much better financial position and ensures that they are better placed to continue to offer medical indemnity cover to their members. Some doctors have expressed concern at the prospect of having to pay for the incurred but not reported liabilities over a period of years through the contribution legislation. Frankly, without the government's action, UMP doctors would have been facing a loss of cover and considerable uncertainty. They would not have had any idea what their premiums would have been to cover those incurred but not reported liabilities. Now they are able to predict, based on what their premium was last year. For members of other medical defence organisations with some unfunded incurred but not reported liabilities, they could well have been facing a call involving a payment of an additional year's premium.</para><para>The legislation ensures that the contribution is affordable for doctors. It will be spread over a number of years and is limited to a maximum of 50 per cent of the premium that doctors paid in 2000-01—the sort of predictability that they would not have had had we not given them this guarantee. It is also important for the Senate to note that the only reason that doctors are having to make an additional contribution now is that the premiums they were paying in the past were not sufficient to cover these incurred but not reported claims. I understand that many members of one professional group withdrew from UMP several years ago because they were worried that their premiums were too low, and they looked for insurance elsewhere. It is unfortunate that the board of UMP did not share the same insight. I recently met a doctor in Queensland who had been concerned about not having had her payments taken automatically out of her bank account for two years, and she suddenly found she was not insured. She withdrew from UMP-AMIL and moved on to another insurer. So some people have looked and have decided to go elsewhere.</para><para>The legislation provides for the Commonwealth to co-fund half of all payments by medical defence organisations over $2 million in respect of claims notified after 1 January next year. This is an important measure as it will reduce the uncertainty around high-cost claims and remove one of the factors discouraging general insurers from entering the medical indemnity market. It should exert a downward pressure on premiums, as it should allow medical defence organisations to negotiate considerable reduced reinsurance premiums as their reinsurance contracts come up for renewal. This, in turn, will lead to benefits for members, with reductions in premiums that would otherwise have been payable by them.</para><para>In addition, the legislation also allows for the government to pay premium subsidies to doctors. We have already indicated that these subsidies are intended to apply to obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs. Under the subsidy scheme, selected doctors will be subsidised half of the difference between the premiums they pay and the premium of a comparative group. The government's medical indemnity package is not limited to the legislation before the Senate today. Action is also occurring in other areas. Legislation to give statutory backing to the guarantee to the provisional liquidator of UMP was passed earlier in these sittings. Legislation to bring medical indemnity insurers under an improved regulatory regime will be introduced into parliament this week.</para><para>As senators will be aware, the Commonwealth continues to work with the states in support of coordinated national tort law reform. I cannot put enough emphasis on the fact that states really need to make sure they keep that commitment they made in that recent meeting—to come together and get tort law reform as coordinated as possible between the states. Some are moving a little faster than others. All senators here need to make sure that their states are pulling their weight. Senator Coonan established the Ipp review of the law of negligence, and we continue to encourage the states to implement its findings through the ministerial meetings on public liability insurance. As I said, it is being chaired by Senator Coonan, the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer. I do not think she could have done any more from when we met on 23 April when we tried to make sure that the states understood the need for consistent tort law reform. Senator Coonan has pursued this relentlessly over the past year. Moreover, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission has been asked to monitor medical indemnity premiums to make sure that they are soundly based. </para><para>A number of senators have said that the government have not been active in this area. We have been very active in resolving these medical indemnity issues as they have emerged over the past year. They are complex problems to resolve and we have worked long and hard, and as quickly and as carefully as possible, to resolve them. We did not play any part in creating the problems in the medical indemnity market, but we have responded quickly from the time that problems with UMP emerged earlier this year to ensure that doctors could continue to practise and that the Australian public had continued access to services. We offered a guarantee to UMP before it placed itself into provisional liquidation. We offered a guarantee to the provisional liquidator to allow him to continue to make payments and accept renewals once UMP had gone into provisional liquidation. We have also passed legislation to give statutory backing to that guarantee. The government have not developed this package of measures in a vacuum. We have consulted widely and at length with a range of medical, insurance and other groups so that we could develop a workable solution to the problems in the medical indemnity area. The results of that process are in the legislation before us today.</para><para>A number of senators have talked about the issues of midwives and Indigenous community services. The focus of the legislation today is on ensuring that private medical services can continue to be provided to the Australian community and that medical indemnity cover is affordable for members of medical defence organisations. It is fair to say that midwives do not purchase medical indemnity insurance from medical defence organisations. When they purchase cover it is usually from a general insurer. That said, birthing services are still available in the community. Nearly all midwives can continue to provide services to pregnant women and their babies. This is because some 97 per cent of midwives are employees, so they are covered by their employers' indemnity insurance. They work either for public or private hospitals or for an agency. But, in any event, their employers ought to indemnify them.</para><para>I am aware that some self-employed midwives have had difficulty in obtaining cover. I appreciate that these midwives face issues of availability of indemnity cover rather than of its affordability. However, I do not believe that the Commonwealth should be in the business of providing cover as some sort of insurer of last resort. Indeed, not even the Midwives Association is suggesting that as an option. I was pleased to hear that the Western Australian and ACT governments have apparently extended the coverage they offer employed midwives to self-employed midwives. I would encourage other jurisdictions to consider making similar arrangements. Importantly, the legislation before the Senate does provide that the high cost indemnity arrangements extend to all health professionals required to be registered under state law. Hopefully, this will result in some downward pressure on premiums for midwives.</para><para>The Commonwealth proposes to subsidise only obstetricians, neurosurgeons and procedural GPs. It has no plans to extend premium subsidies to midwives. There are a number of reasons for that. It has been suggested that it is discriminatory to treat midwives differently from obstetricians. However, the reality is that midwives, like most other non-medical health professionals, are not covered under Medicare. Consequently, there is no reason to extend premium subsidies to them and not to other non-medical groups that are facing large increases in premiums. The High Cost Claims Scheme should provide downward pressure on premiums in the short term while tort law reform measures are put in place and begin to work. There is a need for all senators to make sure that their states are keeping up their side of the bargain in tort law reform. </para><para>With respect to comments made by Senator Ridgeway regarding Indigenous medical services, the government recognise the important role played by Aboriginal medical services. That is why we have allocated $257 million in funding to them for the year 2003-04, which is an 89 per cent increase in funding since 1996. My information is that the insurance premiums of Aboriginal medical services still represent only a small percentage of the funding we provide. My understanding is that all of these services have managed to find insurance and continue to operate. The whole community is currently experiencing the effects of the global downturn in the insurance industry in the form of higher premiums and more limited availability. Again, this is not a situation of the government's making, but we are working hard to address the broader issues of professional indemnity and public liability insurance through the joint Commonwealth-state processes chaired by my colleague Senator Coonan. In the meantime, we agree that it is regrettable that these services are suffering from increased insurance expenses, but an 89 per cent increase in funding should assist in offsetting this. </para><para>Senator Ridgeway also talked about the lack of prudential regulation in the package. In answer to Senator Ridgeway, this issue has been addressed by the government today. A bill has been introduced which sets out a comprehensive package of reforms for the prudential regulation of defence organisations. I believe that all of the concerns raised by the Democrats have been addressed in that bill.</para><para>The government considered the issue of a long-term care scheme in detail. I am aware of the personal impact on people with catastrophic injuries and those who care for them. However, we have concurred that to try and develop a long-term care costs scheme at this stage is not the best way of dealing with the current issues around medical indemnity insurance. The real impact of long-term care costs on medical indemnity is the uncertainty that such costs create for insurers. What needs to happen right now, amongst other things, is to ensure that adequate cover is available where incidents result in a catastrophic injury to a patient. This means addressing the fact that insurance markets at present have little appetite for taking on large and uncertain risks such as medical indemnity. This legislation addresses the insurance issue by meeting 50 per cent of the cost of payouts by medical indemnity providers above $2 million. This will significantly reduce the uncertainty associated with high-cost claims in medical indemnity insurance.</para><para>In reality, the vast majority of people needing long-term care are injured at work or in motor vehicle accidents, not in medical incidents. These people are covered by workers compensation and traffic accident schemes run by the states. Even now, states such as Victoria and Tasmania, which have effective long-term care schemes for traffic accident victims, could add to their scheme people with long-term care needs arising from medical misadventure if they wished to. The Commonwealth will continue to work with the states and territories through the Heads of Treasuries Insurance Issues Working Group in exploring options around long-term care costs. But we do not see action in this area as a short-term solution to medical indemnity issues.</para><para>I hope I have been able to at least deal with some of the issues that senators have raised. Senator Harradine raised an issue about a Tasmanian medical defence organisation. </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>6H4</name.id><name role="metadata">Harradine, Sen Brian</name><name role="display"></name></talker></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>LI4</name.id><name role="metadata">Patterson, Sen Kay</name><name role="display">Senator PATTERSON</name></talker><para>—I was just trying to respond because you mentioned it.

The opposition welcomes the slight movement demonstrated by the government and we will be supporting most of the amendments. But it has to be said that there are still significant differences between the government and the opposition on this bill. There is a range of issues that in our view require being addressed by this committee. These include that this must be a questioning regime not a detention regime; that those being questioned must have access to a lawyer of their choice; that children under the age of 18 should not be subjected to this questioning regime; and that there must be a sunset clause. Later in this committee stage, the opposition will be moving amendments to overcome these concerns.</para><para>In the debate on the ASIO legislation the Senate will have the opportunity to give ASIO much-needed new powers to counter the enhanced terrorist threat that we face. Most importantly, we will also have the opportunity to ensure that those who are subjected to these powers will have appropriate protections. Our obligation in this parliament is to get the balance right on this legislation. We achieved that, I believe, earlier in the year on the antiterrorism bills, and it is just as important that we work towards getting the balance right on this legislation. I do not believe that such a task, such an objective, is beyond the capacity of the Senate, and I hope that at the end of this committee stage we will have achieved that important objective.</para><para>In relation to the amendment before the chair, senators would be aware that the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD put, in their unanimous advisory report, a very strong case for inserting a sunset clause into this bill. We say that such a sunset clause, such an approach, is an appropriate and simple but absolutely essential accountability mechanism. It sends a very powerful message to the public that the government will need to account for, and argue the case for, the continuation of these unprecedented laws. A controversial piece of legislation which has a sunset clause has to be publicly debated, and a government is obligated to defend the continuation of such laws. Of course, a sunset clause is very simple in design but it sends, I think, a confidence boosting message to the Australian public. Such clauses in this area are not without precedent, and it is worth this committee noting the fact that a sunset provision applies in the USA PATRIOT Act. The use of a sunset clause and the review of the act by the PJC, as is proposed by the Attorney-General, should be linked to maximise the quality of the review. The timing of the committee's review will ensure that the government could, if necessary, prepare and introduce a replacement bill when the relevant part of the act expires.</para><para>The opposition strongly supports the inclusion of a three-year sunset clause. Let us be clear what it means. It means that at the end of three years the act will terminate. If such a sunset clause is agreed to, it will be up to the government of the day to argue for the continuation of these unprecedented laws— the proposed powers in this legislation. This is an absolutely essential safeguard in this legislation. I commend this amendment to the committee. It has received strong support throughout the parliamentary committees that have examined this legislation. The good sense of this approach with such unprecedented laws commends itself to the parliament, and I urge the committee to support the amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:21:00</time.stamp><page.no>7601</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have a question for the minister.

Is the government going to formally respond to that report? That is normally done within three months, although this is not a classic report in the sense that it is from a reference committee or a legislation committee. I am not sure whether the government is absolutely obliged in a legal sense to respond. Even if it is not, I would be interested to know whether it is going to respond to that report, given the fact that the government itself commissioned the report, given the fact that it urged the committee to get on with its report and given the fact that the committee was able to bring forward its report to assist the government. Looking at this legislation, it is apparent that 10 of the recommendations have been picked up, two have been partially picked up and three have been rejected. We do not know the specific reasons why some have been picked up and others rejected or only partially picked up.

As Senator Faulkner outlined, this is an extremely controversial piece of legislation. Even if the amendments proposed by the Australian Labor Party and the government proceed, we are left with legislation that allows for the detention of nonsuspects—that is, it allows for the detention of people who are not even suspected of being involved in any terrorist activity. This goes far beyond the scope of legislation put forward in the United Kingdom and in the United States in response to September 11. When in the course of the committee stage we speak about the amendments put forward by the Labor Party I am sure that we will have the opportunity to look at this further. These proposals do not change the nature of this bill to make it just about a questioning regime; they continue to allow for the detention of nonsuspects. We will have the opportunity to get on to that in the course of the debate on the proposed amendments in the committee stage.</para></talk.start><para>The legislation before us fundamentally undermines the basic tenet of our legal system that nobody should be detained unless they have come before a court and have been found to be reasonably suspected or guilty of committing a crime. We now have an amendment that seeks to put a sunset clause in place. The Australian Greens will be supporting this sunset clause. In the process we have been through with this bill, a phenomenal amount of evidence has been put forward about the ways in which our current criminal justice system allows for the government's and ASIO's concerns about questioning people. In the course of putting forward this legislation, the government have not put their case as to why we need to change what we already have in our criminal justice system to deal with these sorts of concerns. We welcome the proposal to put in place a sunset clause that means the government have to try again in three years time to put their case for needing these extended powers. As such, we will be supporting this opposition amendment.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:26:00</time.stamp><page.no>7602</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Hindsight can be a wonderful thing. The insertion of a sunset clause will present an opportunity—it will make hindsight mandatory—for a parliamentary review three years hence of this controversial legislation which has caused considerable anxiety in sections of the community. A sunset clause of this nature will mean that the next federal government, be that a coalition or a Labor government, will have to completely review this legislation with a view to leaving it off the statutes altogether or reforming it in some way. If implemented, this three-year sunset clause will take us beyond the next election. In that context, I ask Senator Faulkner as the mover of the amendment if there is any historical precedent for a three-year sunset clause as opposed to, for example, two years or five years. Was the object of this amendment in part to take the legislation beyond the next federal election so that it would be a new parliament reviewing it in three years time, or is there some precedent for the specific time period of three years? We Democrats will certainly support a sunset clause, but I ask why is it a period of three years as opposed to some other time frame? </para></talk.start></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>18:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>7603</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I hope that Senator Greig is not suggesting the opposition would have opportunistic motives relating to the electoral cycle. I know Senator Greig is a very good mathematician, and of course it is true that if a three-year sunset clause were established it would take effect in a political cycle subsequent to the current one. The substantive point that the senator makes is an accurate one, and all of us who understand that we have three-year terms for the federal parliament in this country realise that a three-year sunset clause inevitably means that it would apply in a subsequent political cycle.</para></talk.start><para><inline font-weight="bold">Sitting suspended from 6.30 p.m. to 7.30 p.m.</inline></para><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—We were talking before the break about the proposal that a sunset clause be added to the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. Senator Greig, I think appropriately, questioned the decision of the opposition to propose a sunset clause with a time period of three years. We agreed before the dinner break that this would be likely to come into effect in the middle of the next political cycle. We can certainly say definitively that it would be after the next election. I think it is also fair to say that a period of three years does give an adequate period of time for us to see how effectively this legislation works, and three years is of course the time period that has now been recommended by three parliamentary committees. The Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD have made this recommendation as have the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee and the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I think it is an appropriate period for a sunset clause.</para></talk.start></continue><para>It is also fair to say that it is not common for the parliament to agree to sunset clauses in legislation. It is a most unusual circumstance, particularly in legislation like this. There are times when parliament agrees to a sunset clause for legislation on superannuation or tax, or agricultural levies and the like. But it is unusual—and I do think this is a proper point to make—for the parliament to agree to a sunset clause effectively because legislation is controversial. That is, of course, a key reason why this amendment is being proposed. It will give us an opportunity to consider how effective this regime has been after a reasonable period in which to make an assessment. It will require the parliament to agree to the regime if it is to continue after a three-year period. It will give us a capacity to review its effectiveness, and it will require the government to put forward a case for the efficacy of the legislation and both houses of the parliament to agree to such a regime continuing in force.</para><para>I say quite seriously that, even though the legislation itself is absolutely unprecedented—it does give unprecedented powers to ASIO—it is almost unprecedented for parliament to agree to such a sunset clause in legislation like this. It is not proposed lightly by the opposition—which, for example, as this committee would recall, would not contemplate a sunset clause in the antiterrorism legislation that was dealt with earlier this year. Those are some of the sorts of issues that were weighed up in determining the appropriate time period. I can say to Senate Greig that committees of the parliament did receive evidence on this and I feel that the amendment I have moved on behalf of the opposition puts forward a sunset clause of an appropriate time period for very proper reasons. This is one of the most important of the safeguards that the opposition believe are essential to have in place if this legislation is to be passed.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:36:00</time.stamp><page.no>7603</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I lay the basis for the government's amendments to the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> which we will propose in this committee stage and, in doing that, touch on the question of a sunset clause. The government have circulated a number of amendments to this bill. These amendments cover some of the recommendations made by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee in its report last week. We also propose some other amendments, which include technical amendments to the bill. The government note that there have been no fewer than three parliamentary inquiries into this bill—by the Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee; the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD; and, more recently, the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. The government's position is that we do not see that such a number of inquiries by parliamentary committees was necessary, but we have nonetheless taken on board what those committees have said. We have repeatedly said that we will entertain proposals that are constructive but not those that would render this bill inoperative or unworkable. We believe that the majority of the proposals by the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee would not be appropriate, for those reasons. </para></talk.start><para>This bill is the final part of our counter-terrorism legislation package, and one which is extremely important. It is designed to give ASIO a greater ability to collect information about potential terrorist attacks so that we can better prevent them before people are hurt or killed. I think that is something that all Australian people would expect of government. On top of the significant changes made in response to the earlier joint standing committee, these amendments reflect the government's commitment to consultation and to obtaining passage of this important bill. The government has demonstrated time and time again its commitment to community safety. The government believes that the time has now come for other parties opposed to this bill to do just that. We cannot afford any further delay. We certainly need to have this bill in place, particularly in the environment in which we find ourselves with the threat to our security.</para><para>The government will not be accepting the opposition's proposed amendments to the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. The opposition proposes an alternative model for a compulsory questioning regime that fundamentally changes the nature of the investigations to be conducted under the bill. The government's bill is about intelligence gathering in the extraordinary circumstance that we see now. It is designed to enhance the capacity of authorities to combat terrorism and to prevent and deter terrorist activities. We remain of the view that the opposition's proposals would not enhance the operation of the bill, would render it unworkable and would undermine the bill's effectiveness.</para><para>We believe that the opposition's amendments would change the fundamental basis of the bill. They would hamper the ability of ASIO to exercise the necessary powers to protect the community at exactly the point at which the community is likely to need it most. The opposition's proposals would take a regime dealing with warrants of last resort that allows detention for the purposes of questioning in order to protect public safety, and replace it with a weak questioning regime that simply will not deliver the goods. Therefore, we believe that accepting the opposition's proposals would frustrate the objectives of this bill. The government are committed to giving those at the front line against terrorism the tools they need to do this very important job, and we have seen in an agency such as ASIO the professionalism and responsibility and the capacity to do just that.</para><para>We have seen provisions that have been introduced in other places around Australia. A striking example is the power given to New South Wales Police to strip-search children as young as 10 years without the need to obtain a warrant or without any judicial oversight into the process. We believe that is not appropriate. However, there are people in this parliament who criticise the government, saying that our measures go too far and that there is no balance. The government have tried to adopt a flexible approach wherever possible and have proposed amendments that pick up recommendations of the references committee. Those are contained within the government amendments that we have here today.</para><para>It is interesting to note that even in the Legal and Constitutional References Committee it was acknowledged that there are a number of safeguards built into this bill, and they listed some of them. They said there were limits on the period of detention, limits on the period a person may be held incommunicado, a requirement that questioning must be videotaped and a copy provided to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security, a requirement that the prescribed authority explain that the person has a right to complain to the Inspector-General of Intelligence and Security and to the Commonwealth Ombudsman, a requirement that questioning be conducted in front of a prescribed authority and a requirement that the Director-General of ASIO satisfy the Attorney-General that there are reasonable grounds for believing that issuing the warrant will substantially assist in the collection of intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorism offence. As the committee stated, these were some of the more important qualifications. It was by no means an exhaustive list, as even the Senate committee recognised. </para><para>So it is that we approach this first opposition amendment, which proposes a sunset clause. It is one that we believe would render this bill ineffective. I say that for a number of reasons. We have an environment of threat, and no-one knows when it will go away. In fact, recently a respected former Prime Minister of Singapore, Lee Kwan Yew, said that, in his opinion, this threat would be in the region for at least the next 10 years. Of course, we do not know when this environment will dissipate, if ever. Therefore, it is important that we do not have a sunset clause but instead that we have a review. That accommodates the concerns that people have with legislation that is needed, such as this. We have announced that the proposed legislation be reviewed after three years by the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. In fact, the Attorney has also said that the legislation would be looked at after one year of operation.</para><para>What we have in place are safeguards. We also have the mechanism of a review. A sunset clause is not the way to do it. Once passed, this bill will continue to be the subject of extensive parliamentary and community scrutiny. I have mentioned already the reviews that the government has announced. To those who are concerned, we say that we have put in place these mechanisms, these safeguards; unlike other pieces of legislation that you see in other domestic jurisdictions— and we do not seem to see the same level of criticism of those regimes. What we have here is a balance, with the required checks and accountability. We therefore oppose the opposition's sunset clause amendment. I also table a supplementary explanatory memorandum relating to the government amendments to be moved to this bill. The memorandum was circulated in the chamber on 10 December 2002.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>7605</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The opposition have approached the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline> as if we were in government. That has been our philosophy: if we were in government, what would we do to deal with the particular issues? We have not approached it from an oppositionist point of view. We have approached it by saying what we would do in government. Of course, that brings critics in from civil libertarian groups et cetera that then try to push us into a different position, and we have not been pushed into a different position.</para></talk.start><para>The Minister for Justice and Customs says that there have been three parliamentary inquiries into this. In reality there have been two. The original Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee barely looked at this. The minister should know that, because at the same time there was a concurrent inquiry by the Joint Standing Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD. So we have had two parliamentary inquiries in reality. The first inquiry was instituted by the government, so they cannot complain about that. We were not even consulted about it. Mr Williams went into parliament at 10 past six and announced that the bill would be referred to the joint committee. The reason I know we were not consulted—well, we were told 10 minutes before at a joint committee meeting that this might be the case—is that at the same time this matter was being referred to a legislation committee in this chamber, and we do not like such a double-up. So we were not consulted on it but, nevertheless, Mr Williams's action in referring it to the joint intelligence committee was a correct one. </para><para>The timetable for the committee was ridiculously short. The committee itself ignored the timetable and put a resolution through both houses of parliament extending the reporting date to allow reasonable time for public submissions. You cannot cut off public submissions, having advertised for them two or three days before. That was the original intention. As it was, the committee did work very hard. It received exemplary cooperation from witnesses, including Attorney-General's and ASIO. We listened to a whole range of critics and were able to bring forward our report in plenty of time for it to be considered by the government for the June sitting. So when the minister comes in here today and says, `We cannot afford any more delay,' some of the delay has been due to government procrastination about amendments and other things. But I think on that point the minister is right—it is now time to finalise these issues before we have the summer break—and I do not think many people in this chamber would necessarily disagree with that.</para><para>The fact is that the second inquiry really came about because of the government's indication as to how they would respond to the first inquiry, in which people decided to at least have a look. I must say that I was dubious about whether there is an alternative regime to all of this. There is concern in the community and in this parliament that ASIO should not be a secret police force. The opposition has attempted to create a division of powers between the Federal Police and ASIO that balances and counterbalances the powers in such a way that you will not have evolving a special branch in the Federal Police or a secret police force under ASIO, that there is a mix-and-match. I think that approach has a lot of appeal.</para><para>One of the great points in all of this is that if you go back to the original legislation you will see why there has been a need for parliamentary intervention. A whole range of things are now conceded by the government. Things that were regarded as right, correct and proper by them in April this year suddenly are no longer right, correct and proper—in other words, we are not worried about what the states can do, our responsibility is federal. Authorities could strip search a 10-year-old girl under your original legislation. You could have it that people would be detained indefinitely, without any limits at all, if authorities were able to succeed in extending the warrants every 48 hours. You could have a situation where there was no legal representation whatsoever in any part of this process. You could have had a position, because of a technical defect in the drafting of the bill, where people could be detained but the clock would not start ticking until they were questioned. Under this legislation they could have been detained for five years before the questions started. But, again, that has been remedied by way of amendment to this bill in the House of Representatives. We could go back over a whole raft of errors, misjudgments or poor principles that were in the original bill which the government have now corrected. But what we say is that the government have not yet gone far enough.</para><para>I think the minister has repeated the worst canard in this debate by basically accusing the opposition of misunderstanding the purpose of the bill. There is misunderstanding about the purpose of the bill. We have spent a lot of time explaining to people that what this bill is about is assisting in the collection of intelligence, not evidence. We understand that. There is no need to patronise us on this, Minister. We have understood that from the start, but we acknowledge that a whole range of critics have never understood that. We have had to fight on two fronts: fight the excesses of the government on the one side and the stupidity of critics on the other side that do not understand the purpose of this legislation. The purpose of this legislation is to enhance the collection of intelligence. It is to protect people's lives by doing so. And it has to be acknowledged that in the process certain traditional rights and responsibilities that citizens have will be curtailed, especially the right to silence—not for the first time but in its most dramatic form yet in legislation presented to this parliament. But we believe that that is a necessary step. It is a hard step for us to take, but we have jumped that hurdle and we have agreed with the government to do so. </para><para>These issues should be decided on balance—not out of panic, not out of a sense of who is the most macho on an issue. There has to be a degree of balance within the legislation. The difference at the moment between the government and the opposition is where that line of balance should be. It is no longer a massively dramatic difference; it is a matter of differences over four or five key principles to get the balance right.</para><para>It should be noted that support for the sunset clause in the joint intelligence committee was unanimous. The Labor Party, in opposition, did not insist on a sunset clause in the five antiterrorist bills that were passed in the chamber, because we believe they had the correct balance and they were there for the ages. In regard to this legislation, which is more dramatic—I do not want to say `more draconian', but it is more dramatic—one wants to see how it operates. Putting a sunset clause in does not preclude a government from reintroducing this legislation and passing it again, with or without a sunset clause, in the year 2005. The committee was quite sensitive to the issue of electoral timing. That is why we recommended a three-year sunset clause. So if this legislation has to be revalidated in the parliament, it will come up in the first year of a new government, be it Labor or coalition, which in terms of the electoral cycle makes it much easier to be able to deal with these things.</para><para>If, as the minister asserts, this legislation is going to work and work well, then there will be very little difficulty in this parliament revalidating that legislation posthaste, without the sorts of committee references and the time that this has taken. It will mean that, six months before the sunset clause, the minister will probably refer it for inquiry to the joint intelligence committee and give the committee two or three months to report back on the effectiveness of it. But there are things that we do not know. We do not know how many warrants are going to be issued under this piece of legislation. It could be as low as 10 over a three-year period, yet it could be several hundred. We need to know that in order to know whether this legislation is working appropriately. I am glad that the government has agreed to pick up the recommendation that says there will be an annual disclosure of the amount of warrants that are issued. </para><para>But, if you really want to be convinced that this legislation needs absolute scrutiny, go back to it in its original form. How could a government have introduced such wide-sweeping legislation with no protocols whatsoever as to the questioning process? Under the original bill, we did not know where people would have been detained. Were you going to reopen Boggo Road? Were you going to reopen Pentridge? Where were you going to detain these people? Were they going to be detained in prisons? Were you going to put them up at the Hyatt? Exactly how were you going to detain them, and where? How long were you going to question them for? In the original bill, there was nothing to stop you questioning someone for 48 hours in a row. There was absolutely no provision for a questioning regime. </para><para>I prefer for the government—and I think they are now going to accept this—to develop protocols around the questioning regime that are disallowable instruments in this chamber, then we as a parliament do not have to dictate exactly what the questioning regime is. It also gives the government flexibility if they find that their tabled questioning regime is insufficient, is not working, to re-regulate in this area without having to go through new legislation. It is all there for the government to do if they want to. They should just reflect, when they categorically knock back the proposed opposition amendments now, that if they had taken that position in regard to the original bill with all its faults we would have had a terrible piece of legislation pass this place. </para><para>I do not know why the government are not willing to further negotiate on this. It seems to me there is a lot of good faith about. I can only presume they are acting under the instructions of the Prime Minister. He has decided to dig his toes in on this issue and no longer negotiate. It seems to me we were bubbling along reasonably well, in a cordial and productive way. All of a sudden there will be no more negotiations. You will just say that this bill is pristine pure now and there can be no amendments. You will not even consider the amendments and it will be thrown out.  </para><para>Coming back to the sunset clause, this is one of the major protections to give people certainty that this adventurous piece of legislation can in fact work. If it does not work, this parliament will not revalidate it, and nor should it. But, once the legislation is in, if it does not work you do not get a second shot at the title. It sits there forever, or until there is a change of government, or a regime change, in this country. If this legislation goes off the rails, if it does not work, there is nothing this parliament can do about it. That is the exact reason you introduce a sunset clause: because you do get a second shot at the title if it is not working. It is a little inconvenient. You would rather have certainty into the future, but you have a pretty good indication from the opposition that, if over the next three years this regime works and works well, we will certainly give it a tick. We are not going to give it an automatic tick but, if you can show that it is working well, that it is being administered properly, that the safeguards put in are all there and are tuned and are going in the right direction, you will get the legislation again. You will get it pretty quickly. I doubt you will get it in non-controversial legislation time, because our colleagues from the Greens, the Democrats—I do not know about Senator Harris and a few others—would probably not allow that. But I think it would be a much more disciplined debate the second time around, much more focused, without the need for an extensive committee inquiry. The opposition will persist with our insistence on a sunset clause. I point out again that we did not do so with the five terrorism bills, because we did not think it was appropriate. We are not doing this to be narky; we are not doing this to needle the government; we are doing it because we think on this occasion that it is good public policy.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>19:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>7608</page.no><name role="metadata">Harris, Sen Len</name><name role="display">Senator HARRIS</name><name.id>8HC</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ON</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to indicate that One Nation will support the opposition amendment for a sunset clause. I will start my remarks by looking at the title of the legislation. The bill is titled the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002</inline>. As Senator Ray so eloquently put the argument, we have an organisation that is primarily in place to ensure the security of Australia, through its ability to use intelligence. What the government is doing with this legislation is taking that organisation and giving it a head of power that One Nation believes it was not intended to have when it was brought into existence. We have the Australian Federal Police, which plays an exemplary role and works concurrently with ASIO. That is how the process should continue. ASIO is there to do the intelligence surveillance, and the Australian Federal Police's role, as a result of ASIO's investigations, is to carry that further. </para></talk.start><para>It saddens me to some degree that the Labor Party did not support a sunset clause in another particular piece of legislation, the <inline ref="R1122">Defence Legislation Amendment (Aid to Civilian Authorities) Bill 2000</inline>. The crossbenchers unanimously believed that that legislation should have been exposed to exactly the same process that Senator Ray has argued for in relation to this legislation. If we look at the government's bill in total, it has the ability, I believe, to achieve what the terrorists have not. The terrorists have not been able to break the spirit of the Australian people. They have not been able to break us as a nation. And yet, sadly, this government's legislation is going to place restrictions on the rights of Australians that no terrorist could ever dream of. It brings in the ability to apprehend a person and hold them without representation. It brings in punitive clauses where, if a person does not answer questions, there is the threat of a jail term. So the government is succeeding in removing the rights of Australians in a way that the terrorists have not. Very clearly, One Nation does not support the government's legislation. One Nation supports Labor's sunset clause because in actuality it will bring this legislation to a close in three years.</para><para>Question agreed to.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:02:00</time.stamp><page.no>7608</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I move opposition amendment (2) on sheet 2764: </para></talk.start><quote><para>(2)	Schedule 1, item 8, page 4 (after line 14), before the definition of <inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">terrorism offence</inline>, insert:</para><para><inline font-weight="bold" font-style="italic">terrorist act</inline> has the same meaning as in Part 5.3 of the <inline font-style="italic">Criminal Code</inline>.</para></quote><para>This is what I would describe as a minor technical amendment.

This particular definition was included in the Criminal Code as a result of the antiterrorism legislation passed in this chamber in June of this year.

While we as a party and I personally differ from the government and the opposition in terms of those adopted definitions and still oppose them in principle, I can concede the need for consistency in this legislation and the previous suite of bills, notwithstanding the difficulties we have with the definitions adopted.

Whilst not wholeheartedly supporting the questioning regime put forward by the opposition— and we will get onto that later—we recognise that it is an improvement on the government's compulsory detention regime.

The Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee recommended that former judges should perform these roles and that a panel of former judges should be established for that purpose, as opposed to the existing provisions providing for these roles to be performed by federal judges, federal magistrates and other prescribed authorities and senior legal members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal. It is the government's view that it is neither appropriate nor workable to limit the pool of potential issuing and prescribed authorities to former judges.</para><para>The pool of retired judges who are willing and able to do the job will be quite small. This could cause serious operational difficulties—for example, in the event of a number of warrants being executed simultaneously or in jurisdictions such as Western Australia, South Australia and the Northern Territory where the pool of retired judges is small. However, the government amendments include former judges amongst the classes of persons who may be appointed as issuing and prescribed authorities. This will ensure that an adequate number of issuing and prescribed authorities are available to meet operational needs. The amendments provide for the Attorney-General to maintain a register of former judges who have consented to be appointed.</para><para>What we have here is an accommodation of the concerns of those people who wanted to include former judges. We do not believe a panel could consist of former judges alone due to the lack of number of those judges and the requirement that they would have to consent—we have seen that the Federal Court judges themselves do not like being involved in the issuing of warrants. It is reasonable to assume that former judges would not necessarily want to become involved in this process. I know the opposition has amendments in relation to this—and I think that they are best left to be addressed when those amendments arise—but there are further restrictions that others and the opposition would have in relation to these former judges which we believe restrict the number even further. In the case of Western Australia, of which I have some personal knowledge, the number of retired judges is not great and, when you look at the fact that you would have to have the consent of that person, it would be unworkable to rely on a pool that consisted only of former judges. In the interests of accommodating the concerns that were raised by the references committee, we are, by these amendments, increasing the pool to include that cohort of persons. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:20:00</time.stamp><page.no>7613</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I ask the Minister for Justice and Customs whether, given that the Director-General of ASIO indicated that this regime, as proposed, would be unlikely to be used on any more than two or three occasions in a calendar year, he continues to claim that there is a concern with the lack of number of retired judges—that the pool is, to use his words, `quite small'. Can you indicate how small the pool is, Minister? Given what seems to be a very small number of occasions on which this regime is likely to be utilised, surely this does not lead to the sorts of logistical problems that you contemplate. The minister says to us that the regime that is proposed by the opposition is neither appropriate nor workable.

However, an occasion could involve several, if not many, warrants because you might have an operation which includes several states. We have recently seen operations carried out by ASIO across Australia simultaneously. I suppose you could call all that one occasion. In such a situation you would need to have a number of people available across Australia, even in smaller states like Western Australia. That is the problem you face. I think it is a quite reasonable scenario. You would have to issue several warrants because you could be dealing with a group of people who are conspiring, and that group of people—obviously a terrorist group—are not acting via one person alone but through several, if not many, people across Australia. You would take out your action or you would carry out your operation simultaneously, and that would involve the issuing of many warrants, albeit on one occasion.</para></talk.start><para>Law enforcement has experienced this many times. I have seen it in the Australian Federal Police where, in relation to organised criminals, warrants have been issued in different states at the same time so that the operations are carried out at precisely the same time and no-one is given advance notice or can give anyone else advance notice. That is the scenario which tests the system. The environment we have been living in since September 11 and in more recent months is a different environment to what we have experienced in the past. As to the future, who knows what we might require as to the frequency of these warrants. That is why everyone regards this bill so seriously. It is a bill that we hope will never have to be used, but we are realistic. In the environment that we are living in, we cannot rule out that these provisions will not be used in the future, and therefore they must be available. If they are to be available, the system has to be workable.

I will come to Senator Faulkner's question in a moment. The Attorney-General's Department does not have records of potential former judges in states and territories. From a Commonwealth point of view, the number of judges who served for the last 10 years and who are still under 72 years of age is: in the New South Wales Federal Court, five; in the ACT Federal Court, one; in the New South Wales Family Court, seven; in South Australia, one; in Victoria, four; in Tasmania, two; and in Queensland, two. So, from the Commonwealth point of view, the total number across Australia would be 22. Those judges would have to consent. My office has made inquiries and we are endeavouring to ascertain further numbers.</para></talk.start><para>The question was put to me from my experience in Western Australia. Looking at judges who would be under the age of 72— because that is what the opposition is proposing—and who have 10 years experience in a superior court, the problem you would run into is that most judges retire at age 70, so you do not have too many left who are under 72. You would have a handful. The Attorney-General himself is of a view that you would have only two or three who would fit that requirement in Western Australia. That is merely anecdotal evidence, and by no means is it by way of some record— but that is the question I was asked. We are endeavouring to see if we can find further numbers. When you look at that number, from a Commonwealth point of view, it is certainly not great at all. The total number for New South Wales is 12; South Australia, one; the ACT, one; Victoria, four; Tasmania, two; and Queensland, two. And, from a Commonwealth point of view, I do not think there is one in Western Australia.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:29:00</time.stamp><page.no>7614</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—If I hear you correctly in answer to my question, Minister, you say that the Attorney-General's Department does not have records.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name></talker><para>—Not for state and territory judges; these numbers are for Commonwealth judges.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—It does have records in relation to Commonwealth judges?</para></talk.start></continue><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9X5</name.id><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Ellison</name></talker><para>—I have just read them out.</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>5K4</name.id><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name></talker><para>—I thought you indicated that they did not have records in the broad.

In particular, it has been suggested that the detention powers under the bill are inconsistent with chapter 3 of the Constitution, which establishes the separation of powers between the executive and the judiciary. It has been argued that the inconsistency arises because the power to detain a person for punitive reasons is a judicial function which cannot be conferred upon the executive. The detention provisions under this bill are not for the purpose of punishing criminal activities. There is no punitive element to detention under the bill. Our advice confirms that the bill is constitutionally valid. </para></talk.start><para>As to whether we can provide a copy of that advice to the committee—we have run into the usual chestnut of providing advice— I will have to take that on notice and seek the views of the Attorney-General.

That was looked at when the parliamentary joint committee was looking at other aspects of this bill. When I said that one of the previous committees had looked at this question I was right.

I take Senator Faulkner's first point, particularly in the context of Mr Richardson's advice, that over the last 12 months—which you have got to say was a pretty hectic year for potential terrorist activities—these provisions would have been used only two or three times. I think that is the fundamental point. Minister, the other point is that, if you are trying to argue that there are no judges, it has never been beyond the capacity of this government or others to find retired judges to conduct work for them across the country.

As I heard you, a signature is required—and that could be done by fax—but the conveyancing, the interpersonal interaction, is done by alerting that person to being present at the receipt of the fax.

If something is signed—and it is stated there—you obviously assume that the person signing it reads it. That is a much more substantial requirement than simply a warrant by telephone.

We will not be supporting these amendments. They are in conflict with the next amendments to be put forward by the opposition. We have had some discussion already about potential constitutional issues with regard to serving judges being a part of this regime. The amendments put forward by the government take up one suggestion of the committee about former judges. But rather than, as suggested by the committee, replacing the existing AAT members or magistrates with former judges, the government's proposal is just to extend the number of people who can be issuing or prescribed authorities to also include former judges. We have had some discussion already about the constitutional issues that could arise from the government's current model, and they are not addressed by the amendments proposed by the government.</para></talk.start><para>Another issue that we have not heard talked about is AAT members being able to provide warrants under the current regime. This being the enormously controversial legislation that it is, I understand that part of the rationale for putting forward the retired judges model was to make a further separation between the government or the executive who are putting this legislation in place and the people who will actually issue the warrants. The idea is that former judges perhaps do not have as much reliance on the government and the executive for their ongoing positions, their future employment or their general relationship with the government. This government amendment does not take away those concerns that people have about government employees, through the AAT, making decisions about how this legislation should be implemented.</para><para>The responses from the Minister for Justice and Customs so far have focused on constitutional issues and the number of retired judges that would be available to serve this function. We have heard others refer to the evidence given by Dennis Richardson during the committee hearings that he believed this legislation would have been used on two to three occasions in the last 12 months. It is particularly disturbing that this government is putting forward as one of its strongest arguments against the retired judges model that it does not believe there are enough retired judges to fulfil these responsibilities. I hope that the government's expression of this as such a concern is not an indication that this legislation would be used more than the two to three times in the last year that we heard about from the Director-General of ASIO. It is deeply concerning to hear that being put forward by the government as a major argument for why they do not support purely retired judges being the prescribed and issuing authorities. Perhaps the minister can enlighten us as to whether he believes this legislation would be used a lot more frequently than Dennis Richardson's evidence to the committee suggested. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:54:00</time.stamp><page.no>7619</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I have to correct something that Senator Nettle said. Members of the AAT are prescribed authorities, not issuing authorities. We have separated the role of the issuing authorities from the role of the prescribed authorities. Issuing authorities issue the warrant; they are not prescribed authorities who preside over questioning. That is a separate role. To have mixed those two would be an issue; that is why we have separated them. Senior legal members of the AAT are prescribed authorities, not issuing authorities. I want to correct the record for Senator Nettle, who was under the impression that the members of the AAT were to be issuing authorities.</para></talk.start><para>As I understand it, Mr Richardson's comments were in relation to the number of instances in which these provisions would have been used since September 11 and not so much how many times they would be used each year. I am glad that I have been advised of that because it brings his evidence into focus more accurately. He can look back and see two or three instances since September 11 last year where these warrants could have been used. In hindsight, he can say that with some degree of certainty.</para><para>As to the future, it is very difficult for anyone to say how many times these provisions would be used. All I can say is that we live in an environment where there is a threat to security. We have seen actions taken by ASIO in past months which in one case have resulted in charges being laid. As I said to Senator Faulkner in answer to an earlier question, it would not be beyond the realms of possibility to see these provisions being used in the future. I would hope that we had an environment where these did not have to be used, but as the government of Australia we have got to look out for the security of this country, and we have to have provisions in place in case the need arises for our agencies to use them. That is why they are there. In the current environment you could not rule out these provisions being used, and that is why they are so important.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>20:57:00</time.stamp><page.no>7619</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The only information that is available to members of the committee is the Director-General of ASIO's public evidence in relation to this matter. I accept the minister's presentation of that evidence to the committee in this debate. That is a fair reflection of what was said. In excess of a year after September 11, 2001 such provisions, if they were in place, would have been used on two or three occasions. I think the link being drawn here—the link between the number of occasions such provisions may be used and the number of retired judges from the High Court, Federal Court, Family Court, state supreme courts and state, district or county courts who are available to fulfil that particular function—is an appropriate one. When we have dealt with these government amendments, we will be dealing with the opposition's amendments which propose that the prescribed authority comprise retired judges from those superior courts. We deliberately talk about retired judges.</para></talk.start><para>It is very important that this committee reflect on the crucial role of the prescribed authority under this legislation—the crucial role of the prescribed authority in a questioning regime. The prescribed authority is the person before whom questioning must take place and the one who supervises the questioning. The prescribed authority is the one who can give a wide range of directions in order to manage the process. The committee should reflect on some of the evidence that was adduced before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee. I remind the committee of the evidence of Mr Bret Walker SC, who appeared on behalf of the Law Council of Australia and argued that the prescribed authority `must not become engaged on anything which sees them lining up with the institution which is doing the questioning'. In his evidence he likened the role of the prescribed authority to that of a chaperone. He said: </para><quote><para>... as I understand the role of a chaperone, it is not to run interference on things but, by their simple presence and by the nature of the person, to perhaps instil a sense of propriety that might not otherwise happen ... The idea is that if you have got a respectable retired judge ... then the chances of the security services misbehaving are hugely reduced, I would have thought. People do tend to behave better when they are in the presence of people whom they cannot control.</para></quote><para>Like the Law Council, Dr Stephen Donaghue argued that a judge would be most suitable in this role. He said:</para><quote><para>The questioning is not being conducted by the prescribed authority ... it is being supervised by them. It seems to be desirable to have someone acting in that position who would ... make sure that the process takes place appropriately. It seems to me that that is why they are there, at the end of the day—to ensure that the process is conducted appropriately. I would submit that a sitting Supreme Court judge, or a retired judge of any court, is less likely to be in a position to be pressured by the executive in the way that they exercise that function than an AAT member, who is likely to have had a less distinguished legal career and is likely to be dependent on the government for their continued appointment to the AAT. If it is a safeguard, it is a better safeguard in my view. There are certainly a great many Supreme Court judges or retired judges who would exercise that function very vigorously.</para></quote><para>I think Dr Donaghue draws an important distinction about the seniority and status of judges and retired judges. It became clear through the recent Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee inquiry into the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 that it is essential that the prescribed authority be truly independent if the prescribed authority is to fulfil the role and obligation of protecting the rights of people who are being questioned and detained. However highly esteemed magistrates may be, they do not have the status and seniority of judges.</para><para>We have had senior counsel making it absolutely clear that the role given to serving Federal Court judges and serving federal magistrates—who, as issuing authorities, are subject to the same chapter III limitations as Federal Court judges—makes the bill constitutionally suspect. Chapter III of the Constitution prevents the conferral of any function upon a federal judge, even acting in a personal capacity, if that function is incompatible with the exercise of the judicial function under chapter III. That concern has simply not been answered by the government.</para><para>The people putting this case are people of substance: Dr Gavan Griffith QC, Professor George Williams and Dr Stephen Donaghue. They represent some pretty heavyweight legal opinion on these sorts of issues. In stark contrast to the open, frank and thoughtful advice provided to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee by these eminent people, the government refuse to table or provide a copy of its legal advice. The minister says that the legal advice exists but will not front up with it. Given what is at stake here, it is of concern that the government have never been willing to provide that advice to parliamentary committees or to either house of the Australian parliament. They say to us, `Everything's okay,' even though we have these eminent constitutional lawyers making the strong points they have made.</para><para>I am not sure it is okay. I am one of those people in the chamber who are not lawyers, but if strong, coherent and persuasive arguments are put forward by lawyers, I like to listen to them. But what the opposition has put forward, which we will deal with in the next set of amendments, is a far more workable model for the prescribed authority, and one that has also been recommended by a Senate committee. I want to hear from the government whether there are the logistical weaknesses that the minister blithely says exist. The minister claims that the pool of retired judges is not big enough. I hoped that, by the time we were having this committee debate, the minister would be able to substantiate that claim. He cannot. He has not been able to do that today. I think that, if the minister could substantiate that claim, there would be an obligation on this committee to look carefully at any arguments like that that are presented. But all we hear is that Senator Ellison is well connected in the Western Australian bar and he does not think there are enough retired judges to go around. No-one actually has any statistics or any names to throw on the table—or, as we would say in politics, no-one has any numbers to throw on the table. </para><para>I think that on these points the government is obligated to front up to the Senate committee. The government is obligated, if it says there are not enough retired judges, to tell us how broad the pool is. I have tried to seek advice from the legal community, who have tried to satisfy me that there are enough; but I am willing to listen to sensible, well-founded arguments, if there are any. I am more than happy to be satisfied on the point of constitutionality. But what we get from the minister and from the government is some half-baked claim that the Attorney-General's Department has had a look at it and everything is okay. Who is going to accept that throwaway line from the government on an important issue like this? The government to date has not provided any comfort on these important issues. It has provided no comfort at all on the serious constitutional issues that have been raised.</para><para>This is important, because the government—properly, in my view—argues about the national security implications of this and other counter-terrorism legislation. In my view, that is a fundamentally important imperative for this chamber and for this parliament. I hope every senator in this chamber takes account of it. If this legislation is considered as important as it is by the government, what would the government think of the blow to national security if this particular law, if it is passed in the form that the government wants, were to fall over because of constitutional problems with the warrant issuing process? That is why I think we are entitled, at this committee stage, to ask for clear and definitive answers from the government on issues of genuine and real substance.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:12:00</time.stamp><page.no>7621</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to address a couple of issues. Firstly, Senator Faulkner has raised the query of using members of the Administrative Appeals Tribunal as prescribed authorities. I think the question related to whether or not they are appropriate. Recommendation 1 of the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—of which Senator Ray is a member and was a participant in this inquiry—into the <inline ref="R1539">Australian Security Intelligence Organisation Legislation Amendment (Terrorism) Bill 2002 </inline>states:</para></talk.start><quote><para>Federal magistrates to issue all warrants;</para><para>Federal Judges to issue all warrants where detention will exceed 96 hours; and</para><para>members of the AAT, as set out in proposed subsection 34B(1), to undertake all other duties of the prescribed authority excluding the power to issue warrants.</para></quote><para>That is where you get the division between the people who issue the warrant and the people who are the prescribed authorities who oversee the questioning. That deals with any constitutional query, and it is also a recommendation of the parliamentary joint committee, which we adopted. That is why it is in the bill.</para><para>We have had the query about the constitutionality of this framework. If you are going to ask where the authority is, let us look at a Senate committee, because we rely on this as our authority. The Senate Legal and Constitutional Legislation Committee, as I previously advised the committee, looked into the constitutional aspect of this bill. Paragraph 1.21 of the committee's report comes under the heading, `Is the issuing of questioning warrants by magistrates an exercise of executive power that is incompatible with their role as judicial officers?' This is the nub of any concern as to constitutionality and really touches on the High Court decision of Grollo v. Palmer. Paragraph 1.21 of the committee's report states:</para><quote><para>In summary, the Committee notes the concerns of Professor Williams and Dr Carne about some fundamental constitutional questions and the further response of the Attorney General's Department to those matters. The Committee considers that if the PJC's recommendation that warrants for detention be issued only by federal magistrates and Federal Court judges is adopted by the Government, such amendments will go a considerable way towards addressing the concerns about the validity of the current Bill. </para></quote><para>That is precisely what we did. We have taken on board recommendation 1 of the parliamentary joint committee, and we have federal magistrates, Federal Court judges and members of the AAT as prescribed authorities. So I think we have addressed those issues, and I cannot see what more the government can do. We have taken what the committee said and we have got our own advice. The matter really speaks for itself. Look at the committee report, look at both committee reports, and you will see what the PJC said in its first recommendation. We have followed that course of action.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:16:00</time.stamp><page.no>7622</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—When someone who has been the Commonwealth Solicitor-General, such as is the case with Gavan Griffiths QC, says that the legislation in its current form is constitutionally suspect, I think it is very foolish of the government not to look carefully at these sorts of issues. Of course what the Minister for Justice and Customs does— and this has been raised after the report of the Parliamentary Joint Committee on ASIO, ASIS and DSD—is come in here and read one recommendation from the PJC report. Half an hour ago he was rejecting another one. In other words, what the minister is doing is cherry picking these recommendations. If a recommendation or a view of a particular committee happens to suit the government, the government picks that out, regardless of the evidence that has been forthcoming on these issues—in the case of the PJC, after the advisory report had gone to the Attorney-General.</para></talk.start><para>The approach that the opposition is putting forward is in fact consistent with a unanimous Senate committee recommendation—that is, that the opposition proposes that the prescribed authority be made up of experienced retired judges. I am trying to hear from the minister, but have not heard, some support for a logistical argument, which I think people would take account of if there are not enough of them. Apart from some sort of vague indication that this is the case in Western Australia, the committee is yet to be provided with any evidentiary support for that statement.</para><para>So we say, given all the concerns and given the role of the prescribed authority, that that prescribed authority be made up of experienced retired judges—individuals whose standing cannot be questioned. We have suggested a panel of retired judges who have had very significant years of service on a superior court. What is the advantage of doing that? What is the reason for doing that? It removes serious concerns over the constitutionality of using chapter 3 judges as the issuers of warrants, as the government is proposing, but also—and I think this is very important—it will have the effect of boosting community confidence in the accountability and the integrity of this regime. I think that is absolutely essential also.</para><para>The government needs to reflect on the fact that when this proposition was developed by the Senate committee—it came forward in evidence, and the committee was able to seek evidence on this matter and develop the proposal of using retired judges as members of the prescribed authority—it was very well received by agencies, by lawyers and by community groups who were appearing before the Senate inquiry. In fact, the Director-General of Security also said in evidence before the Senate inquiry that he thought using retired judges was well aligned to the current bill. But I think it is important that we heed what the director-general was saying. It is important to remember that, right through his evidence and through a range of public statements he has made, he has been supportive of ensuring that we use a model that instils the greatest level of community confidence in this regime. I think that is the other great advantage in what the opposition propose with retired judges. If there is a logistical problem with this in terms of the numbers, in terms of the pool, tell us. Do not make some vague claims.

I wish to quote from the October 2002 issue of the <inline font-style="italic">Public Sector Informant.</inline> The cover story is by Veronica Burgess and the heading is, `Secret Business—ASIO Intelligence Game'.

With the approval of the Attorney-General, it can do some pretty intrusive things, including: tracking your movements, tapping your phone or computer, sticking a microphone or a micro-camera in your bedroom wall, checking your post or taking a look around your house—but not willy-nilly. There are still strict regulations about what it is allowed to do, why, and for how long. ASIO also collects foreign intelligence within Australia at the request of the Minister for Foreign Affairs or Defence.</para></quote><para>I come back to the original proposal—that is, the information that is used to establish the application for a warrant is in no way available to the person who is the subject of the warrant. Proposed section 34D(5)(a)(i), which deals with warrants for questioning, refers to giving information `that is or may be relevant to intelligence that is important in relation to a terrorist offence'. So an order for questioning can be placed on somebody for no other reason than that they `may' happen to have information. It does not have to be relevant. The only requirement is that it `may' be relevant. What an intrusion that is into the lives of average Australians.</para><para>Under this legislation, a person who owns a property in which a person may have resided—a person whom the government suspects has been involved in some terrorist activity—could find that he is the subject of an order and be taken in for questioning just because the information he has `may' be relevant. He does not even have the right to know the basis of the claim. That is the reason why I believe we should be looking at this section of the legislation relating to the prescribed authority and the issuing authority. It is extremely important that the prescribed authority ensures that the person being questioned has certain rights maintained.

One would anticipate that if this legislation, as the director-general said, were used on only two or three occasions, that would give us some idea about the likelihood of the ongoing use of this legislation.</para><para>I direct a question to Senator Faulkner. Senator Faulkner, you described evidence that had been given before the Senate committee about the distinction made in the issuing of the prescribed authority. You said that evidence had been put to the committee that we needed to ensure that there were different people who fulfilled these roles. It could be that I have not found it. Could you explain to me where that distinction exists in the model put forward by the opposition between the role of the prescribed authority and the role of the issuing authority, which was something that was put forward in the committee as a concern by some groups. </para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:30:00</time.stamp><page.no>7624</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—No such distinction exists.

We are effectively involving ourselves in a debate and a discussion on which is the better model in terms of issuing warrants. There are pros and cons on both sides. I have some sympathy with the minister's argument that there are few judges. To be fair, in the statistics that he has given he has referred only to retired chapter III judges, not to state jurisdictional retired judges. There was also the argument that warrants cannot be issued by phone. However, we have heard that they can be issued by fax and that state judges are available. I could have some sympathy with the minister's position if he could further quantify it or strengthen the argument that a lack of judges was the issue, but I am not so sure that it is. If that is or is not the case then surely this is an illustration of where the sunset clause comes into play. In three years time we can, with the benefit of hindsight, look back on this and say, `That model worked,' or, `That model didn't work.' That will be an opportunity for a new parliament in a different environment to review the legislation.</para></talk.start><para>I strongly pick up a point that Senator Faulkner made—and I am paraphrasing— that this is not just an issue of practicalities or indeed technicalities but also a question of perception. There was recently an article in the Australian print media resulting from questions asked in recent Senate estimates where ASIO confirmed that it had in some cases issued its own warrants—the minister may correct me on that—on the basis that the Attorney was unavailable. I think that creates an understandable perception and concern in the community around the notion of a secret police force. It is something which we as a parliament should avoid and we should ensure that the appropriate protections are in place. The proposal by the opposition better does that on the basis that there is the stronger perception that the issuing of warrants is at arm's length from the government or, at least, departments associated with the government when you are referring instead to the integrity and judicial experience of retired judges. On that basis I believe, and the Democrats believe, that these government amendments ought to be opposed. The alternative model, which we will get to shortly, offers a better opportunity to deal with this issue not just in terms of its perception but also in terms of its practicality, given that the three-year sunset clause is there to remedy the situation if it is proven to be fundamentally flawed. On the debate I have heard thus far, I am not convinced that that is the case.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:34:00</time.stamp><page.no>7624</page.no><name role="metadata">Ray, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator ROBERT RAY</name><name.id>UI4</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I want to comment on one point raised by Senator Greig. He is right that there is a provision in the ASIO legislation—but not, I think, this one—where the director-general can issue a warrant in the absence of the Attorney-General, but it is an unusual step. It is then subject to review—and this case was subject to review by the inspector-general; it was in his report. He looked at the circumstances and validated ASIO's actions on this occasion. The provision is there for that reason. But it is not an unfettered right of the director-general.

I have canvassed at some length the reasons that I believe the opposition's proposal is a superior one. I think that we determined in the committee debate that both alternative models would effectively be on the table and canvassed. The committee has seen fit to oppose the government amendments in relation to adding former judges. We are now dealing with the substantive opposition amendment in relation to the form of the prescribed authority.</para><para>I do not want to speak at length to this, because we canvassed it at considerable length a little earlier this evening. It is important for the committee to remember that the prescribed authority plays an absolutely crucial role in the questioning regime. It is, of course, the prescribed authority which is present when questioning takes place. The prescribed authority has responsibility for supervising the questioning and for managing the whole process and has a capacity to give directions in managing the process. </para><para>We have indicated our concerns on a range of issues in relation to the alternative proposition that is contained in the bill, and not only in terms of the need for appropriate status and seniority of the prescribed authority—in other words, judges as opposed to magistrates. There is also the question of constitutionality, which is an important one. Hence the proposal that the opposition have put forward—which was developed in the Senate references committee inquiry and report—in relation to retired judges, given the concerns that have been indicated and presented to the committee about the constitutional issues surrounding serving Federal Court judges and federal magistrates.</para><para>I put to the committee in the strongest terms I can that this particular amendment has the advantage of removing those serious concerns over the constitutionality of using chapter III judges as the issuers of warrants. It also has the very considerable advantage of ensuring maximum community support for and confidence in the regime, by ensuring the accountability and integrity of the process. That is the great advantage of using retired judges as the prescribed authority. I make the point again that this is something that not only is supported by the opposition and the Senate references committee but also was received very favourably by senior members of the legal community who appeared before the Senate references committee, by agencies and also by community groups. </para><para>The amendment has a lot to commend it, and the only real argument that the government has been able to propose against it is that there may be an inadequate number of retired superior court judges to be able to adequately fulfil the functions of, or provide a panel for fulfilling the functions of, a prescribed authority. But we continue to face the problem that the government is unable to quantify that, thus reinforcing what Senator Greig was saying in his most recent contribution to the committee.</para><para>Mr Temporary Chairman, as you know, this particular matter has been canvassed at length this evening.

There are going to be many occasions throughout this debate where I will be rising to indicate that the Australian Greens will be supporting an amendment put forward by the Labor Party that we see as trying to improve a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation. Opposition amendment (6) is one of those amendments. We have previously had discussions about constitutionality and the relationship between prescribed and issuing authorities and the executive, and we have had arguments about whether or not there is an adequate number of judges. All of those points lead to a preference for this model as opposed to the model that is being put forward by the government.</para></talk.start><para>When Senator Faulkner says that he believes this model will boost public confidence in this regime, I think he is probably being a little bit rich. I think it will boost some confidence—in what you could describe as an ambit claim in terms of the way in which this legislation was first put forward by the government—in that it does seek to ameliorate some of the worst aspects of that legislation. But it still leaves us with a detention regime for non-suspects. I go back to one of the fundamental tenets of our legal system—stated in the Magna Carta itself: people should not be detained unless they have come before a court and have been found to have been, or are suspected on reasonable grounds by the court to have been, involved in a criminal activity. This is one of those many amendments where we will be supporting the position put forward by the opposition, because we see that it does help to ameliorate the worst aspects of a fundamentally flawed piece of legislation.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:44:00</time.stamp><page.no>7626</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise to put on record that the government opposes these opposition amendments.

I have indicated that, from a federal point of view, there are only 22 judges across Australia, none of them being in Western Australia. I hasten to add that there are state and territory judges who would not be included in these figures. We do not have those figures from the states and territories but, as I have said earlier, on anecdotal evidence the Attorney-General and I do not believe that you would find more than two or three judges in Western Australia. That does make it unworkable when you consider that, if we had a September 11 in Australia and you had prior notice of such an event, you would want to execute a number of warrants—because there were some 19 operatives that we know of in that exercise. If you had some intelligence prior to that and you wanted to question all 19, you would want to have 19 warrants. I have indicated our own experience where ASIO actions in the last couple of months involved the issuing of a number of warrants on the one occasion, so you do need people around the country available in relation to this role.</para></talk.start><para>Finally, we took on board recommendation 1 of the parliamentary joint committee.

We really believe that we have taken this as far as we can in meeting the concerns.

Of course, substantive amendments will be moved by the opposition later in this committee stage in relation to removing 14- to 18-year-olds from the regime, setting out appropriate questioning times and ensuring access to legal advice. The amendments that are being moved here do ensure that the character of the regime is a questioning regime as opposed to a detention regime.</para><para>All in this chamber would agree that our response to the threat of terrorism has to be strong, effective and consistent with our democratic values and freedoms. As the ASIO bill stands, our view is that the government has got that balance wrong. The opposition is persuaded that the intelligence-gathering powers of ASIO should be enhanced, but we are not persuaded that that should be done through a police-like detention regime. ASIO can do its intelligence-gathering job properly, it can gather vital intelligence, without having to detain people for extended periods. I have heard the Attorney-General and others in the government stress that what is proposed in this bill is to ensure that the capacity for ASIO to gather intelligence is maximised.</para><para>I have been assured that this bill is about an intelligence-gathering regime. We are very concerned that, as it stands, this legislation may well run foul of the prohibition against arbitrary detention in the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. Those who have followed the hearings, the evidence and the submissions before the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee would be aware that a very significant number of strong submissions were made to the Senate committee on this issue.</para><para>The opposition proposes and supports a questioning regime, not a detention regime. We also insist on a questioning regime with strong protections and safeguards. We think it is appropriate that such a regime be broadly consistent with other questioning regimes employed by Commonwealth and state law enforcement agencies, such as royal commissions, the NCA and state crime commissions. You have to be able to answer the question of why ASIO should have weaker powers to interview people in relation to terrorism offences than those bodies have in relation to corruption or corporate crime. That is an absolutely crucial question that opponents of this bill need to be able to answer.</para><para>The first issue in relation to a questioning regime as opposed to a detention regime is: who should initiate the process? In this respect, the opposition believe that the current bill has got it right. We think that warrants for questioning should be initiated by the Director-General of Security, who should seek the Attorney-General's consent to apply for a warrant. The Attorney-General must be given a draft and supporting material. Before giving consent, the Attorney-General must be satisfied that the warrant is absolutely necessary and that questioning the person would be more effective than other methods of collecting intelligence. As far as the opposition are concerned, it is fundamental that this questioning regime should not apply to anyone under the age of 18. Although that matter will be dealt with in later amendments, the opposition strongly believe that children should not be subjected to ongoing questioning by an intelligence agency. Further opposition amendments that deal with the specifics of the questioning regime will be moved later in the committee stage of this bill. </para><para>I commend the significance and importance of these amendments to this committee. We believe it is essential that the character of this regime be a questioning regime, not a detention regime. The intent of these amendments is to give effect to that.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>21:59:00</time.stamp><page.no>7630</page.no><name role="metadata">Nettle, Sen Kerry</name><name role="display">Senator NETTLE</name><name.id>00AOR</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>AG</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Australian Greens will be supporting these amendments because clearly a questioning regime is better than a compulsory and coercive detention regime as was proposed by the government initially in this legislation. However, I do think that the way the opposition describe these amendments is a little inaccurate, as they have assiduously gone through the bill and removed any reference to detention, taken out the word, replaced it with `custody' and simply left in questioning as a regime.</para></talk.start><para>The opposition are proposing up to 20 hours of detention for people not suspected of being involved in terrorist activities, and those 20 hours do not include the time in which that person being questioned may talk to their lawyer, get rest that they need, get food or medical attention, talk to an interpreter, wait whilst a lawyer arrives, wait whilst an interpreter arrives, be informed of their rights with regard to this legislation or wait for any intoxication that they are under the influence of to have subsided. All of this time beyond the 20 hours that the opposition are proposing is clearly not questioning time; it is detention time.</para><para>The opposition are proposing not merely a questioning regime such as in the models that Senator Faulkner put forward—those of the ACC or the former National Crime Commission. Under that legislation, a summons is issued for people to appear before the examiner—somebody in the ACC office—often for discrete periods of time, in which they will proceed with questioning. Then, if you fail, a warrant can be issued and outlined for those people to appear before the ACC and the examiner. That is not the same as that proposed in these opposition amendments—and later we will get onto government amendments about entry into premises and reasonable force being used in that process—which are about bringing people into a questioning regime of 20 hours with no time limit for any detention beyond and around that.</para><para>What was proposed by the government originally was indefinite. Then we heard seven days as a further suggestion. But that was a maximum time limit for which people could be held. What we are hearing from the opposition is a far reduced time period for questioning, but no time limit for those additional activities that fall outside the questioning regime. This turns the opposition proposal not into a questioning regime, as they purport, but indeed into a detention regime. Senator Faulkner talked about the strong and convincing evidence to the Senate Legal and Constitutional References Committee about the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, where arbitrary detention is clearly singled out as being in contravention of that international covenant. I suggest to Senator Faulkner that that same and compelling evidence applies to the questioning and detention regime that is being put forward by the opposition in this regime and this package of amendments.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:03:00</time.stamp><page.no>7630</page.no><name role="metadata">Ellison, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator ELLISON</name><name.id>9X5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Justice and Customs</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The government opposes these amendments put forward by the opposition. The opposition has argued that the bill should be amended so that it is a questioning regime only and does not permit the detention of persons. The government does not accept this proposal. It believes that the fundamental purpose of the bill would be thwarted by this approach. This bill deals with those circumstances where coercive questioning and detention, subject to strict controls, are necessary in the interests of public safety. For example, it may be necessary to detain a person to allow urgent intelligence investigations to continue unimpeded and to prevent them from informing others about ASIO's investigation. In some situations, the capacity to detain will be critical.</para></talk.start><para>What we are dealing with here is not a normal situation, as you have with a criminal investigation. This aspect goes to national security where people are suspected of actively planning to bring about harm to the community at large or, indeed, something much greater than that. Detention is not just about questioning. It is also about prevention—it is about acting to prevent terrorist attacks. It would be absurd not to have a power to detain a person for a limited period in a situation where there is evidence that they will tip off their terrorist associates. We need sufficient powers to prevent persons from alerting the terrorists that we are on to them. The only way to protect against this is to hold a person incommunicado, subject to strict safeguards, while questioning for the purposes of intelligence gathering. </para><para>Those at the front line of meeting the terrorist threat tell us that, in order to protect the community, they need the power to hold a person incommunicado, subject to strict safeguards, whilst questioning them to gather intelligence. This is a need that we have to address in this bill. The opposition amendments do not do that. Warrants under the bill will only ever be used as a last resort. It is important that, when no other measures are available, our intelligence agencies have this essential tool to prevent terrorist attacks. The detention of persons is a significant power, but one that is necessary in the new environment of threat that we experience.</para><para>The government have taken active steps to ensure that the safeguards included in this bill remain consistent with our fundamental democratic values and freedoms. In the opposition's proposals we see nothing that advances what this bill needs us to do and what our security agencies need. We believe that we do that in our bill, but at the same time we have regard to those democratic values and freedoms which I mentioned. We believe that we have to make tough decisions in the interests of the safety of all Australians. A bill such as this is the sort of decision that I mention.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:07:00</time.stamp><page.no>7631</page.no><name role="metadata">Greig, Sen Brian</name><name role="display">Senator GREIG</name><name.id>86X</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The first group of amendments moved by the opposition would remove reference to detention. If the committee are to support that, then we should acknowledge that the removal of references to detention may influence the interpretation of the act by a judge, should it be challenged— that is, individual sections should be interpreted consistently with the spirit of the act as a whole. Opposition amendment (14) would remove the provision which enables a person to be deprived of the right to legal advice during the first 48 hours. It is very important to emphasise here that access to legal advice and, indeed, access to legal aid where warranted in those circumstances is critical.

The government takes Australia's human rights obligations seriously and makes conscientious efforts to ensure that they are complied with. The bill recognises the need to ensure both the security and safety of the community and respect for individual rights. Ultimately, any person claiming that his or her international human rights under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights have been violated has a right to lodge a communication with the United Nations Human Rights Committee. We believe it would be impossible for any country to say categorically that no breaches of its international human rights obligations will ever occur, because these obligations relate to the treatment of individuals and compliance will depend on the circumstances of each individual case. But one has to remember that stemming from that resolution by the United Nations Security Council is a duty on member states to prevent and suppress terrorist acts.

It knows that that is the case. The minister has indicated that that is the case but this government, headed by the Hon. John Howard, Prime Minister, is not honest about this legislation. If it were we could have a much more reasonable debate here. We could say, `This is a difficult situation.' Of course, we have to attack terrorism. We have to defend ourselves against terrorism, because terrorism itself is an attack on democracy, freedom and liberty. But we are not into an open and honest debate on this matter and on how we deal with the dilemma. We are into a debate in which the government says it is defending those values but knows that, through this piece of legislation, it is in breach of international laws upholding those values but will not say so.</para><para>I think honesty is a basic component of a healthy debate in a free parliament like this. Sometimes we do get terrible contradictory problems and this is one of them. But this debate is not helped by the government failing to admit the problem it faces. Once the government says—and this is the problem— `We can do what we like in internal legislation; we can cut down civil and political rights to sections of the community,' but will not admit that, then the process has no end. We have seen it with the detained asylum seekers. We are seeing it here in this legislation. We have to ask: where does it end? The problem is that it will go a lot further if we allow the government to get away with saying that it is not breaching anything here. That is a lie. Any minister or member opposite who gets up and says that would be confronted with the compelling evidence that that is a lie.</para><para>This legislation does breach international covenants.

If we look at the powers of the bill, we find some rather frightening things. A person may be detained for questioning without being suspected of having committed or having been involved in planning an offence. They do not even have to be suspected of being involved in the planning of it, yet they can be held incommunicado. That person may be held for 48 hours. The period of detention may be extended if certain grounds are satisfied, with no maximum period of detention specified. </para><para>There is no right to silence. Well, excuse me: if the right to remain silent is not one of the fundamental civil rights that we have in Australian society, what is? The privilege of refusing to answer on the grounds of selfincrimination does not apply.

There is no right to legal representation. You lose your right to remain silent. You lose your right not to answer because you may incriminate yourself.

Both in the original bill and in the bill as grudgingly amended in the House, the government has very stubbornly stuck to the basic model that it proposed on day one. That model contemplates allowing children to be detained for an extended period and to be questioned by ASIO. It contemplates allowing someone not suspected of any offence to be detained for seven days, including for 48 hours without a lawyer. Even after questioning has finished, a person not suspected of any offence can be detained for seven days.</para></talk.start><para>The radical model proposed by the government is still at the core of the amended bill. I say it is still a detention regime. The government says it is for gathering intelligence. If that is so, then people should be released once questioning finishes. But of course, that is not the case. The government originally wanted to detain them for an unlimited period. Now they have grudgingly wound that back to seven days. Detaining people is a police function, and that is not what this bill should be about. The opposition amendments ensure the bill is about intelligence gathering and questioning, not about detention.</para><para>The government uses the words `detention' and `detain' in many contexts, but it uses them primarily to justify detaining people after questioning has finished—that is, they are detained for some other purpose. We have chosen the word `custody' and used it sparingly to indicate the nature of the situation that a person is in when they are being questioned over a period of time. The only purpose of custody under the opposition's model—under these proposed opposition amendments—is for questioning. That is the crucial difference. The critical difference here is the purpose of the custody. The purpose is questioning, not detention.

This government, like all of its predecessors, has no option but to keep raising revenue for legitimate Australian needs—for more to be spent on upgrading national security, creating jobs, improving health and education services and investing in the environment for a sustainable future. Revenue prospects are affected by growth prospects. The federal government faces some difficult budgetary challenges in the near future. The precise economic effects of the drought remain unknown but are likely to be substantial; the global economic climate is uncertain; and, if the Iraq crisis blows up, oil prices will go through the roof.</para></talk.start><para>It is important to secure additional revenue sources to cover a very problematic future, and the fairest way to do that is by reducing unfair tax concessions, eliminating tax rorts and cutting wasteful tax expenditure. In this climate, the government needs to examine its revenue base to determine whether there are any sources from which additional revenue could reasonably be derived. For five years now I have been urging the government to address the unfair and costly tax loss that results from a number of super-club businesses abusing the mutuality principle. The mutuality principle was designed as a tax concession to help community services, not to give big businesses a tax lurk. Conservative estimates suggest that closing this loophole could generate at least $200 million in revenue annually.</para><para>I fully endorse the principle of mutuality when it is properly applied. The mutuality principle provides that, where a number of persons contribute to a common fund that is created and managed as a common interest, any excess earnings that are generated from the use of the fund are not to be considered income for the purposes of taxation. This affords the private licensed registered club industry in Australia tax-free status on income derived from members. This system offers significant benefits to the Australian community. It allows many community organisations, such as small sporting clubs, to consolidate their financial position. These community based clubs often have very limited resources. This concessional tax treatment enhances their ability to continue to contribute to the community for the common good. </para><para>This is an excellent system but it is only excellent where it is not abused—and it is abused, to the benefit of big businesses. Large, big business clubs throughout Australia have diversified into a broad range of commercial activities that are way outside the intention of their original community based charter. Apart from the exceptionally large salaries that seem to float around in these big businesses, the big business club sector is involved in operating accommodation properties, ski lodges, cinemas, IMAX theatres, gymnasiums, travel agencies, bus services, hairdressing businesses, bakeries and butcher shops—all with huge taxpayer subsidies. In the process, such big businesses are not only not paying their fair share of tax but also hurting small and local taxpaying businesses unable to compete with their larger, tax-free competitors.</para><para>I start from the premise that, where possible, tax laws should look to the substance rather than the form of commercial arrangements. The fact is that some clubs are major multimillion dollar commercial enterprises. They are clubs in form but commercial enterprises in substance. They should be taxed accordingly as businesses. I will use one example for this speech: a club that has been in the news for other reasons recently. There are many other examples, some of which I have used in the past. The Bulldogs Rugby League Club's audited annual financial reports for the year ended 31 October 2001 show that the tax payable for that year was a net $1,181,494 on a profit before tax that was declared of $5,585,154. In theory, this would represent a 21.1 per cent tax rate. But this profit does not include grants paid by the club totalling $6,745,000 for the year. There is no further notation in the accounts as to how or where these grants were paid. It is unclear from the financial reports whether the grants should have been fully tax deductible. If we look at total profits before allocating any grants, the profit would then be $12,330,154 and the tax rate 9.6 per cent.</para><para>While the precise detail of the club's taxation situation is not clear from the financial reports—and that in itself is an issue—it can be estimated that the tax rate was somewhere between 10 and 20 per cent. This is a very low to low tax rate and a good example of the revenue shortfall that government could instead be gaining and devoting to health, education or other areas of community need. This is not the local tennis club that is being concessionally taxed. It is a big business—a major commercial enterprise that is given a special unfair advantage over its competitors.</para><para>Let us examine another tax lurk they enjoy. Consider the difference between the gaming machine taxes paid by hoteliers to that of their club counterparts under the New South Wales Gaming Machine Tax Act. On the first $1 million of gaming machine profits, a hotelier is liable for $216,600 while a registered club will pay $87,280. On $2 million profit, a hotelier will pay $525,700 while a registered club will pay only $156,600. The fact that large clubs pay less tax on their gaming operations means that other operations of these big business clubs can be subsidised, including food and beverages, entertainment and accommodation, along with undertaking further activities and capital expenditure. The benefits for an elite group of members and guests in accessing cheap big business club operations subsidised by the rest of us, including dining and bar facilities, gym and entertainment, are to the detriment of both much needed revenue for other purposes and fair competition.</para><para>Concern has also been expressed at the fact that the level of community contributions from clubs is not accurately measured. The role of clubs should be to support community projects in sport or welfare. Many do, and the Democrats and I strongly support the continuation of that community service; but there are many cases in which it can be shown that big business clubs are paying nothing or a very small percentage of their profit back to the community. This is an unacceptable distortion and manipulation of the tax system. The commercial activities of private licensed registered clubs operating as businesses should be subject to company tax, as with any other business enterprise. Clubs should also be obliged to pay a mandatory sum to community organisations as part of their charter. Apparent constraints on the Taxation Office and the courts to effectively interpret the current taxation exemption in respect of clubs should be removed by both legislative change and a more vigorous enforcement and evaluation procedure. </para><para>One proposal I am aware of is that section 50-45 of the Income Tax Assessment Act should give effect to a test that a club show that the principal activity of that club is in accordance with the original objectives of the club. The effect of this change would be that, where clubs have a principal activity relating to social activity as distinct from sporting or community activities, there would be definitive guidelines whereby the tax office would be in a position to review those clubs in order to reassess their taxation exemptions. I support the notion of community based organisations and clubs and view smaller, tax-exempt club enterprises as legitimate and desirable community subsidised organisations. The large superclub big businesses, however, are clearly major multimillion dollar commercial enterprises that should be taxed appropriately.</para><para>The current situation has a severe effect on the hotel and other associated hospitality and service industries. If left unchecked, it will undoubtedly result in reduced investment in those industries, many of which are small businesses. This will be to the detriment of Australia as a whole. I have previously moved amendments in the Senate to try to remove the loopholes that have created this problem. There are of course many views about how best to reform the mutuality principle, and I am not committed to any particular model. I ask again that the government review this situation as a matter of urgency, and I say again that there is about $200 million out there that they could get. It is necessary to assist small business competitors that are being unfairly disadvantaged and to provide revenue to assist in meeting the substantial budgetary needs not just of this government but of future governments.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Taxation: Tobacco</title><page.no>7637</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:43:00</time.stamp><page.no>7637</page.no><name role="metadata">Barnett, Sen Guy</name><name role="display">Senator BARNETT</name><name.id>00AUF</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In 1997 tobacco wholesalers gained a windfall of up to $250 million following a High Court ruling on tobacco franchise fees. The ruling meant that the tobacco wholesalers did not have to pay excise collected during the period 1 July 1997 and 5 August 1997 to the states or to the Australian government. Wholesalers retained up to $250 million in excise collections and, while the Australian government acted to prevent greater windfalls to wholesalers for all amounts prior to 1 July 1997, the government has cited subsequent High Court judgments to argue that its legal options are constrained. Retrospective legislation is a dangerous precedent at any time. This money does not belong to either the tobacco retailers or the tobacco wholesalers. Neither does it belong to any government—state or federal. It belongs to those smokers who purchased their tobacco products during the same period in 1997. If no action is taken, there is every possibility that some of the funds will remain with the tobacco wholesalers, and in my view this would be a tragedy.</para></talk.start><para>I acknowledge that there is currently litigation between the tobacco retailers and the tobacco wholesalers and that the tobacco retailers are likely to be successful in retrieving some of the funds from the tobacco wholesalers. But I say again that it is, in my view, not their money nor the tobacco wholesalers' money. The $250 million windfall gained by the tobacco wholesalers in 1997 should be used for antismoking campaigns and tobacco related health care. In my view, the tobacco wholesalers and retailers are morally bound to return the money and use it, preferably by way of hypothecated funding, for smoking related health care.</para><para>I have been advised by the Cancer Council in my home state of Tasmania that the $250 million would assist with much-needed antismoking campaigns—indeed, I agree. I hope that this money will help save some of the nearly 20,000 Australian lives lost to tobacco related diseases each year. The Cancer Council has advised that tobacco addiction carries a health and social cost of $12.7 billion a year in Australia. </para><para>I compliment Lawson Ride, the Executive Director of the Cancer Council of Tasmania, and the Chairman, Rob Walters, for the work that they do in raising this important issue. I also compliment the cancer councils in each and every state and territory around this nation for highlighting and addressing the concerns that are faced by those Australian people dealing with tobacco related diseases. There are costs that flow from that, and of course there are 20,000 Australian lives lost each year to tobacco related diseases.</para><para>I also acknowledge the work of the Launceston Cancerians, including the good work of my own mother, Lady Ferrall, for raising money in aid of research for cancer. It may seem unusual to stand in this place to compliment one's mother, but in this case the accolades are entirely appropriate. I compliment the Launceston Cancerians for the work that they do and the team that they have around them. Indeed, there is another team in Hobart and there are other groups in and around Tasmania that raise funds for research into cancer and for cancer support. I compliment all those who work in the cancer support industry. I hope that this call for action and the moral authority that we have in this place will be a good indicator and will send a very strong message to the tobacco wholesalers and the tobacco retailers that this is actually not their money and that it can be best used for antismoking campaigns and tobacco related health care.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Drought</title><page.no>7638</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:48:00</time.stamp><page.no>7638</page.no><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name><name.id>00AOS</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—Last night it rained in my home town of Goulburn.</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>9L6</name.id><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator Mackay</name></talker><para>—Hooray!</para></talk.start></interjection><continue><talk.start><talker><name.id>00AOS</name.id><name role="metadata">Stephens, Sen Ursula</name><name role="display">Senator STEPHENS</name></talker><para>—Yes, hooray!

This is the first of four information papers developed by AWI, with contributions from the New South Wales and Western Australian departments of agriculture, the Queensland and South Australian departments of primary industry, the Victorian department of natural resources, and Woolmark. `Decision making during drought' provides information to wool producers, including a high-level assessment of the current drought and the impact that it may have on the wool industry, current information and services available from a range of sources to assist producers through these difficult times, identification of current AWI investments that will deliver innovation and new technology for drought management in the future, identification of activities that AWI is considering to help producers now, and future strategic research and development opportunities for AWI investment.

Labor provided the community with a blueprint of what we think should be done to help drought affected communities. It is a blueprint of what Labor will do in government. We will cut through the red tape by setting a seven-day turnaround for prima facie assessment of EC applications to allow emergency funding to flow to farm families in need. Further to this, we will set a 28-day turnaround for full EC assessment. Labor will improve the Farm Management Deposit Scheme by providing flexibility in accessing farm management deposits, to allow farmers in EC declared areas to withdraw deposits within 12 months without penalty. We will introduce 100 per cent interest rate subsidies for loans used to preserve core breeding stock. We will order an immediate national grain audit to assist current and future national grain supplies to allow intensive industries to plan for potential feed shortages in 2003. We will coordinate existing rural programs to better assist rural and regional communities manage the drought. We will work with the states to streamline exceptional circumstances application processes, by adding drought to the agenda for the next COAG meeting. When drought strikes, Labor is there. Our state Labor governments have been responding for many months, and we have created this six-point plan. </para><para>I move now to the announcements made yesterday by the Prime Minister. On behalf of the 60,000-plus farmers and the many country communities affected, I congratulate him and John Anderson on reforming the farm management deposits to allow farmers to withdraw their deposits within 12 months without penalty. This is, in fact, point 2 of Labor's six-point plan. There are some admirable features in yesterday's announcement. I will certainly be watching the Drought Force program with interest, although my office has already been contacted by some people from northern country New South Wales who have tried to find out about this program from Centrelink, and who have been referred to the AFFA web site, only to be directed from there to a link connecting them to Minister Truss's announcement. I would hate to think that this was going to be another bungle between departments, such as that which characterised the exceptional circumstances announcements of August this year.</para><para> There are some questions about how the Work for the Dole program can be voluntary while others are being forced into Work for the Dole programs as part of the government's reciprocal obligations regime. I will grant the government the benefit of the doubt, because at last the Prime Minister and his government are doing something about the desperate drought conditions being experienced across Australia.</para><para>The Prime Minister's announcement has had a mixed reception. With a drought of this magnitude, however, there has to be a compassionate approach, although I recognise the concerns of some rural commentators about extending income support measures but at the same time not supporting efforts by farmers to develop risk management strategies. This government must implement a seven-day turnaround for the prima facie assessment of EC applications and set a 28-day turnaround for full EC assessments. Only through such reform will our farmers receive the funding they desperately need. <inline font-style="italic">(Time expired)</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Hunter Region: Newcastle Structural Adjustment Fund</title><page.no>7640</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>22:58:00</time.stamp><page.no>7640</page.no><name role="metadata">Tierney, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator TIERNEY</name><name.id>O15</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise tonight to speak on a very successful regional employment program in the Hunter Valley, called the Newcastle structural adjustment fund. This fund was established in the wake of the shutdown of steel smelting in Newcastle in 1997. This was a traumatic event not only for the Hunter but for the whole of Australia. At that time the feeling was that, if Newcastle could no longer smelt steel, what were the chances for steel making in the rest of the country and, therefore, what were the chances for secondary industry? It was a very traumatic event. At the time, the Prime Minister, to his great credit, came up to Newcastle, spent two days in the city and had widespread consultation with the unions, the leaders of the community, welfare groups and other community members. This consultation led to the creation of the Newcastle structural adjustment fund. </para></talk.start><para>As it turned out, the shutdown of steel smelting in Newcastle with the loss of 2,000 jobs was followed the next year by the creation of 40,000 jobs in the region. What had occurred was a major boom in the Hunter, following the successful policies of the Howard government since 1996 in generating higher levels of employment in this country. Indeed, today we see that unemployment has dropped to six per cent. The Hunter, which under the last Labor government was running at 15 per cent unemployment and moved down to under 10 per cent under our government—in the Olympic period it touched seven per cent—at that time had moved back but is now down around seven per cent. This really disturbs the Labor Party in the Newcastle area. They had a job summit on this week. They were going to talk about the job crisis, but unfortunately for them the Bureau of Statistics showed that unemployment had plummeted to seven per cent. They said, `This can't possibly be right; the statistics are wrong.' A lot of this has been generated by policies from this government that has got the budget in order, got the deficit down, got interest rates down and got the economy really moving. This has now flowed through to regions like the Hunter Valley.</para><para>But in 1997 the outlook was pretty grim. Hence, the state government and the federal government brought in two structural adjustment packages for assistance post BHP. As you look down on the city of Newcastle, you see it dominated by these industries and you think that that is basically the industry of Newcastle. But the reality in the Hunter Valley was that when BHP shut down its steel-smelting facilities it was actually only shutting down one per cent of employment in the Hunter Valley. There were 2,000 people employed at the steel works at that time. But it was a major shock at the time and therefore it needed a response. Both the state government and the federal government came in with that response in the form of the Hunter structural adjustment packages.</para><para>It was therefore somewhat disturbing to find that the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> editorial two days ago published a comparison of the two projects. The unfortunate thing about their comparison was that they took the very honest figures provided by the federal government in terms of money spent, projects funded and job outcomes achieved and compared them with the rather dodgy figures of the Carr Labor government. Evidence to support those figures has not yet been provided. They claim these figures are commercial-in-confidence, so instead of giving the outcomes for jobs project by project they have just given the grand total, claiming that $10 million has generated $200 million worth of investment and 2,700 jobs. Given that they funded a series of small projects that were basically private businesses, these sorts of outcomes would be absolutely astounding. Talk about rubbery figures! But that is what we have come to expect from the Carr government.</para><para>By comparison, our federal government went through a very detailed assessment process and made sure that, with each project, there were going to be direct job outcomes, indirect job outcomes, short-term outcomes and long-term outcomes, and this had to be proved before the minister of the day, Senator Ian Macdonald, would sign off on those projects. I have had a lot of discussions with him. I would like to pay special tribute not only to the projects he signed off but to the visionary direction taken in the case of the federal Newcastle structural adjustment program. Unlike the state government, which funded a whole series of small businesses, what we did was fund a series of infrastructure projects, off the back of which there could be a whole lot of extra private jobs generated. That was the approach in 1997, and five years later the proof is in the pudding—this is actually coming to fruition.</para><para>I will go through some of the federal government's projects, because they are radically transforming Newcastle. One project that is a real highlight, which was perhaps one of the ones we had the most difficulty getting through initially, is the creation of a marina in Newcastle. We are very much in a yachting area. There is a terrific yachting facility in Port Stephens to the north and a terrific yachting facility in Lake Macquarie to the south, but in Newcastle harbour itself if you had a yacht and called in you could not even get any fuel—there was no place to do that. That is now being replaced with a 220-yacht facility. This will transform Newcastle harbour. As a matter of fact, more than half of the facility is built. There have been a few trial runs which I have been involved with where they have brought yachts in from the other nearby yachting areas and tried out the facilities. Over the years we had ships bringing in iron ore. That is now being replaced by 220 yachts, if you can imagine Newcastle harbour and the way that is going to transform it in the next year. But it is not only a visual thing. There is a whole range of businesses that are now developing around the facility. So what we have created with this marina is a little microeconomy which will generate many more jobs than were originally projected, and that is just one project. </para><para>Another excellent piece of infrastructure was the pipeline into the Hunter Valley vineyards. We all know that the Lower Hunter has some of the best wines in the world, but the amazing thing is that no-one managed to provide a pipeline over the last 150 years until we came up with the seed funding, off the back of which more funding was generated. Every vineyard is now linked up to the Hunter River. Can you imagine, in the drought that we are currently in, what a difference that will make to the yields and the vintages? This also generates a little microeconomy in the region, because if you have secure water supplies you get greater yields, people are confident and open more vineyards, you have more wineries opening and more restaurants and golf courses, and the whole economy builds on the back of that. That is a sign of the success of this approach.</para><para>Newcastle Airport is another success. We actually funded an extension of the apron areas and the facilities for handling and, despite the fact that there has been a downturn in aviation, there is greater diversity not just within the airport but also surrounding the airport. I was delighted to see, when I went in on Monday morning, a new sign up— `Brindabella Airlines'. There will be direct flights developing between Canberra and Newcastle. This is a terrific development at a time when aviation has turned down. This is possible because we have provided the proper infrastructure for such businesses to develop.</para><para>So it is a great pity that the editorial of the <inline font-style="italic">Newcastle Herald</inline> gave such a misleading picture. The reality is that the federally funded Newcastle structural adjustment program has delivered real growth and jobs, and I compliment Senator Ian Macdonald for his work as the minister in delivering that program.</para></speech></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Adjournment Speech</title><page.no>7642</page.no></subdebateinfo><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>23:08:00</time.stamp><page.no>7642</page.no><name role="metadata">Mackay, Sen Sue</name><name role="display">Senator MACKAY</name><name.id>9L6</name.id><electorate>Tasmania</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—In the short time available to me—</para></talk.start><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>YW4</name.id><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name></talker><para>—Mr Acting Deputy President, can I raise a point of order.
