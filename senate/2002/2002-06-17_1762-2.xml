He was educated at Shore School in Sydney, at Geelong Grammar and at Oxford University, where he received a Master of Arts. It was while attending Oxford that Sir John trained as a pilot, was a member of the rowing team and also met Betty, an American, whom he married in 1935. On returning from Oxford, Sir John worked at his father's orchard at Kerang, in Victoria, until the outbreak of World War II, when he enlisted in the Royal Australian Air Force and bravely served his nation in Britain, Malaysia and Papua New Guinea. Sir John received severe facial injuries when his Hurricane fighter crashed during the defence of Singapore. He was discharged from service in December 1944, with the rank of flight lieutenant, whereupon he returned to managing the family orchard, along with his wife and his three children.</para><para>Sir John was active in local politics, being a member of the Kerang Shire Council from 1946 to 1952 and shire president from 1949 to 1950. He joined the Country Party but later switched to the Liberal Party and was elected as a senator for Victoria in the 1949 general election, taking up his position in February 1950. </para><para>Sir John was the longest-serving minister for the Navy, from 1958 to 1963. He assisted the Minister for Foreign Affairs from 1960 to 1963. He was minister in charge of the CSIRO from 1962 to 1963, Minister for Works from 1963 to 1967 and Minister for the Interior from 1963 to 1964. He was the first federal minister for education when he became Minister for Education and Science from 1966 to 1968 and was briefly Minister for Defence in the McMahon government in 1971. He was also Leader of the Government in the Senate from 1967 to 1968. After the disappearance of Harold Holt in December 1967, Sir John Gorton became Australia's 19th Prime Minister on 10 January 1968, the only senator to do so. He moved to the House of Representatives in 1968, after contesting and winning the seat of Higgins. Sir John held the office of Prime Minister until 1971.</para><para>Sir John made a significant contribution to Australia in a number of key policy areas. Perhaps his most conspicuous contribution to the life of the nation as Prime Minister was his determined advancement of Australian national interests. In particular, he sought to raise the consciousness of all Australians to value what it meant to be an Australian. He had a strong sense of Australia's distinctive identity, and this showed in his approaches to issues of national development and foreign investment.</para><para>Sir John will be remembered for his important contribution to education, where he advocated the fair treatment of both government and independent schools and maintained a strong commitment to the quality of Australian universities. He placed education firmly on the Commonwealth agenda and fervently believed that every Australian should have equal access to a quality education. He initiated a series of grants for science blocks and vigorously promoted and expanded the Commonwealth's secondary scholarships scheme. His dedication to Australian nationalism also extended to the cultural identification of this country. The Gorton government provided the first Commonwealth assistance to the Australian film industry, establishing the National Film and Television Training School and the Australian Council for the Arts. </para><para>Sir John also had a major role in recognising how important it was to protect Australia's unique environment for future generations. As Prime Minister, he created the first federal environment portfolio, the Office of the Environment, in November 1970. His government also established what is now the Casey Antarctic base to enhance scientific research and protection of the Antarctic environment. Sir John also played a major role in moves to protect the Great Barrier Reef, about which he held a longstanding passion. So outstanding was Sir John's commitment to the environment that in 1999 the current Prime Minister renamed the offices of the Department of the Environment and Heritage as the John Gorton Building. It was my pleasure as environment minister at that time to also be present at that very happy and significant occasion.</para><para>Sir John himself was Australian to his bootstraps. He was fearless in the pursuit of his views and honest and forthright in his dealings with his colleagues and the country. He was respected by people from all sides of politics. As a politician, he exhibited great personal loyalty as well as a deep conviction for the views he held. His firm sense of social justice stemmed from his earliest years as a school student during the Depression and was maintained throughout his life.</para><para>The circumstances of his departure as Prime Minister have, of course, now become part of our political folklore. We all have our strengths and weaknesses, but in my view his loss of office was clearly a net loss to the nation. He was made a Privy Councillor in 1968, a Companion of Honour in 1971, a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George in 1977 and a Companion of the Order of Australia in Australia's bicentennial year, 1988. Sir John married Nancy Home in 1993, his wife Betty having died of cancer in 1983.</para><para>On behalf of the government I extend to his wife, Lady Nancy Gorton, children, Joanna, Michael and Robin, and to other family members and friends our most sincere sympathy in their bereavement.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:39:00</time.stamp><page.no>1856</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator FAULKNER</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><role>Leader of the Opposition in the Senate</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—On behalf of the opposition I support the condolence motion and I associate the opposition with it. A condolence motion for a former Prime Minister is a rare event. Today's is the only one that I have witnessed in the 13 years I have served in this chamber. So today is not a typical Senate sitting day, as we will adjourn later as a mark of respect to Sir John Gorton. Then again, Sir John Gorton was not a typical Prime Minister. For one thing, when he was elected leader of the Liberal Party he became the first and only senator to achieve the highest elected office our country has to offer. While others have tried to make the transition, some in the hope of becoming Prime Minister—including a number recently—few have made that transfer successfully. But the then Senator Gorton became Prime Minister even before he became a member of the House of Representatives. He was Australia's 19th Prime Minister and he will be remembered for starting to drag Australia out of Menzian complacency.</para></talk.start><para>There was nothing usual about Gorton's life or political career. His road to the prime ministership was predicated on tragedy—the drowning of Harold Holt. He was, as we have heard, born in 1911 and he had a rather disjointed childhood. He was born out of wedlock into a society that frowned on such things. He suffered the death of his mother while still a young boy. He was schooled at Geelong Grammar and then attended Oxford University. In 1934 he met his first wife, American Bettina Brown. She was 18. They had to fudge her age to get married.</para><para>During the war he survived two fighter plane crashes—one in a Hurricane, one in a Kittyhawk—and a torpedo attack on an ammunition ship which had rescued him. During the recent television coverage of Sir John's life, the footage of the young airman, covered in oil and being pulled from the water, is a haunting image of the heroism that he, and so many like him, displayed in war in the Pacific.  </para><para>After the war Gorton entered politics in a conventional way: first, local government— becoming president of the Kerang Shire Council in Victoria, where he was an orchardist—then contesting, but losing, a seat in the Legislative Council of the Victorian parliament. In 1949 he won a Senate seat in the election which saw the defeat of the Chifley government and the beginning of 23 years of unbroken Liberal rule. Nine years later, under Menzies, Gorton was appointed Minister for the Navy, and throughout the sixties served in a variety of portfolios. He was minister in charge of the CSIRO, Minister for the Interior, Minister for Works, and Minister for Education and Science. His biographer, Ian Hancock, says that as education minister from 1963-68, Gorton produced his most `creative and substantive and enduring contribution to Australia as he expanded the Commonwealth's role across the education field'.</para><para>Perhaps it was his 19 years as a senator and two years as Senate leader that led to his strong views about the representativeness and role of this chamber. But it was his misfortune to come to the position of Prime Minister when the Leader of the Opposition was Gough Whitlam. To some extent, Gorton owed his prime ministership to Whitlam, to the challenge that the new Labor leader posed with his grasp of parliamentary tactics and exceptional media skills. As Ross McMullin would later write, Gorton owed his success to `the effective television and radio appearances he made while his parliamentary colleagues were evaluating the various contenders'. The first Liberal leader chosen on the basis of media performance, though not the last, his good fortune was to be chosen by his party as the one candidate most likely to handle Whitlam. His misfortune was that he proved incapable of doing so.</para><para>Although the contrast between Gorton and Whitlam was stark, Gorton had many curious parallels with Whitlam. Like Whitlam, his ability to use the media was integral to his political success; unlike Whitlam, it was not matched with electoral success. Like Whitlam, Gorton would be accused of high-handedness and failure to consult colleagues. Like Whitlam, he was a federalist. Indeed, when Gorton congratulated Whitlam after the 1972 election victory that swept Labor into power, the new Prime Minister wrote back: </para><quote><para>I shall try to advance some of the causes which you were the first Prime Minister to identify.</para></quote><para>Like Whitlam, Gorton had been a flight lieutenant in the Second World War and had gone into politics after a return from active service. Like Whitlam too, Gorton's unwise comments about his parliamentary leaders— in his case, Holt and McMahon; in Whitlam's case, Calwell—landed him in a certain amount of hot water. Whitlam, however, survived, even thrived; Gorton not so. Unlike Gorton, who left the Liberal Party, Whitlam remained always loyal to Labor. Gorton repaid his perception of Fraser's disloyalty to him by quitting the Liberal Party in disgust in 1975, even advocating a vote for Labor at the election that year—not that it did us much good, I might say. Not until two decades later was Gorton finally taken back into the Liberal fold. I, for one, will not be criticising my political opponents for holding out an olive branch to a disillusioned former leader. That is a strength; it is not a weakness.</para><para>The `Gorton experiment', as journalist Alan Reid called it, was a failure. Gorton's coalition government lost 17 seats in the first and only election he fought as leader. Eighteen months later, his own party was even less forgiving than the public. As Gavin Souter says in his great history, <inline font-style="italic">Acts of Parliament</inline>, by 1971 `Gorton had offended too many friends ever to be short of enemies'. In many ways John Gorton was a social conservative. He believed in the White Australia policy and resisted the push for Aboriginal land rights, though in his speech at the Prime Ministers on Prime Ministers lecture series in 1997 he graciously acknowledged Holt's efforts for Aboriginal people with the 1967 referendum before he roundly criticised the Mabo judgment and native title. </para><para>He was a hawk when it came to fighting the `communist menace', as it was then dubbed. He was a great believer in our alliance with the US, although as the Vietnam War soured he became more uncertain. In other ways, Gorton was fundamentally opposed to the dominant paradigms of his party: he was a centralist and someone who wanted a more nationalist agenda. He was not as wedded to Britain as Menzies had been—that was not difficult. He made it more difficult for foreign companies, including British ones, to take over Australian businesses. His choice of Ainslie Gotto as principal private secretary caused a furore. His choice of Sir Lennox Hewitt as secretary of the Prime Minister's department also put noses out of joint. John Gorton took on Joh Bjelke-Petersen over the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, and even that one issue alone should ensure his place in our history.</para><para>John Gorton was his own man. He was engaged in a self-styled `experiment in a Prime Minister being himself'. In the Prime Ministers lecture series, he asked: </para><quote><para>What makes a good prime minister—apart from the obvious qualities of intelligence and integrity?</para></quote><para>His answer was `most of all' being a risk taker:</para><quote><para>... the need to recognise and grasp opportunities ... going out on a limb to do something you feel strongly about, and doing it regardless of the short term cost.</para></quote><para>John Gorton lived by his own dictum, and it cost him dearly.</para><para>Through the pens of eulogists, John Gorton has been described recently as a `typical Australian'. We read about his `larrikin streak', his `liking a beer', his being `comfortable in the company of women' and his `individuality'. And John Gorton did have many personal characteristics which contributed to making him unique among Australia's prime ministers. In his 1969 informal biography of Gorton—this was when the Gorton experiment was still being judged by Australians—Alan Trengove wrote:</para><quote><para>The nineteenth Prime Minister of Australia is probably the most complex and enigmatic bloke to have held that office ... an apparent extrovert who in reality is often withdrawn, secretive and calculating as any lonely introvert. He is the leader of a nation of suburb-dwellers who has never in his adult life lived long in a big city himself. He is an Oxford graduate, an historian, with a ... feeling for words ... that enables him at his best to make a speech of refreshing clarity and conviction and controlled emotion. He is also apt occasionally to become entangled in a maze of words so baffling that those trying to follow him through qualifying phrases, in and out of parentheses, and up and over interpolations feel that they are being led round a verbal obstacle course.</para></quote><para>In this condolence motion, I want to make the point that, unlike some, we on this side of the chamber—and I am sure the vast majority of those in the Australian parliament and outside—have no long-held grudges to settle over either the manner of Sir John's accession to the prime ministership or the circumstances in which he left it.</para><para>Sir John Gorton was an idiosyncratic leader. As Prime Minister, he was true to himself. He was also true to Australia, and he did seek out a more independent national identity for this country. He was above all else a passionate Australian and, on behalf of my Senate colleagues, I would like to extend my sincere condolences to Lady Gorton and to his family and friends.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>12:53:00</time.stamp><page.no>1858</page.no><name role="metadata">Stott Despoja, Sen Natasha</name><name role="display">Senator STOTT DESPOJA</name><name.id>3I6</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>AD</party><role>Leader of the Australian Democrats</role><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I rise on behalf of my Democrat colleagues and, indeed, the Australian Democrats.

Senator Vicky Bourne, other colleagues and I attended the memorial service on 31 May on behalf of our party. The House of Representatives has already had the opportunity to pay tribute to Sir John Gorton. Occupants of this building write his name many times a week, as DOFA and MAPS are located in the building named after him in Canberra. Biographer Ian Hancock described him as: </para><quote><para>very likeable  a knockabout bloke with the larrikin streak, his scarred features and crumpled suits, his candid approach and laconic air, jaunty grin, tousled hair and ever-present cigarette.</para></quote><para>As a young man, he was house captain and school prefect. He was a fine rower and allegedly shared a dormitory with Errol Flynn at one time. As has been said, he lied about his wife's age, raising it from 18 to 21 in order to marry her. He had a distinguished military career and he was an orchardist. He served in local government; he was the president of Kerang Shire Council before he entered the Australian Senate.</para><para>He first won a Victorian Senate seat on a joint LCP-Country Party ticket back in 1949. He was, as has been mentioned, the first senator to become Prime Minister of Australia and, indeed, held many portfolios over his career. He was the longest serving Minister for the Navy; he assisted the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Minister-in-Charge of Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation, Minister for Works and Minister for the Interior. He was the first federal minister for education when he become Minister for Education and Science in 1966. He was deputy in the McMahon government in 1971.</para><para>He was elected to the Senate five times before resigning to become Prime Minister. He was elected to the lower house four times before he left the Liberal Party to stand as an independent candidate for the Senate in the ACT in 1975. Former Democrat Senator John Siddons, from Victoria also, says that he and others approached Gorton to lead a United Australia Party and a Liberal Movement Party in 1974, but Gorton had decided that he did not want to become a flag carrier.</para><para>He may not have been our founding member, but he was a friend of the Australian Democrats and, particularly, a friend of our most famous founder, Don Chipp. In fact, John Gorton was one of those many thousands of Australians who gathered in Melbourne on that cold, rainy Monday night in May 1977 when we held one of our first public meetings to form the new party. I understand from reports that he received a standing ovation from the crowd when he walked in a little later than those who had assembled. When the crowd recognised who was in attendance, they all rose to their feet in applause.</para><para>In 1978, in a book that was cowritten by Don Chipp, he wrote:</para><quote><para>It may perhaps be considered a little odd that I should write a preface to this book, which I have not read. After all I am not a member of Don Chipp's Party or any other party. But it will not be considered so odd when you realise that I have known and worked with and admired Don Chipp for many years.</para><para>Yet it is not only because of my admiration for him that I write. I feel that there is a real place for his Party in the democratic life of the country. A nucleus of Australian Democrats in the House of Representatives and in the Senate could keep either of the major parties from acting too outrageously.</para><para>And this was the reason why Chipp founded the Party and why so many supported it at the last election.</para><para>It is a novel, if naive, concept for a political party to allow each of its members to vote against any party policies which offend their principles of conscience. But at least it will allow individuality and initiative to replace the total conformity which the present disciplined Party system demands.</para></quote><para>John Gorton was a genuine small `l' liberal—described as a big small `l' liberal— with progressive views. He advocated decriminalisation of marijuana and homosexual law reform. In 1973, as a member of the back bench, he successfully moved for the federal decriminalisation of homosexual acts between consenting adults. On some issues, however, he was a conservative, supporting the White Australia policy and opposing Aboriginal land rights—although he did make Commonwealth gains in Aboriginal health and education services. He initiated many reforms that came to fruition during the Gough Whitlam government. In 1972, Gough Whitlam himself paid tribute to Gorton's legacy. Gorton supported an Australian film industry and the Arts Council. He created an environment department and he opposed Australia selling the farm and foreign companies increasingly having dominance in this country. </para><para>I take the opportunity now, as Senator Faulkner has done, to also pay tribute to Ms Ainslie Gotto, who was his principal private secretary and encountered, as we all know, some snide barbs and unfounded gossip because of her relative youth and her appearance. Fortunately, though, she has also been recognised and praised for the good work that she did and continued to do up until, and after, Gorton's death. I understand that she assisted with the state funeral arrangements. As the national president of a non-profit organisation for female entrepreneurs, she has certainly rewarded Gorton's support, years ahead of his time, for women's participation in the paid work force.</para><para>He was one of the first to understand the power of television in politics. At the same time, he was attacked ferociously by the press. In particular, his visit to the US embassy with a young press gallery reporter may even have contributed to him losing the office of prime minister, and certainly it was an injustice that that young reporter lost her job.</para><para>On Gorton's 80th birthday, Don Chipp said:</para><quote><para>The petty states-righters who wanted to thwart Gorton's dream of a single, unified Australia, joined with the greedy rich who wanted to sell our land and heritage to foreigners.</para></quote><para>This was reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, and the journalist pointed out that:</para><quote><para>From a man whose dismissal as Navy Minister was one of Gorton's first exercises of prime ministerial power, it was a generous tribute ...</para></quote><para>After the 1967 death of the then Prime Minister, Harold Holt, Don Chipp did not support Gorton to be leader, and Gorton dropped Chipp as Minister for Navy as a result of the <inline font-style="italic">Voyager</inline> royal commission, as Chipp probably knew he would. A biography of Don Chipp notes that they had similar styles, so the rift between them was soon healed. Chipp became a part-time member of the Prime Minister's kitchen cabinet, and after the 1969 election Gorton made Chipp Minister for Customs and Excise, where he was able to achieve considerable reform, particularly in the area of censorship. As we all know, Gorton gave the casting vote to lose his prime ministership in March 1971, and he was replaced by the more conservative William McMahon, who lost government in 1972.</para><para>Gorton's experience as a schoolboy of seeing returned soldiers from World War I living in circumstances of poverty and of seeing the inevitable poverty inflicted on their children and others made a lasting impression. He had a renowned military career, which has been referred to here today. During one of two plane crashes, he received considerable scarring and damage to his face, but his story is a reminder that it is so often those who have served this nation in war who most passionately wish the nation to avoid future military conflicts. He did question the Liberal Party's traditional policy of forward defence, and he was Prime Minister at a time when Australian troops were serving in Vietnam. Senator Faulkner is right: he did recognise the importance of the alliance with America but he loosened our bond with the United States of America. He reduced our troop numbers in Vietnam and he understood the problems of the birthday ballot in relation to conscription. He did not maintain a close relationship with the American president. He believed in independence in foreign policy and defence policy.</para><para>For those of you who would like to find out more about this interesting Australian and former Prime Minister, I strongly recommend Ian Hancock's recently released biography, <inline font-style="italic">John Gorton: he did it his way</inline>— which I am sure many of you have read. Don Chipp recommended it to me, and it is a fine read. The release of federal cabinet papers under the 30-year rule has revealed much that favours Gorton—and I am sure that many of us look forward to reading the papers of this cabinet in 30 years time. The personal intervention of Prime Minister Gorton in the 1970s did prevent the mining of oil on the Great Barrier Reef. Senator Faulkner has referred to that and I am sure my Queensland colleague, Senator Andrew Bartlett, will elaborate on it. </para><para>I will finish with two quotes. One is from the <inline font-style="italic">Age</inline> newspaper on the passing of Sir John Gorton: </para><quote><para>Here was an Australian original—a man who stayed true to his personality and paid a price. But he gave much to his country. For that, we must be grateful.</para></quote><para>Lastly, a 1968 quote from the man himself, reported in the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>. This is what he said:</para><quote><para>You know, it was said `A man's reach must exceed his grasp or what's a Heaven for?'

The Rt Hon. Sir John Grey Gorton was one of Australia's best known prime ministers, a former senator in this house and an MP for the Victorian seat of Higgins. He served in this parliament for 26 years. He was born on 9 September 1911 in Melbourne, Victoria, and he died on 19 May this year. He was the 19th Prime Minister of Australia, holding office from 1968 until 1971. We are all aware of the circumstances which saw him become Prime Minister after the disappearance of Prime Minister Harold Holt in 1967. Senators are equally aware of the circumstances surrounding Sir John Gorton's resignation from the position in 1971, when he voted himself out of the prime ministership after a tied ballot in the party room. Sir John Gorton held ministerial positions in this parliament from 1958 until 1971, a period of 13 years. His portfolios included Defence in 1971, when he visited Australian soldiers at war in Vietnam; Education and Science, when he was minister in charge of the CSIRO; Works, when he was in charge of Commonwealth Activities in Education and Research in 1963; and Works in 1967. He served this house as a senator for Victoria for 19 years, from 1949 to 1968, when he successfully stood for election in Harold Holt's old seat of Higgins and took up the position of Prime Minister. </para></talk.start><para>Sir John was an orchardist by trade but he is probably better remembered as a great nationalist. He served his country as an RAAF pilot in World War II and suffered serious war injuries during that time. He was involved in two air crashes and was rescued from a life raft after the ship that he was rescued by was then attacked by a Japanese torpedo. After this distinguished war service, he was elected as a local councillor on the Kerang Shire Council, as a member of the Country Party, as it was in those days. He joined the Senate as a Liberal in the 1949 election. I suppose it is interesting to note that the National Party—or the Country Party as it was at the time of Harold Holt's demise—went out very strenuously and fought for him, arguing that Sir John Gorton—or John Gorton as he was at the time— be the leader of the Liberal Party. In fact, they refused to endorse another leadership aspirant.</para><para>During his parliamentary career, he promoted a staunch Australian nationalist agenda. He encouraged national pride, placed limits on foreign investments, encouraged a more independent foreign policy and promoted an Australian film industry. It was under Sir John Gorton's leadership that the Australian Film and Television School was established, further boosting and concreting the Australian identity by enabling a new wave of Australian films to emerge in the seventies.

I suppose memories play funny tricks on you but, interestingly enough, I do have some wonderful memories of my time covering some of the portfolios that Sir John Gorton was responsible for, particularly the time when he was minister for education.</para></talk.start><para>I have very clear recollections of speeches that Senator Gorton, as he was then, made on education, and in particular a speech he made calling for a single curriculum to apply in primary and secondary schools across Australia so that children whose parents were transferred from state to state would know that at any particular time they would still be learning from the same books and essentially from the same curriculum. I am not sure that we have achieved that even yet. I remember when Senator Gorton, and later Prime Minister Gorton, would call a press conference to speak on a particular topic but the press conference would often finish on topics far away from the original intention of the press conference. They would be wide-ranging and very interesting and would cover many of the initiatives that have been outlined by others here today.</para><para>I think it is always interesting to look at the headlines that are put on obituaries for well-known people because they often represent a reflection of the life of the person. In looking through the obituaries that were written for Prime Minister Gorton, I think it is useful to outline some of the headings that were put on those pieces. There was `Death of a statesman', `Gorton: a certain style', `Gorton: a true original', `An Australian to his bootstraps', `A man for the good of his nation', `A political gladiator of his era' and `A leader who broke the mould'. Perhaps most significant—for it is another of the memories that I have of his time as Prime Minister—was the headline `He did it his way'. I shall never forget the ABC's coverage, on the night Prime Minister Gorton was deposed by Prime Minister McMahon, of Prime Minister Gorton swinging in a bosun's chair between two navy ships with some incredibly rough water beneath him to the tune, which was well known at the time, of Frank Sinatra's song <inline font-style="italic">I did it my way</inline>.</para><para>There is no doubt that Prime Minister Gorton did it his way, and Senator Faulkner outlined a couple of things that he covered in his speech `Prime Ministers on Prime Ministers', which I attended in the Old Parliament House dining room. I think it is useful to summarise some of those policy initiatives but I think it is quite important that we put them against the time, the late 1960s; he became Prime Minister in 1968. Sir John Gorton said:</para><quote><para>Australia was a very different country from that of today. It is probably very difficult for young people today to relate to the Australia of the 1960s where we had virtually full employment, we had no problems with our external trade accounts, we had very low inflation, women were becoming more liberated, and people were more concerned with issues of human rights and social justice.</para></quote><para>He said, and I think it is so appropriate for him:</para><quote><para>But all of these views needed nurturing, so I filled a bucket and I watered them.</para></quote><para>That is a very interesting way of recalling his prime ministership. Another memory I have of him and of that time is the day when he was deposed as Prime Minister. I was standing in a very crowded King's Hall that day in March. I remember the doors opening and both Prime Minister McMahon and former Prime Minister Gorton coming through those doors to the Prime Minister's Corridor. Prime Minister McMahon came up to, I think, about the elbow of former Prime Minister Gorton, and somebody standing near me in the crowd said, `Look at them. And the little guy won.' I think what really struck me and many other people who were standing in King's Hall on that day was the extraordinary differences between these two men. I recall very clearly the interview I did with Ainsley Gotto the night that she was appointed to the Prime Minister's staff. I went to her house and talked to her. What a bright young woman she was; clearly without any real understanding of the storm that was about to break over her head as a result of the appointment. </para><para>There is no doubt that Sir John Gorton was a very distinctive Prime Minister and a person who was well known to people who lived in Canberra. Although he was a senator for Victoria, he spent a great deal of time in Canberra. I have many recollections of chatting with him as he wandered around Hamelin Crescent in Narrabundah. He would always toot the horn and wave when he drove past, some times more enthusiastically than others. I am not sure if it had anything to with the skimpy fashions of the day. I certainly always found him to be a most interesting and fun-loving person. It was a time when our ministers were very accessible in Canberra. Parliament House was a very easy place to come and go from in those days. There were no passes and far less security than we need today. It was very interesting, as a young journalist working for the <inline font-style="italic">Canberra Times</inline>, to cover those years of Prime Minister Gorton, and I enjoyed them very much. I recollect them and his contribution to Australia with great affection.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:15:00</time.stamp><page.no>1863</page.no><name role="metadata">Bartlett, Sen Andrew</name><name role="display">Senator BARTLETT</name><name.id>DT6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—I would like to add my remarks and join in the expression of condolences and regret from the Australian Democrats—not just from the parliamentarians here today but from our party membership more broadly. We are marking the life of not just a former Prime Minister but a former senator who served in this chamber for around 18 or 19 years. His time in the House of Representatives finished in 1975 and there are now only three people still left in that chamber who were serving when he was: Prime Minister Howard, Mr Ruddock and Mr Cadman. There are very few people around who have direct experience of him in the parliament and who shared parliamentary careers with him. Speaking as someone who was only three years old when Sir John Gorton became Prime Minister and six years old when he ceased being Prime Minister, my personal recollections are basically zero. This highlights the importance of marking and recording the history of people and their work in the parliamentary arena and noting occasions such as these, because it provides a mechanism for people who were not around at the time to get a better understanding of what has gone before.</para></talk.start><para>The issue of protection of the Great Barrier Reef, which a few people have touched on today, is still current. The threats to the Great Barrier Reef are now much wider than they were in John Gorton's time. Even the issue that he was best known for—protecting the reef from oil exploration and drilling—is still ongoing. We have been debating it in this chamber and it is the subject of legislation that I have brought forward. As one of many people from Queensland who have been fighting to provide better protection for the Barrier Reef, I think the role that John Gorton played in initiating the protection of the reef, at least from oil exploration and drilling, is one that is often not recognised. He was clearly ahead of his time in appreciating the importance of national protection of areas of environmental significance and particularly of such icons as the Great Barrier Reef. What might seem to be large amounts of money that could be made from extracting the oil from that area would shrink in comparison to the enormous economic value that that marine park has provided to Queensland and Australia because it has been protected to some extent. </para><para>In 1968 John Gorton declared of the Great Barrier Reef, `The slightest danger to this reef is too much danger.' According to the <inline font-style="italic">Australian </inline>at the time, this remark caused near hysteria in the Queensland Country Party. I am sure even they today would recognise the benefits of Sir John Gorton's foresight in that regard, even though more than 30 years later the fight still goes on and there is still massive interest from oil companies who have set their sights on the billions of barrels of oil they believe lie in deep water in the Coral Sea adjacent to or within the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park. The fact that Gorton stood up against the Queensland government of the day and insisted on a proper examination of this issue initiated a royal commission, which led to an agreement by the Queensland government and oil companies to halt exploration activities until the royal commission delivered its report. Since that time, oil exploration has been banned at least nominally inside the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park; although, as we have documented in the Senate in recent times, there are still ongoing efforts to carry out oil exploration within the marine park as well as in areas surrounding it. But it does show just one aspect for which Sir John Gorton should be remembered. If I or any of us could have even one legacy like that—of having played a significant role in protecting such an asset as the Barrier Reef—then we will have done our jobs very well. I hope that the current government will take on board his remark that I quoted earlier—`The slightest danger to this reef is too much danger'—in relation to the many other threats to the Barrier Reef, because it is still under significant threat. This is a great danger to the future environmental and economic health of Queensland and it is very much a national responsibility and something that I hope this government and future governments will take more seriously. </para><para>It is appropriate to properly note the passing of prime ministers. We have had, as has been remarked, only 25 people who have taken the office of Prime Minister in the 101 years of our history. Three of those were in a semicaretaker role, so only 22 in that period of time is not many. John Gorton was in that role for over three years, which is actually a longer period than some other prime ministers of note, such as Barton, Scullin, Holt or indeed Gough Whitlam. Gorton's prime ministership has often been perceived as being at the fag end of the Menzies era, as the Liberals disintegrated into inevitable defeat. In some ways that could be seen as a description of the direction of the Liberal Party at the time, but I think it should not be seen as the sole descriptor of John Gorton's actions in the role of Prime Minister.</para><para>He was the only senator to hold the role of Prime Minister and indeed the only person who went on to be Prime Minister after being leader of the government in the Senate. He served in the Senate for 19 years, served in the role of leader of the government in the Senate and then went on to be Prime Minister—perhaps there is hope for Senator Hill yet! </para><para>He was attacked by many in the media and in the public and within his own party at the time for what might have been seen as improper behaviour, as being too nonconformist. As is often the way, as soon as those attacks had their effect and he was removed from the office of Prime Minister, those very qualities that he was criticised for, he was then lauded for by many. It is ironic that those are the qualities that people have most noted about him in their speeches after his death yet at the time, of course, these were some of the qualities that he was most attacked for. Such is the way of politics that the sorts of things that can bring you down, can later on become the things that people most respect you for. </para><para>Mr Anthony, in his speech in the House of Representatives, said that his father, Doug Anthony, in one of his most basic descriptions of John Gorton's character noted Gorton's openness and his absolute transparency and that he did not want to be a hypocrite in avoiding doing what he believed was right. Those are qualities that are often quite rightly lauded yet, many times, when people in politics display them, they are criticised and attacked for being naive. These are things that should continue to be acknowledged as desirable qualities in the field of politics and should be praised when they are displayed. </para><para>It is another of the ironies of politics that Gorton, who was very much seen in most respects as a small `l' liberal on the progressive side of the party very much against the traditional grain of the Liberal mould—in some ways, as Senator Stott Despoja has said, `in the Don Chipp mould'—quit the Liberals in disgust a couple of years before Don Chipp did the same thing. Mr Gorton was replaced eventually by Malcolm Fraser, who was seen as far more conservative, far more proper in his character than the nonconformist small `l' liberal Gorton. After Fraser, we now have the much more conservative John Howard. Yet, we have seen the interesting spectacle of Mr Gorton being welcomed back into the fold as a great Liberal Prime Minister by Mr Howard who, by any calculation, would be seen to be at the absolute opposite end of the philosophical spectrum. Malcolm Fraser is now the one out in the cold and is seen to be expressing so-called progressive views about many issues of the day. Again, this highlights some of the ironies of politics and how things can shift so much over the course of time. This is why it is sometimes desirable not to get too caught up in the here and now and the short-term political activities of the day but to look at the long-term focus.  </para><para>John Gorton did have a minor but nonetheless interesting role in the circumstances and atmosphere that led up to the establishment of the Australian Democrats in 1977. As Senator Stott Despoja has said, he not only wrote a forward for one of Don Chipp's books but also was part of that loose grouping of people who were looking for alternatives to the two major political parties back in the mid-seventies—looking for not just a different ideological approach but, indeed, a characteristically different approach to politics, which in some ways Mr Gorton personified; that is, a more individualistic approach, a greater willingness to move outside a strait-jacketed solid party line and looking at different issues in a more dynamic way. Certainly, as many people have said both here and in the other place, his life as a whole could be seen in many ways to categorise that.</para><para>He played an interesting role in the history of this parliament, not just in his three years as Prime Minister but in his approximately 26 years in the two different chambers of this parliament. In many ways I think the roles he played in the parliament should be given as much note as the three years which happened to coincide with his period as Prime Minister. As I have said, he is one of only a small number of people to have held the office of Prime Minister—and, indeed, one of an even smaller number who have held the title of senator before becoming Prime Minister. I think it is still only around 500 people who have held the position of senator. Clearly, in amongst all those people, he has made a much greater and more significant longstanding contribution than many. For that reason, it is appropriate that the Senate pay tribute to the work he did over his long life and express its condolences on his passing at the reasonably ripe age of 90.</para></speech><speech><talk.start><talker><time.stamp>13:28:00</time.stamp><page.no>1865</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator IAN MACDONALD</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—As has been clearly demonstrated by the contributions in the Senate today, John Gorton was a really great Australian and one who had a profound effect on Australia—and, I might say, on myself as an impressionable young person in the late sixties and early seventies.

He was forward-looking and tackled a range of issues, like the protection of the Great Barrier Reef, as has been mentioned on several occasions. And that was of great importance to me particularly, coming as I did from that area so very close to the Great Barrier Reef.</para></talk.start><para>In my view, John Gorton was a Prime Minister who was well ahead of his time. I often said that he would have made a great Prime Minister some 20 or so years later. He had a very independent view, a very Australian approach. He was a hero of mine within the Liberal Party. He reinforced my belief in the Liberal Party with all it stood for and the self-made people who had been attracted to its principles and goals.</para><para>I met him on a number of occasions, as I know you did, Madam President, in recent years at various functions around the national capital and particularly, as has also been mentioned, at the naming of the John Gorton Building. He was always a generous person, and he was generous enough in the recent meetings I had with him, where I had made myself known to him, to listen to my words of admiration and my recollections of that very emotional recording of his political demise on <inline font-style="italic">This Day Tonight</inline> to the background theme of <inline font-style="italic">I did it my way</inline>—which Senator Ferris mentioned.

I was 24 years old at the time and from the bush, and those sorts of experiences—even seeing the national capital—were something well-remembered. Having driven for a week to get to Canberra for that convention and then to shake hands with and actually talk to a person who was such a significant Australian—indeed, the Prime Minister—is something I have never forgotten, and even now I still talk about it.</para><para>I admired John Gorton's social conscience, his nationalism, his belief in Australia and the importance and pre-eminence of the national government, his absolute rejection of humbug and hypocrisy and his personal integrity and courage, both in war and in peace.

The issues raised included whether privilege was being made available, issues of decorum and whether the committee had accidentally suspended itself. These are all important matters. In the discussion that took place at the committee, I raised a number of issues that I believe should be referred to the full Senate for consideration. The chair of the committee, Senator Brandis, said he would write to you, Madam President, and include the transcript of the remarks made in the discussion at that time. I welcome that as I believe that is the most appropriate way to proceed.  </para><para>Today I received a letter, circulated to me from the secretary of that committee, which was sent to the committee by the Clerk of the Senate. The Clerk, clearly in a proactive way—and in no way do I criticise him—has read the transcript. I checked with Senator Brandis and found that, because he has been away, as chair of the committee he has not yet had a chance to write to you and raise the issues that have been discussed as he said he would. He told me today that he would be writing to you this week. There are a couple of very important matters involved here that, irrespective of the comments the Clerk has raised in his letter about the procedure, I believe warrant consideration by you, as President, and, if necessary, be referred to the Senate Standing Committee on Procedure. </para><para>The first issue, and the major one, concerns the risk that a Senate committee might have lost the right to privilege because someone queried whether a quorum was present at a Senate estimates committee. This arose in the Senate debate because one of my colleagues, quite rightly, in asking questions of the Australian Securities and Investments Commission, asked details about certain activities of certain companies and individuals. When the officers from that agency were answering, they were warned that there may not be an appropriate quorum present and therefore privilege may not exist.</para><para>To say that this scared the officers from the statutory authority would be an understatement, and they made comment that they would be very nervous about responding as they always had if privilege were not available or if there were a doubt about privilege. I believe that is something that has to be dealt with quickly and urgently by the Senate. We cannot have a position in which officers coming before an estimates committee are concerned that any answer they give may not have the full protection of Senate privilege as we have all understood it. I think that, for the future, that is a very important issue.</para><para>I acknowledge that Senator Brandis has returned to the chamber. Senator Brandis, you may wish to take the opportunity to speak on this matter, even though it is against the convention that we have that we do not speak on a motion for the adjournment following a condolence resolution. The issue of who calls a quorum in a Senate estimates committee is at the heart of this matter. It was raised in the discussion that there was not a quorum present because there were not enough voting members from the non-government side present at the particular time. As I raised in the discussion—I draw this to your attention particularly, Madam President—the issue of a quorum is resolved by a member of the committee, in this case, or a member of the Senate drawing attention to it. Therefore there is a suspension, as we have in the Senate, the bells are rung until a quorum is re-established, and we go on with the business. It is the same in a committee; I always understood that that would be the way. But there is now some doubt, according to one of the standing orders, that at a Senate committee someone else—it may be the secretariat itself—can draw attention to the fact that there may not be a quorum present. It seems to me that we may have a different process of establishing quorums for Senate committees at the estimates level than we accept here in the Senate.</para><para>I received a copy of the letter to Senator Brandis from the Clerk on this matter. Again, I do not have any criticism of the Clerk proactively reading the transcript and anticipating Senator Brandis sending a letter. The letter says about the quorum:</para><quote><para>The provision in standing order 29(2), whereby the chair is to suspend the proceedings of a committee whenever a quorum is not present, may be regarded as imposing a greater restriction upon committees than applies in practice in the Senate, because in the Senate it is not the practice for the President to draw attention to the absence of a quorum. </para></quote><para>So what we have here is a practice in the Senate that is not accepted in the committee. I think that should be clarified quite clearly. We should not have a different procedure for a committee from the standard practice here in the Senate. Even if that means changing the wording of one of the Senate standing orders, I believe that is a matter the Procedure Committee should look at, Madam President, on your referring that matter to them. That to me is a difficulty: we have a convention that operates in the full Senate chamber— </para><interjection><talk.start><talker><name.id>BH4</name.id><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name></talker><para>—Madam President, I raise a point of order.

Again, if in any way I have offended the memory of former Prime Minister Gorton, I apologise for that, but this is a matter that I thought should be raised at the first opportunity because it does deal with the workings of the Senate itself.</para></talk.start></continue><para><inline font-weight="bold">Senate adjourned at 1.43 p.m.</inline></para></speech></subdebate.1></debate></chamber.xscript><answers.to.questions><debate><debateinfo><type>Answers to Questions on Notice</type><title>QUESTIONS ON NOTICE</title><page.no>1869</page.no></debateinfo><para>The following answers to questions were circulated:</para><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Superannuation Complaints Tribunal: Appointment</title><page.no>1869</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 1)</subtitle><id.no>1</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1869</page.no><name role="metadata">Faulkner, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Faulkner</name><name.id>5K4</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer, upon notice, on 13 February 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Has former Senator Michael Baume been appointed to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</para><para>(2)	Is the letter of appointment dated 3 October 2001, two days before the announcement of the federal election.</para><para>(3)	Was there a public announcement of Mr Baume's appointment; if not why not.</para><para>(4)	Was Mr Baume's appointment made in accordance with the usual process for appointments to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</para><para>(5)	Was a shortlist of potential appointees to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal drawn up following the national advertisement for applicants earlier in 2001.</para><para>(6)	Was Mr Baume's name on the shortlist.</para><para>(7)	If Mr Baume's name was not on the shortlist, who recommended the appointment.</para><para>(8)	Was the Prime Minister or his office involved in the appointment process.</para><para>(9)	What expertise does Mr Baume have to offer the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1869</page.no><name role="metadata">Coonan, Sen Helen</name><name role="display">Senator Coonan</name><name.id>2M6</name.id><electorate>New South Wales</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Revenue and Assistant Treasurer</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The answer to the honourable senator's question is as follows:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	Yes.</para><para>(2)	Yes.</para><para>(3)	No. It is generally the case that there has not been a press release for appointments of part-time members to the Superannuation Complaints Tribunal.

The Commonwealth is highly supportive of the Trust's conservation activities, however there are many competing demands on the Federal Budget. </para><para>(5)	Heritage protection does not rely simply on ownership; it is afforded by the legislation that binds owners. While the properties are under Commonwealth ownership, they are protected by the Australian Heritage Commission Act 1975. When they pass out of Commonwealth ownership, they will be protected by the Northern Territory Conservation Act 1991 and the Northern Territory Planning Act 1999. In June 2000 the then Northern Territory Minister for Lands, Planning and Environment authorised an instrument under the Territory's legislation protecting all properties in the Myilly Point Heritage Precinct. See also (8) below re public access.</para><para>(6)	Yes.</para><para>(7)	See answer to (5) above. In addition, the sale contract for the properties would include a binding obligation on the purchaser to implement a Conservation Management Plan and/or Heritage Agreement. The Australian Heritage Commission and the Northern Territory heritage authorities would be given the opportunity to comment on the sale contract.</para><para>(8)	(a)	The National Trust has leases over both houses until 2011, plus the option of renewing the leases for a further 25 years, ie until 2036. These occupancy rights would be protected in any private sale contract. The National Trust would presumably continue to allow public access while it remained in occupancy. Public access might also continue under a range of other occupancy scenarios.</para><para>(b)	See answer to (8a) above.</para></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Health and Ageing: Nursing Homes</title><page.no>1896</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 159)</subtitle><id.no>159</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1896</page.no><name role="metadata">Evans, Sen Chris</name><name role="display">Senator Chris Evans</name><name.id>AX5</name.id><electorate>Western Australia</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Ageing, upon notice, on 4 March 2002:</para></talk.start><para>Can the following information be provided on the impact of the Government's policy of funding equalisation in relation to nursing home care subsides:</para><para>For each state and territory, and for levels 1 to 4 in the Resident Classification </para><para>Scale (RCS), can the Government indicate what the daily subsidy would be for residents in the 2002-03 financial year through to the 2006-07 financial year, assuming an annual indexation of 1.5 per cent, 2 per cent and 2.5 per cent.</para><para>(For example, assuming an indexation of 1.5 per cent provide a table showing daily care subsidy in each state and territory for RCS levels 1 through to 4.

Much of this work will be completed by non-ongoing staff on fixed term contracts who are deployed on nominal rolls other than the Nuclear Tests Participants Nominal Roll, under the direction of a Departmental officer. </para><para>The Director, Nominal Rolls has responsibility for the Nominal Roll. The Director, Research has responsibility for the study. Assistance on the project is provided as needed.

Prior to the cancer incidence and mortality study being commissioned, the Department of Veterans' Affairs had no reason to maintain information on this group. The Department has completed and published a preliminary nominal roll of nuclear test participants which contain the names of more than 8,000 former service personnel, for possible use in the study. However, it is apparent that many of the people whose names are currently on the preliminary roll may have left tests sites prior to any tests being undertaken. Work is continuing to further refine the nominal roll. For these reasons, there is no practical way of undertaking a costing such as this. </para><para>(10)	As discussed above in (8), work is continuing on the preliminary nominal roll to ensure only those who participated in the tests are included.

Departmental expenditure in that period includes a significant proportion of block payment to providers for veteran treatment as well as other payments including the Repatriation Hospital expenditure. This expenditure cannot be attributed to specific veteran card types and it is therefore not possible to identify the costs of the Personal Treatment Entitlement Card.</para><para>·	These estimates exclude expenditure on administration, residential aged care and certain minor expenses not directly related to the health care of cardholders for example, health research. The estimates of average costs may be subject to revision with more analysis of the data and final reconciliation of payments to public hospitals.</para><para>(2)	While figures are not available for earlier years, the average annual health care cost to the Department of Veterans' Affairs of the White Card (as at April 2002) has been estimated at $1,100 for 1999-00 and $1,200 for 2000-01. For the period up to 1998, research shows that a White Cardholder generally costed the Department about 25% of the cost of a Gold Cardholder. With the Gold Card extension on 1 January 1999 and the significant transfer of White Cardholders to being Gold Cardholders it has been assessed that the White Card costs is now some 14% of the cost of the Gold Card. The average costs have been calculated based on the known costs that can be attributed by card type. These figures relate to direct health care costs and exclude administration costs, residential aged care and certain minor expenses not directly related to the health care of cardholders for example, health research. The estimates average costs may be subject to revision with more data analysis.</para><para>(3)	(a)	Output 2.1 provides for administration cost associated with the delivery of services to Gold &amp; White Cardholders. The Portfolio Additional Estimates 2001-2002 (page 40) identifies $210 as the price per cardholder. This is calculated by dividing the treatment population (gold and white cards) of 342,516 with the $71.802m departmental expenses (page 39). The average cost per card for previous years can be obtained in a similar manner from previous Portfolio Budget Statements and Portfolio Additional Estimates. </para><para>(b) &amp; (c) </para><para>The answer to these parts of the Question are complex, as the profile of the types of treatments veterans receive, and payment arrangements to public and private hospitals vary both within and across States as well as sectors. As a result, drawing comparisons of the average costs between public and private hospitals is difficult, and any conclusions drawn need to be treated with caution. For example, the payments to each of the hospitals will have different profiles of acute, non-acute inpatient services, non-inpatient services, varying levels of medical &amp; allied health services and prosthetics. Or simply, payments to private hospitals in one state may exclude the cost of prostheses, whilst this cost is included in the cost of public hospitals of another state.</para><para>Having regard to the above comment, the following estimates are provided:</para><para>Private Hospitals 2000/2001</para><para>·	$2,300 per head for a Gold Cardholder; and </para><para>·	$250 per head for a White Cardholder. </para><para>Public Hospitals 2000/2001</para><para>·	$1,780 per head for Gold Cardholders; and </para><para>·	$150 per head for White cardholders.</para><para>The average public or private hospital cost by card type holder has been calculated by dividing total payments for that year for public or private hospitals by the Treatment population as at 31 December 2000. These costs are based on data provided by departmental information systems. As all components of hospital costs are not readily identifiable by card type, total costs by card type have been derived by pro-rating total payments that can be attributed for public or private hospital expenditure by the relevant cardholder type population.</para><para>(d)	The following estimated average cost of Non-hospital health expenses by card are provided for 2000/01: </para><para>·	$4,320 for a Gold Cardholder; and</para><para>·	$800 for a White Cardholder.</para><para>These figures should be considered as broad estimates only. They exclude expenditure on administration, residential aged care and certain minor expenses not directly related to the health care of cardholders for example, health research. Further, as not all other components of non hospital costs are readily identifiable by card costs, total costs by card type for major components of these non hospital health services have been derived by pro rating total payments based on that can be attributed by the relevant card holder type population. Those costs were then divided by the relevant treatment population as at 31 December 2000, to arrive at the average cost per card type. </para><para>(4)	Historically, the Department has not routinely collected separation data by Card Type. In 1996 the four existing treatment entitlement cards were replaced by the Gold and White Cards.

The project description was “The remaining sclerophyll forests on the coastal plains in North East Tasmania are poised on the brink of major decline. The project aims to initiate Bushcare activity in these areas in order to start the rehabilitation process; develop management information and expertise in this specific bio-region; and demonstrate the process to the wider community. This will be achieved through fencing remnant bush on two demonstration properties; undertaking baseline botanical surveys; ongoing monitoring on the trial sites; and promoting the project to landholders through a series of field days.” We understand that this funding was used to fence off a 36 ha demonstration site (with 5.3 km of fencing) on the above property. The vegetation fenced off is predominantly old-growth coastal Eucalyptus amygdalina forest. This was an alternative site to those indicated in the application because of changes in ownership and personal circumstances on the original properties. The change in site was not referred to the Commonwealth but was assessed by a range of State experts.</para><para>(3)	(a)	Yes.</para><para>(b)	The Launceston Environment Centre has signed a 10 year fencing agreement to ensure the fenced area of vegetation is maintained.</para><para>(c)	The project was a small demonstration project intended to raise awareness of tree-decline in the North-east. It was not intended as a strategic regional response to the dieback.</para><para>(d)	Dieback of Smithton Peppermint within this region is indicated as a priority issue within the “Vegetation management strategy for Tasmania.” There is no regional vegetation strategy in this area.</para><para>(4)	(a)	Yes.</para><para>(b)	Yes.</para><para>(5)	As indicated within the Tasmanian Natural Heritage Trust Partnership Agreement, the primary aim of Bushcare is to work with all levels of government, industry and the community to conserve remnant native vegetation. In regard to land clearing a national outcome agreed to by Tasmania is to avoid or limit any further broad scale clearance of native vegetation consistent with ecologically sustainable management and bioregional planning, to those instances in which regional biological diversity objectives are not compromised. </para><para>A key outcome of the National Framework for the Management and Monitoring of Australia's Native Vegetation, agreed to by all jurisdictions, is to prevent clearing of endangered or vulnerable vegetation communities, critical habitat for threatened species, or threatened species or communities. </para><para>I understand that a Forest Practices Plan has been prepared for the area (this does not include the area fenced with Bushcare). The area to be cleared consists primarily of coastal Eucalyptus amygdalina forest. The reservation target for this forest community at 15% of pre-European extent has been met on a statewide basis, and has been substantially met on a bioregional basis (ie 99.2% of the bioregional target has been met). We understand that prescriptions to protect the habitat of the threatened species were included in the forest practices plan. </para><para>Therefore in relation to Bushcare objectives this clearing of native forest is not inconsistent with the current Natural Heritage Trust Partnership Agreement in terms of the forest community being harvested.  </para><para>(6)	Tasmania's commitment within the Regional Forest Agreement is to introduce “mechanisms to encourage native vegetation retention and management including the protection of riparian vegetation, consistent with the agreed outcomes of the National Vegetation Initiative as set out in the Tasmanian Partnership Agreement”. These commitments relate to regional biological diversity not being compromised. There has not been a specific biological diversity assessment in this region outside of the Regional Forest Agreement. In terms of the forest community being harvested bioregional targets have been substantially met. </para><para>(7)	(a)	To my knowledge there is no specific plan for the conservation of native vegetation in this region.</para><para>(b)	Not applicable.</para><para>(8)	Land management, including the management of land clearing, is the responsibility of the State. The Minister for the Environment and Heritage will continue to encourage the Tasmanian government to limit the clearing of native vegetation in line with government policies and programs. He will take relevant action in accordance with the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act 1999 where land clearing affects matters of national environmental significance. </para><para>(9)	In response to the findings of the State of Environment report, the Minister for the Environment and Heritage will continue to encourage the Tasmanian government to limit the clearing of native vegetation in line with government policies and programs.

The proposals commenced or undertaken in 2001-02 (total estimated cost in brackets) are:</para><para>(a)	Computers for Cadets—providing surplus Defence computers to some 430 Cadet units across Australia ($0.4 million);</para><para>(b)	CadetNet—providing a new, dedicated computer to link all units via the Internet in order to enhance administrative support and information access ($1.5 million);</para><para>(c)	uniforms and equipment—includes the initial provisioning for 17,000 Army Cadets and staff of a second set of camouflage uniforms and polyesters for Cadets required to participate in ceremonial occasions and parades; safety boats and canoes and a new cadet black boot for ceremonial and field/barracks activities ($3.1 million);</para><para>(d)	ADF Cadets Inaugural National Conference incorporating a tri-Service Cadet parade held on 20-21 April 2002 at Sydney Olympic Park ($0.4 million);</para><para>(e)	audit and review of Cadet accommodation ($0.3 million);</para><para>(f)	establishment of the Directorate of Defence Force Cadets ($0.7 million in 2001-02);</para><para>(g)	support to the External Overview Team established to provide independent advice on the implementation program ($0.1 million); and </para><para>(h)	a number of initiatives directed at the development of ADF Cadet policies and procedures to ensure consistency and currency across the three Cadet organisations. These include ($1.4 million):</para><para>-	development of an Occupational Health &amp; Safety (OH&amp;S) strategic plan and provision of OH&amp;S training courses and information packages for cadets and adult supervisors.</para><para>-	development of an indigenous cadet participation strategy and projects.</para><para>-	collaboration with other youth development organisations.</para><para>-	benchmarking of ADF Cadets programs to other youth programs.</para><para>-	development of a communications and awareness strategy.</para><para>-	establishment of an ADF Cadets Council.</para><para>-	provision of Identity Cards for adult staff.</para><para>-	development of an Equity and Diversity policy.</para><para>-	development of a Human Resources strategic plan that addresses areas such as adult staff appointment, termination, training, codes of behaviour, accreditation and remuneration.</para><para>(2)	As at 30 April 2002, $713,000 has been spent.</para><para>(3)	(a)	The amount estimated to remain unspent at the end of the 2001-02 is $2.9 million. </para><para>(b)	A number of factors have contributed to the underspend. The Directorate of Defence Force Cadets was established, among other things, to manage the Cadet Enhancement Program. It was created in September 2001 but has only been near full strength since the beginning of 2002. Initially, individual proposals had to be identified and prioritised by the Directorate. The next step in the process is to scope and document the requirements and there are lead times for items such as uniforms and equipment. In addition, the size of any task can be significant with 25,500 cadets and nearly 2,300 adult volunteer staff in some 430 units throughout Australia. </para><para>Although the funds have not been fully spent this financial year, proposals have been identified for the $6 million and the unspent portion will be rolled over into 2002-03.</para><para>(4)	Administrative functions relate to the Directorate of Defence Force Cadets. Salaries and other administrative expenses are estimated to be $0.7 million for 2001-02.</para><para>(5)	In December 1999, a review of cadets was commissioned by the Government and the subsequent Report, <inline font-style="italic">Cadets: the Future,</inline> was released in December 2000. The Report included details on the level of resources provided to cadets. $24 million is the estimated amount of Defence support to the three Cadet organisations. Under the current accounting arrangements, certain support funding cannot be separately identified. The Directorate is putting in place resource management arrangements with the three Services and other areas of the department in order to provide more accurate information on the cost of support to cadets. These arrangements and will come into effect on 1 July 2002. The breakdown of the $24 million estimated from Defence sources is as follows:

In this context, the marriage with the LPA stern ramp in at least Sea State 2 was described as an Essential requirement. The Interface Pontoon proposed by the preferred tenderer, promises the transfer of heavy vehicles without expensive and time intensive modifications to the LPA. </para><para>(4)	The seakeeping ability of the preferred tenderer's proposed Amphibious Watercraft during marriage operation with the LPA was trialed on a 1/25th-scale model in the Model Test Basin in the Australian Maritime College. The modelling was undertaken prior to the selection of the preferred tenderer. The test program included benchmark tests on the existing landing craft (LCM8) to which the results from the proposed landing craft could be compared. The results indicated that the Interface Pontoon may experience some limitations in higher Sea States (ie Sea State 2 and above) and this was more likely in other than ahead seas, for example bow quartering seas. The Selection Board noted that the Interface Pontoon was a useful element of the preferred tenderers solution, although it was not a key discriminator in assessing the compliance to operational/technical criteria.</para><para>(5)	(a)	Further analysis post Source Selection was undertaken to establish whether the Tender Evaluation process would be compromised should the Interface Pontoon prove not to be viable or not meet the operational requirements. The analysis recommended that the conclusions and recommendations approved in the Source Selection Report remain extant. The through put would have been similar to other tendered solutions in the context of transfer from LPA to Watercraft but not in the context of overall system performance.</para><para>(b)	In the event that the pontoon was taken out of the tender, there are other remedies including modification to the LPA stern door that would retain the throughput. In the unlikely event that none of these remedies work, then heavy vehicles such as tanks would need to be craned over the side of the LPA, as would be done now.</para><para>(6)	It should be noted that the pricing for through-life cost provided by all tenderers was incomplete and adjustments were made to adjust them to a common baseline for six vessels. The preferred tenderer provided the lowest estimated whole of life costs of owning and operating and maintaining the craft. It was clearly lower in price, both for acquisition and separately for in service support, compared to the tender rated second overall.</para><para>(7)	Hydrodynamic Modelling Tests on the optimisation of the Interface Pontoon have not been completed.

Both detainees are no longer minors as they reached 18 years of age in March and early April respectively.</para><para>The Minister is the Guardian of all unaccompanied minors in detention. He has delegated certain powers under the IGOC Act 1946 to DIMIA Managers and Deputy Managers at the Centres. Neither the Centre managers nor deputy managers accompany minors to court.

The need to apply restraints is assessed on an individual basis and must be approved by the centre manager on each occasion. The guidelines state that handcuffs are not to be used to restrain females, children or the intellectually disabled unless special circumstances exist. In this case, the special circumstances taken into account were the ages of the two young men, and the fact that neither detainee was sufficiently known to ACM staff at the Perth IDC to make a reasonable assessment of their risk of absconding. They were therefore assessed as `high risk', and restraints were applied while they were being transferred to and from Court. </para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Transport: Australia Cycling National Strategy</title><page.no>1979</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 292)</subtitle><id.no>292</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1979</page.no><name role="metadata">Hogg, Sen John</name><name role="display">Senator Hogg</name><name.id>7L6</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>ALP</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Transport and Regional Services, upon notice, on 2 May 2002:</para></talk.start><quote><para>With reference to Australia Cycling—The National Strategy 1999-2004:</para><para>(1)	What funding has been provided in support of the strategy by the Commonwealth Government for each year since the strategy was adopted to: (a) its own programs; and (b) state and/or local governments. </para><para>(2)	Is there a line item in the departmental portfolio budget statements that outlines the funding for the strategy.</para><para>(3)	What are the details for each funded program, including the name of the program, amount of funds provided and when.</para><para>(4)	What has been reported against the objectives detailed in the strategy.</para><para>(5)	When and where has this been reported.</para><para>(6)	Does the Australian Bicycle Council oversee and coordinate implementation of the strategy and function as the Austroads Bicycle Reference Group; if so: (a) how often has it met to review the strategy; (b) are the outcomes of its work reported if so, to whom and are those reports available and (c) what funding does it receive to carry out its work. </para><para>(7)	When did the Minister last review the progress of the council.</para><para>(8)	When the strategy was announced, were there any out-year funding commitments; if so, what where those commitments.</para><para>(9)	Has any consideration been given by the Government to a replacement for and/or extension of the strategy beyond 2004.</para></quote></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1980</page.no><name role="metadata">Macdonald, Sen Ian</name><name role="display">Senator Ian Macdonald</name><name.id>YW4</name.id><electorate>Queensland</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Forestry and Conservation</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Transport and Regional Services has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><quote><para>(1)	Responsibility for implementation of Australia Cycling a National Strategy rests primarily with the State, Territory and Local Government authorities, which are best placed to determine local solutions and funding requirements.

Using these data in combination with a database on Australian patterns of food consumption, the Australia New Zealand Food Authority and the NRA are then able to estimate intakes of pesticide residues for different population groups, including infants, children and adults. For occupational exposure of farmers and farm workers, the National Occupational Health and Safety Commission has an extensive database on amounts of dermal and inhalation exposure which can arise from pesticide application practices. </para><para>Australian regulatory agencies follow internationally-agreed best practice in chemical and hazard and exposure assessment. A number of their professional staff play key roles in technical committees of international organisations which deal with food and chemical safety issues, including the World Health Organization and the Food and Agriculture Organization.</para><para>(4)	The National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) is the principal funder of health and medical research. Applications are assessed on the basis of the significance, approach and feasibility of the proposed research, and on the applicants' track record. Those research proposals that have the highest scientific merit receive funding. The majority of the funding is based on research proposed by the investigators themselves. Other funding is provided for research in priority areas including ageing, mental health, systems of care for chronic disease, oral health and indigenous health.</para><para>Although the NHMRC does not currently provide funding for specific research into the association between chemical pollution and its effects on child development and learning, a considerable body of research relevant to the areas of child health and the effects of chemicals are supported. In 2002, the NHMRC will provide nearly $4.3 million for research related to paediatrics, community child health, toxicology, and environmental and occupational health. Most NHMRC research funding is directed towards biomedical, clinical and public health research and it is likely that a number of these projects will have the potential to benefit those suffering from a range of conditions, including the effects of chemicals.</para></quote></answer></subdebate.1><subdebate.1><subdebateinfo><title>Environment: Kyoto Protocol</title><page.no>1984</page.no><subtitle>(Question No. 302)</subtitle><id.no>302</id.no></subdebateinfo><question><talk.start><talker><page.no>1984</page.no><name role="metadata">Allison, Sen Lyn</name><name role="display">Senator Allison</name><name.id>1M6</name.id><electorate>Victoria</electorate><party>AD</party><in.gov>0</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para> asked the Minister representing the Minister for Foreign Affairs, upon notice, on 13 May 2002:</para></talk.start><para>(1)	(a) Can a list be provided of all United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) conferences, subsidiary body meetings, working groups and other official UNFCCC meetings at which the Australian Government has been represented since Conference of Parties (COP)1 held in 1995 and until 2002; and (b) can a list be provided of the location and dates of the conferences, subsidiary body meetings, working groups and other official meetings held during this period.</para><para>(2)	Can a list be provided of all other Kyoto Protocol related meetings, such as umbrella group meetings, informal working groups and conferences, at which the Australian Government has been represented since COP3 in November 1997.</para><para>(3)	How many paid federal government officials and representatives have attended each of the official and unofficial meetings described in (1) and (2).</para><para>(4)	How many federal government officials and representatives have attended the official and unofficial international climate change meetings described in (1) and (2).</para><para>(5)	Can an estimate be provided of the number of federal government person hours spent at, and preparing for, official and unofficial meetings described in (1) and (2). </para><para>(6)	Can a list be provided of official Australian Government written interventions, discussion papers and reports that have been prepared by all departments to prepare for and contribute to official and unofficial meetings described in (1) and (2).</para><para>(7)	How much has been spent on sending Australian Government representatives to the official meetings described in (1) and the unofficial meetings described in (2) (please include all costs including airfares, accommodation, travel allowance and all other related costs).</para></question><answer><talk.start><talker><page.no>1984</page.no><name role="metadata">Hill, Sen Robert</name><name role="display">Senator Hill</name><name.id>BH4</name.id><electorate>South Australia</electorate><party>LP</party><role>Minister for Defence</role><in.gov>1</in.gov><first.speech>0</first.speech></talker><para>—The Minister for Foreign Affairs has provided the following answer to the honourable senator's question:</para></talk.start><para>In relation to parts 1 (a) and (b) and 2, attached is a list of relevant meetings held over the period 1995-2002, including locations and dates.
